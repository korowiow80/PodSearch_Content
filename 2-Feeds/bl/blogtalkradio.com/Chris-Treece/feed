Mark Koegel, 60, pursues his lifelong dream of racing in ARCA and then on to NASCAR. Companies across the nation are joining the excitement as Mark gains momentum in capturing Fortune 1000 sponsorship to showcase his skills. "In performIng all the years I have raced, the wins were great, the friendships were the greatest," says Koegel. I have been interested in racing cars all my life. But as with everything else, rearing a family, work and life got in the way of my biggest dream: racing in ARCA and eventually NASCAR. I began to think about calling it quits...but then the unthinkable happened.... A friend from work needed a driver for one night just to keep his points. All I had to do is finish the race. Well, the car ran so good I finished second. I beat a large field of young drivers. That was nice. The whole time I was racing the kids would watch TV with me and I would tell them I knew this guy or that guy. They would humor me and say yes we know. Then last year we were watching Daytona, a guy crashed real bad, I point at the TV and they say YES WE KNOW you know him. I did. It was Barry Fitzgerald from 35 years ago. I called him the next day. He said he will be in Texas racing next. I need to come out and help. After the races we sat in a caf&eacute; talking about old times and he says YOU CAN DO THIS. The car owner said I can help any time I want to at any track. Then The big one, YOU CAN DRIVE ONE OF MY CARS. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/mark-koegel/'>Mark Koegel</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/mark-koegel.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/mark-koegel.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/mark-koegel-racing/'>Mark Koegel Racing</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/mark-koegel-racing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/mark-koegel-racing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/blogtalk-radio/'>Blogtalk Radio</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blogtalk-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blogtalk-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Local Texan celebrity, breaks all barriers!

After attending three different high schools and three different colleges, trying countless different career paths and living in several different locations, Steve was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder at the age of twenty-nine. With a degree in Psychology from Mars Hill College and Film Production Technology from Valencia Community College in Orlando, Florida, Steve produced the documentary Attention Deficit Disorder: Life at a Different Pace. He has since produced other such films as The Tide From Red to Blue, Yearning for Light, and Lesson Learned. In 2001, Steve followed up his debut novel Descent by venturing out on the road to write his travelogue The Rucksack Letters. By car, hitchhiking, and motorcycle, Steve traveled through twenty-six states, visiting various communities ranging from a Buddhist monastery and yoga ashrams to hippie communes and New York City. The book was initially published electronically through emails as he traveled. The first edition was put into print in 2006 and a revised edition is expected in 2010. Steve has also performed in his one man show The Rucksack Cabaret, in the Manatee Players’ production of Hank Williams: Lost Highway as the iconic songwriter, Banyan Theatre Company’s production of Moon for the Misbegotten and the debut of Jenny Beres‘ new play Hay Day in July 2009. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/steve-mcallister/'>Steve McAllister</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/steve-mcallister.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/steve-mcallister.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-mcallister-code/'>The McAllister Code</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-mcallister-code.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-mcallister-code.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/blogtalk-radio/'>Blogtalk Radio</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blogtalk-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blogtalk-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Steve McAllister was born and raised in Sarasota, Florida.

After attending three different high schools and three different colleges, trying countless different career paths and living in several different locations, Steve was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder at the age of twenty-nine. With a degree in Psychology from Mars Hill College and Film Production Technology from Valencia Community College in Orlando, Florida, Steve produced the documentary Attention Deficit Disorder: Life at a Different Pace. He has since produced other such films as The Tide From Red to Blue, Yearning for Light, and Lesson Learned. In 2001, Steve followed up his debut novel Descent by venturing out on the road to write his travelogue The Rucksack Letters. By car, hitchhiking, and motorcycle, Steve traveled through twenty-six states, visiting various communities ranging from a Buddhist monastery and yoga ashrams to hippie communes and New York City. The book was initially published electronically through emails as he traveled. The first edition was put into print in 2006 and a revised edition is expected in 2010.

When my 35-year real estate career came to an end I, like so many other millions of Americans, had to re-examine my life.

He was the youngest son of five. Lawrence enjoyed writing at an early age. His first poem, a Haiku, was published in Seedlings, a local magazine sponsored by Caddo Parish Middle Magnet School. Writing became a way to express himself as he discovered the world around him. He has always had an entrepreneurial spirit and enjoys the business world. Determined to be a corporate tycoon, Lawrence progressed through the ranks in the corporate world. While thoroughly enjoying corporate America, his most fond memories are of those when he served in the military. He started out as an enlisted soldier but worked his way to the rank of First Lieutenant where he served in the Signal Corps during Operation Iraqi Freedom III. He has a strong passion for helping others and this passion for others has become his greatest challenge. After writing his first book, Reflections of Reality, a book of poetry, Lawrence noticed that people around him were constantly frustrated by challenges to the life they wanted to have.

It is their argument that business influences everything from day-to-day decisions to the broadest issues of politics and economics. This unique collection of essays contains two hard-to-find works by Ayn Rand, “The Money-Making personality” and “An Answer for Businessmen.” Though you might not expect it, insightful business principles found in Rand’s writing include: • Do Businessmen Really Need Philosophy? By Dr. Leonard Peikoff. This essay is based on a presentation given to the Young President’s organization on January 12, 1995. Dr. Peikoff explores why businessmen are viewed so negatively in our culture. • Why is Business “Public Enemy #1”? In this essay, Ayn Rand describes how political power has been used negatively to affect the economic power of businessmen. • Doesn’t business require compromise? This essay was first published in 1966 in Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal in which Ayn Rand discusses three rules for helping understand how business principles work. • And more intellectual theories behind successful business practices and habits! Richard A. Ralston is the publishing manager of the Ayn Rand Institute. He has been the circulation director and publisher of The Christian Science Monitor, a radio producer, a national television news business manager, and a book publisher. He was the revision editor of two books by Ayn Rand in 2005: Three Plays and The Early Ayn Rand.

I dedicate my life to helping people achieve their dreams through the word of GOD. When I lost my wife through death in December 2005, I was faced with the challenges of raising three boys as a single parent, and at the same time coping with the loss of my mate. During this time, I dealt with many emotions, how can I be a father and mother to my children, how do I deal with the grief of losing my wife. I was faced with many difficulties. There were times when life brought enjoyment, and other times when life was so challenging that I wanted to give up and quit. During the difficult and unbearable moments, I made up in my mind to do something about it. I was not going to let this unfortunate situation take over me. I decided to use this terrible and devastating situation as a platform to rebuild my life. I realized that life is what you make it. I spent many nights crying out to GOD for a strategy to overcome my situation. The strategy I got was, while I am going through my difficulties, share it with others, help them to overcome and at the same time I would overcome. My struggle has taught me that life is not a sprint race, or a hop skip and a jump but that life is more like the seasons. Each season gives you different occurrence. The winter would give you snow and cold. The summer would give you sun and rain. The spring gives you a mild and a gentle breeze, while the fall deals mostly with the leaves on the trees. There is one thing that all the seasons have in common; it is guaranteed to come around repeatedly and again, until the end of time. That is how life is. Therefore, don’t get bent out of shape about a little obstacle that occurs in your life. Your season will come around again. When it does, remember this “LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT!” <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/carl-mathis/'>Carl Mathis</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/carl-mathis.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/carl-mathis.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/motivation/'>Motivation</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/motivation.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/motivation.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/blogtalk-radio/'>Blogtalk Radio</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blogtalk-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blogtalk-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi, my name is Carl Mathis and I am a Motivational Author/Speaker.

During the difficult and unbearable moments, I made up in my mind to do something about it. I was not going to let this unfortunate situation take over me. I decided to use this terrible and devastating situation as a platform to rebuild my life. I realized that life is what you make it. I spent many nights crying out to GOD for a strategy to overcome my situation. The strategy I got was, while I am going through my difficulties, share it with others, help them to overcome and at the same time I would overcome. My struggle has taught me that life is not a sprint race, or a hop skip and a jump but that life is more like the seasons. Each season gives you different occurrence. The winter would give you snow and cold. The summer would give you sun and rain. The spring gives you a mild and a gentle breeze, while the fall deals mostly with the leaves on the trees. There is one thing that all the seasons have in common; it is guaranteed to come around repeatedly and again, until the end of time. That is how life is. Therefore, don’t get bent out of shape about a little obstacle that occurs in your life. Your season will come around again. When it does, remember this “LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT!” </itunes:summary><itunes:duration>00:29:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/chris-treece/2011/04/05/motivational-author-and-speaker-carl-mathis.mp3" fileSize="6809728" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/chris-treece/2011/04/05/motivational-author-and-speaker-carl-mathis.wma" fileSize="6809728" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>Chris Treece Show</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>Chris Treece,Carl Mathis,The Chris Treece Show,Motivation,Blogtalk Radio,BlogTalkRadio, Blog Talk Radio</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Motivational Author and Speaker Carl Mathis</itunes:subtitle></item><item><title>Destination X Television Celebrity Celeste Thorson - Apr 04,2011</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/chris-treece/2011/04/04/destination-x-television-celebrity-celeste-thorson</link><description><![CDATA[Celeste Thorson is a professional actress, award winning model, screenwriter and activist living in Los Angeles, CA.

Her goals are: 1.Create awareness about pelvic organ prolapse and help women become comfortable talking about it. 2.Make the acronym POP for pelvic organ prolapse become commonly known. 3.Encourage the medical community to start educating women about the importance of of pc (pelvic floor) muscle awareness and Kegel exercises at the first pelvic exam rather than waiting until POP becomes an active physical condition. 4.Establish additional charters of the global support network APOPS to connect women in all phases of pelvic organ prolapse treatment. 5.Create awareness of POP issues that occur in undeveloped areas of the world. </itunes:summary><itunes:duration>00:30:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/chris-treece/2011/03/31/health-and-fitness-pelvic-organ-prolapse-expert-sherrie-palm.mp3" fileSize="7160395" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/chris-treece/2011/03/31/health-and-fitness-pelvic-organ-prolapse-expert-sherrie-palm.wma" fileSize="7160395" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>Chris Treece Show</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>Chris Treece,Sherrie Palm,Pelvic Organ Prolapse,POP,Blogtalk Radio,BlogTalkRadio, Blog Talk Radio</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Health and Fitness-Pelvic Organ Prolapse Expert Sherrie Palm</itunes:subtitle></item><item><title>Authors Spotlight-I Married Satan Author LaDonna Smith - Mar 30,2011</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/chris-treece/2011/03/30/authors-spotlight-i-married-satan-author-ladonna-smith</link><description><![CDATA[LaDonna M. Smith was born and raised in Maryland. However, it was not until she had to survive on her own going from house to house or house hopping until she ultimately ended up in Philadelphia, PA and heard the voice of God that she grew wiser, and more mature in her own walk of life. She was 19 years old. Despite her being raised in church and serving as a church musician since age 12, she accepted the Lord Jesus Christ into her life at age13 at the Pilgrim Rest Baptist Church (Washington DC). She soon found that becoming a new creature in Christ was difficult especially without the proper encouragement and general growing pains; not to mention the peer pressure of being a teenager. Coincidentally in her adult hood, most of the situations that she hears young people discuss causes her to blurt out words like I have been there and trust me I know. Ms. Smith is a native of Fairmont Heights MD (Prince Georges County) and graduated from Fairmont Heights High School (1996), Prince Georges Community College (Associate of Arts in General Studies 2001) and is only 26 credits away from graduating at Bowie State University with a 3.41 GPA. She is perusing a Bachelor of Science in Communications, concentrating on Broadcast Technology. LaDonna has experienced situations in several realms of her life to include but definitely not limited to: physical, mental, sexual, spiritual and emotional abuse; homelessness; hunger; depression, and suicidal thoughts, to name a few. All of this by the age of 29 years old. If you ever hear her testimony you would not believe that she is still able to smile despite of and just because. And she believes that she has to smile because there is nothing left to do after all that she has experienced and endured. LaDonna is a member of New Harvest Ministries International (Baltimore, MD) under the leadership of Bishop Marcus A. Johnson, Sr. and Lady Evangelist Ronae Johnson.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ladonna-smith/'>LaDonna Smith</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ladonna-smith.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ladonna-smith.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/i-married-satan/'>I Married Satan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/i-married-satan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/i-married-satan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/blogtalk-radio/'>Blogtalk Radio</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blogtalk-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blogtalk-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[LaDonna M.

With a background in counseling and Social Work, Missy weaves her client’s individuality, as well as to where they are into every circumstance. There is no “formula” for good organization, as each space should reflect the needs and comfort of the person, business or family.“We are all different people who view the world around us differently. Therefore, our environment must be organized to meet our individual needs”, says Missy. Missy’s business, The Organized Connection was born in 2006 when she and her family moved to The OC. She has had the opportunity to serve a wide range of households, high profile clientele, businesses and groups. She has been speaking and training groups since 1994.

For more than 24 years, Missy has been been putting thing in order in homes and businesses. She creates functional spaces as well as peacefulness and harmony both without (one’s environment), as well as ‘within’ (calmness and order). The key to her success is in understandingand intentionally creating balance in all that she encounters. Missy does this by listening to how each person relates to their space. With a background in counseling and Social Work, Missy weaves her client’s individuality, as well as to where they are into every circumstance. There is no “formula” for good organization, as each space should reflect the needs and comfort of the person, business or family.“We are all different people who view the world around us differently. Therefore, our environment must be organized to meet our individual needs”, says Missy. Missy’s business, The Organized Connection was born in 2006 when she and her family moved to The OC.

The family owned a gas service station for several decades, selling in 1972 and then owning the Barons Hotel for 5 years in the Seventies. Barons was (and is) a small town of about 250 people which acted as Lyon’s learning grounds for business, commerce, networking, and “exposing oneself” for success. Grades 10 through 12 students were bussed to Lethbridge, a city of about 50,000, 30 miles away, and after finishing High School in 1976, Danny went to work for Alberta Government Telephones (which later became Telus). This led to completion of a Diploma of Technology in Telecommunications at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology in Calgary, Alberta – graduating in 1979. Lyon spent 20+ years in the telecom industry as a technician and contractor in the installation, test and acceptance of long haul transmission systems. He specialized in fiber optic transmission. From 1986 to 1992, Lyon worked throughout the United States as well as Puerto Rico and Guam, and then relocated to Thailand for 4 years to help install, test and maintain the country’s first working nationwide fiber optic transmission system. During his years in telecommunications, Lyon learned, developed and utilized skills as a manager, “in-charge”, and supervisor, including the necessary ability to co-ordinate between several companies and many contacts on any one project. He didn’t know it at the time but that project management ability was crucial to the success of his businesses later on. It was during the telecom “on the road” years that Lyon was lucky enough to be found by the beautiful and vivacious Miss Connie Campbell. They married in February of 1990 and together they have three ultra-fantastic kids Tommy (17), Davey (15) and Maggie (13). The two youngest children were born in Thailand. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/danny-lyon/'>Danny Lyon</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/danny-lyon.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/danny-lyon.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-colour-of-my-underwear-is-blue/'>The Colour of My Underwear Is Blue</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-colour-of-my-underwear-is-blue.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-colour-of-my-underwear-is-blue.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/blogtalk-radio/'>Blogtalk Radio</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blogtalk-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blogtalk-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Born in 1958, Danny Lyon grew up in Barons, Alberta, Canada with 2 brothers and a sister.

Growing up in a Mormon fundamentalist religious home shaped her life values, and her views on literally everything. This memoir is about growing up while suffering abuse in a polygamous family living in Utah. She says, “In writing the book, I let the rotting parts of myself die and I asked the book to carry the emotional truth that my body could no longer hold.” Young Susanna didn’t know anything other than the family environment that was created for her; a system without regard for society or man’s laws. Raised in a sequestered home in a busy city neighborhood, everything beyond the front gate was off-limits. The isolation proved to be a breeding ground for abuse and Susanna struggled to reconcile her desire to escape and her need to belong. The book recounts six critical years of Susanna’s youth during which she struggled to come to terms with the conditions of her life. This coming of age story is as much a testament to survival as it is to surrender. Pushed to the limits of her coping abilities, Susanna tried everything she could think of to bring about the peace that always seemed out of reach. In an impulsive moment and an act of daring, she contacted a newspaper journalist and found herself in a predicament that she never before considered. That decision became the impetus that propelled her to where she wanted to be and to finally find personal peace. Although Ms. Barlow is no longer affiliated with any polygamous group on a religious level, she is surrounded by family and friends who are practicing polygamists. She says, “Although I suffered abuse at the hands of one of “the mothers”, I currently know many decent people who are living this lifestyle.” Susanna Barlow is currently working on her second book. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/susanna-barlow/'>Susanna Barlow</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/susanna-barlow.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/susanna-barlow.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/what-peace-there-may-be/'>What Peace There May Be</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/what-peace-there-may-be.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/what-peace-there-may-be.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/blogtalk-radio/'>Blogtalk Radio</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blogtalk-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blogtalk-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[SUSANNA BARLOW is the 23rd child of 46 children, the quintessential middle child.

But there was no lack of remarkable personalities, each of whom left an indelible imprint on his life. Gar Fish & Long Gravy collects the stories, insight, tragedies, and uproarious wit of an unforgettable cast of characters. Meet Granmama Lia’, whose hard-won wisdom on life, love—and mistresses—is dispensed to in her kitchen to her beloved grandson, sometimes over Johnny Walker Black. There’s Ms. Peaches, who raises chickens in her ramshackle hut yet might be one of the richest people in town. Big Daddy is an imposing hulk, but his massive frame hides a vulnerable past and humiliating secret. Ms. Annie Laurie is a fabulously wealthy white woman who never had children of her own. But her love rains down on young Alexander. And that’s just for starters. Based on real-life experiences, Gar Fish & Long Gravy is about the mistakes we make, the loves we share, and the stories we tell each other that make us who we are. And it is the touching story of a boy who ultimately breaks free of the poverty and abuse of his extended family, yet never forgets the important lessons he learned along the way.

At that age his mother recounts how he sold finger paintings in the drive way, affixing price tags next to each one. His best (and only) customer was his mother who bought them all. His first profitable business was a lemonade stand near their home, which raked in $5 a day. Fast forward some years later, James Rick Stinson was awarded Young Entrepreneur of the Year by Southern Utah Chamber of Commerce in 2001, for starting his first major venture with less than $1,000 at the age of 17. By age 18 he had gotten into as much as $30,000 in credit card and personal debt but somehow managed to get out of it. Over the next 3 years he grew that business to half a million dollars in sales and expanded to build an office in Noida, India where he lived and worked for 3 months before returning to the US. James learned the hard way that you can’t do it all yourself. He had been the top sales person at his company and when he stopped selling to focus on building out the office, things took a turn for the worse. He ended up closing the business a few months later due to losses. “It crashed and burned but I was still alive”. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/james-rick/'>James Rick</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/james-rick.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/james-rick.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/full-potential/'>Full Potential</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/full-potential.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/full-potential.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/entrepreneur/'>Entrepreneur</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/entrepreneur.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/entrepreneur.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[At the age of 4, James was either going to be a priest or an Entrepreneur.

At that age his mother recounts how he sold finger paintings in the drive way, affixing price tags next to each one. His best (and only) customer was his mother who bought them all. His first profitable business was a lemonade stand near their home, which raked in $5 a day. Fast forward some years later, James Rick Stinson was awarded Young Entrepreneur of the Year by Southern Utah Chamber of Commerce in 2001, for starting his first major venture with less than $1,000 at the age of 17. By age 18 he had gotten into as much as $30,000 in credit card and personal debt but somehow managed to get out of it. Over the next 3 years he grew that business to half a million dollars in sales and expanded to build an office in Noida, India where he lived and worked for 3 months before returning to the US. James learned the hard way that you can’t do it all yourself. He had been the top sales person at his company and when he stopped selling to focus on building out the office, things took a turn for the worse.

It is a classy organization representing a classic dress. Wearing little black dresses, women work and play together to build awareness, raise funds, and impact the lives of women touched by abuse. Amanda is personally committed to ending the abuse of women while encouraging other women to join her in this worthy cause. For over 20 years, Amanda has touched the hearts of women through her passion of empowering them to live their life to the fullest. She is a contributing author of two books and in 2007 her inspirational novel, The Little Black Dress, was released exploring the power of forgiveness and bringing hope to its readers. She recently received the 2010 Phoenix Award in San Antonio for the work she does to bring awareness to Domestic Violence. Amanda volunteers her time teaching self-esteem to women equipping them for both life and employment, therefore restoring their passion to fulfill their dreams. Her driving force in creating the Little Black Dress Society is to give women of all walks of life the ability to join hearts and hands in order to make a difference in their community. The magic is women in little black dresses with willing hearts, compassion and hands that reach beyond pettiness and competition. Amanda believes the vision is global. Through the combined efforts of women forming “societies”, the innate beauty of a woman’s heart can be changed. The blindfold women wear to hide their shame can be removed returning their hope to… LOVE, BELIEVE, AND DREAM, again! <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/amanda-graybill/'>Amanda Graybill</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/amanda-graybill.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/amanda-graybill.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-little-black-dress-society/'>The Little Black Dress Society</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-little-black-dress-society.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-little-black-dress-society.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/domestic-violence/'>Domestic Violence</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/domestic-violence.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/domestic-violence.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Amanda Graybill is a Speaker, Author, and Founder of The Little Black Dress Society, a service organization she founded in 2009 that is committed to ending the abuse of women.

In COMPLETELY WHOLE, Paulette Harper offers keys to help those who are searching for answers that can lead to a life of complete wholeness: Spirit, Soul and Body. COMPLETELY WHOLE focuses on how to overcome suffering caused by alcoholism, substance abuse, poverty, and other obstacles blocking the path to a life of wholeness.” Oftentimes, many people try to seek fulfillment from money, relationships, accomplishments, or material things. Others choose to cope with difficult problems by using drugs or alcohol, but they often come up short and soon have to realize that such things do not bring true happiness and fulfillment in life. How then can we successfully solve the problems that we face and find true happiness and peace in our lives? Well, author, Paulette Harper, in her latest book, Completely Whole, shows readers how to overcome suffering caused by alcoholism, substance abuse, poverty, and other obstacles blocking the path to a life of wholeness in spirit, soul, and body. In her well-written, resource-filled guide, Harper provides readers with practical and biblically-based solutions to overcome everyday problems.

In 1992, following several hardships—including serving a prison sentence for illegal activities and having been shot while driving away from a dispute mix up—Moffitt began his professional writing career from a hospital sick bed. In December 1992 Moffitt, then a drug dealer, was incarcerated at Graterford prison; he later served time at Somerset prison.

Standing before the judge, he was only 17 years old at the time his illegal activity brought him crashing down.

The game, to be played on February 6, 2011, will pit the AFC champion Pittsburgh Steelers against the NFC champion Green Bay Packers to decide the NFL champion for the 2010 season. The game will be held at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, the first time that the Super Bowl will be held in the Dallas – Fort Worth area; and the third time it will be held in Texas (Houston was the host city to Super Bowls VIII and XXXVIII). Kickoff time is approximately 5:25pm CST (UTC-06). This will be the eighth appearance in the Super Bowl for the Steelers (who hold the record with 6 Super Bowl wins) and the fifth for the Packers (who hold the record with 12 overall NFL titles, including 3 Super Bowl wins and 9 league titles prior to the Super Bowl-era). The Packers are three point favorites, making this the first Super Bowl the Steelers were underdogs in since Super Bowl XXX. In all four previous Super Bowls that Green Bay played in, they were also favored to win. The Steelers and Packers did not play each other this season. The last time the two teams met was December 20, 2009, when the Steelers defeated the Packers 37–36 at Heinz Field. That game was marked by four lead changes in the fourth quarter and a game-winning touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger to Mike Wallace as time expired.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/super-bowl-xlv/'>Super Bowl XLV</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/super-bowl-xlv.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/super-bowl-xlv.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-perfect-party/'>The Perfect Party</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-perfect-party.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-perfect-party.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/predictions/'>Predictions</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/predictions.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/predictions.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Super Bowl XLV will be the 45th annual edition of the Super Bowl in American football, and the 41st annual championship game of the modern-era National Football League (NFL).

The game, to be played on February 6, 2011, will pit the AFC champion Pittsburgh Steelers against the NFC champion Green Bay Packers to decide the NFL champion for the 2010 season. The game will be held at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, the first time that the Super Bowl will be held in the Dallas – Fort Worth area; and the third time it will be held in Texas (Houston was the host city to Super Bowls VIII and XXXVIII). Kickoff time is approximately 5:25pm CST (UTC-06). This will be the eighth appearance in the Super Bowl for the Steelers (who hold the record with 6 Super Bowl wins) and the fifth for the Packers (who hold the record with 12 overall NFL titles, including 3 Super Bowl wins and 9 league titles prior to the Super Bowl-era). The Packers are three point favorites, making this the first Super Bowl the Steelers were underdogs in since Super Bowl XXX. In all four previous Super Bowls that Green Bay played in, they were also favored to win. The Steelers and Packers did not play each other this season. The last time the two teams met was December 20, 2009, when the Steelers defeated the Packers 37–36 at Heinz Field. That game was marked by four lead changes in the fourth quarter and a game-winning touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger to Mike Wallace as time expired. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/vince-moore/'>Vince Moore</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/vince-moore.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/vince-moore.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/pittsburg-steelers/'>Pittsburg Steelers</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/pittsburg-steelers.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/pittsburg-steelers.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/green-bay-packers/'>Green Bay Packers</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/green-bay-packers.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/green-bay-packers.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Super Bowl XLV will be the 45th annual edition of the Super Bowl in American football, and the 41st annual championship game of the modern-era National Football League (NFL).

High society and the racing elite, medical and veterinary specialists, mob figures, and Kentucky hill folk become entangled in this unique twist on the medical thriller. Dr. Anthony Gianni, a prominent Manhattan surgeon, becomes involved in a racing partnership as a diversion from a thriving surgical practice and an ailing marriage. The excitement builds when the partnership acquires Chiefly Endeavor, a two-year-old colt with the breeding, the spirit, and enough early racing success to qualify for the Kentucky Derby. When a new partner with an unsavory background appears and a breeder’s nightmare becomes real, Dr. Gianni and a dedicated veterinarian must confront organized crime and solve a complex mystery that threatens to destroy both of their careers, and possibly a great deal more. Dean M. DeLuke is an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, a graduate of St. Michael’s College, Columbia University (DMD) and Union Graduate College (MBA).

High society and the racing elite, medical and veterinary specialists, mob figures, and Kentucky hill folk become entangled in this unique twist on the medical thriller. Dr. Anthony Gianni, a prominent Manhattan surgeon, becomes involved in a racing partnership as a diversion from a thriving surgical practice and an ailing marriage. The excitement builds when the partnership acquires Chiefly Endeavor, a two-year-old colt with the breeding, the spirit, and enough early racing success to qualify for the Kentucky Derby. When a new partner with an unsavory background appears and a breeder’s nightmare becomes real, Dr. Gianni and a dedicated veterinarian must confront organized crime and solve a complex mystery that threatens to destroy both of their careers, and possibly a great deal more.

That is our story. God is Good. All the Time. Scripture states that God hates divorce. We understand why. Anyone who has ever experienced the breakup of a family can perhaps understand God's message on divorce. God's original design for the family works best. He knows the pain divorce creates. The tearing of a family often brings with it bigger trials and tribulations, causing a ripple effect in the walk of life that God, as our loving Heavenly Father would not choose for us. However, our world is replete with divorce. We believe that God is not into scrapping people, He's into redeeming them. It's never too late to turn our eyes toward Him and seek healing, restoration and a relationship with our Heavenly Father. The message for you to remember right now...is that God is a God of second chances. You, your family, your new marriage and your children can all find a way to 'bond' to God and as a result of that bond, bond to each other. There is a way. We'd like to share a Biblical message of Encouragement, Hope, Inspiration, Motivation and Biblical Insight to all those who've found themselves in the midst of divorce trials. GOD'S PLAN FOR TWO PEOPLE It was in 1995 when God went to work and set forth the events that now lead you to be reading this very story, right now, this moment. God is a God of 'no coincidences'. Dan was a single Dad of two young children in Shawnee, KS. Rebecca was an Overland Park, KS single Mom, raising her three children, and working at home. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dan-snell/'>Dan Snell</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dan-snell.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dan-snell.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-bonded-family/'>The Bonded Family</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-bonded-family.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-bonded-family.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/blended-families/'>Blended Families</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blended-families.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blended-families.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes God let's people 'take their mess...and turn it into His message'.

Imagine finding out your employer, one of the leading lenders, who was closing 3.5 billion in loans every month is shutting down and hearing this on a conference call. What would you do and how would you survive when you not only loose your job, but the entire market sector colapses. Keith Goeringer is now the Director of Sales and Marketing for Cendera Funding in Brentwood, TN. He has pioneered a new system in real estate in which he provides hands on marketing training and assistance to all his referral partners. When most people in the industry threw in the towel, he spent years learning ways to generate business through real estate internet marketing. He will be giving away some of his best kept secrets for generating new business even in a difficult market that real estate professionals can implement immediately. Keith has a nine year background in retail and wholesale lending and was a top producing account executive for three of the largest fortune 500 banks in what most people now call the “Good Times.” Keith has recently moved back to his hometown of Franklin, TN where he lives with his wife Kate and 2 year old son Jake. His new business model has created a paradigm shift in lender/Realtor relationship. Keith regularly speaks to groups of real estate professionals sharing his systems, programs, and marketing. He is also author of a popular blog www.realtor-resources.com which provides techniques for agents to sell more homes, get more listings, and attract more buyers. His philosophy is very simple. He believes that you don't have to be the best Realtor out there, just the best marketer. The more people you can get in front of, the better chance you have to sell more homes. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/keith-goeringer/'>Keith Goeringer</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/keith-goeringer.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/keith-goeringer.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/marketing/'>Marketing</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/marketing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/marketing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/real-estate/'>Real Estate</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/real-estate.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/real-estate.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[When the real estate bubble popped it not only affected millions of homeowners but also hundreds of thousands of people that supported the entire real estate industry.

Imagine finding out your employer, one of the leading lenders, who was closing 3.5 billion in loans every month is shutting down and hearing this on a conference call. What would you do and how would you survive when you not only loose your job, but the entire market sector colapses. Keith Goeringer is now the Director of Sales and Marketing for Cendera Funding in Brentwood, TN. He has pioneered a new system in real estate in which he provides hands on marketing training and assistance to all his referral partners. When most people in the industry threw in the towel, he spent years learning ways to generate business through real estate internet marketing. He will be giving away some of his best kept secrets for generating new business even in a difficult market that real estate professionals can implement immediately. Keith has a nine year background in retail and wholesale lending and was a top producing account executive for three of the largest fortune 500 banks in what most people now call the “Good Times.” Keith has recently moved back to his hometown of Franklin, TN where he lives with his wife Kate and 2 year old son Jake. His new business model has created a paradigm shift in lender/Realtor relationship. Keith regularly speaks to groups of real estate professionals sharing his systems, programs, and marketing. He is also author of a popular blog www.realtor-resources.com which provides techniques for agents to sell more homes, get more listings, and attract more buyers. His philosophy is very simple. He believes that you don't have to be the best Realtor out there, just the best marketer. The more people you can get in front of, the better chance you have to sell more homes. </itunes:summary><itunes:duration>00:30:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/chris-treece/2011/01/24/business-spotlight-real-estate-marketing-expert-ke.mp3" fileSize="7147439" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/chris-treece/2011/01/24/business-spotlight-real-estate-marketing-expert-ke.wma" fileSize="7147439" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>Chris Treece Show</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>Chris Treece,Keith Goeringer,The Chris Treece Show,Marketing,Real Estate,BlogTalkRadio, Blog Talk Radio</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Business Spotlight-Real Estate Marketing Expert Keith Goeringer</itunes:subtitle></item><item><title>Health and Fitness-Ardyss Consultant Esta J Ware - Jan 21,2011</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/chris-treece/2011/01/21/health-and-fitness-ardyss-consultant-esta-j-ware</link><description><![CDATA[Esta J.

With his twenty-second book, DAMAGE (Dutton; On sale January 4, 2011), John Lescroart has more than lived up to that challenge. While still featuring many of his series characters and centering on the legal profession (though to this day Mr. Lescroart has never had any formal legal experience), this time he takes his thriller outside the courtroom. A more intimate, darker novel of suspense, DAMAGE is a look at what goes on behind-the-scenes; how the application of justice is often determined unfairly outside the courtroom, especially when a powerful family can intimidate law enforcement, the media, and the district attorney. John Lescroart introduces us to the Curtlees, the kind of excessively wealthy and connected family that we all know exists in real life. In the San Francisco of DAMAGE, you’d be hard pressed to find an important pocket that’s not lined with Curtlee money. So when heir to the Curtlee dynasty, Ro, was convicted of rape and murder a decade ago, the fallout for those who played a role in that case—the jury foreman, the lead prosecutor, the head homicide detective—was grave. All of their careers and lives were damaged in some vicious and permanent way. Now Ro’s lawyers have won him a retrial and he is out on bail. Within 24 hours, a fire destroys the home of the original trial’s star witness. Her abused body is found in the ruins, and she’s only the first victim. When a second fire claims another participant in the case, everyone is convinced that Ro is out for revenge. But with no hard evidence and with the Curtlees able to get to everyone, the major players for the prosecution find themselves frustratingly powerless.

I am a Domestic Violence Survivor. That is the key right there, I am a survivor! I came up with the concept of Simply Beautiful Domestic Violence Awareness in October 2010. I believe this is when I felt my strength return. I can’t say that the “old” Bridget returned, she is long gone but the foundation of who I once was is still there; just stronger, more relaxed and eyes wide open. It is Simply Beautiful’s purpose to draw an awareness to a worldwide problem…Domestic Violence. At times it seems pandemic. I will provide contact information for help. Post events and educate you on early signs and full blown signs of the problem. You may learn how to avoid the situation, you may gain strength to get out and you may be able to heal. This is part of my way to heal. I want others to heal and the rest to avoid the situation altogether. Please be aware that you may read things that seem outrageous. Anything is possible...sadly.

Both entertaining and poignant, The Butterfly's Flight offers parents and teachers an entertaining way to introduce children to autism.

I've been on stage since the age of 6, performing poems written by some of the greats including Langston Hughes. I've since shared the stage with lots of "famous" folks such as Nikki Giovanni, Yolanda Adams, Ruby Dee and Sonia Sanchez. I'm also a singer, I have THREE music cds under my belt including my most successful cd: MOJO I've written two books- Doubledutch and Gabby Saturday, illustrated by her mother Janice Treece Senter. Gabby Saturday also won the 2010 Harold Grinspoon Award! Right now I'm focusing on finishing my second book of poetry which I'm planning to call "Enormous Things." I'm also shopping a new novel I wrote late last year.

My name is Scott Tousignant. I've been helping busy women and men improve their #1 asset (HEALTH) for over a decade. My balanced and practical approach to fitness will help you get more done in less time so you can spend more time doing what you enjoy most in life. Backed by years of experience and the application of my education in human kinetics, I created Fat Loss Quickie, the fast fun at home workout program that will quickly transform YOU into the confident, energetic, beautiful person you really are! Now it doesn’t matter how busy you are… You’ll never have to neglect your health again! About my approach to weight loss and my beliefs: I am very non-judgmental when it comes to diets and exercise programs. I've observed some programs to work very well for some and not so well for others. It all depends on the individual. I believe that there needs to be more emphasis on having fun when it comes to fitness. Today people view fitness as a way to lose weight. That's not what fitness should be about at all. Living an active lifestyle is about so many other things and weight loss is just one of the outcomes from fitness... but it's not the end result. If you dislike a certain physical activity and you can never stick to it find something that you enjoy and will stick with. It's all about compliance and when you are having fun with an activity you are more likely to stick to it. I believe that in order to start a new trend where the number of healthy active people begins to increase steadily, there will need to be a shift in how people VALUE their health and their bodies. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/scott-tousignant/'>Scott Tousignant</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/scott-tousignant.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/scott-tousignant.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/health-and-fitness/'>Health and Fitness</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/health-and-fitness.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/health-and-fitness.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-fat-loss-experience/'>The Fat Loss Experience</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-fat-loss-experience.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-fat-loss-experience.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Hey there!

I can relate to the pain of domestic violence, drug and alcohol abuse by family members, child molestation and rape, emotional abuse, death of the only people I ever trusted, divorce, being stripped of my dreams and goals, living as a single parent, living on disability, having nothing and no one to turn to... But through it all, I had... (and still have) my faith in God. I had to inspire MYSELF and never gave up on the dreams I have. I work diligently everyday to write this cookbook which will also contain many testimonies and inspirational words to help someone find their inner strength. We all have something inside us to help us get over the pain and obstacles in our lives. Sometimes we just need a little push or inspiration to get us to recognize it...and use it. That's my reason for living. My purpose in this life is to encourage and inspire God's precious people to keep their faith. If I never had to cry, I'd never appreciate the joy of laughter. If I was never hurt, I could never open myself to comfort others. I know there are so many people who have gone through worse events in their lives than I have. I just feel that MY purpose is to use my story to touch as many people as I can, and to let them know that their faith can bring them out of any situation. How does a cookbook fit into my purpose? Well, everyone has to eat. Everyone has to eventually COOK! God has blessed me with this passion for food and cooking. Food is something that can destroy all barriers...race, creed, sex, age, etc. Food is one thing we all have in common, so my gift for cooking is an International gift! It's a way to break the ice and get into the hearts of people. It's my way of inviting you all to the table for dinner and conversation! <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/sharon-fox/'>Sharon Fox</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/sharon-fox.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/sharon-fox.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ms-southern-hospitality/'>Ms Southern Hospitality</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ms-southern-hospitality.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ms-southern-hospitality.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/cooking/'>Cooking</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/cooking.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/cooking.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[In my lifetime, I've endured many painful events.

As Vice President of my youth group, I composed songs for my church, and I received my first standing ovation, at age 16, after performing a song I composed for my High School graduation. After high school I became a professional model while attending the University of New Mexico and learned very quickly that it’s nice to have beauty on the outside, but to be in demand, the beauty must also come from within. And to be successful, I had to lay out a plan of where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do. I had always been a goal-setter, but I lacked in direction and the follow through to get things done. At age 21, I told my father I was quitting college to pursue a career as a professional singer. Can you imagine the look on a father’s face, who was the only one to go to college in his family, and had saved all those years just so I could go? Thank goodness he was supportive of my dreams, because he knew deep down that all I wanted to do was travel the world and sing. It had become my aching desire, and I had found a way to make it happen. I pushed myself daily at my vocal lessons and dance classes all while working a full time job. I auditioned for my first show overseas and finally fulfilled my dreams, and became a lead vocalist in shows world wide. While headlining shows, I became known for my enthusiasm, positive attitude and my coaching abilities (most of that came from all the motivational books I read throughout my life). Out of the blue one day, I was asked if I could develop motivational seminars on Goal Setting, Teamwork and Customer Service for the employees of a venue I was performing at. I had no clue what I was getting myself into, but I couldn’t resist the offer. It was then I found my new passion for public speaking and coaching others to reach extraordinary goals. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/betsy-allen/'>Betsy Allen</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/betsy-allen.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/betsy-allen.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/motiv8u-seminars/'>Motiv8u Seminars</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/motiv8u-seminars.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/motiv8u-seminars.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/personal-development/'>Personal Development</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/personal-development.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/personal-development.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Born in Morristown, NJ, with two loving and supporting parents, I learned to impact lives through leadership and entertainment from an early age.

I had no clue what I was getting myself into, but I couldn’t resist the offer.

As Vice President of my youth group, I composed songs for my church, and I received my first standing ovation, at age 16, after performing a song I composed for my High School graduation. After high school I became a professional model while attending the University of New Mexico and learned very quickly that it’s nice to have beauty on the outside, but to be in demand, the beauty must also come from within. And to be successful, I had to lay out a plan of where I wanted to go and what I wanted to do. I had always been a goal-setter, but I lacked in direction and the follow through to get things done. At age 21, I told my father I was quitting college to pursue a career as a professional singer. Can you imagine the look on a father’s face, who was the only one to go to college in his family, and had saved all those years just so I could go? Thank goodness he was supportive of my dreams, because he knew deep down that all I wanted to do was travel the world and sing. It had become my aching desire, and I had found a way to make it happen. I pushed myself daily at my vocal lessons and dance classes all while working a full time job. I auditioned for my first show overseas and finally fulfilled my dreams, and became a lead vocalist in shows world wide. While headlining shows, I became known for my enthusiasm, positive attitude and my coaching abilities (most of that came from all the motivational books I read throughout my life). Out of the blue one day, I was asked if I could develop motivational seminars on Goal Setting, Teamwork and Customer Service for the employees of a venue I was performing at.

Laura lives in Texas and has been married to her best friend Jeremy for over 16 years. Together, they have two children – Mason is 14 and Mekenna is 11. Laura has been an active community leader and connector since the early age of 21 when she served as the leader of two local Mothers of Preschoolers (MOPS International) chapters in Las Vegas, NV. That experience showed Laura the power, purpose and effectiveness of women creating strong and nurturing relationships as they “linked hearts” to support one another. Laura developed a sincere passion for the Direct Selling industry after attending a kitchen party over a decade ago. During her 12-year career in Direct Sales, Laura developed teams and new leaders nationwide. She received multiple awards from two well-known Direct Sales companies for Top Sales, Top Recruiting, and Leadership Excellence. Laura served in an elected position on a Technology Committee, was a featured National Convention speaker, participated in multiple corporate-office and field member focus groups, and led numerous tele-classes for her colleagues in those companies in order to help them grow their businesses. In addition to serving as President of The Heart Link Network, co-authoring a women’s networking blog, and volunteering in her community, she also serves as a 6th grade Girl Scout Troop Leader, and has a home-based business. Laura has a special talent for helping entrepreneurs market their business in a real, authentic, and transparent way and believes that when relationships are created, business just naturally follows! <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/laura-wells/'>Laura Wells</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/laura-wells.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/laura-wells.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-heart-links-womens-network/'>The Heart Links Womens Network</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-heart-links-womens-network.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-heart-links-womens-network.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/women/'>Women</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/women.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/women.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Laura Wells is the President of The Heart Link Women’s Network and a relationship marketing coach.

Our free resume evaluation and review does not simply critique the content of your resume - but also the appearance, design and layout. The main focus of our review is directed toward strengths and weaknesses with an emphasis on the organized flow of information, and how you market or sell yourself based on the evidence of value and contributions offered. We also check for spelling, grammar and punctuation errors. Heading up this free effort is our Careers Consultant, Erin Flannery. Erin is the Human Resources Management Intern at the University Career Center at Truman State University in Kirksville, MO. She has worked as a Career Advisor for two years critiquing resumes and assisting students with career planning.

Croce - Oct 07,2010</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/chris-treece/2010/10/07/musicians-spotlight-recording-artist-aj-croce</link><description><![CDATA[Shortly before his father's death in a 1973 plane crash, Croce's family moved west to San Diego, California, where he was raised by his mother, Ingrid Croce. At the age of four, Croce was completely blinded, as the result of a brain tumor. Between the ages of four and ten, Croce gradually regained vision in his left eye. It was during this difficult time in Croce's life that he began to play the piano. "At some point I was given the music of Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder as inspiration, which it was, and has been ever since."[citation needed] Croce's first paying gig was at the age of 12, when he was paid $20 to perform at a Bat Mitzvah party. By the age of 16, Croce was performing regularly at San Diego nightclubs, as a sideman and band leader. Croce reflects, "I was into every kind of music... you might say I was unfocused, but I consider an eclectic taste in music to be the foundation of versatility." His house burned down when he was age 15. Ron Goldstein and Peter Bauman of Private Music signed Croce to his first record deal at age 19. He recorded two CDs for Private Music: his self-titled debut, "A.J. Croce," produced by T-Bone Burnett and John Simon, and "That's Me In The Bar," produced by Jim Keltner, and featuring artists such as Ry Cooder, David Hidalgo, and Keltner himself. Croce then took a musical turn with the release of his album Transit. He explained, "I had been playing blues-based music for a long time, and I was ready to try something new." Glen Starkey of New Times labeled Croce "a song crafter of the first order". He has performed as an opening act for artists such as Carlos Santana, Rod Stewart, Aretha Franklin, Willie Nelson, Lyle Lovett, James Brown, Ben Harper, Dave Matthews, Earth, Wind and Fire and Ray Charles. He has also performed on such national venues as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, The Late Show with David Letterman, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Today Show, Good Morning America, and Austin City Limits. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/aj-croce/'>AJ Croce</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/aj-croce.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/aj-croce.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/musicians/'>Musicians</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/musicians.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/musicians.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/jim-croce/'>Jim Croce</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jim-croce.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jim-croce.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Shortly before his father's death in a 1973 plane crash, Croce's family moved west to San Diego, California, where he was raised by his mother, Ingrid Croce.

She believes in that magic nation of imagination, and in everything sees the story lurking beneath the surface. Born in Seattle, WA and raised & living in southern California, LK is definitely a west coast girl, but loves to travel. The love of writing and travel were fostered very young by reading Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women and deciding that she and Jo had a great deal in common. While she didn’t have 3 sisters, and a father absentee in the war, the making up of stories, dramatic feelings, and a quick temper were enough for LK to know that she and Jo would have been kindred spirits. Outside the world of writing, LK loves listening to music and even more, singing. Country music is her favored genre (mostly because that’s what she sings). She and her husband Denny are strong supporters of Cal State Fullerton Baseball (Go Titans!) and they thoroughly enjoy supporting their nieces and nephews in their sport and music related endeavors. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/lk-gardner-griffee/'>LK Gardner Griffee</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/lk-gardner-griffee.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/lk-gardner-griffee.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/owhere-feels-like-home/'>owhere Feels Like Home</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/owhere-feels-like-home.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/owhere-feels-like-home.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/books/'>Books</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/books.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/books.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[LK Gardner-Griffie started writing her first, never to be published, novel at the ripe old age of 9.

Growing up the middle child in a family of ten siblings, Dugoni jokes that he didn't get much of a chance to talk, so he wrote. By the seventh grade he knew he wanted to be a writer. Dugoni wrote his way to Stanford University where he majored in communications/journalism and creative writing and worked as a reporter for the Stanford Daily. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa and worked briefly as a reporter in the Metro and San Gabriel Valley Offices of the Los Angeles Times before deciding to attend the UCLA law school. Dugoni practiced law full-time in San Francisco as a partner at the law firm, Gordon and Rees and is currently of counsel for a law firm in Seattle. While practicing law he satisfied his artistic thirst studying acting at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, appearing in equity and non-equity shows throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. His longing to return to writing never wavered, however, and in 1999 he made the decision to quit the full-time practice of law to write novels. On the 4-year anniversary of his wedding, he drove a u-haul trailer across the Oregon-Washington border and settled in Seattle to pursue his dream. For the next three years, Dugoni worked in an 8 x 8 foot windowless office in Seattle s Pioneer Square to complete three novels, two of which won the 1999 and 2000 Pacific Northwest Writer's Association Literary Contests.

Growing up the middle child in a family of ten siblings, Dugoni jokes that he didn't get much of a chance to talk, so he wrote. By the seventh grade he knew he wanted to be a writer. Dugoni wrote his way to Stanford University where he majored in communications/journalism and creative writing and worked as a reporter for the Stanford Daily. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa and worked briefly as a reporter in the Metro and San Gabriel Valley Offices of the Los Angeles Times before deciding to attend the UCLA law school. Dugoni practiced law full-time in San Francisco as a partner at the law firm, Gordon and Rees and is currently of counsel for a law firm in Seattle. While practicing law he satisfied his artistic thirst studying acting at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, appearing in equity and non-equity shows throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. His longing to return to writing never wavered, however, and in 1999 he made the decision to quit the full-time practice of law to write novels. On the 4-year anniversary of his wedding, he drove a u-haul trailer across the Oregon-Washington border and settled in Seattle to pursue his dream. For the next three years, Dugoni worked in an 8 x 8 foot windowless office in Seattle s Pioneer Square to complete three novels, two of which won the 1999 and 2000 Pacific Northwest Writer's Association Literary Contests.

She has personally underwritten and processed thousands of loans and is a respected authority on mortgage lending. She pioneered the first independent loan processing company in San Diego California and grew the company to a multi-state presence in the early 90's. Her clientele list, both with the borrowing public and lender servicers is extremely impressive. She has worked with almost every major bank including: Bank of America, Chase, Citibank, Wells Fargo, Union Bank, Washington Mutual and many others. Mary entered the world of mortgage banking in 1980 when the lending industry was respected and underwriters were still valued.

Having no high school diploma let alone college degree severely limited my career choices. Fed up I finally went on to get my GED (General Education Diploma).

The Brubury Tales takes Chaucer's story and frame to Los Angeles just after the riots, where seven security guards on the graveyard shift swap tales in a hilarious storytelling competition for Christmas vacation time. The Brubury Tales also contains a special foreword by California literary legend, Carolyn See, the Friday-morning book reviewer for The Washington Post and bestselling author of Handyman and There Will Never Be Another You. "The Brubury Tales," says See, "is a landmark book, in what is going to be -- and already is -- an exceptional, distinguished literary career." For years Frank Mundo worked countless odd jobs, including a graveyard-shift security guard in Los Angeles, which allowed him to write and publish hundreds of stories, poems, essays, book reviews, articles and author interviews. During this time, Frank managed to earn a BA in English from UCLA, where he completed the Creative Writing Program. Frank is currently a Lead Content Developer for UCG Publishing.

Best - Apr 21,2010</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/chris-treece/2010/04/21/secret-survivor-author-t-e-best</link><description><![CDATA[After numerous sleepless nights and continuous nightmares; I realized that I was still being haunted by childhood demons. I was at a place in my life where I had already given birth to my first two children and fear was beginning to consume me. Quickly realizing that addictive behaviors were not the answer; I sat down and began to write. I wrote about all of the things that were on my mind that I didn’t have the courage to say out loud. As the words began to appear upon the page and tears started to flow; the ink ran, but I was determined to keep on going. Hours became days, days became weeks; yet my determination remained strong. I knew that by the time that I stopped writing my healing would have begun. As my pen stroked the page and the last word was down; I was overcome by relief. Now, albeit long overdue; I was finally free to live my life. The silent voices that had been “screaming ever so loudly” deep within me had been released.

I was at a place in my life where I had already given birth to my first two children and fear was beginning to consume me. Quickly realizing that addictive behaviors were not the answer; I sat down and began to write. I wrote about all of the things that were on my mind that I didn’t have the courage to say out loud. As the words began to appear upon the page and tears started to flow; the ink ran, but I was determined to keep on going. Hours became days, days became weeks; yet my determination remained strong. I knew that by the time that I stopped writing my healing would have begun. As my pen stroked the page and the last word was down; I was overcome by relief. Now, albeit long overdue; I was finally free to live my life. The silent voices that had been “screaming ever so loudly” deep within me had been released.

But her strapped-for-cash childhood motivated her to strive for abundance and financial independence -- goals she exceeded by age thirty as a successful business owner and respected Wall Street player. Now she shares the lessons she learned on her own road to success and riches in LIVE IT, LOVE IT, EARN IT: A Woman’s Guide to Financial Freedom (to be published by Portfolio in January 2010). She shows women of all ages how to break bad money habits and take control of their finances so they can lead happier, richer lives. A sample of her tips: •Fall in Love with Your Money: Having a cavalier attitude toward money is part of the reason many of us find ourselves in a financial pickle. But when you treat your money with respect, keep track of it and spend and save it wisely your money will always love you back. •Act as If: If you think that change is impossible, think again. Start your transformation by acting as if you already are as successful, intelligent, and prosperous as you want to be. •Say Yes to Yourself: Turn toward people and situations that enhance your life and well being, and away from those that don’t. Until you start affirming your future through both thought and action, your efforts to improve your finances will fall flat. LIVE IT, LOVE IT, EARN IT is full of true stories of ordinary women who have overcome obstacles like climbing the corporate ladder, getting themselves out of debt, and changing jobs mid-career. Marianna also shares insights and savvy strategies from various highly accomplished women like fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg and Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/marianna-olszewski/'>Marianna Olszewski</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/marianna-olszewski.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/marianna-olszewski.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/live-it-love-it-earn-it/'>Live it Love it Earn It</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/live-it-love-it-earn-it.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/live-it-love-it-earn-it.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/women/'>Women</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/women.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/women.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Marianna Olszewski wasn’t always rich, happy, and fabulous.

Now living in Buckingham, Quebec which is a small town of approximately 12,000 people that is 20 minutes outside of Canada’s Capital, Ottawa, Jon and his family Jennifer, Savannah Maria, Pierce Christian and a fifth member of the family due in July 2010 live a peaceful and satisfying life. Beyond the obvious passion for social media, family activites center on volunteering at the local Legion where Jennifer is President, and pursuing both family and individual interests which includes art and dance. In May 2001 Jon sold his company for $12 million dollars – mostly shares and debentures, only to see the dot com bust erode away his personal wealth to practically nothing by 2007. This as it turns out was the catalyst that caused him to pursue his present endeavor in the world of social media. Today, the PI Social Media Network is viewed as being one of the top networks in the industry in terms of innovation and quality of content. The flagship Procurement Insights is actually the number one sponsored blog in its industry sector in total number of sponsors, and industry pundits rate the PI Window on Business Show as one of the most popular in North America. Besides writing more than 700 articles and white papers, Jon is also a highly regarded speaker addressing audiences of all sizes ranging from 10 to 20 people in a seminar to giving keynote addresses to 400 attendees at major conferences. Prior to completing this book, Jon had finalized the agreement to write a second book on the emergence of the So Act social network. The second book titled “What Are You Waiting For? So Act Already! (The Unsociable Business of Social Networks and Why the So Act Social Network Will Change the World),” is now available. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/jon-w-hansen/'>Jon W Hansen</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jon-w-hansen.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jon-w-hansen.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/pi-social-media-network/'>PI Social Media Network</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/pi-social-media-network.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/pi-social-media-network.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/your-show-will-go-live-in-5-seconds/'>Your Show Will Go Live In 5 Seconds</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/your-show-will-go-live-in-5-seconds.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/your-show-will-go-live-in-5-seconds.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jon William Hansen was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba on July 21, 1959.

Williams was at the height of her career. Despite the fact that she was very successful in corporate America, she knew something major was missing in her life. She had no clue what it was, but realized she had to figure it out. That led her to embark upon a journey to discover her WHY – her true purpose of existence. "If your WHY doesn't make you cry, it's not strong enough," says Lynesa. "The WHY behind us all should be filled with the WOW of who we are. What we yearn to do, long to do, would do for free…it is the WOW in our WHY that makes us cry, and ultimately fly." After two years of deep study in the book of Proverbs 31, Lynesa finally understood that life is so much more than just having a job. She discovered God’s blessing to all WOMEN, journaled her findings and wrote her first book, “Take the Popcorn out of Your Pancakes.” This riveting book details Lynesa’s life and journey and will serve as one of your trusted guides to becoming a True Proverbs 31 Woman and a Mother-at-Home. Lynesa is able to talk the talk because she has definitively walked the walk -- a walk filled with pain, uncertainty, fear, and ultimately joy and blessings. She has been through what so many of us have been through...instability, problems with our home life, children, partners, finances, and the stark and painful reality that somewhere along the line she had somehow lost herself. Lynesa Williams is currently the inspirational founder of eMothers-at-Home (eMAHs) - an amazing organization that teaches WOMEN how to become a True Proverbs 31 Woman by discovering their passion and purpose and turning it into a profitable business. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/lynesa-williams/'>Lynesa Williams</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/lynesa-williams.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/lynesa-williams.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/emother-at-home/'>eMother at Home</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/emother-at-home.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/emother-at-home.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/training-portal/'>Training Portal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/training-portal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/training-portal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/new-launch/'>New Launch</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/new-launch.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/new-launch.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[In December 1996, Lynesa L.

Williams was at the height of her career. Despite the fact that she was very successful in corporate America, she knew something major was missing in her life. She had no clue what it was, but realized she had to figure it out. That led her to embark upon a journey to discover her WHY – her true purpose of existence. "If your WHY doesn't make you cry, it's not strong enough," says Lynesa. "The WHY behind us all should be filled with the WOW of who we are. What we yearn to do, long to do, would do for free…it is the WOW in our WHY that makes us cry, and ultimately fly." After two years of deep study in the book of Proverbs 31, Lynesa finally understood that life is so much more than just having a job. She discovered God’s blessing to all WOMEN, journaled her findings and wrote her first book, “Take the Popcorn out of Your Pancakes.” This riveting book details Lynesa’s life and journey and will serve as one of your trusted guides to becoming a True Proverbs 31 Woman and a Mother-at-Home. Lynesa is able to talk the talk because she has definitively walked the walk -- a walk filled with pain, uncertainty, fear, and ultimately joy and blessings. She has been through what so many of us have been through...instability, problems with our home life, children, partners, finances, and the stark and painful reality that somewhere along the line she had somehow lost herself.

Williams was at the height of her career. Despite the fact that she was very successful in corporate America, she knew something major was missing in her life. She had no clue what it was, but realized she had to figure it out. That led her to embark upon a journey to discover her WHY – her true purpose of existence. "If your WHY doesn't make you cry, it's not strong enough," says Lynesa. "The WHY behind us all should be filled with the WOW of who we are. What we yearn to do, long to do, would do for free…it is the WOW in our WHY that makes us cry, and ultimately fly." After two years of deep study in the book of Proverbs 31, Lynesa finally understood that life is so much more than just having a job. She discovered God’s blessing to all WOMEN, journaled her findings and wrote her first book, “Take the Popcorn out of Your Pancakes.” This riveting book details Lynesa’s life and journey and will serve as one of your trusted guides to becoming a True Proverbs 31 Woman and a Mother-at-Home. Lynesa is able to talk the talk because she has definitively walked the walk -- a walk filled with pain, uncertainty, fear, and ultimately joy and blessings. She has been through what so many of us have been through...instability, problems with our home life, children, partners, finances, and the stark and painful reality that somewhere along the line she had somehow lost herself. Lynesa Williams is currently the inspirational founder of eMothers-at-Home (eMAHs) - an amazing organization that teaches WOMEN how to become a True Proverbs 31 Woman by discovering their passion and purpose and turning it into a profitable business. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/lynesa-williams/'>Lynesa Williams</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/lynesa-williams.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/lynesa-williams.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chis-treece-show/'>The Chis Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chis-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chis-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/emothers-at-home/'>eMothers At Home</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/emothers-at-home.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/emothers-at-home.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/empowering-women-in-2010/'>Empowering Women in 2010</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/empowering-women-in-2010.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/empowering-women-in-2010.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[In December 1996, Lynesa L.

Kiffin will bring his father and defensive coordinator, Monte Kiffin, and assistant head coach and recruiting coordinator Ed Orgeron to Southern California with him. Sources tell ESPN.com's Chris Low that Tennessee wide receivers coach Kippy Brown will be named interim coach of the Volunteers. He had been given the opportunity to follow Kiffin to USC as well. Lane and Monte Kiffin and Orgeron will hold a news conference on Wednesday at 7 p.m. ET Kiffin replaces Pete Carroll, who jumped to the NFL as coach of the Seattle Seahawks. "This was not an easy decision," Kiffin said in a brief press conference on Tennessee's campus. "I really believe this is the only place I would have left here to go." The hiring was first reported by ESPN.com. "We are really excited to welcome Lane Kiffin back to USC," Garrett said in a statement. "I was able to watch him closely when he was an assistant with us and what I saw was a bright, creative young coach who I thought would make an excellent head coach here if the opportunity ever arose. I'm confident he and his staff will keep USC football performing at the high level that we expect." Kiffin, the former Oakland Raiders coach, led the Volunteers for only one season. Kiffin has been on the move of late. He was 7-6 in his one season at Tennessee and 5-15 in one-plus seasons with the Raiders before being fired in September 2008. He was a member of the USC coaching staff from 2001 to '06, first as wide receivers coach and then as offensive coordinator under Carroll.

Kiffin will bring his father and defensive coordinator, Monte Kiffin, and assistant head coach and recruiting coordinator Ed Orgeron to Southern California with him. Sources tell ESPN.com's Chris Low that Tennessee wide receivers coach Kippy Brown will be named interim coach of the Volunteers. He had been given the opportunity to follow Kiffin to USC as well. Lane and Monte Kiffin and Orgeron will hold a news conference on Wednesday at 7 p.m. ET Kiffin replaces Pete Carroll, who jumped to the NFL as coach of the Seattle Seahawks. "This was not an easy decision," Kiffin said in a brief press conference on Tennessee's campus. "I really believe this is the only place I would have left here to go." The hiring was first reported by ESPN.com. "We are really excited to welcome Lane Kiffin back to USC," Garrett said in a statement. "I was able to watch him closely when he was an assistant with us and what I saw was a bright, creative young coach who I thought would make an excellent head coach here if the opportunity ever arose. I'm confident he and his staff will keep USC football performing at the high level that we expect." Kiffin, the former Oakland Raiders coach, led the Volunteers for only one season. Kiffin has been on the move of late. He was 7-6 in his one season at Tennessee and 5-15 in one-plus seasons with the Raiders before being fired in September 2008. He was a member of the USC coaching staff from 2001 to '06, first as wide receivers coach and then as offensive coordinator under Carroll.

Depression and anger, combined with the environmental pressures of living in South Central, produced a low self-image. "Neither teachers, adults, nor coaches expected much from me," she says. However, Rosalind's dreams motivated her to search for models of success. She learned her greatest opposition to success resided in her. Devising strategies to transform counterproductive habits, she graduated from Loyola Marymount University, earned a Multiple Subject Teaching Credential from Chapman University, and has been recognized in Who's Who of America's Teachers for five consecutive years.

Pink is the author of several provocative, bestselling books about the changing world of work. His latest is Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, which uses 40 years of behavioral science to overturn the conventional wisdom about human motivation and offer a more effective path to high performance. Early reviews say that “Pink’s analysis–and new model–of motivation offers tremendous insight into our deepest nature” (Publishers Weekly) and call the book “important reading . . . an integral addition to a growing body of literature calling for a radical shift in how businesses operate” (Kirkus). Dan’s first book, Free Agent Nation: The Future of Working for Yourself, was a Washington Post bestseller that Publishers Weekly says “has become a cornerstone of employee-management relations.” His articles on business and technology appear in many publications, including the New York Times, Harvard Business Review, Fast Company, and Wired, where he is a contributing editor. He has provided analysis of business trends on CNN, CNBC, ABC, NPR, and other networks in the U.S. and abroad. He also lectures to corporations, associations, and universities around the world on economic transformation and the new workplace. A free agent himself, Dan held his last real job in the White House, where he served from 1995 to 1997 as chief speechwriter to Vice President Al Gore. He also worked as an aide to U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich and in other positions in politics and government. He received a BA, with honors, from Northwestern University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and a JD from Yale Law School. To his lasting joy, he has never practiced law. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/daniel-pink/'>Daniel Pink</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/daniel-pink.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/daniel-pink.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/drive/'>Drive</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/drive.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/drive.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/pink/'>Pink</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/pink.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/pink.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Daniel H.

He is 33 years old and hails from Cedar Hill, Tennessee.

He is married and is the father of four children, and has been called highly dedicated to his family.

Jonathan has quickly become recognized as one of the most sought-after and well-respected speakers and entrepreneurs in the country. The author of several books, informational audio projects and countless articles, his writings have been published internationally and are frequently cited by industry experts. Jonathan’s passion to help people perform at their best stems from the agony that he felt when he lost his father to cancer at the age of 15. Attempting to mask the pain, he gave into peer pressure and the low expectations that surround many African-American men. However, Jonathan’s spirit wouldn’t allow him to stay down. Refusing to settle for life’s second best, he graduated college from the fourth-ranked marketing program in the country and enjoyed a thriving career in sales at Dell, Inc. Jonathan also distinguished himself as being among the top speakers, becoming a Toastmasters International District Champion in speech evaluation (one of only 73 in the world). Jonathan was hand-picked by senior management to join an elite group of Senior Account Managers who were responsible for acquiring new business in the fastest-growing segment of the company. Because of the leadership, customer service, and team-building skills that he developed within a high-stakes sales environment era, Jonathan was bestowed with the coveted title as the “Significant Achiever” among a pool of 400 of the corporation’s best sales reps. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chris-treece/'>Chris Treece</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chris-treece.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/jonathan-sprinkles/'>Jonathan Sprinkles</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jonathan-sprinkles.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jonathan-sprinkles.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-chris-treece-show/'>The Chris Treece Show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-chris-treece-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/speakers/'>Speakers</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/speakers.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/speakers.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/motivational/'>Motivational</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/motivational.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/motivational.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Jonathan Sprinkles is the 2006 College Speaker of the Year selected by members of the Association for the Promotion of Campus Activities and here’s why: he’s funny; his energy keeps audiences on the edge of their seats; and he pulls no punches.

18,2009</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/chris-treece/2009/11/18/authors-spotlight-erik-therwanger-think-great</link><description><![CDATA[My guest today proudly served in the Marine Corp and served as a Corporal. 10 Months after he married his wife they recieved the news she had NON-Hodgkins Lymphoma. Due to the hectic schedule of being Gina’s caretaker, Erik left the entertainment field and began working as an independent contractor in the financial services industry in order to earn income and control his schedule. This time period caused him to seek out a greater life while achieving balance in their current situation. Erik applied the Think GREAT program to his new career and quickly became a top producer in his office and was one of the fastest to be promoted to the position of Marketing Director. He was often requested to speak to teams of financial professionals at different locations across the country. Erik returned to the entertainment field over 4 years later and took an entry-level position to get his foot back in the door. Once again, by applying the techniques & strategies of Think GREAT, he was promoted to the level of Vice President within 18 months and helped the company build a leadership team, enhance its sales team, and more than double its revenue. Erik is an inspirational speaker offering a unique coaching method. Detailed in his book, Think GREAT, Erik not only delivers a powerful story, but inspires members of every organization to Think GREAT and achieve greatness, personally and professionally. Erik combined the survival techniques of the Marine Corps and of being a caretaker to create the Think GREAT program. By learning to Think GREAT, we were not only able to climb out of our situation, we were able to light up the path to achieving greatness in many important areas of our lives: relationships with family and friends, finances, health and fitness, and personal interests. 6 years after going into remission, Gina gave birth to our beautiful baby girl. Today, our daughter is 3 years old!

Due to the hectic schedule of being Gina’s caretaker, Erik left the entertainment field and began working as an independent contractor in the financial services industry in order to earn income and control his schedule. This time period caused him to seek out a greater life while achieving balance in their current situation. Erik applied the Think GREAT program to his new career and quickly became a top producer in his office and was one of the fastest to be promoted to the position of Marketing Director. He was often requested to speak to teams of financial professionals at different locations across the country. Erik returned to the entertainment field over 4 years later and took an entry-level position to get his foot back in the door. Once again, by applying the techniques &amp; strategies of Think GREAT, he was promoted to the level of Vice President within 18 months and helped the company build a leadership team, enhance its sales team, and more than double its revenue. Erik is an inspirational speaker offering a unique coaching method. Detailed in his book, Think GREAT, Erik not only delivers a powerful story, but inspires members of every organization to Think GREAT and achieve greatness, personally and professionally. Erik combined the survival techniques of the Marine Corps and of being a caretaker to create the Think GREAT program. By learning to Think GREAT, we were not only able to climb out of our situation, we were able to light up the path to achieving greatness in many important areas of our lives: relationships with family and friends, finances, health and fitness, and personal interests. 6 years after going into remission, Gina gave birth to our beautiful baby girl.

Magazine as one of Atlanta's 9to5 Business Women in the Media field and Crossroads News, an East Metro Atlanta paper graced the Author with a feature story on her book. Author Marian L .Thomas delivers a book that discusses real-life issues including teen pregnancy and abuse.

It's a cozy, murder mystery, with the issues of Mexican drug violence, and illegal immigration integral to the plot. As a native Californian, and current Arizona resident, she has witnessed the escalating problems along the border. At the age of fourteen, she worked in the dry yards of Northern California, preparing fruit for processing in one-hundred-plus degree heat.

She's been published in Highlights For Children, Skipping Stones, Listen, and Winner. Also, Positive Teens, and The Arizona Republic. "SINS OF THE BORDER" is her first novel.

As a native Californian, and current Arizona resident, she has witnessed the escalating problems along the border. At the age of fourteen, she worked in the dry yards of Northern California, preparing fruit for processing in one-hundred-plus degree heat.

<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">In recent weeks I met with a B2B company to discuss marketing options. The topic of community and social media came up and I was reminded of how difficult it has been for the B2B segment of businesses to grasp a hold of the power in social media when one business is marketing to another. The value has still not been understood. They still view this type of marketing as not relating to them, when in actuality social marketing is becoming one of the most effective ways to market online. </SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0.25in 0in; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">in today's economy B2B companies are decreasing their marketing dollars and spending more online. A recent survey by B2B Magazine revealed that over 48% of those surveyed were increasing their online marketing spend. </SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0.25in 0in; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">Why is there such an effectiveness in social media? </SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0.25in 0in; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">Truth is, so many people are tired of "marketing speak." Social media allows companies to relate to one another and bypass the fluff. </SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0.25in 0in; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">Let's take a look at what the online definition of social media, I've chosen to use the definition from wikipedia since it is user generated. </SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0.25in 0in; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">Social media describes the online technologies and practices that people use to share opinions, insights, experiences, and perspectives with each other. Social media can take many different forms, including text, images, audio, and video. Popular social mediums include blogs, message boards, podcasts, wikis, and vlogs. </SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0.25in 0in; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">The definition alone should reveal to you how important it is that B2B companies explore social media marketing channels. </SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0.25in 0in; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">In a recent study done by KnowledgeStorm of B2B technology decision makers the following statistics were revealed: </SPAN></P>

<P style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">In recent weeks I met with a B2B company to discuss marketing options. The topic of community and social media came up and I was reminded of how difficult it has been for the B2B segment of businesses to grasp a hold of the power in social media when one business is marketing to another. The value has still not been understood. They still view this type of marketing as not relating to them, when in actuality social marketing is becoming one of the most effective ways to market online. </SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0.25in 0in; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">in today's economy B2B companies are decreasing their marketing dollars and spending more online. A recent survey by B2B Magazine revealed that over 48% of those surveyed were increasing their online marketing spend. </SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0.25in 0in; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">Why is there such an effectiveness in social media? </SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0.25in 0in; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">Truth is, so many people are tired of "marketing speak." Social media allows companies to relate to one another and bypass the fluff. </SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0.25in 0in; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">Let's take a look at what the online definition of social media, I've chosen to use the definition from wikipedia since it is user generated. </SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0.25in 0in; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">Social media describes the online technologies and practices that people use to share opinions, insights, experiences, and perspectives with each other. Social media can take many different forms, including text, images, audio, and video. Popular social mediums include blogs, message boards, podcasts, wikis, and vlogs. </SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0.25in 0in; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">The definition alone should reveal to you how important it is that B2B companies explore social media marketing channels. </SPAN></P>
<P style="MARGIN: 0.25in 0in; BACKGROUND: white"><SPAN style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; FONT-SIZE: 9pt">In a recent study done by KnowledgeStorm of B2B technology decision makers the following statistics were revealed: </SPAN></P>

<P>There are some that think “social media marketing” is just the latest buzz phrase in marketing, but the truth is it is a new venue that you can use to market and promote your products and services. Social media centers around interaction with colleagues, potential customers as well as current customers.<BR>
I’ve found that when companies begin to dig into social media, they are not sure where to start. The information in this series will help you understand why social media marketing is important and how to begin to put it to work for you and your business.</P>
<P>What the heck is social media and what role does it play in my marketing? This is probably a question I wouldn’t have received two years ago, but yet today it’s the most common question that enters my inbox.<BR>
<BR>
First off, let’s talk about what social media is. Social media represents low-cost tools that are used to combine technology and social interaction with the use of words. These tools are typically internet or mobile based. A few that you have probably heard of include Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and YouTube.<BR>
Social media gives marketers a voice and a way to communicate with peers, customers and potential consumers. It personalizes the “brand” and helps you to spread your message in a relaxed and conversational way.<BR>
The downfall to social media, if you could call it that is that it must be a part of your everyday life in order to keep the momentum and attention you need for it to be successful.<BR>
If you think that social media is only for the small business owners that are trying out an experiment, I have to correct you.<BR>
</P>
<P>Success stories are abundant when it comes using social media from headhunters that find job applicants to new businesses that want to introduce a new product as well as already established Fortune 500 companies that want to strengthen their brand. The role of social media in your marketing is to use it as a communication tool that makes you accessible to those interested in your product and makes you visible to those that don’t know your product. Use it as a tool that creates a personality behind your brand and creates relationships that you otherwise may never gain. This creates not only repeat-buyers, but customer loyalty. Fact is social media is so diversified that it can be used in whatever way best suits the interest and the needs of your business.</P>
