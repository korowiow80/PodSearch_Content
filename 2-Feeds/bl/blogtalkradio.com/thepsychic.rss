She is a wife, mother of two sons and former elementary school teacher. She spent several years as a remedial reading and math teacher, working with students with learning difficulties, before deciding to explore, develop and use her healing gifts. She has traveled extensively and has lived in Pakistan, Tunisia, the former Soviet Union and Panama. Sherry believes that we can heal ourselves, but that we can also benefit from assistance in recognizing and releasing thought patterns or habits that are keeping us from moving forward in our lives. To foster self-healing, she shares suggestions with her clients to assist them in bringing their bodies back into balance. Sherry receives information from Spirit in a variety of ways. She is empathic (understands another&rsquo;s situation, feelings, and motives), clairvoyant (sees objects or events not perceived by the senses), clairsentient (feels things not normally felt by most people) and clairaudient (hears Spiritual communication outside the range of normal perception). Her intuitive skills often give her a look at the inner organs of the body and the emotional base causing the body to be out of balance.

SHEs BACK! A show you wont want to miss! Bestselling Author & Irish Mystic LORNA BYRNE Author of Angels In My Hair Lorna Byrne has been seeing and talking to angels since she was a baby. Now, having raised her family, she talks openly for the first time about what she has seen and learned. This decision led to her book Angels In My Hair, published in May 2008 which has become an international bestseller. She lives quietly in rural Ireland. For anyone who has ever wondered about the mysteries that lie beyond everyday experience, or doubted the reality of the afterlife, Angels in My Hair is a moving and deeply inspirational journey into the unseen world. For as long as she can remember, Lorna Byrne has seen angels. As a young child, she assumed everyone could see the otherworldly beings who always accompanied her. Yet in the eyes of adults, her abnormal behavior was a symptom of mental deficiency. Today, sick and troubled people from around the world are drawn to her for comfort and healing, and even theologians of different faiths seek her guidance. Lorna is trusted for her ability to communicate with spirits and angels&mdash;and by sharing her intimate knowledge of the spiritual world she offers a message of hope and love to us all. In this uplifting autobiography, a modern-day Irish mystic shares her vivid encounters and conversations with the angels and spirits she has known her entire life.

Passionate about people, Colette’s work as an intuitive and medium is to help individuals see the magic and meaning in the Story of their lives. She has brought her message of hope, healing and humor to audiences of thousands in 150 cities across North America, Europe and the UK. Her popular books and audio programs are found worldwide.

Learning and attuning can be a slow process from some, and a faster process for others. Patience is virtue, as everyone is different and manifests their abilities at different times of their journey. Patience is very important to the continued positive impact of your spiritual travels. Accepting yourself as a divine conduit and spiritual healer and messenger from God is very overwhelming at times, even when you are constantly shown signs that you are doing as you were put here to do. Some of this has to deal with one not fully accepting themselves for who they are within their spiritual soul and spirit. Listen as I share some ways on you can obtain more patience via one of my meditation techniques, and why you already accept yourself but sometimes find yourself judging yourself and how that is blocking that acceptance, and how to remove those blocks!

Listen as I share some ways on you can obtain more patience via one of my meditation techniques, and why you already accept yourself but sometimes find yourself judging yourself and how that is blocking that acceptance, and how to remove those blocks!

Learning and attuning can be a slow process from some, and a faster process for others. Patience is virtue, as everyone is different and manifests their abilities at different times of their journey. Patience is very important to the continued positive impact of your spiritual travels. Accepting yourself as a divine conduit and spiritual healer and messenger from God is very overwhelming at times, even when you are constantly shown signs that you are doing as you were put here to do.

This is the premise behind Stephane Wuttunee's DREAMING THE PYRAMID. Wuttunee reveals how the Pyramid was designed to portray human beings as they originally once were: androgenous, immortal, and omniscient. Stephane believes that the premise is simple. The Great Pyramid of Egypt, the last remaining wonder of the ancient world was designed and built to represent the greatest wonder of all - us! Is it possible that the giant structure has only just begun revealing its true nature & secrets? Could Extraterrestrials or a much more highly advanced civilization have helped design and build it? Wuttunee believes so and will share with us his visions and beliefs on this mystical topic! The author’s awakening started in 1991 at age 22. He began dreaming of humanity’s past, various mathematical symbols, and pyramid shapes similar to the ones found in Egypt. These progressed to feeling physical touches on his skin and hearing voices. Fearing he was becoming delusional, he left on a journey that involved 4,500 miles of wilderness canoeing, as well as living out of a backpack for ten years. Insights imparted by his travels and research as well as time spent with Indigenous elders from around the world. Stephane's mission is to help us remember that we are not victims trapped in a cold, uncaring Universe. Rather, we are powerful spiritual beings who long ago decided to build, along with God, a virtual environment through which our creative abilities could be explored.

When big things happen to us that threaten our journey (whether is be loss of a loved one, ending of a relationship, loss of home, job, pet, etc) one might find themselves immediately putting their spiritual gifts and spiritual journey on the backburner -- missing out on valuable learning and growth that's needed for your spiritual abilities and life mission. This is also a time when we tend to forget about ourselves altogether, and we forget to care for ourselves and give ourselves the love and appreciation that we need as spiritual beings of light to help guide our path onward. Listen as I share some messages that my Guides have given me over the years on ways of dealing with life when 'life gets in the way', and how to acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses, love yourself for who you are without any judgement and how you can appreciate yourself by just being yourself!<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/christopher-reburn/'>Christopher Reburn</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/christopher-reburn.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/christopher-reburn.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/loving-yourself-more/'>Loving Yourself More</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/loving-yourself-more.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/loving-yourself-more.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/acknowledging-your-importance/'>Acknowledging Your Importance</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/acknowledging-your-importance.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/acknowledging-your-importance.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/understanding-yourself/'>Understanding Yourself</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/understanding-yourself.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/understanding-yourself.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/focusing-on-you/'>Focusing On You</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/focusing-on-you.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/focusing-on-you.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ You've heard me use the following phrase on my show a few times: 'life gets in the way'.

Author & Animal Communicator BETHANNE ELION Author of 'Memoirs of The Bathtub Psychic: A True Story of a Clairvoyant & Her Dogs' Bethanne Elion is a gifted clairvoyant and animal communicator and has released her latest book 'Memoirs of the Bathtub Psychic: The True Story of a Clairvoyant and Her Dogs'. This book is the heartwarming true story of her relationship with her Newfoundland dogs, Sophie, Emma and Cubby. These “barking bears” teach her to trust her natural psychic ability, which leads to the discovery of her animal communication and healing gifts and skills. Afraid to acknowledge her instincts due to negative experiences as a child, a deep love for her dogs motivates Bethanne to open her mind and take unusual steps to improve their lives when they fall ill. She begins to suspect that some conventional veterinary practices, especially vaccinations, may have actually caused her pets’ serious health problems. Following her intuition and signals provided by her dogs and the Universe, she starts down the path toward holistic medicine. By opening the channel to psychic communication, Bethanne receives information about her previous incarnations and the lessons she must learn in her current lifetime. She does psychic readings for farmers and pet owners while relaxing in the bathtub, when her third eye is open and important clues for her clients’ healing are revealed. This marks Bethanne's third appearance on 'Conversations with Christopher' and she has become a featured guest of the show and makes quarterly appearances. It's always a wonderful time when Christopher & Bethanne get together! Be sure to listen in to learn more about animal communication and how to receive messages and warnings from your pets which could save your life!<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/christopher-reburn/'>Christopher Reburn</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/christopher-reburn.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/christopher-reburn.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/bethanne-elion/'>Bethanne Elion</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bethanne-elion.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bethanne-elion.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/memoirs-of-the-bathtub-psychic/'>Memoirs of The Bathtub Psychic</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/memoirs-of-the-bathtub-psychic.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/memoirs-of-the-bathtub-psychic.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/a-true-story-of-a-clairvoyant-and-her-dogs/'>A True Story of a Clairvoyant and her dogs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/a-true-story-of-a-clairvoyant-and-her-dogs.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/a-true-story-of-a-clairvoyant-and-her-dogs.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/animal-communication/'>Animal Communication</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/animal-communication.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/animal-communication.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ CALLING ALL ANIMAL LOVERS!

Bestselling Author LORNA BYRNE Author of 'Angels In My Hair' Lorna Byrne has been seeing and talking to angels since she was a baby. Now, having raised her family, she talks openly for the first time about what she has seen and learned. This decision led to her book 'Angels In My Hair', published in May 2008 which has become an international bestseller. She lives quietly in rural Ireland. For anyone who has ever wondered about the mysteries that lie beyond everyday experience, or doubted the reality of the afterlife, 'Angels in My Hair' is a moving and deeply inspirational journey into the unseen world. For as long as she can remember, Lorna Byrne has seen angels. As a young child, she assumed everyone could see the otherworldly beings who always accompanied her. Yet in the eyes of adults, her abnormal behavior was a symptom of mental deficiency. Today, sick and troubled people from around the world are drawn to her for comfort and healing, and even theologians of different faiths seek her guidance.

Bestselling Author LORNA BYRNE Author of 'Angels In My Hair' Lorna Byrne has been seeing and talking to angels since she was a baby. Now, having raised her family, she talks openly for the first time about what she has seen and learned. This decision led to her book 'Angels In My Hair', published in May 2008 which has become an international bestseller. She lives quietly in rural Ireland. For anyone who has ever wondered about the mysteries that lie beyond everyday experience, or doubted the reality of the afterlife, 'Angels in My Hair' is a moving and deeply inspirational journey into the unseen world. For as long as she can remember, Lorna Byrne has seen angels. As a young child, she assumed everyone could see the otherworldly beings who always accompanied her. Yet in the eyes of adults, her abnormal behavior was a symptom of mental deficiency. Today, sick and troubled people from around the world are drawn to her for comfort and healing, and even theologians of different faiths seek her guidance. Lorna is trusted for her ability to communicate with spirits and angels—and by sharing her intimate knowledge of the spiritual world she offers a message of hope and love to us all.

Sherry Dmytrewycz is a gifted and dedicated medical intuitive, as well as a conduit for a variety of energy healing modalities. She is a wife, mother of two sons and former elementary school teacher. She spent several years as a remedial reading and math teacher, working with students with learning difficulties, before deciding to explore, develop and use her healing gifts. She has traveled extensively and has lived in Pakistan, Tunisia, the former Soviet Union and Panama.

During this show, listen as we talk about Richard's book 'Turning Trauma Into Triumph', how you can turn your own trauma into triumph, ways to let go of the fears, the past and so much more. When Richard last appeared on 'Conversations with Christopher' in October, the whole hour flew by! What if someone told you that the most difficult period in your life may be a blessing in disguise? As a psychotherapist with 25 years of experience, Richard C. Scheinberg has candidly and succinctly summarized the spiritual and deeply personal transformation of ten people attempting to overcome the worst challenges of their lives. In this inspirational book, Scheinberg also reveals how he survived the most difficult periods in his own life. Furthermore, he conveys his personal conviction that our common strengths emanate from a source more powerful than any challenges that may come our way. ABOUT THE AUTHOR RICHARD C. SCHEINBERG is a New York State Licensed Clinical Social Worker and he is recognized nationally as a Board Certified Diplomate in clinical social work.

During this show, listen as we talk about Richard's book 'Turning Trauma Into Triumph', how you can turn your own trauma into triumph, ways to let go of the fears, the past and so much more. When Richard last appeared on 'Conversations with Christopher' in October, the whole hour flew by! What if someone told you that the most difficult period in your life may be a blessing in disguise? As a psychotherapist with 25 years of experience, Richard C. Scheinberg has candidly and succinctly summarized the spiritual and deeply personal transformation of ten people attempting to overcome the worst challenges of their lives. In this inspirational book, Scheinberg also reveals how he survived the most difficult periods in his own life. Furthermore, he conveys his personal conviction that our common strengths emanate from a source more powerful than any challenges that may come our way. ABOUT THE AUTHOR RICHARD C. SCHEINBERG is a New York State Licensed Clinical Social Worker and he is recognized nationally as a Board Certified Diplomate in clinical social work.

Listeners loved her and I'm proud to welcome her back to the show for another discussion on animal communication, great holiday gift ideas for your furry friend, animal welfare, things that every pet owner should know, communicating more with your pet, becoming more intuitive about your pet, communicating with your pet on The Other Side and so much more.

The date was June 27th, 2004. On that day they got the most devastating news any parent could ever receive, that one of their children has died. Their son, Billy was killed when his ATV he was riding at night hit a tree. He died instantly. He was found by passers by who were on their way to breakfast. About twenty feet from the road. He spent the night there because no one saw him, it was too dark. Guy wrote the book 'Signs From Our Loved Ones: Our Son Billy'. This book doesnt deal with the story of how Guy and Jo-Anne dealt with the loss of their son, but instead what happened about 10 months after the passing of their beloved son, Billy. About 10 months after Billy died, Guy began to notice he was able to take some pretty unusual pictures. Guy found out later on that he was able to take these photographs for a reason, to let everyone know that our loved ones are with us now and always. These amazing photos within the book show you the different ways that Spirits can and do appear. Billy has given Guy & Jo-Anne so many signs. The book shows you some of them.

The date was June 27th, 2004. On that day they got the most devastating news any parent could ever receive, that one of their children has died. Their son, Billy was killed when his ATV he was riding at night hit a tree. He died instantly. He was found by passers by who were on their way to breakfast. About twenty feet from the road. He spent the night there because no one saw him, it was too dark. Guy wrote the book 'Signs From Our Loved Ones: Our Son Billy'. This book doesnt deal with the story of how Guy and Jo-Anne dealt with the loss of their son, but instead what happened about 10 months after the passing of their beloved son, Billy. About 10 months after Billy died, Guy began to notice he was able to take some pretty unusual pictures. Guy found out later on that he was able to take these photographs for a reason, to let everyone know that our loved ones are with us now and always. These amazing photos within the book show you the different ways that Spirits can and do appear. Billy has given Guy & Jo-Anne so many signs. The book shows you some of them. In a very rare interview, listen as Christopher talks with Guy about this book, the orb photos and the signs that Billy still shows his parents to this day, how this has offered healing to both of them, and much more.

In his book 'Seeking Soul Mates, Spirit Guides, and Past Lives', we can discover new meaning to our lives and garner valuable insights into our experiences! With an artful blend of scientific research and heartrending narratives, this book demonstrates how we can recognize and embrace the spiritual relationships that determine our life’s path. Taking us on a journey, illustrated by his professional and personal experiences, Mr. Scheinberg offers us a fresh and intimate glimpse of the fascinating unseen world of eternal love and the enduring soul. And in so doing, he encourages and inspires us to embark on a soul searching expedition of our own. Mr. Scheinberg, a psychotherapist with twenty-eight years in private practice helping children, adults, couples, and families, is the director of Sunrise Counseling Center in Bay Shore, Long Island, New York. Founded by Mr. Scheinberg in 1993, the Center now has a staff of 24 clinical practitioners serving 1000 people each month. As Mr. Scheinberg has evolved spiritually, he has chosen to devote more time and energy to professional development that is directly associated with what one may call “the life force”. This research has included a wide range of training involving mystical and energy practices that relate to life, love, karma, and overall mind-body health. These experiences include ancient and modern forms of meditation, prayer, hypnotism, chakra clearing, psychic development, angel communication, mediumship, remote viewing, and alternative healing modalities (Reiki and Reconnective healing). This promises to be an amazingly powerful show!

She is a wife, mother of two sons and former elementary school teacher. She spent several years as a remedial reading and math teacher, working with students with learning difficulties, before deciding to explore, develop and use her healing gifts. She has traveled extensively and has lived in Pakistan, Tunisia, the former Soviet Union and Panama. Sherry believes that we can heal ourselves, but that we can also benefit from assistance in recognizing and releasing thought patterns or habits that are keeping us from moving forward in our lives. To foster self-healing, she shares suggestions with her clients to assist them in bringing their bodies back into balance. Sherry receives information from Spirit in a variety of ways. She is empathic (understands another’s situation, feelings, and motives), clairvoyant (sees objects or events not perceived by the senses), clairsentient (feels things not normally felt by most people) and clairaudient (hears Spiritual communication outside the range of normal perception). Her intuitive skills often give her a look at the inner organs of the body and the emotional base causing the body to be out of balance. With Spiritual Response Technique, she taps into the Akashik Records to clear past life issues that are affecting this lifetime. With Energy Alignment, she brings the physical body back into alignment and works on all the organs and glands. Often a particular colored symbol is combined with a frequency, herb or flower essence and energetically applied to foster the healing of specific physical disturbances, mental, emotional or spiritual issues, and energy blockages.

These “barking bears” teach her to trust her natural psychic ability, which leads to the discovery of a talent for animal communication and healing. Afraid to acknowledge her instincts due to negative experiences as a child, a deep love for her dogs motivates Bethanne to open her mind and take unusual steps to improve their lives when they fall ill. She begins to suspect that some conventional veterinary practices, especially vaccinations, may have actually caused her pets’ serious health problems. Following her intuition and signals provided by her dogs and the Universe, she starts down the path toward holistic medicine. By opening the channel to psychic communication, Bethanne receives information about her previous incarnations and the lessons she must learn in her current lifetime. An enlightening relationship develops with her spirit guide (and love from a past life), a Native American entity named Gray Wolf who offers wisdom at key moments. She does psychic readings for farmers and pet owners while relaxing in the bathtub, when her third eye is open and important clues for her clients’ healing are revealed. A compelling read for all animal lovers, this book will be of special interest to pet owners interested in holistic health, organic raw food canine nutrition, and critics of excessive vaccination.

Empathic lightworkers are amazing souls who use so much of their daily energies to help others along this difficult task we call life. Being empathic, in addition to using your psychic ability and intuition, you can help others by sensing their emotions and getting a deeper picture of their situation to better help them. Being empathic also allows us to be more sensitive to most people and situations because we can 'see' and 'sense' the full picture.

Christopher recounts some of his very first memories and experiences with his own gifts growing up -- some of which he's never spoke of until now -- and offers practical ways in helping and guiding the young and gifted, as well as highlighting some ways and exercises that can help awaken and manifest psychic and healing ability in children and young adults as they mature. We are all born psychic, but not everyone retains the full effect and strength of their gifts as they get older, Christopher shares ways to re-ignite the gifts of the younger and older generation which can restore the original incarnated strength and power of them in this very powerful audio CD project. Christopher also speaks about why children come into life so incredibly gifted, and what life is like on The Other Side for them before they are born that makes them so gifted and spiritually oriented, and much more.<BR>

Christopher recounts some of his very first memories and experiences with his own gifts growing up -- some of which he's never spoke of until now -- and offers practical ways in helping and guiding the young and gifted, as well as highlighting some ways and exercises that can help awaken and manifest psychic and healing ability in children and young adults as they mature. We are all born psychic, but not everyone retains the full effect and strength of their gifts as they get older, Christopher shares ways to re-ignite the gifts of the younger and older generation which can restore the original incarnated strength and power of them in this very powerful audio CD project. Christopher also speaks about why children come into life so incredibly gifted, and what life is like on The Other Side for them before they are born that makes them so gifted and spiritually oriented, and much more.<BR>
<BR>
