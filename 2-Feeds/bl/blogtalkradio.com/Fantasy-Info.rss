color: #336666;">Fantasy Football Regular Season Week Seventeen Notes:</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #663366;">Patriots Lose Wes Welker</span><br><br>It's
not like the Patriots had nothing to play for in this game as the
number three seed in the AFC hanged in the balance. With a Patriots'
loss and a Bengals win tonight, the Bengals would have the number three
seed in the AFC.<br><br>Unfortunately for the Patriots, their star receiver Wes Welker went
down after trying to make a cut against a defender and went straight to
the ground.<br><br>Even worse for Welker and the Patriots is that they've already received the news that Welker has a torn acl and mcl in his knee.<br><br>Now,
Welker is not only done for the season but will probably miss some time
into next season as well. This is a horrible injury to have and it's
even worse this late in the fantasy football season.<br><br>Welker is
now clearly not a top twenty five receiver and we need to see just when
he will be able to play again. Don't expect him to comeback and start
catching ten footballs a game as this injury will take time.<br><br>Expect
Welker to be his old self in 2011 but in 2010 he will probably struggle
to help fantasy owners until he gets his full strength back.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #990000;">Jamaal Charles Goes Off</span><br><br>There
is just no doubt about the fact that Jamaal Charles will be the Chiefs
starting running back heading into 2010. Not only that but it looks
like Charles has turned himself into a clear top fifteen fantasy
football running back heading into next year as well.<br><br>Charles
ran for 259 yards on the ground and two touchdowns in this game and had
strong consistent numbers all through the final games of the year.<br><br>For
the season Charles had 190 carries for 1,120 yards rushing (5.9 ypc)
and seven rushing touchdowns. Not only did Charles have strong rushing
numbers, but he had 40 receptions for 297 yards and a touchdown catch
as well.<br><br>All these numbers came in just ten starts, this season and that is why this kid has a very bright future.<br><br>The
only knocks on Charles coming into next year is if he can run well from
week one to the end of the year and if the team will use a goal line
back. In this game, the Chiefs used different running backs at times
when the team got inside the five yard line.<br><br>Beyond those
issues, this kid has a world of talent and has a chance to score on any

playoffs, and it looks like they have a chance to go all the way this
year.<br><br>As far as fantasy football goes the regular season is now
over, and, unless you plan on playing a playoff's version of fantasy
football that means your waiting until next year for your next contest.<br><br>Below
I have some observations from the 17th week of the regular season as I

color: #336666;">Fantasy Football Regular Season Week Seventeen Notes:</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #663366;">Patriots Lose Wes Welker</span><br><br>It's
not like the Patriots had nothing to play for in this game as the
number three seed in the AFC hanged in the balance. With a Patriots'
loss and a Bengals win tonight, the Bengals would have the number three
seed in the AFC.<br><br>Unfortunately for the Patriots, their star receiver Wes Welker went
down after trying to make a cut against a defender and went straight to
the ground.<br><br>Even worse for Welker and the Patriots is that they've already received the news that Welker has a torn acl and mcl in his knee.<br><br>Now,
Welker is not only done for the season but will probably miss some time
into next season as well. This is a horrible injury to have and it's
even worse this late in the fantasy football season.<br><br>Welker is
now clearly not a top twenty five receiver and we need to see just when
he will be able to play again. Don't expect him to comeback and start
catching ten footballs a game as this injury will take time.<br><br>Expect
Welker to be his old self in 2011 but in 2010 he will probably struggle
to help fantasy owners until he gets his full strength back.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #990000;">Jamaal Charles Goes Off</span><br><br>There
is just no doubt about the fact that Jamaal Charles will be the Chiefs
starting running back heading into 2010. Not only that but it looks
like Charles has turned himself into a clear top fifteen fantasy
football running back heading into next year as well.<br><br>Charles
ran for 259 yards on the ground and two touchdowns in this game and had
strong consistent numbers all through the final games of the year.<br><br>For
the season Charles had 190 carries for 1,120 yards rushing (5.9 ypc)
and seven rushing touchdowns. Not only did Charles have strong rushing
numbers, but he had 40 receptions for 297 yards and a touchdown catch
as well.<br><br>All these numbers came in just ten starts, this season and that is why this kid has a very bright future.<br><br>The
only knocks on Charles coming into next year is if he can run well from
week one to the end of the year and if the team will use a goal line
back. In this game, the Chiefs used different running backs at times
when the team got inside the five yard line.<br><br>Beyond those
issues, this kid has a world of talent and has a chance to score on any
play. It will be very interesting to see just how well this young
runner does next fantasy football season.<br><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 78%;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #333399;"><br>NFL Fantasy Football Player Rankings writer Sean E.

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">Fantasy Football Regular Season Week Ten Notes:</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 51, 102);">Rice and Peterson Dominate</span><br>
<br>
It's
time to say that Sidney Rice is the true No. 1 receiver for the Vikings
this season. The third year receiver is having a breakout season, and
today he caught seven passes for 201 yards. This now gives Rice 786
yards receiving on the season already.<br>
<br>
Start Rice every week
from here on out and expect him to help you the rest of the way. Rice
is a solid No.2 receiver for fantasy football teams going forward.<br>
<br>
Running back <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Adrian_Peterson">Adrian Peterson</a> got things going this week as he posted 133 yards rushing and two touchdowns.<br>
<br>
Fantasy owners wanted to see Peterson get his production going again as he had a slow couple weeks against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Steelers">Steelers</a> and <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Packers">Packers</a>.<br>
<br>
Look for Peterson to put up a huge second half of the season and lead teams to the fantasy football playoffs.<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"><a href="http://view.picapp.com/default.aspx?term=Adrian%20Peterson&amp;iid=7055946" target="_blank"><br>
</a></div>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Johnson goes for 100/100 Game</span><br>
<br>
In this contest <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Chris_Johnson">Chris  Johnson</a> put together another massive day as he had 132 yards rushing and 100 yards receiving.<br>
<br>
On
the ground Johnson had 26 carries for the 132 yards and rushed for two
touchdowns. In the passing game Johnson had nine receptions for 100
yards.<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"><a href="http://view.picapp.com/default.aspx?iid=7055575&amp;term=Chris%20Johnson&amp;ContributorId=3&amp;CategoryId=6" target="_blank"><br>
</a></div>
<br>
This
performance is the reason why Johnson will be the number one pick in
many fantasy football leagues next year. His production is just too
solid to ignore as he has the best skill set overall for fantasy owners.<br>
<br>
Look for Johnson to continue his strong season as he helps fantasy owners win games and take them to the playoffs.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 0, 153);">LT's Not Done Yet</span><br>
<br>
This past week I wrote a column saying <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/LaDainian_Tomlinson">LaDainian Tomlinson</a>
was washed up and done as a fantasy football running back. I considered
him to be nothing more than a flex play for the rest of the season and
I felt the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Chargers">Chargers</a> would let him go at year's end.<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"><a href="http://view.picapp.com/default.aspx?iid=7056048&amp;term=LaDainian%20Tomlinson&amp;ContributorId=3&amp;CategoryId=6" target="_blank"><br>
</a></div>
<br>
Today
Tomlinson had a much better game than we've seen from him this entire
season as he had two touchdowns and 96 yards on the ground.<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"><a href="http://view.picapp.com/default.aspx?iid=7056048&amp;term=LaDainian%20Tomlinson&amp;ContributorId=3&amp;CategoryId=6" target="_blank"><br>
</a></div>
<br>
Unless
this game marks a 180 degree turnaround for Tomlinson I would suspect
that he may have games like this from time to time. Beyond that don't
be surprised if he has some bad games as well.<br>

Look for Peterson to put up a huge second half of the season and lead teams to the fantasy football playoffs.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Johnson goes for 100/100 Game</span><br>
<br>
In this contest <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Chris_Johnson">Chris  Johnson</a> put together another massive day as he had 132 yards rushing and 100 yards receiving.<br>
<br>
On
the ground Johnson had 26 carries for the 132 yards and rushed for two
touchdowns. In the passing game Johnson had nine receptions for 100
yards.<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"><a href="http://view.picapp.com/default.aspx?iid=7055575&amp;term=Chris%20Johnson&amp;ContributorId=3&amp;CategoryId=6" target="_blank"><br>
</a></div>
<br>
This
performance is the reason why Johnson will be the number one pick in
many fantasy football leagues next year. His production is just too
solid to ignore as he has the best skill set overall for fantasy owners.<br>
<br>
Look for Johnson to continue his strong season as he helps fantasy owners win games and take them to the playoffs.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 0, 153);">LT's Not Done Yet</span><br>
<br>
This past week I wrote a column saying <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/LaDainian_Tomlinson">LaDainian Tomlinson</a>
was washed up and done as a fantasy football running back. I considered
him to be nothing more than a flex play for the rest of the season and
I felt the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Chargers">Chargers</a> would let him go at year's end.<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"><a href="http://view.picapp.com/default.aspx?iid=7056048&amp;term=LaDainian%20Tomlinson&amp;ContributorId=3&amp;CategoryId=6" target="_blank"><br>
</a></div>
<br>
Today
Tomlinson had a much better game than we've seen from him this entire
season as he had two touchdowns and 96 yards on the ground.<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"><a href="http://view.picapp.com/default.aspx?iid=7056048&amp;term=LaDainian%20Tomlinson&amp;ContributorId=3&amp;CategoryId=6" target="_blank"><br>
</a></div>
<br>
Unless
this game marks a 180 degree turnaround for Tomlinson I would suspect
that he may have games like this from time to time. Beyond that don't
be surprised if he has some bad games as well.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">Fantasy Football Regular Season Week Nine Notes:</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 204);">Failure to Launch</span><br>
<br>
The stats for <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Peyton_Manning">Peyton Manning</a> don't look that bad as he did have 50 passing attempts for 318 yards and a touchdown score.<br>
<br>
However,
Manning has lost the killer instinct that he had early in the season as
he's now only thrown one touchdown pass in that past two weeks.<br>
<br>
For the game Manning found his star tight end <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Dallas_Clark">Dallas Clark</a>
up and down the field for 14 catches and 119 yards. While this was a
great effort from Clark, fantasy owners want to see Clark stick one or
two of those into the end zone.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, the Colts will get back to their stellar play next week when the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Patriots">New England Patriots</a> come to town.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Cedric Benson Runs Hard</span><br>
<br>
This season has been a great one for fantasy football owners with <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Cedric_Benson">Cedric Benson</a> on their team(s).<br>
<br>
The
last time Benson played the Ravens, he posted the first 100 yard
rushing game against their defense in years. This time around one had
to believe that the Ravens would be ready for Benson and not allow him
to go over the century mark twice.<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"><a href="http://view.picapp.com/default.aspx?term=Cedric%20Benson&amp;iid=6999084" target="_blank"><br>
</a></div>
<br>
By
games end Benson posted 34 carries for 117 yards rushing and a
touchdown run. The Bengals road Benson for their second win against the
Ravens and their 4th win in the division.<br>
<br>
The Bengals are still atop the division as they get ready for the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Steelers">Steelers</a> next week . If they can win that game, they will have swept the Steelers and Ravens for the season.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">Randy Moss Big Down the Stretch<br>
<br>
</span>In the middle of the third quarter both teams were tied 17 all but that was until <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Tom_Brady">Tom Brady</a> found Moss.<br>
<br>
Close
to the end of the quarter Moss caught a pass and put a stiff arm on a
defender and took the play to the house. The touchdown went for 71
yards and helped the Patriots take control of the game.<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"><a href="http://view.picapp.com/default.aspx?term=Randy%20Moss&amp;iid=6998733" target="_blank"><br>
</a></div>
<br>
For the game Moss had six catches for 147 yards and the score.<br>
<br>
Next week the Patriots will go to Indianapolis and will play against he rival <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Colts">Colts</a> on Sunday night football. Get for fantasy players in for this one as it should be a great game.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">Fantasy Football Regular Season Week Nine Notes:</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 204);">Failure to Launch</span><br>
<br>
The stats for <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Peyton_Manning">Peyton Manning</a> don't look that bad as he did have 50 passing attempts for 318 yards and a touchdown score.<br>
<br>
However,
Manning has lost the killer instinct that he had early in the season as
he's now only thrown one touchdown pass in that past two weeks.<br>
<br>
For the game Manning found his star tight end <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Dallas_Clark">Dallas Clark</a>
up and down the field for 14 catches and 119 yards. While this was a
great effort from Clark, fantasy owners want to see Clark stick one or
two of those into the end zone.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, the Colts will get back to their stellar play next week when the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Patriots">New England Patriots</a> come to town.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Cedric Benson Runs Hard</span><br>
<br>
This season has been a great one for fantasy football owners with <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Cedric_Benson">Cedric Benson</a> on their team(s).<br>
<br>
The
last time Benson played the Ravens, he posted the first 100 yard
rushing game against their defense in years. This time around one had
to believe that the Ravens would be ready for Benson and not allow him
to go over the century mark twice.<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"><a href="http://view.picapp.com/default.aspx?term=Cedric%20Benson&amp;iid=6999084" target="_blank"><br>
</a></div>
<br>
By
games end Benson posted 34 carries for 117 yards rushing and a
touchdown run. The Bengals road Benson for their second win against the
Ravens and their 4th win in the division.<br>
<br>
The Bengals are still atop the division as they get ready for the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Steelers">Steelers</a> next week . If they can win that game, they will have swept the Steelers and Ravens for the season.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">Randy Moss Big Down the Stretch<br>
<br>
</span>In the middle of the third quarter both teams were tied 17 all but that was until <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Tom_Brady">Tom Brady</a> found Moss.<br>
<br>
Close
to the end of the quarter Moss caught a pass and put a stiff arm on a
defender and took the play to the house. The touchdown went for 71
yards and helped the Patriots take control of the game.<br>
<div style="float: right; margin-left: 5px;"><a href="http://view.picapp.com/default.aspx?term=Randy%20Moss&amp;iid=6998733" target="_blank"><br>
</a></div>
<br>
For the game Moss had six catches for 147 yards and the score.<br>
<br>
Next week the Patriots will go to Indianapolis and will play against he rival <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Colts">Colts</a> on Sunday night football. Get for fantasy players in for this one as it should be a great game.<br>

This week brings us a new bunch of players that are hot on the waiver wire as injuries are mounting up around the league.<br>
<br>
Waivers
for the next seven weeks are going to be vitally important to most
fantasy owners as they will have all their key players out on bye weeks
at different times. This week the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Cardinals">Cardinals</a>, <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Falcons">Falcons</a>, <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Eagles">Eagles</a> and <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Panthers">Panthers</a> are all off so you will need to rely on your depth to win.<br>
<br>
Below
we have the top players you might want to pay attention to, for waiver
pickups. Even if you don't select a waiver (or have already done so)
it's good to keep these names in mind for the future weeks.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 153, 153);">Dolphins- Chad Henne- Bye Week 6</span><br>
<br>
Ok,
Chad Henne has not proven a darn thing in this league yet, and he may
not be all that great in the end. However, if your desperate for a
starting quarterback this week ( if you have <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Kurt_Warner">Kurt Warner</a>, Eagles quarterback, or <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Matt_Ryan">Matt Ryan</a>) you could do worse with no quarterback.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Ted_Ginn_Jr">Ted Ginn Jr</a>
tore up the Bills' defense last year at home, and maybe he will do it
again. In the end, Henne is a starting quarterback, and he should give
you some points while your starter is out.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Browns- Derek Anderson- Bye Week 9</span><br>
<br>
It's getting to that point in time that <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Derek_Anderson">Derek Anderson</a> will probably see his opportunity to start once again. The <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Browns">Browns</a> pulled <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Brady_Quinn">Brady Quinn</a> out of last weeks game and outside of Anderson's interceptions, the coaching staff liked what they saw.<br>
<br>
Quinn may get another chance to prove himself this week against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Browns">Bengals</a>, but if he should falter in the first half, Anderson will get the call.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">49ers- Glen Coffee- Bye Week 6</span><br>
<br>
With <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Frank_Gore">Frank Gore</a> out the next two games, rookie runner <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Glen_Coffee">Glen Coffee</a> makes for an excellent waiver pick up this week. This weekend the<a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*49ers"> 49ers</a> play at home against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Rams">Rams</a> and one would have to figure Coffee will have a solid day.<br>
<br>
What
I like most about Coffee is that the 49ers coaching staff is committed
to using him as a feature runner. Last week against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Vikings">Vikings</a>, Coffee had 22 carries. Look for Coffee to have a fine day for your fantasy football team this week.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 153);">Cowboys- Tashard Choice- Bye Week  6</span><br>
<br>
If for some reason, <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Tashard_Choice">Tashard Choice </a>is still on your waiver wire you should strongly consider picking him up. <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Marion_Barber">Marion Barber's</a> status for this week is up in the air and <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Felix_Jones">Felix Jones</a> is out for the next three weeks with a knee injury.<br>
<br>
If Choice should get the start he will be a fine play against, the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Broncos">Broncos</a> defense.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 153, 0);">Steelers- Rashard Mendenhall- Bye Week 8</span><br>
<br>
Today the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Steelers">Steelers</a> announced that <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Willie_Parker">Willie Parker</a> has a turf toe injury. At this point in time, the team is saying he could still play this week against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Chargers">Chargers</a>. If the team is smart they will hold him out as this injury usually makes runners ineffective.<br>
<br>
If a player does not rest on this injury it can bother them for the rest of their career (Hello <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/LaDainian_Tomlinson">LaDainian Tomlinson</a>). Look for <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Rashard_Mendenhall">Rashard Mendenhall</a> to get the bulk of work in the Steelers offense this weekend.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 153, 153);">Jaguars- Mike Sims-Walker- Bye Week 7</span><br>
<br>
You might have heard of <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Mike%20Sims-Walker">Mike Sims-Walker</a>
before when he didn't have the Sims attached to his name. In August,
Walker changed his name to Sims-Walker in honor of his father passing
away from colon cancer last December.<br>
<br>
Every week Walker is becoming <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/David_Garrard">David Garrard's</a>
go to guy in the passing game. In the past two weeks Walker has had 12
catches for 187 yards and a touchdown. Look for Walker to continue his
strong play in the offense as he is now a starter.<br>
<br>
This week
Walker should continue his success against the Titans poor pass defense
(feels weird saying that) and should catch at least another 5 balls.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Titans Nate Washington- Bye Week 7<br>
<br>
</span><a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Nate_Washington">Nate Washington</a>
was slowed up by a hamstring injury week one but has since come back
and scored each of the last two weeks. Look for Washington to continue
being a factor in the Titans' offense as he is their new <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Derrick_Mason">Derrick Mason</a>.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Panthers- Daunte Rosario- Bye Week 4</span><br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Panthers">Panthers</a>
are finally waking up and getting the football to their receiving tight
end Daunte Rosario. In the last two games Rosario has had three catches
and a touchdown and Jake Delhomme looks comfortable throwing the ball
his way.<br>
<br>
Carolina is desperate for someone other than Steve
Smtih to step up and help in the passing game and Rosario looks like a
good fit.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, Rosario is on a bye week this week but all that means is that you can pick him up within the next two weeks.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">49ers- 49ers Defense/ Special Teams- Bye Week 6</span><br>
<br>
It's
time to give the 49ers defense it's do as the team looks like a
contender this season. Right now the 49ers are leading the NFC Western
division and Mike Singletary has his defense playing some inspiring
football.<br>
<br>
This defense may always be a risk when they go on the
road against a good team but this week they play at home against the
Rams. This is a great week to have the 49ers in a pinch.<br>

This week brings us a new bunch of players that are hot on the waiver wire as injuries are mounting up around the league.<br>
<br>
Waivers
for the next seven weeks are going to be vitally important to most
fantasy owners as they will have all their key players out on bye weeks
at different times. This week the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Cardinals">Cardinals</a>, <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Falcons">Falcons</a>, <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Eagles">Eagles</a> and <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Panthers">Panthers</a> are all off so you will need to rely on your depth to win.<br>
<br>
Below
we have the top players you might want to pay attention to, for waiver
pickups. Even if you don't select a waiver (or have already done so)
it's good to keep these names in mind for the future weeks.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 153, 153);">Dolphins- Chad Henne- Bye Week 6</span><br>
<br>
Ok,
Chad Henne has not proven a darn thing in this league yet, and he may
not be all that great in the end. However, if your desperate for a
starting quarterback this week ( if you have <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Kurt_Warner">Kurt Warner</a>, Eagles quarterback, or <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Matt_Ryan">Matt Ryan</a>) you could do worse with no quarterback.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Ted_Ginn_Jr">Ted Ginn Jr</a>
tore up the Bills' defense last year at home, and maybe he will do it
again. In the end, Henne is a starting quarterback, and he should give
you some points while your starter is out.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Browns- Derek Anderson- Bye Week 9</span><br>
<br>
It's getting to that point in time that <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Derek_Anderson">Derek Anderson</a> will probably see his opportunity to start once again. The <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Browns">Browns</a> pulled <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Brady_Quinn">Brady Quinn</a> out of last weeks game and outside of Anderson's interceptions, the coaching staff liked what they saw.<br>
<br>
Quinn may get another chance to prove himself this week against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Browns">Bengals</a>, but if he should falter in the first half, Anderson will get the call.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">49ers- Glen Coffee- Bye Week 6</span><br>
<br>

fighting it out in hot weather conditions. This week we saw some wild
games and some defense break down bad against the run.<br>
<br>
If teams
are playing like this in September, what will happen if the league goes
to 18 regular season games and the season starts in August?<br>
<br>
Below
I have some observations from the second week of the regular season and
how I see those points of interest playing out from a fantasy
perspective.<br>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 102, 102);">Fantasy Football Regular Season Week Two Notes:</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 153);">Peyton Manning Steals a Win</span><br>
<br>
Manning started the game off with a bang as he found his tight end <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Dallas_Clark">Dallas Clark</a> for an 80 yard touchdown pass to start the game. For the night Manning had two touchdowns and 303 yards on only 14 completions.<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Colts">Colts </a>were on the sidelines for most of the game as the Dolphins pounded out the yardage on the ground.<br>
<br>
On
the Colts last drive of the game Manning threw a quick pass to second
year receiver Pierre Garcon, and he took it the distance for a 48 yard
touchdown catch.<br>
<br>
It looks like Garcon is very capable of filling <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Anthony_Gonzalez">Anthony Gonzalez's</a> shoe for now so this is a great sign for Manning's fantasy value.<br>
<br>
Look for Garcon as a nice fantasy waiver pickup this week.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Matt Schaub Saves the Day</span><br>
<br>
I
picked the Texans to make it into the playoffs as a wild card this
offseason. If they were, in fact, finally going to get to the post
season, they needed to win this game. Last week the Texans were
embarrassed at home against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Jets">Jets</a> and this week started out no better.<br>
<br>
It did not seem to matter how many big touchdowns the Titans had, as Matt Schaub kept leading his team to touchdowns.<br>
<br>
The Titans were obsessed with stopping running back <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Steve_Slaton">Steve Slaton</a>
as he had two 100 yard rushing days against them last year. Seeing that
Slaton was the only runner to have a 100 yard rushing day against them
last year, it was understandable that they wanted to stop him.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately,
to stop Slaton meant leaving themselves susceptible to the big play
down the field. Because of this, Andre Johnson and Jacoby Jones had
huge days.<br>
<br>
Look for Slaton to get his year on track against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Jaguars">Jaguars</a> suspect defense next week.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Frank Gore Runs Wild</span><br>
<br>
Some doubted if <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Frank_Gore">Frank Gore</a>
could ever return to his great numbers he posted back in 2006. In this
game, he showed the fantasy football world that he is still a very good
fantasy running back.<br>
<br>
In the first half, he busted a 79 yard
touchdowns and in the second half he had an 80 yard touchdown. These
two runs single handedly beat the Seahawks.<br>
<br>
Now, it would be
nice to see the 49ers do a better job in the passing game. If they can
have a respectable passing attack than Gore may be one of the top five
fantasy players for 2009.<br>
<br>
Only time will tell if that can happen but for now, Gore is off to a great start.<br>

Strength of Schedule</span><br>
<br>
vs Run <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/2009/08/2009-nfl-strength-of-schedule-vs-run.html">7th Easiest Schedule</a><br>
<br>

<br>
vs Points Given Up <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/2009/08/2009-nfl-strength-of-schedule-vs-points.html">14th Easiest Schedule</a><br>
<br>
This
season should be one of spreading the ball around to multiple players
in the running game and the passing game. The main reason for this is
because the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Steelers">Steelers</a>
have good capable depth in both categories and it would be wise to keep
their players fresh and make defenses think twice about players like <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Rashard_Mendenhall">Rashard Mendenhall</a> or <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Limas_Sweed">Limas Sweed</a>.<br>
<br>
On paper the Steelers have a good schedule to take advantage of but
because they are the super bowl champs every team will give them a
little extra in every week. If <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Ben_Roethlisberger">Ben Roethlisberger</a> can stay healthy than this team should have success once again.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"></span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Arizona Cardinals: Games of Interest </span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fantasy Playoffs weeks 14 - 16 <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*49ers">49ers</a>, </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Lions">Lions</a><span style="font-weight: bold;">, <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Rams">Rams</a>:</span> It's hard to ask for a better schedule for a team to have in the fantasy football playoffs than the one the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Cardinals">Cardinals</a>
will have this year. All three of the teams they will face could very
well be waiting till next year as they are losing franchises.<br>
<br>
Unlike last season when the Cardinals spent their time with the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Patriots">Patriots</a> and <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Vikings">Vikings</a>
in the fantasy playoffs, this season they have a chance to do some real
damage to help you win a fantasy title. Look for Arizona players to be
solid producers in your run for a championship as they should win the
division with these games.<br>
<br>
It will be interesting to see if rookie running back <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Chris%20%22Beanie%22%20Wells">Chris "Beanie" Wells</a>
will take over around this time of the season as the Cardinals feature
running back. If he does you will most definitely want him on your team
just for this stretch run.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">San Diego Chargers: 2009 Football Projection</span><br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Chargers">Chargers</a>
may not win 12 games this season but they should coast to a division
championship with a 10 win season. However if San Diego is serious
about winning a championship this year they will need home field
advantage and to get that they will need at least 13 wins this season.<br>
<br>
In
the end I believe the Chargers will win the division but they probably
play too many competitive teams to take home field this year. Look for
the Chargers to have another good year and come up short in the
playoffs.<br>

<br>
This
season should be one of spreading the ball around to multiple players
in the running game and the passing game. The main reason for this is
because the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Steelers">Steelers</a>
have good capable depth in both categories and it would be wise to keep
their players fresh and make defenses think twice about players like <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Rashard_Mendenhall">Rashard Mendenhall</a> or <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Limas_Sweed">Limas Sweed</a>.<br>
<br>
On paper the Steelers have a good schedule to take advantage of but
because they are the super bowl champs every team will give them a
little extra in every week. If <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Ben_Roethlisberger">Ben Roethlisberger</a> can stay healthy than this team should have success once again.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"></span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Arizona Cardinals: Games of Interest </span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fantasy Playoffs weeks 14 - 16 <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*49ers">49ers</a>, </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Lions">Lions</a><span style="font-weight: bold;">, <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Rams">Rams</a>:</span> It's hard to ask for a better schedule for a team to have in the fantasy football playoffs than the one the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Cardinals">Cardinals</a>
will have this year. All three of the teams they will face could very
well be waiting till next year as they are losing franchises.<br>
<br>
Unlike last season when the Cardinals spent their time with the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Patriots">Patriots</a> and <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Vikings">Vikings</a>
in the fantasy playoffs, this season they have a chance to do some real
damage to help you win a fantasy title. Look for Arizona players to be
solid producers in your run for a championship as they should win the
division with these games.<br>
<br>
It will be interesting to see if rookie running back <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Chris%20%22Beanie%22%20Wells">Chris "Beanie" Wells</a>
will take over around this time of the season as the Cardinals feature
running back. If he does you will most definitely want him on your team
just for this stretch run.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">San Diego Chargers: 2009 Football Projection</span><br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Chargers">Chargers</a>
may not win 12 games this season but they should coast to a division
championship with a 10 win season. However if San Diego is serious
about winning a championship this year they will need home field
advantage and to get that they will need at least 13 wins this season.<br>
<br>
In
the end I believe the Chargers will win the division but they probably
play too many competitive teams to take home field this year. Look for
the Chargers to have another good year and come up short in the
playoffs.<br>

what we might come to expect in the real season. While it is just
preseason and you can only take so much from it, there are always
interesting points of information that we can come away with.<br>
<br>
Probably the most disappointing part of this week for me was that <strong><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/LaDainian+Tomlinson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking" target="_self"><strong>LaDainian Tomlinson</strong></a></strong> did not play against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Falcons">Falcons</a>. I was hoping to see LT show that he had the burst of speed to hit the hole and make big plays this preseason.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately
we did see that explosion as he was clogged up at the line of scrimmage
or he stumbled when he did have a chance for a nice play. While Norv
Turner said he did not hold Tomlinson out because of an injury but he
did note that he was concerned about LT playing on the turf.<br>
<br>
Watching how LT ran the ball in the first two games of the preseason
and the fact that he was held out this week makes me believe his turf
toe from a season ago is still a problem. This is not a surprise as
players that have this injury and play on it can have lingering
problems for years.<br>
<br>
Just look at Deon Sanders with the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Cowboys">Cowboys</a>, he had the injury and it took him a few years to get right.<br>
<br>
Below
I have some interesting observations from the third week of preseason
and how I see those points of interest playing out from a fantasy
perspective.<br>
<br>

<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 0, 153);">Cutler Struggles Early</span><br>
<br>
The boo's were loud and the camera's were shaky as the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Broncos">Broncos</a> fans wanted to let <strong><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Jay+Cutler+Fantasy+Football+Ranking" target="_self"><strong>Jay Cutler</strong></a> </strong>know
how they felt about his trade demand. Early in the game you could tell
that the crowd noise had an effect on the Bears offense as they were
stalled on the first couple drives.<br>
<br>
As the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Bears">Bears</a> offense settled down Jay lead the team down for 17 first half points that was capped off by a touchdown pass to <strong><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Matt+Forte%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking" target="_self"><strong>Matt Forte</strong></a></strong>.<br>
<br>
In the end Cutler did a good job and the Bears look like a good team as we get set for the regular season in a couple of weeks.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">Ray Rice has Eight Catches</span><br>
<br>
Last week starting running back <strong><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Ray+Rice%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking" target="_self"><strong>Ray Rice</strong></a></strong> scored a touchdown at the goal line and fantasy writers went crazy as it looked like Ray might be the goal line man in <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Ravens">Baltimore</a>.
For my money I was happy to see that Ray did receive an opportunity to
score and did convert on the play but I never believe he would be the
only runner to get touches in that area.<br>
<br>
This week Ray flashed
off his receiving skills as he had eight catches for 67 yards
receiving. This will probably make PPR fantasy players giddy about what
this guy can do in their scoring structure.<br>
<br>
In the end I believe Rice will run some and will catch some and will
even get opportunities to score during the season. The question really
is can Ray put the total package together and be a every week producer
this season.<br>
<br>
At this point I still think Ray isn't worth a
starting spot even in PPR leagues because their are still to many hands
in the pot running the ball.<br>
<br>
<strong><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Willis+McGahee%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking" target="_self"><strong>Willis   McGahee</strong></a></strong> had another touchdown today and you can't forget about <strong><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/LeRon+McClain%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking" target="_self">Le'Ron McClain</a></strong> and his abilities in this offense as well.<br>
<br>
Right now Rice is a good early backup player for your team but not a starter to begin the season.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Rivers is Coming Into His Own</span><br>
<br>
This may seem like another preseason game but it's really a game in which we saw a preview of what the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Chargers">Chargers </a>would
be like if they should lose LT for any stretch of time. In this preview
what fantasy owners and football fans can come away with is that this
is Philip's team and he has a lot of weapons to have success.<br>
<br>
The model of this passing game is very simple and that is to attack
down the field with aggressiveness throughout the game and than dump
the ball off to your running backs underneath.<br>
<br>
Once you make the
secondary respect the deep routes it opens up opportunities like we saw
tonight for running back Michael Bennett whom had a 52 yards touchdown
catch and run. The play was just a dump off on a 3rd and about 24 yards
to go but Bennett made a few shifty moves and took it to the house.<br>
<br>
Oh and by the way Rivers also has this tight end guy named <strong><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Antonio+Gates+Fantasy+Football+Ranking" target="_self"><strong>Antonio Gates</strong></a></strong> and he's not all that shabby over the middle and in the red zone for touchdowns as well.<br>

what we might come to expect in the real season. While it is just
preseason and you can only take so much from it, there are always
interesting points of information that we can come away with.<br>
<br>
Probably the most disappointing part of this week for me was that <strong><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/LaDainian+Tomlinson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking" target="_self"><strong>LaDainian Tomlinson</strong></a></strong> did not play against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Falcons">Falcons</a>. I was hoping to see LT show that he had the burst of speed to hit the hole and make big plays this preseason.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately
we did see that explosion as he was clogged up at the line of scrimmage
or he stumbled when he did have a chance for a nice play. While Norv
Turner said he did not hold Tomlinson out because of an injury but he
did note that he was concerned about LT playing on the turf.<br>
<br>
Watching how LT ran the ball in the first two games of the preseason
and the fact that he was held out this week makes me believe his turf
toe from a season ago is still a problem. This is not a surprise as
players that have this injury and play on it can have lingering
problems for years.<br>
<br>
Just look at Deon Sanders with the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Cowboys">Cowboys</a>, he had the injury and it took him a few years to get right.<br>
<br>
Below
I have some interesting observations from the third week of preseason
and how I see those points of interest playing out from a fantasy
perspective.<br>

<br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 0, 153);">Cutler Struggles Early</span><br>
<br>
The boo's were loud and the camera's were shaky as the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Broncos">Broncos</a> fans wanted to let <strong><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Jay+Cutler+Fantasy+Football+Ranking" target="_self"><strong>Jay Cutler</strong></a> </strong>know
how they felt about his trade demand. Early in the game you could tell
that the crowd noise had an effect on the Bears offense as they were
stalled on the first couple drives.<br>
<br>
As the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Bears">Bears</a> offense settled down Jay lead the team down for 17 first half points that was capped off by a touchdown pass to <strong><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Matt+Forte%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking" target="_self"><strong>Matt Forte</strong></a></strong>.<br>
<br>
In the end Cutler did a good job and the Bears look like a good team as we get set for the regular season in a couple of weeks.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">Ray Rice has Eight Catches</span><br>
<br>
Last week starting running back <strong><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Ray+Rice%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking" target="_self"><strong>Ray Rice</strong></a></strong> scored a touchdown at the goal line and fantasy writers went crazy as it looked like Ray might be the goal line man in <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Ravens">Baltimore</a>.
For my money I was happy to see that Ray did receive an opportunity to
score and did convert on the play but I never believe he would be the
only runner to get touches in that area.<br>
<br>
This week Ray flashed
off his receiving skills as he had eight catches for 67 yards
receiving. This will probably make PPR fantasy players giddy about what
this guy can do in their scoring structure.<br>
<br>
In the end I believe Rice will run some and will catch some and will
even get opportunities to score during the season. The question really
is can Ray put the total package together and be a every week producer
this season.<br>
<br>
At this point I still think Ray isn't worth a
starting spot even in PPR leagues because their are still to many hands
in the pot running the ball.<br>
<br>
<strong><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Willis+McGahee%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking" target="_self"><strong>Willis   McGahee</strong></a></strong> had another touchdown today and you can't forget about <strong><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/LeRon+McClain%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking" target="_self">Le'Ron McClain</a></strong> and his abilities in this offense as well.<br>
<br>
Right now Rice is a good early backup player for your team but not a starter to begin the season.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Rivers is Coming Into His Own</span><br>
<br>
This may seem like another preseason game but it's really a game in which we saw a preview of what the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Chargers">Chargers </a>would
be like if they should lose LT for any stretch of time. In this preview
what fantasy owners and football fans can come away with is that this
is Philip's team and he has a lot of weapons to have success.<br>
<br>
The model of this passing game is very simple and that is to attack
down the field with aggressiveness throughout the game and than dump
the ball off to your running backs underneath.<br>
<br>
Once you make the
secondary respect the deep routes it opens up opportunities like we saw
tonight for running back Michael Bennett whom had a 52 yards touchdown
catch and run. The play was just a dump off on a 3rd and about 24 yards
to go but Bennett made a few shifty moves and took it to the house.<br>
<br>
Oh and by the way Rivers also has this tight end guy named <strong><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Antonio+Gates+Fantasy+Football+Ranking" target="_self"><strong>Antonio Gates</strong></a></strong> and he's not all that shabby over the middle and in the red zone for touchdowns as well.<br>

until the middle of the second quarter. Next week many teams will have
their starters play for at least the entire first half and some will
come out to start the third quarter.<br>
<br>
This week marked the return of<a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Brett_Favre"> Brett Favre</a>
as he traded in his traditional green jersey for a purple one. For all
the glitz and glamor of Favre's return we were treated to a measly one
completion for four yards passing. Lets hope Brett puts on a better
show next week on Monday Night against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Texans">Texans</a> defense.<br>
<br>

Fantasy Football Week One Preseason Notes:</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 153, 153);">Matt Hasselbeck Looks Sharpe<br>
<br>
</span>Last week we learned that <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Matt_Hasselbeck">Matt Hasselbeck's</a>
left tackle Walter Jones had to have another knee surgery and is now
out indefinitely. Despite the bad news Matt went out on Saturday and
torched the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Broncos">Broncos</a> secondary for 171 yards and 2 touchdowns.<br>
<br>
After
this performance I was very pleased to see him play well with his best
lineman out of the game. Unfortunately for Matt his center Chris
Spencer was hurt during the game and now will miss time into the season.<br>
<br>
With
two lineman down it's becoming harder to consider Matt as a starting
quarterback in 12 team leagues this year in fantasy football.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">The Colts Offense is Just Fine</span><br>
<br>
Last week <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Peyton_Manning">Peyton Manning</a> was sacked three times in the one series he played against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Vikings">Vikings</a> defense in Minnesota. This week was a different story as Manning was 10 of 14 passing for 167 yards and two touchdowns passes.<br>
<br>
The first one was a nice fade pattern throw to third year receiver <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Anthony+Gonzalez+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Anthony Gonzalez</a>
in the corner of the end zone. On Manning's final throw on the night he
light the stadium on fire with a 76 yard touchdown pass to <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Reggie+Wayne%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Reggie Wayne</a>.<br>
<br>
This year you can tell that Peyton is now fully recovered from his knee
problem that cost him all of preseason a year ago. In the regular
season he just didn't look like the same confident quarterback (still
won the MVP) as the team got off to a poor start to begin the season.<br>
<br>
Look for Manning and the boys to have a very productive year as they now have an offensive minded head coach.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 153, 153);">Troy Williamson is Back from the Dead</span><br>
<br>
South Carolina receiving product <a href="http://www.nfl.com/players/profile?id=00-0023442">Troy Williamson</a>
was a high first round pick by the Vikings a few years back. When he
was drafted the book in him was that he was very fast and talented but
was an extremely raw talent. It was understood that it may take a few
seasons for this young stud to figure out how to be a successful
receiver at this level of competition.<br>
<br>
Troy made some highlight plays in his three years with the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Vikings">Vikings</a>
but was not close to delivering on his talent at this level. Williamson
is now in his 5th season in the league he has an opportunity to play
with a solid No.1 receiver in <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Torry+Holt%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Torry Holt</a>.
With a receiver like Torry on the field Williamson will consistently
see lesser coverage and will have opportunity's to flash his promising
skills.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Mike_Walker">Mike Walker</a>
was thought to be the No.2 starter early in camp but he has been
decimated by injuries in his career and is hurt again as he has a lower
leg problem.<br>
<br>
Last week Williamson was one of the few players to
have a good week and in the first drive of this game he had a 74 yard
touchdown. Troy finished the night with an impressive three catches for
147 yards and the big touchdown.<br>
<br>
If Williamson officially wins a
starting job he will make for a very nice sleeper pick in the late
rounds of 10 and 12 team fantasy football leagues.<br>

until the middle of the second quarter. Next week many teams will have
their starters play for at least the entire first half and some will
come out to start the third quarter.<br>
<br>
This week marked the return of<a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Brett_Favre"> Brett Favre</a>
as he traded in his traditional green jersey for a purple one. For all
the glitz and glamor of Favre's return we were treated to a measly one
completion for four yards passing. Lets hope Brett puts on a better
show next week on Monday Night against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Texans">Texans</a> defense.<br>
<br>
This weekend we also got to see running backs like <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/DeAngelo_Williams">DeAngelo Williams</a> and <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Matt_Forte">Matt Forte</a> bust off explosive touchdown runs against respectable defenses. It's always nice to see a running back like <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Michael_Turner">Michael Turner</a> do well against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Rams">Rams</a> but it means a little more when you do it against the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Dolphins">Dolphins</a> or <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Giants">Giants</a>.<br>

<br>
</span>Well
sort of as it is still preseason and the real games don't start until
around mid September. Even though it is preseason it's always neat to
see a football game actually being played after the long layoff since
February.<br>
<br>
No matter how preseason shakes out the only way players like <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Adrian+Peterson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Adrian Peterson</a>
are going to lose their respective fantasy football ranking is if they
go down with an injury. While those things can happen to star fantasy
players, what I like watching is all those players we need to "see"
something from in order to rank them higher on our drafts.<br>
<br>
Other
points of interest are the classic quarterback battles that go on every
year at this time like who will start in Cleveland for the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Browns">Browns</a>.<br>
<br>
Below
I have some interesting observations from the first week of preseason
and how I see those points of interest playing out from a fantasy
perspective.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Tom Brady and LaDainian Tomlinson work in Preseason<br>
<br>
</span>One of the interesting trends we have seen this year as opposed to years past is high profile stars like <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Tom+Brady%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Tom Brady</a> and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/LaDainian+Tomlinson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">LaDainian Tomlinson</a>
playing in the preseason. The main reason for their playing these games
is that they want to get their timing down before the season begins.<br>
<br>
As long as both of these players show no ill effects after playing in these games it will no doubt up their <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/">fantasy football rankings</a> before we get to the start of the season.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Brady Quinn distances himself from Derek Anderson</span><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><br>
</div>
This was an interesting one as <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Brady+Quinn%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Brady Quinn</a>
started the game and went 3 of 5 passing for 27 yards as he lead the
team down for a field goal try (Phil Dawson missed it). Then we saw <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Derek+Anderson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Rankings">Derek Anderson</a> come in and he played two series that may have been his undoing in Cleveland.<br>
<br>
In that time he was 0 for 2 passing and threw and interception, this
was so bad that new head coach Eric Mangini pulled Derek from the game
and put Quinn back in.<br>
<div style="text-align: right;"><br>
</div>
Brady proceeded to drive the team down the field and should of thrown a touchdown pass but <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Braylon+Edwards+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Braylon Edwards</a>
and his hands of stone dropped the ball. Then on the next play Quinn
threw and interception as he tried to force the ball into Edwards for a
touchdown again.<br>
<br>
On the night Quinn was 7 of 11 passing for 68 yards and an interception.<br>
<br>
Right now Brady is going to be the starting quarterback if Anderson can't turn things around and turn it around fast.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Robbie Gould and Rian Lindell should have good years</span><br>
<br>
When
an team has a new quarterback and growing receivers or a team is
learning a new offense, the last part of passing success that comes is
the touchdowns.<br>
<br>
Since bot the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Bears">Bears </a>and <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Bills">Bills</a> offenses have talent and can move the football, look for their kickers <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Robbie+Gould%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Robbie Gould</a>
(Bears) and Rian Lindell (Bills) to have solid seasons this year as
both offense still need to get better at converting drives into
touchdowns.<br>

2009 Strength of Schedule for NFL Team for Win/Loss Record<br>

Strength of Schedule vs Run</a><br>
<br>

<br>
<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/2009/08/2009-nfl-strength-of-schedule-vs-points.html">Strength of Schedule vs Points Given Up</a><br>
<br>
I
usually don't place much stock into a teams strength of schedule when
it comes to the win/loss percentage of the teams they face. Most of all
strength of schedule is heavily based on how good of a season the teams
in your division had.<br>
<br>
To me it is more important to pay
attention to the teams strength of schedule against the run, pass and
point against. Going further then that fantasy football owners need to
pay attention to the schedule for each team and see what team they face
in week 17. If your in a league that doesn't play that week it would
mean a team has an easier schedule or a harder one because of missing
that game.<br>
<br>
Most talk show people would never make a point of not
including that week just because they are not looking at the schedule
from a fantasy football perspective.<br>
<br>
With all that being said I
have taken the time to write down a few interesting things I noticed
from the win/losses perspective of strength of schedule. Listed below
are some notables that I have on different teams and why those teams
are going to either struggle or succeed in 2009.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 0, 204);">Surprise, Surprise the Vikings, Packers and Bears have the easiest schedules</span><br>
<br>
This
one is not that surprising when you consider that they are in a
division that has a team that didn't win a game for the year in the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Lions">Lions</a>.
Any time you get to face two games in your schedule that has a team
that went 0-16 your going to have a easier schedule then the rest.<br>
<br>
One thing that fantasy owners need to keep in mind is that while the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Bears">Bears</a>
do have the easiest schedule in football, they play one of their games
against the Lions in week 17. Many fantasy football leagues don't play
the last week of the season because so many team rest their stars
players for the playoffs.<br>
<br>
With the Bears only facing the Lions
one time on the fantasy schedule this will make their schedule in
fantasy a little harder then it actually is.<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Vikings">Vikings</a> and <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Packers">Packers</a> however will get to face the lonely Lions twice in fantasy football and this will keep stars like <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Adrian+Peterson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Adrian Peterson</a> in line for fine seasons this up coming year.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 153, 153);"><br>
The Dolphins have the Hardest Schedule for Football</span><br>
<br>
This
is a little concerning as this team does have the hardest win/loss
record to face in football and they have the hardest schedule in points
against. One positive for this team is that they to get to play the
hardest team on their fantasy schedule in week 17.<br>
<br>
That week they face the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Steelers">Steelers</a>
and this situation is a complete reverse of what the Bears will get as
this will help their schedule be a bit easier with this news.<br>

The <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Vikings">Vikings</a> and <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Packers">Packers</a> however will get to face the lonely Lions twice in fantasy football and this will keep stars like <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Adrian+Peterson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Adrian Peterson</a> in line for fine seasons this up coming year.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 153, 153);"><br>
The Dolphins have the Hardest Schedule for Football</span><br>
<br>
This
is a little concerning as this team does have the hardest win/loss
record to face in football and they have the hardest schedule in points
against. One positive for this team is that they to get to play the
hardest team on their fantasy schedule in week 17.<br>
<br>
That week they face the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Steelers">Steelers</a>
and this situation is a complete reverse of what the Bears will get as
this will help their schedule be a bit easier with this news.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fantasy Football Information for our August Auction Mock Draft<br>
<br>
</span>It never ceases to amaze me that many times in online auction mock
drafts you can see some of the early players go so high. In this
auction draft I decided to play along in the beginning (my team is team
1) and be like so many that over draft.<br>
<br>
While I didn't go crazy and draft <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Michael+Turner%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Michael Turner</a>
for 69 dollars, I did do more then I would normally choose to spend in
a usual draft. If you want to draft one big runner at the top of the
auction that's not to bad. But some teams (maybe it's just because it's
a mock) like to go out and spend 180 of their 200 dollars on three or
four guys early in the draft.<br>
<br>
That to me is just suicide and I
never see that in an experienced auction draft league. Most fantasy
owners understand that it is better to have a well rounded team for the
season then to just have a few guys to depend on all year.<br>
<br>
Never
the less it is not easy to always get a bunch of friends together
online (let alone at a house or pizza parlor) just to have an auction
mock draft, so this is the best we can do.<br>
<br>
Below I have a few observations from what I found interesting at the auction mock draft.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">Auction Mock Draft Price 69 Dollars: Michael Turner</span><br>
<br>
You
have to love auction drafts because only in a situation like this can
you find anyone that has Michael Turner as the highest priced player in
the mock draft. To be honest this is the first auction mock draft I've
done that I've seen anyone go higher then <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Adrian+Peterson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Adrian Peterson</a> (65 dollars).<br>
<br>
Turner is a very good running back but their is no way in heck he or
anyone else should be worth that much money in a 200 dollar cap league.
At that much money you are using almost 40% of your teams cash on one
player!<br>
<br>
Even though I tried to play with the big boys in this draft going over 40 dollars is just to high of a price in my book.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Auction Mock Draft: Getting at least one top ten runner or receiver</span><br>
<br>
I
liked team eights strategy during the auction mock draft as they were
conservative in the early part of the draft. I was also liking the
names I kept seeing that team accumulate during the middle and later
parts of the auction as well.<br>
<br>
But what I didn't realize until
the end of the draft was that this team didn't have one true top ten
running back or receiver on the team.<br>
<br>
It is always good to have a strong team overall as it can carry you through the entirety of a season and through the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/2009_NFL_Bye_Weeks">bye weeks</a>
strong. But you still need to have a few impact players that can make
the difference in those weeks when you and your opponent are neck and
neck in points.<br>
<br>
Many times it is the team with the game breaker on the roster that
pulls away at the end and winds up the winner. This team will suffer
because it does not have any of those type of players outside of
quarterback on their team.<br>
<br>
Sure it's nice to have <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Peyton+Manning%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Peyton Manning</a> and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Kurt+Warner%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Kurt Warner</a> but you can only start one of them in most leagues and what good does it do you to auction for both and only start one?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Auction Mock Draft Price 1 Dollar: Eagles rookie runner LeSean McCoy<br>
<br>
</span>I drafted <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Brian+Westbrook%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Brian Westbrook</a>
early for 29 dollars because I heard today that he is already running
and cutting in camp. This is a very good sign for Brian as he is coming
off of ankle surgery and was not expected to condition again until
September. Seeing that it is August 5th he now has a good amount of
time to get his legs in better shape before the season beings in mid
September.<br>
<br>
However with that being said it is still important for Westbrook owners to have <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/LeSean+McCoy%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">LeSean McCoy</a>
on their teams this season as a hand cuff. When I was able to snag
McCoy up for only a dollar I was very happy to get this back at such a
low price.<br>
<br>
Sure McCoy probably wouldn't of gone for more then 4 dollars but it is
always nice when you have a "need" player for your team and you can get
them for a buck.<br>

Below I have a few observations from what I found interesting at the auction mock draft.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">Auction Mock Draft Price 69 Dollars: Michael Turner</span><br>
<br>
You
have to love auction drafts because only in a situation like this can
you find anyone that has Michael Turner as the highest priced player in
the mock draft. To be honest this is the first auction mock draft I've
done that I've seen anyone go higher then <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Adrian+Peterson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Adrian Peterson</a> (65 dollars).<br>
<br>
Turner is a very good running back but their is no way in heck he or
anyone else should be worth that much money in a 200 dollar cap league.
At that much money you are using almost 40% of your teams cash on one
player!<br>
<br>
Even though I tried to play with the big boys in this draft going over 40 dollars is just to high of a price in my book.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Auction Mock Draft: Getting at least one top ten runner or receiver</span><br>
<br>
I
liked team eights strategy during the auction mock draft as they were
conservative in the early part of the draft. I was also liking the
names I kept seeing that team accumulate during the middle and later
parts of the auction as well.<br>
<br>
But what I didn't realize until
the end of the draft was that this team didn't have one true top ten
running back or receiver on the team.<br>
<br>
It is always good to have a strong team overall as it can carry you through the entirety of a season and through the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/2009_NFL_Bye_Weeks">bye weeks</a>
strong. But you still need to have a few impact players that can make
the difference in those weeks when you and your opponent are neck and
neck in points.<br>
<br>
Many times it is the team with the game breaker on the roster that
pulls away at the end and winds up the winner. This team will suffer
because it does not have any of those type of players outside of
quarterback on their team.<br>
<br>
Sure it's nice to have <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Peyton+Manning%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Peyton Manning</a> and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Kurt+Warner%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Kurt Warner</a> but you can only start one of them in most leagues and what good does it do you to auction for both and only start one?<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Auction Mock Draft Price 1 Dollar: Eagles rookie runner LeSean McCoy<br>
<br>
</span>I drafted <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Brian+Westbrook%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Brian Westbrook</a>
early for 29 dollars because I heard today that he is already running
and cutting in camp. This is a very good sign for Brian as he is coming
off of ankle surgery and was not expected to condition again until
September. Seeing that it is August 5th he now has a good amount of
time to get his legs in better shape before the season beings in mid
September.<br>
<br>
However with that being said it is still important for Westbrook owners to have <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/LeSean+McCoy%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">LeSean McCoy</a>
on their teams this season as a hand cuff. When I was able to snag
McCoy up for only a dollar I was very happy to get this back at such a
low price.<br>
<br>
Sure McCoy probably wouldn't of gone for more then 4 dollars but it is
always nice when you have a "need" player for your team and you can get
them for a buck.<br>

part in a 12 team ppr draft. Sean E. Douglas or "Playa" drafted in the
3rd spot and Chris Douglas "Reddog" drafted in the 7th slot.<br>
<br>
To
say this was an interesting draft is putting it mildly as this internet
draft reminded us of more of the problems a fantasy football owner can
run into at an online draft.<br>
<br>
With some of these mistakes in mind
we thought it was a good opportunity to have a good laugh at our selves
and talk about the good and bad from this <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/17705440/Points-Per-Reception-PPR-July-Mock-Draft-NFL-12-Team-Cheat-Sheet">July points per reception mock draft</a>.<br>
<br>
First
up will be the Reddog as he shares with you his thoughts on drafting in
the 7th pick of the draft. Then the Playa is next inline as he shares
with you, why he needs to just draft and put the mic down and draft his
picks. </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-size: 130%;">The Reddog Dishout</span><br>
<br>
</span><span>For
our July PPR mock draft my Reddog Team selected 7th out of 12 teams. In
this draft my strategy was to take a running back 1st and wide receiver
2nd. But oh how greed got in the way and I had to do some recovery.<br>
<br>
</span><span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">First Pick: Texans Running Back Steve Slaton <br>
<br>
</span></span><span>Also available were <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Chris+Johnson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Chris Johnson</a>, <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/DeAngelo+Williams+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">DeAngelo Williams</a> and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Brian+Westbrook%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Brain Westbrook</a>.<br>
My reason for drafting <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Steve+Slaton%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Steve Slaton</a>
is because he's the number one on his team and his combo running and
catching is equal to Westbrook, who just isn't heading into this season
100%.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2nd Round: Giants Running Back Brandon Jacobs</span><br>
<br>
I really didn’t expect <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Brandon+Jacobs+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Brandon Jacobs </a>to still be on the board, so this messed up my plan to grab a receiver here. Available were <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Reggie+Wayne%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Reggie Wayne</a>, <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Greg+Jennings+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Greg Jennings</a> and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Steve+Smith%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Steve Smith</a>. Boy I gotta work to cover my wide receivers in the 3rd round.<br>
<br>
</span><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">3rd Round: Bills Wide Receiver Terrell Owens. </span><br>
<br>
Available at that time, <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Peyton+Manning%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Peyton Manning</a>, Roy Williams, and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/T.J.+Houshmandzadeh+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Who’s yourmama</a>. Boy the receivers went faster than I expected going up in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and<span style="">  </span>back to me in the 3<sup>rd</sup>. I like <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Terrell+Owens+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">TO</a>
but he may not have a high catch count in this type of league. But with
a receiver like this, if I can snag another good one, I will be good.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">4th Round: Cardinals Quarterback Kurt Warner</span><br>
<br>
Well the other receivers I was counting on were gone. Best were <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Vincent+Jackson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Vincent Jackson</a>,<span style="">  </span>Lance Moore, and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Jason+Witten%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Jason Witten</a> at TE. While I'm a little disappointed, I am also happy to get a quarterback like <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Kurt+Warner%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Kurt Warner</a> as he can give you some big days and carry a fantasy football team at times.<br>
<br>
</span><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">5th Round: Steelers Wide Receiver Santonio Holmes</span><br>
<br>
Yep getting tough to fill in the receivers but <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Santonio+Holmes+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Santonio Holmes</a> is a number one on his team ( <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Hines+Ward%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Hines Ward</a>
is washed up) but da gone it Holmes is like TO in that he doesn't get a
lot of catches. Oh well, never liked PPR leagues anyways.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">6th Round: Jaguars Wide Receiver Torry Holt </span><br>
<br>
Well I needed a 3<sup>rd</sup> receiver and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Torry+Holt%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Torry Holt</a> is a number one, lets hope he’s determined to prove he got some left in the tank and it was just a poor <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Rams">Rams</a> team, that was the cause for last years numbers.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">7th Round: Cowboys Running Back Felix Jones</span><br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Felix+Jones+Fantasy+Football+Ranking"><br>
Felix Jones </a>is
now my third back and I have to use him in my flex starting position.
That’s what I get for grabbing a QB in the fourth round versus drafting
down.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8th Round Seahawks Tight End John Carlson</span><br>
<br>
</span><span>This is one of the things I don’t like about online drafts, I
clicked on the wrong TE at this point so will need to cover this later
in the mock draft. Overall <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/John+Carlson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">John Carlson</a> should be good player  in <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Seahawks"><st1:place st="on"><st1:city st="on">Seattle</st1:city></st1:place></a>, but I could have done better.<br>
<br>
Note: Follow up 12 Rd. <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Visanthe+Shiancoe%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Shincoe Visanthe</a> TE, <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Vikings">Vikings</a>, gotta love the fact <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/2009/07/fantasy-football-info-lets-face-itbrett.html">Brett Favre</a> involves his Tight Ends. This was a sweat find as I was scrolling through <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/17667279/Fantasy-Football-Info-NFL-Teams-Draft-Board-Cheat-Sheet-2009">Fantasy-Info draft board</a> and saw him still available as a number one on a playoff<br>

messing up at TE, I grabbed a high defense. So long as they maintain
there sack and turn over ratio, this will provide some consistent
points each week.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">10th Round: A Kicker?<br>
<br>
</span></span><span>Dumb draft tool switched to auto select and took kicker <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Kris+Brown%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Kris Brown</a>, what a suck’s pick. That should teach me as in the later rounds I drafted <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Adam+Vinatieri%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Adam Vinateri</a>
to make up for this one. Just shows you that kickers don’t need to go
in the 10th round, my fault for having my player search on kickers.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">11th Round: Jets Running Back Shonn Greene  And Beyond</span><br>
<br>
Just had to have my rookie running back and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Shonn+Greene%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Shonn Greene</a> of the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Jets">Jets</a> fits the bill, who knows he is backing up <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Thomas+Jones%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Thomas Jones</a> so could be starting after week 6.<br>
<br>
After this I scrapped the on line tool and use the <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/">Fantasy Info draft board</a> and found <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Cowboys">Cowboys</a> receiver <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Patrick+Crayton%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Partick Crayton</a> who will be number two and who knows if <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Roy+Williams+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Roy Williams</a> struggles, this guy may have some success.<br>
<br>
</span><span>Also picked up 49ers young receiver Josh Morgan in the late rounds. Ok, I will confess, I’m a <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*49ers">49ers</a> fan so this was a little lean toward my home team.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Overall Observations:<br>
<br>
</span>From <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/2009/06/fantasy-football-information-june-mock.html">Junes Mock Draft</a>
to July the receivers really went quicker than expected so watch how
this plays out in your mock drafts. Also do your self a favor and do
more mocks as some allow you to select the location you want to draft
in. This really helps you gain insights if your lucky to draft early or
get a bottom pick.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it was just a mock and you never know
if everyone involved was showing there true hand or just feeling the
waters of what if's.<br>
<br>
Best of luck, but be prepared or you’ll be Waiting for Next Year….Chris –RedDog- Douglas<br>

<br>
Way
to go Reddog, good job on breaking down your rounds for everyone. For
me I won't be breaking down my draft as it was not the greatest in the
world. Instead I thought I would talk about some other parts of online
drafting that one needs to watch out for ( I fell for it again) before
you draft your for real.<br>
<br>
My first fault in the draft was for one
this marked the first time I ever drafted on the site that we choose do
draft on. Any time you are drafting on a new site for an internet
draft, you should pay attention the first time around so you know how
that site runs their mocks.<br>
<br>
Well I knew I should pay attention but all that went out the window when the team just in front of me drafted <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Maurice+Jones-Drew%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Maurice Jones-Drew</a>
with the second pick overall. I'm not quite sure what it is ego or just
trying to have fun, but I couldn't help but heckle the guy for drafting
MJD so high.<br>
<br>
</span><span>It's not that MJD is a bad runner, we even have him around the
5th or 6th best fantasy back in football for this year. But when I see
a runner that has not proven he can handle a feature role get selected
as the 2nd overall pick, I just had to say something.<br>
<br>
Well
little did I know that when I opened my mouth soon I would be taking on
the entire mock draft group in debate (outside of Reddog that is). We
traded insult for insult back and forth and to be honest I had a lot of
fun, but at the same time I didn't pay attention to my draft enough.<br>
<br>
Because of this I drafted to late on my receivers and then took <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Lance+Moore%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Lance Moore</a> as my No.1 when I already had <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Drew+Brees+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Drew Brees</a>. Some people like the combo but I think you should spread your team out for balance's sake.<br>
<br>
</span><span>Then I selected <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Antonio+Gates+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Antonio Gates</a> and I already had<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/LaDainian+Tomlinson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking"> Ladainian Tomlinson</a>
on my team. I was a little disappointed when I noticed that I had done
that as I usually make a point of not doing those things at my drafts.<br>
<br>
For all of you that don't know me I'm kind of like Marty McFly in the Back to the Future Movies. <a href="http://www.evtv1.com/player.aspx?itemnum=2025">You call me a Chicken</a>
and I just can't help but take you on. So naturally when the guys on
the chat board kept talking, I talked it right back. It was all in good
fun and everything but my draft kept getting worse.<br>
<br>
In the
latter rounds I ended up some how having my draft set to auto draft and
the darn site drafted me Justin Gage and Jamaal Charles.<br>
<br>
</span><span>At the end of the day all I can say is to give you three pieces of advice and they are.<br>
<br>
1.
Remember even McFly had to learn to not challenge everyone because they
called him a chicken. If he did he would have crashed his car in the
second movie and his entire life would have changed.<br>
<br>
With that in mind at least keep your mouth shut on the chat board for the first time or two your on a new site.<br>
<br>
2.
Make sure you can navigate through your different players on the site
well, so that way you can make more informed and sound picks and you
don't get rushed into a player you don't want.<br>
<br>
3. Find out where
the stinking auto draft button is so that you don't accidentally hit is
and this finally find it three rounds later after you've lost a few
picks!<br>
<br>
Hope this info as helpful and again we will be doing a
radio show on this draft on Friday July 31st at 9:30 west coast time,
if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
Good Luck in your 2009 fantasy football draft.<br>

part in a 12 team ppr draft. Sean E. Douglas or "Playa" drafted in the
3rd spot and Chris Douglas "Reddog" drafted in the 7th slot.<br>
<br>
To
say this was an interesting draft is putting it mildly as this internet
draft reminded us of more of the problems a fantasy football owner can
run into at an online draft.<br>
<br>
With some of these mistakes in mind
we thought it was a good opportunity to have a good laugh at our selves
and talk about the good and bad from this <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/17705440/Points-Per-Reception-PPR-July-Mock-Draft-NFL-12-Team-Cheat-Sheet">July points per reception mock draft</a>.<br>
<br>
First
up will be the Reddog as he shares with you his thoughts on drafting in
the 7th pick of the draft. Then the Playa is next inline as he shares
with you, why he needs to just draft and put the mic down and draft his
picks. </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-size: 130%;">The Reddog Dishout</span><br>
<br>
</span><span>For
our July PPR mock draft my Reddog Team selected 7th out of 12 teams. In
this draft my strategy was to take a running back 1st and wide receiver
2nd. But oh how greed got in the way and I had to do some recovery.<br>
<br>
</span><span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">First Pick: Texans Running Back Steve Slaton <br>
<br>
</span></span><span>Also available were <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Chris+Johnson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Chris Johnson</a>, <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/DeAngelo+Williams+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">DeAngelo Williams</a> and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Brian+Westbrook%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Brain Westbrook</a>.<br>
My reason for drafting <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Steve+Slaton%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Steve Slaton</a>
is because he's the number one on his team and his combo running and
catching is equal to Westbrook, who just isn't heading into this season
100%.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2nd Round: Giants Running Back Brandon Jacobs</span><br>
<br>
I really didn’t expect <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Brandon+Jacobs+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Brandon Jacobs </a>to still be on the board, so this messed up my plan to grab a receiver here. Available were <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Reggie+Wayne%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Reggie Wayne</a>, <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Greg+Jennings+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Greg Jennings</a> and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Steve+Smith%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Steve Smith</a>. Boy I gotta work to cover my wide receivers in the 3rd round.<br>
<br>
</span><span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">3rd Round: Bills Wide Receiver Terrell Owens. </span><br>
<br>
Available at that time, <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Peyton+Manning%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Peyton Manning</a>, Roy Williams, and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/T.J.+Houshmandzadeh+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Who’s yourmama</a>. Boy the receivers went faster than I expected going up in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and<span style="">  </span>back to me in the 3<sup>rd</sup>. I like <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Terrell+Owens+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">TO</a>
but he may not have a high catch count in this type of league. But with
a receiver like this, if I can snag another good one, I will be good.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">4th Round: Cardinals Quarterback Kurt Warner</span><br>
<br>
Well the other receivers I was counting on were gone. Best were <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Vincent+Jackson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Vincent Jackson</a>,<span style="">  </span>Lance Moore, and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Jason+Witten%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Jason Witten</a> at TE. While I'm a little disappointed, I am also happy to get a quarterback like <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Kurt+Warner%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Kurt Warner</a> as he can give you some big days and carry a fantasy football team at times.<br>
<br>
</span><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">5th Round: Steelers Wide Receiver Santonio Holmes</span><br>
<br>
Yep getting tough to fill in the receivers but <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Santonio+Holmes+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Santonio Holmes</a> is a number one on his team ( <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Hines+Ward%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Hines Ward</a>
is washed up) but da gone it Holmes is like TO in that he doesn't get a
lot of catches. Oh well, never liked PPR leagues anyways.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">6th Round: Jaguars Wide Receiver Torry Holt </span><br>
<br>
Well I needed a 3<sup>rd</sup> receiver and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Torry+Holt%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Torry Holt</a> is a number one, lets hope he’s determined to prove he got some left in the tank and it was just a poor <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Rams">Rams</a> team, that was the cause for last years numbers.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">7th Round: Cowboys Running Back Felix Jones</span><br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Felix+Jones+Fantasy+Football+Ranking"><br>
Felix Jones </a>is
now my third back and I have to use him in my flex starting position.
That’s what I get for grabbing a QB in the fourth round versus drafting
down.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8th Round Seahawks Tight End John Carlson</span><br>
<br>
</span><span>This is one of the things I don’t like about online drafts, I
clicked on the wrong TE at this point so will need to cover this later
in the mock draft. Overall <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/John+Carlson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">John Carlson</a> should be good player  in <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Seahawks"><st1:place st="on"><st1:city st="on">Seattle</st1:city></st1:place></a>, but I could have done better.<br>
<br>
Note: Follow up 12 Rd. <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Visanthe+Shiancoe%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Shincoe Visanthe</a> TE, <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Vikings">Vikings</a>, gotta love the fact <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/2009/07/fantasy-football-info-lets-face-itbrett.html">Brett Favre</a> involves his Tight Ends.

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">9th Round: Pittsburgh Steelers Defense</span><br>
<br>
After
messing up at TE, I grabbed a high defense. So long as they maintain
there sack and turn over ratio, this will provide some consistent
points each week.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">10th Round: A Kicker?<br>
<br>
</span></span><span>Dumb draft tool switched to auto select and took kicker <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Kris+Brown%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Kris Brown</a>, what a suck’s pick. That should teach me as in the later rounds I drafted <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Adam+Vinatieri%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Adam Vinateri</a>
to make up for this one. Just shows you that kickers don’t need to go

</span><span>Also picked up 49ers young receiver Josh Morgan in the late rounds. Ok, I will confess, I’m a <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*49ers">49ers</a> fan so this was a little lean toward my home team.<br>

2.
Make sure you can navigate through your different players on the site
well, so that way you can make more informed and sound picks and you
don't get rushed into a player you don't want.<br>
<br>
3. Find out where
the stinking auto draft button is so that you don't accidentally hit is
and this finally find it three rounds later after you've lost a few
picks!<br>
<br>
Hope this info as helpful and again we will be doing a
radio show on this draft on Friday July 31st at 9:30 west coast time,
if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
Good Luck in your 2009 fantasy football draft.<br>

Hi to all <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/">Fantasy-Info</a> fans.<br>
<br>
Attached
are our team draft board is intended as a reference for your fantasy
football draft. This board is broken up into two different pages (NFC
and AFC) to use with our <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/17265085/Fantasy-Football-Info-Top-150-Players-Cheat-Sheet">current player cheat sheet</a>.
This is another tool to have on draft day, to help you focus on
different NFL Team strengths and depth at key positions. Beyond just a
handy draft board at draft day this information is also a very good
reference when making your pre-draft decisions.<br>
<br>
Having this tool
for your mock drafts and projections of the coming year can be a vital
helper in ensuring success in any fantasy football season. Listed below
are just a couple pointers on the depth charts and key defensive
information that we want to point out, to help you understand this
board better.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">How to use Fantasy Info Draft Board Cheat Sheet:</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Part 1: Depth Chart for each teams Skill Position Players</span><br>
<br>
First review each team and based on your preference highlight players on each team<br>
You've consider draft worthy or a good back up to keep track of. In each position we've<br>
Listed the known starter by team.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">For Example</span><br>
<br>
<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/*Chargers">Chargers </a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">RB </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/LaDainian+Tomlinson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">LaDainian Tomlinson</a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">RB </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Darren+Sproles+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Darren Sproles</a><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">RB Jacob Hester</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">Part 2: Defensive Rankings</span><br>
<br>
The second piece of information that is worth noting is that our defensive rankings are listed as  follow.<br>
<br>
Def.
Value: Ratings 1 - 32 Review and highlight your top 12. Knowing your
top twelve on the list is important as most teams have a 12 team
league. However this you may play in a league that has even more teams
or less teams. In the end it is important to know how many you need to
have listed to ensure that you will be covered for the amount of teams
in your league.<br>
<br>
Defensive Ranking: Data is from 2008 team
performance. Here you will be able to find out how the team rated in
yards against, how many sacks they had and finally how many turn overs
they accumulated.<br>
<br>
Defensive Base: These are from 2008, note several teams changed Head or Defensive coach so<br>
track
what there base may change to. For example Tampa Bay, likely will
change from Cover 2 defense because their have now lost their long time
defensive coordinator.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">What this Draft Board is Best For<br>
<br>
</span>Lets face it we all have an idea of which players will be the top 50
taken in just about every fantasy football draft known to man. But with
this draft board cheat sheet you will have access to more then just a
list that can help you in the first five rounds of your draft.<br>
<br>
Understanding
the depth of every team can be us full, but also knowing which teams
have strong depth and which do not can help you make informed decisions
as well.<br>
<br>
To dominate in your fantasy football league you will
need to know which diamonds in the ruff are going to be found this
year. Sure you will never find them all but if you can find a few in
the later rounds it can really make a fantasy football team go.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Some helpful tips for success:</span>
In later rounds use this to find those Number 1's, RB / WR / TE still
left on the board. Take the number one on our depth chart, most of the
time over the No.2 on another team.<br>
<br>
For example while you may not think much of the Rams chances this season <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Donnie+Avery%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Donnie Avery</a>
is still a good option over a Kevin Walter with the Texans. The Rams
may not be a fantasy juggernaut but Avery will still get a lot more
looks from Marc <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Marc+Bulger%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Bulger</a> during the season.<br>
<br>
It is amazing how many times we will see a No.2 receiver get taken over No.1's that just get forgotten about.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Understanding a Good Defense When you see them</span><br>
<br>
Defensive
Rating: On the draft board check out each teams turnovers and sack
totals. If a team can apply pressure then the odds of that defense
making touchdowns and hold the team down in scoring goes up.<br>
<br>
In
the end this tool is good for having all the teams depth charts right
at your finger tips. Yes some of this depth charts will change in
August as pre-season comes along. We will probably put out a late
August version of this board for all of you that are drafting at the
end of the month or in September.<br>
<br>
To close this out I would also
like to add again that this board while it is useful at the draft it is
even more hand before you get to your draft. It never hurts to have all
the info on different teams depth charts in front of you so that you
can make more informed decisions on though's hard choices we all
personally face between this player and that player.<br>
<br>
Good luck in 2009, or Wait Till Next Year for not being totally prepared this season.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">Part 2: Defensive Rankings</span><br>
<br>
The second piece of information that is worth noting is that our defensive rankings are listed as  follow.<br>
<br>
Def.
Value: Ratings 1 - 32 Review and highlight your top 12. Knowing your
top twelve on the list is important as most teams have a 12 team
league. However this you may play in a league that has even more teams
or less teams. In the end it is important to know how many you need to
have listed to ensure that you will be covered for the amount of teams
in your league.<br>
<br>
Defensive Ranking: Data is from 2008 team
performance. Here you will be able to find out how the team rated in
yards against, how many sacks they had and finally how many turn overs
they accumulated.<br>
<br>
Defensive Base: These are from 2008, note several teams changed Head or Defensive coach so<br>
track
what there base may change to. For example Tampa Bay, likely will
change from Cover 2 defense because their have now lost their long time
defensive coordinator.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">What this Draft Board is Best For<br>
<br>
</span>Lets face it we all have an idea of which players will be the top 50
taken in just about every fantasy football draft known to man. But with
this draft board cheat sheet you will have access to more then just a
list that can help you in the first five rounds of your draft.<br>
<br>
Understanding
the depth of every team can be us full, but also knowing which teams
have strong depth and which do not can help you make informed decisions
as well.<br>
<br>
To dominate in your fantasy football league you will
need to know which diamonds in the ruff are going to be found this
year. Sure you will never find them all but if you can find a few in
the later rounds it can really make a fantasy football team go.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Some helpful tips for success:</span>
In later rounds use this to find those Number 1's, RB / WR / TE still
left on the board. Take the number one on our depth chart, most of the
time over the No.2 on another team.<br>
<br>
For example while you may not think much of the Rams chances this season <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Donnie+Avery%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Donnie Avery</a>
is still a good option over a Kevin Walter with the Texans. The Rams
may not be a fantasy juggernaut but Avery will still get a lot more
looks from Marc <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Marc+Bulger%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Bulger</a> during the season.<br>
<br>
It is amazing how many times we will see a No.2 receiver get taken over No.1's that just get forgotten about.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Understanding a Good Defense When you see them</span><br>
<br>
Defensive
Rating: On the draft board check out each teams turnovers and sack
totals. If a team can apply pressure then the odds of that defense
making touchdowns and hold the team down in scoring goes up.<br>
<br>
In
the end this tool is good for having all the teams depth charts right
at your finger tips. Yes some of this depth charts will change in
August as pre-season comes along. We will probably put out a late
August version of this board for all of you that are drafting at the
end of the month or in September.<br>
<br>
To close this out I would also
like to add again that this board while it is useful at the draft it is
even more hand before you get to your draft. It never hurts to have all
the info on different teams depth charts in front of you so that you
can make more informed decisions on though's hard choices we all
personally face between this player and that player.<br>
<br>
Good luck in 2009, or Wait Till Next Year for not being totally prepared this season.<br>

<br>
Sure
Moss has had attitude problems before going to the Patriots and he has
also had a few bad years in his career, but he's also been fun to
watch. Not many have ever been able to flat out dominate the way this
man has done for the last decade, in any time in the history of
football.<br>
<br>
At this point in time Randy has the best career ratio
for touchdowns to catch average for a receiver with 500 catches or more
in a career. For every 6.24 receptions Randy has had in his career he
has had one touchdown. For those of you scoring at home that is a
career total of 823 receptions and 135 touchdowns in his hall of fame
career.<br>

I
say hall of fame career because I believe Randy proved last year that
he has risen above his selfish ways and became a leader on the team. He
did not sit around an whine all year once <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Tom+Brady%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Tom Brady</a> went down for the season. Instead he worked with <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Matt+Cassel%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Matt Cassel</a> and the rest of the offense to be a better team overall.<br>
<br>
With
this display of maturity I truly believe that the NFL voters for the
hall of fame have no excesses as to why Moss is not a hall of fame
receiver.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">It's Not Over Yet Folks<br>
<br>
</span>While Moss has had a great career so far, he is still going to be one of the best receivers in the league for a few more years.<br>
<br>
Sure the <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Patriots">Patriots</a>
are known for spreading the ball around and getting multiple players
involved, but one player will get his for sure and that is Moss. I also
believe that <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Wes+Welker%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Wes Welker</a> should also see over 100 receptions again in 2009 as he is a very valuable receiver in the offense as well.<br>
<br>
Tom
Brady is back and looks like he is ready to role from week one of the
season on. Assuming Brady is capable of being 80% of the player he was
before the injury, I see no reason why Moss won't have 1,300 yards and
15 touchdowns.<br>

This
dynamic duo is just too good for defenses to hold down and Randy should
be the most explosive receiver again in fantasy football.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">Fantasy Football Information for Randy Moss</span><br>
<br>
A
few months ago when I wrote all my fantasy player rankings, I had Randy
Moss ranked as the No.2 receiver in fantasy football. Soon I will have
to move him into the No. 1 spot over <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Fantasy+Football+Ranking+for+Larry+Fitzgerald">Larry Fitzgerald </a>as Tom Brady is ready to go.<br>
<br>
At
the end of the day Moss is next to no one as far as ability to dominate
a game down the field. I do believe the next great receiver for fantasy
football has arrived in <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Lions">Lions</a> <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Calvin+Johnson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Calvin Johnson</a>, but we need to see his team be a little better before he is worth ranking over Moss in fantasy.<br>
<br>
Draft
Moss with confidence as I believe that Tom Brady is itching to show the
world that he is back and ready to make a run for the Super Bowl.<br>

football has arrived in <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Lions">Lions</a> <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Calvin+Johnson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Calvin Johnson</a>, but we need to see his team be a little better before he is worth ranking over Moss in fantasy.<br>
<br>
Draft
Moss with confidence as I believe that Tom Brady is itching to show the
world that he is back and ready to make a run for the Super Bowl.<br>

fantasy information bounce around quite a bit in the last few seasons.
In 2007 we all wondered how Tom's fantasy production would change with
new receiver <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Randy+Moss%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Randy Moss</a> on the team.<br>
<br>
Man
oh man did we ever find out when Brady flopped out a 50 touchdowns and
the Patriots had a undefeated regular season. In all of Tom's success
he also made Moss a star again and fellow receiver <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Wes+Welker%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Wes Welker</a> became a house hold name in fantasy football.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">Disappointment in 2008</span><br>
<br>
At my draft I hit the fantasy lotto (or so I thought) when I selected <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Adrian+Peterson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Adrian Peterson</a>, <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Terrell+Owens+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Terrell Owens</a>
and Randy Moss with my first three picks. But like so many in week one
of the season, my fantasy dreams were crushed when Brady went down for
the year.<br>
<br>
With Brady down it took <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Matt+Cassel%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Matt Cassel</a>
about 10 games to really find his grove as the quarterback for the
Patriots. In that time Moss suffered from inconsistent play and made
fantasy owners question if and when he would score again.<br>
<br>
To
Cassel's credit he did turn it around in the final six weeks or so thus
helping Randy and Wes have good endings for the 2008 season.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">Can Brady Return to Excellence in 2009?<br>
<br>
</span>One of the biggest questions on fantasy owners minds this summer, is
how effective will Tom be this season. While it is never easy to return
from mcl and acl surgery, one has to believe that if anyone can it is
Brady.<br>
<br>
So far their are encouraging signs as the Patriots traded
away Matt Cassel and Brady is reportedly back to throwing on the run.
Just recently his tight end Ben Watson came out and noted that Tom has
looked great in camp so far.<br>
<br>
I personally liken Tom this season to <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MariDa00.htm">Dan Marino</a>
in 1994 when he returned from knee problems. That season Dan dropped in
fantasy draft because people were concerned about his health. Marino
proved his doubters wrong and had 30 touchdowns and 4,453 passing yards.<br>
<br>
At
the end of the day one should never turn their back on a great player
with the tools to succeed in hand. Brady will have his great supporting
cast back as well as veteran receiver Joey Galloway.<br>
<br>
Tom even
came out in early June to let people know he plans on playing another
ten years (he would be 41 by that time) and is focused on winning
championships. The first step to winning a championship is to have a
hot start (like Marino in 1994) and let everyone know that Brady is
back.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">Fantasy Football Information on Tom Brady</span><br>
<br>
With
the confidence and some times arrogance that Brady can have at times,
all fantasy owners should expect success from this all-pro quarterback.<br>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);"><a class="external" href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=346959&amp;b=31196&amp;m=7124&amp;afftrack=&amp;urllink=www%2Efootballfanatics%2Ecom%2FNFL%5FNew%5FEngland%5FPatriots%2FReebok%5FNFL%5FEquipment%5FNew%5FEngland%5FPatriots%5F%5FNumber%5F12%5FTom%5FBrady%5FSilver%5FAlternate%5FReplica%5FFootball%5FJer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Purchase Your Patriots Tom Brady Jersey Today!" src="http://image.wetpaint.com/image/1/Bt760GppxzFFiDJtArp3OA25346/GW189H189" title="Purchase Your Patriots Tom Brady Jersey Today!" width="189" align="right" height="189"></a></span><br>
Some
players are just able to rise to the occasion and succeed time and time
again. Tom Brady is that kind of player and I'm not going to doubt his
ability's. Look for Tom as a nice second or third round pick in most
fantasy formats this season.<br>
<br>
With the great team around this man
I would be very surprised if you find him lower then the third round,
even in smaller eight team leagues.<br>
<br>
Look for Brady to post at least the same kind of numbers that Dan Marino had in 1994, as he returns to the MVP of the NFL.<br>

I discussed the importance of an offensive line working together. The
main idea of the piece was that all success in an offense starts up
front with the offensive line.<br>
<br>
When an offensive line runs like
a well oiled machine, an offense is always going to be setup to succeed
on the football field. But when an o-line is not maintained, you leave
open the possibility's to have failure.<br>
<br>
Failures up front can happen in different ways, for example a line suffer injurys (<a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/2009/07/fantasy-information-alex-barron-and.html">Rams o-line </a>last couple of years) or they can have a quarterback that holds onto the ball to long and is immobile (<a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/2009/07/fantasy-information-chiefs-brandon_01.html">Chiefs</a> before <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/2009/07/fantasy-football-info-what-ever.html">Tyler Thigpen</a>).<br>
<br>
While
an offensive line can always suffer unfortunate hardships they can
build one common bond together over time. That bond is called
"chemistry" and it only comes when you have played together over time.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Major Changes on the Offensive Line</span><br>
<br>
Before
I get into the Bills major over haul on the offensive line I would like
to stack up what they had on the line last year and what they have this
year.<br>

<br>
From the information listed above it is easy to see that the Buffalo Bills offensive line has gone through a <span style="font-weight: bold;">MAJOR</span>
overhaul this off-season. With so much change, a fantasy football owner
can only have concern that the Bills star players may have problems
this season.<br>
<br>
It's hard enough to have two rookies on the
offensive line in one season, but to have two more in different
positions is killer. Throw in a backup center from another team and you
have your self a problem.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Can Buffalo Players Excel for your Fantasy Team?</span><br>
<br>
Let me get this out of the way right now, <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Terrell+Owens+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Terrell Owens</a> is the only player you should select in your first seven round or so of your fantasy draft.<br>
<br>
This season <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Marshawn+Lynch%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Marshawn Lynch</a> is going to start the year with a three game suspension and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Fred+Jackson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Fred Jackson</a>
will take his place. When the news came down that Lynch would miss time
I thought it was a good opportunity to start Jackson on fantasy teams
for the first month.<br>
<br>
But with chemistry and timing issues on the
line and the fact that they play the Patriots, Buccaneers, Saints and
Dolphins, he is going to have a hard time. Maybe you can start Fred
against the Saints, but I caution you that the Saints strength as a
defense is against the run.<br>
<br>
If the Bills are going to find success this year, the Buffalo offensive line had best be good at protecting <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Trent+Edwards+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Trent Edwards</a>.<br>
<br>
While
I like Trent as a quarterback there was a reason he slipped into the
third round of the NFL draft in 2007 and that was because of injuries.
Last season Trent was sacked only 23 times in 14 games.<br>
<br>
What
that should tell fantasy owners is that in only 23 sacks, Trent had to
miss two games due to injury. What will happen if he has to suffer lets
say 35 or even 40 sacks this year?<br>
<br>
If Trent goes down the Bills
will now have to rely on Bengals reject (it's hard for me to write this
guys name without becoming physically ill) <a href="http://www.nfl.com/players/ryanfitzpatrick/profile?id=FIT792915">Ryan Fitzpatrick</a> or <a href="http://www.nfl.com/players/mattbaker/profile?id=BAK495064">Matt Baker</a> (zero snaps in the NFL).<br>
<br>
It
is clear to see that the Bills can not lose Edwards for anytime if they
hope to make a run at the playoffs. It is also very clear that if you
draft any players on the Bills this year in fantasy, you better hope
that Edwards stays healthy.<br>
<br>
Just look at what Fitzpatrick did to <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/Chad_Ochocinco">Chad Ochocinco</a> and <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/search/label/TJ_Houshmanzada">TJ Houshmanzada</a> after <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Carson+Palmer%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Carson Palmer </a>went down.

I discussed the importance of an offensive line working together. The
main idea of the piece was that all success in an offense starts up
front with the offensive line.<br>
<br>
When an offensive line runs like
a well oiled machine, an offense is always going to be setup to succeed
on the football field. But when an o-line is not maintained, you leave
open the possibility's to have failure.<br>
<br>
Failures up front can happen in different ways, for example a line suffer injurys (<a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/2009/07/fantasy-information-alex-barron-and.html">Rams o-line </a>last couple of years) or they can have a quarterback that holds onto the ball to long and is immobile (<a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/2009/07/fantasy-information-chiefs-brandon_01.html">Chiefs</a> before <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/2009/07/fantasy-football-info-what-ever.html">Tyler Thigpen</a>).<br>
<br>
While
an offensive line can always suffer unfortunate hardships they can
build one common bond together over time. That bond is called
"chemistry" and it only comes when you have played together over time.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Major Changes on the Offensive Line</span><br>
<br>
Before
I get into the Bills major over haul on the offensive line I would like
to stack up what they had on the line last year and what they have this
year.<br>

<br>
From the information listed above it is easy to see that the Buffalo Bills offensive line has gone through a <span style="font-weight: bold;">MAJOR</span>
overhaul this off-season. With so much change, a fantasy football owner
can only have concern that the Bills star players may have problems
this season.<br>
<br>
It's hard enough to have two rookies on the
offensive line in one season, but to have two more in different
positions is killer. Throw in a backup center from another team and you
have your self a problem.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Can Buffalo Players Excel for your Fantasy Team?</span><br>
<br>
Let me get this out of the way right now, <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Terrell+Owens+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Terrell Owens</a> is the only player you should select in your first seven round or so of your fantasy draft.<br>
<br>
This season <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Marshawn+Lynch%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Marshawn Lynch</a> is going to start the year with a three game suspension and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Fred+Jackson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Fred Jackson</a>
will take his place. When the news came down that Lynch would miss time
I thought it was a good opportunity to start Jackson on fantasy teams
for the first month.<br>
<br>
But with chemistry and timing issues on the
line and the fact that they play the Patriots, Buccaneers, Saints and
Dolphins, he is going to have a hard time. Maybe you can start Fred
against the Saints, but I caution you that the Saints strength as a
defense is against the run.<br>
<br>
If the Bills are going to find success this year, the Buffalo offensive line had best be good at protecting <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Trent+Edwards+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Trent Edwards</a>.<br>
<br>
While
I like Trent as a quarterback there was a reason he slipped into the
third round of the NFL draft in 2007 and that was because of injuries.
Last season Trent was sacked only 23 times in 14 games.<br>
<br>
What
that should tell fantasy owners is that in only 23 sacks, Trent had to
miss two games due to injury. What will happen if he has to suffer lets
say 35 or even 40 sacks this year?<br>
<br>
If Trent goes down the Bills
will now have to rely on Bengals reject (it's hard for me to write this
guys name without becoming physically ill) <a href="http://www.nfl.com/players/ryanfitzpatrick/profile?id=FIT792915">Ryan Fitzpatrick</a> or <a href="http://www.nfl.com/players/mattbaker/profile?id=BAK495064">Matt Baker</a> (zero snaps in the NFL).<br>
<br>
It
is clear to see that the Bills can not lose Edwards for anytime if they
hope to make a run at the playoffs. It is also very clear that if you
draft any players on the Bills this year in fantasy, you better hope
that Edwards stays healthy.<br>

the magazine section. At this time of year lots of fantasy football
sites are cranking out their fantasy mags (<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/">fantasy info magazine is free online</a>) for everyone to read.<br>
<br>
I
normally don't like to bash other sites rankings because I don't want
to give the impression that I'm trying to make them look bad. But when
I picked up ESPN's fantasy football magazine and saw that <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Steven+Jackson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Steven Jackson</a> was ranked No.5 running back, I slowly closed the mag and walked away.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">How can Steven Be a Top Five, This Season!</span><br>
<br>
Don't
get me wrong, Jackson is a solid talent, but to have him 5th overall is
just ridiculous this season. In 2006 Steven had the second best season
of any player that year (LT made his run for 30 TD's that year) in
fantasy football. Naturally Jackson was then ranked as the 2nd best
player to draft coming into the 2007 season.<br>
<br>
In 2007 Jackson was a disappointment to many fantasy owners as he missed 4 games to injury and he only had six touchdowns.<br>
<br>
In
2008 Steven was still ranked around the top 5 runners in fantasy. I
didn't mind that ranking last year because many runners had bad seasons
and Jackson was only one year removed from fantasy greatness.<br>
<br>
But
again in 2008 Steven missed 4 more games due to injury and disappointed
fantasy owners that rolled the dice, believing he would bounce back.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">2009 Jackson is not even a top ten fantasy runner</span><br>
<br>
In
our rankings this year we currently have Jackson as the 14th best
runner in fantasy. This is because of four parts and they are health,
bad team, two bad seasons and solid runners broke out last year.<br>
<br>
Sooner
or later a guy that has great talent and does not get it done, is just
not a top 5 player in his respective position. Especially when you
consider there are more options for fantasy running back this year.<br>
<br>
With young runners like <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Chris+Johnson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Chris Johnson</a>, <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Steve+Slaton%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Steve Slaton</a> and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Matt+Forte%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Matt Forte</a> you should be considering these fine young runners before Steven.<br>
<br>
Other options like <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Maurice+Jones-Drew%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Maurice Jones-Drew</a> or <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Brandon+Jacobs+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Brandon Jacobs</a> have also moved above Jackson in this years draft.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Why is Jackson better then LT<br>
<br>
</span>Also can someone give me the info as to why Jackson deserves to be ranked over <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/LaDainian+Tomlinson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">LT</a> this year?<br>
For some reason ESPN seems to think that Jackson has "earned" a higher ranking then LT.<br>
<br>
Hey
it's true that LaDanion did have a down year for his standards. But the
man still played every game, scored twelve touchdowns, had over 1,500
all purpose yards and caught 52 receptions.<br>
<br>
LT is still on a great offense and they are in the weakest division in football coming into 2009.<br>
<br>
Steven Jackson has only sniffed the stats listed above <span style="font-weight: bold;">one time</span> in his whole career!!!!<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Fantasy Information for Steven Jackson</span><br>
<br>
While
Steven is a great talent I need to see his stats, health and team all
improve before he moves back into the top ten, let alone the top five.<br>
<br>
Having
great talent is all well and good but sooner or later I have to see a
player "live up" to his lofty expectations. Especially before he gets
ranked as a top five overall runner in fantasy football.<br>
<br>
Sooner
or later a fantasy owner deserves to get a player off of two down
seasons at a "value" coming into the next year. Braylon Edwards had 16
touchdowns in 2007 and last year he had a horrible season. Would you
rank him as a top 5 receiver this year?<br>
<br>
With all that being said
I actually do like Steve as a nice No.2 runner for your fantasy team
this season. But please don't try and sell me that this guy should be a
mid first round pick this year.<br>

<span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153); font-family: georgia;">Highlight Information: Players Round by Round</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1st Round Information<br>
<br>
</span><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Adrian+Peterson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Adrian Peterson</a>
- At this point in time, Adrian still has a quarterback issue on his
team. How ever "All Day" is just to talented a player to not be the top
fantasy pick, even if Brett Favre does not sign with the team.<br>
<br>
If
Brett should sign, Peterson would be able to take his game to another
level. Reason for this is that obviously defenses would have to take
Favre seriously and not load nine in the box to stop Adrian.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2nd Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Marion+Barber%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Marion Barber</a>- When my Dad (<a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/15244100878354645698">Wait Till Next Year</a>)
selected Barber in the second round, I was amazed to see how Marion
value has changed. Last season Barber was one the rise as a mid first
round pick, in most fantasy leagues. With <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Julius+Jones+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Julius Jones</a> out of the picture and Marion finally the starter, it look like he was primed for a great year.<br>
<br>
Like most players on Dallas he was a disappointment and now their is talk that <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Felix+Jones+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Felix Jones</a> will start and Barber will be used as he was when Julius was on the team.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3rd Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Roddy+White%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Roddy White</a>- It does not seem to matter what quarterback throws the football to White, he just keeps producing. With <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Matt+Ryan%27s+Fantasy+Football+Value">Matt Ryan</a> at the helm, he now has a legit quarterback and should see his touchdown totals move higher, as Ryan continues to progress.<br>
<br>
The addition of tight end <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Tony+Gonzalez+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Tony Gonzalez</a> only helps Roddy, as now defenses have to pay attention to someone else in the offense.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4th Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Braylon+Edwards+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Braylon Edwards</a>-
Many fantasy owners were disappointed with Edwards last season. I was a
little surprised when when he was selected in the 4th round by Randy.<br>
<br>
In
the end there just are not that many receivers that have had 16
touchdown seasons. Not to also add that last year, was a down season
for lots of receivers in fantasy.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">5th Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Larry+Johnson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Larry Johnson</a>-
Not to long ago, Larry was the No.1 player in fantasy football. But the
last two seasons, Johnson has been a total fantasy bust, in any format.<br>
<br>
This year Larry is still slated to be the feature runner (assuming he
is a good boy off the field) and his offensive line is getting better.
Granted the loss of <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Tony+Gonzalez+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Tony Gonzalez </a>will hurt, but if you can snag LJ as your 5th round pick or lower, his is probably worth the gamble.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">6th Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Greg+Olsen%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Greg Olsen</a>- With no proven true receivers in the Chicago offense, look for <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Jay+Cutler+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Jay Cutler</a>
to go to Olsen this year. Greg has an excellent chance to be a fantasy
star as the Bears should compete for a playoff spot this season.<br>
<br>
If Greg can not produce this year for fantasy owners, when will he ever get it done. It's now or never.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">7th Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Wes+Welker%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Wes Welker</a>, <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Thomas+Jones%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Thomas Jones</a>, <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Joseph+Addai%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Joesph Addai</a> and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Aaron+Rodgers+Fantasy+Football+Rankings">Aaron Rodgers</a>-
You can tell it is June because all these players should go higher then
the 7th round in a ten team league. Every year you see good players
fall in the draft, it is rounds like this one, that fantasy owners can
capitalize on players that fall a bit too far.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8th Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/LeSean+McCoy%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">LeSean McCoy</a>- fantasy owner Chicago Blues, was smart to draft McCoy as a backup for <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Brian+Westbrook%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Brian Westbrook</a> on her team. If you have Westbrook this season, you should think long and hard about wear McCoy will fit into your draft plans.<br>
<br>
Right
now Brian should be ready for the start of the regular season, but no
one will know how long (and effective) he can play with this ailment.
It does help that Brian had surgery this month, so hopefully he will be
fine.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">9th Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Jamal+Lewis+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Jamal Lewis</a>- So far in camp Jamal has been a little slow to recover from ankle surgery.<br>

Head Coach Eric Mangini, loves to use a two man committee at running back.  Last year his committee in <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Leon+Washington%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Leon Washington</a> and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Thomas+Jones%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Thomas Jones</a> work out great, so look for him to get <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/2009/05/fantasy-info-browns-running-back-jerome.html">Jerome Harrison</a> into the mix this season.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">10th Round Information<br>
<br>
</span><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Chester+Taylor%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Chester Taylor</a>- My Dad was a cold dog for taking <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Adrian+Peterson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Adrian Peterson's</a> backup, as his last pick. Our online draft group, had many comments back and forth on this one.<br>
<br>
Chester
is a good fantasy player if given the chance. With Peterson's in-
ability to stay healthy at times, this is a great "stash away" pick and
might pay off big. In the end this was only a mock draft and we won't
be playing with these teams.<br>
<br>
Let this write up be a reminder to
those that are lucky enough to have Adrian this year. If you draft
Peterson, watch out for another person in your league drafting Taylor.
Nothing would be worse then if Adrian should go down and you have to
watch another team succeed with No.29.<br>

<span style="font-size: 130%;"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 153); font-family: georgia;">Highlight Information: Players Round by Round</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1st Round Information<br>
<br>
</span><a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Adrian+Peterson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Adrian Peterson</a>
- At this point in time, Adrian still has a quarterback issue on his
team. How ever "All Day" is just to talented a player to not be the top
fantasy pick, even if Brett Favre does not sign with the team.<br>
<br>
If
Brett should sign, Peterson would be able to take his game to another
level. Reason for this is that obviously defenses would have to take
Favre seriously and not load nine in the box to stop Adrian.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2nd Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Marion+Barber%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Marion Barber</a>- When my Dad (<a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/15244100878354645698">Wait Till Next Year</a>)
selected Barber in the second round, I was amazed to see how Marion
value has changed. Last season Barber was one the rise as a mid first
round pick, in most fantasy leagues. With <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Julius+Jones+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Julius Jones</a> out of the picture and Marion finally the starter, it look like he was primed for a great year.<br>
<br>
Like most players on Dallas he was a disappointment and now their is talk that <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Felix+Jones+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Felix Jones</a> will start and Barber will be used as he was when Julius was on the team.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3rd Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Roddy+White%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Roddy White</a>- It does not seem to matter what quarterback throws the football to White, he just keeps producing. With <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Matt+Ryan%27s+Fantasy+Football+Value">Matt Ryan</a> at the helm, he now has a legit quarterback and should see his touchdown totals move higher, as Ryan continues to progress.<br>
<br>
The addition of tight end <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Tony+Gonzalez+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Tony Gonzalez</a> only helps Roddy, as now defenses have to pay attention to someone else in the offense.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4th Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Braylon+Edwards+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Braylon Edwards</a>-
Many fantasy owners were disappointed with Edwards last season. I was a
little surprised when when he was selected in the 4th round by Randy.<br>
<br>
In
the end there just are not that many receivers that have had 16
touchdown seasons. Not to also add that last year, was a down season
for lots of receivers in fantasy.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">5th Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Larry+Johnson%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Larry Johnson</a>-
Not to long ago, Larry was the No.1 player in fantasy football. But the
last two seasons, Johnson has been a total fantasy bust, in any format.<br>
<br>
This year Larry is still slated to be the feature runner (assuming he
is a good boy off the field) and his offensive line is getting better.
Granted the loss of <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Tony+Gonzalez+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Tony Gonzalez </a>will hurt, but if you can snag LJ as your 5th round pick or lower, his is probably worth the gamble.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">6th Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Greg+Olsen%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Greg Olsen</a>- With no proven true receivers in the Chicago offense, look for <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Jay+Cutler+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Jay Cutler</a>
to go to Olsen this year. Greg has an excellent chance to be a fantasy
star as the Bears should compete for a playoff spot this season.<br>
<br>
If Greg can not produce this year for fantasy owners, when will he ever get it done. It's now or never.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">7th Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Wes+Welker%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Wes Welker</a>, <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Thomas+Jones%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Thomas Jones</a>, <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Joseph+Addai%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Joesph Addai</a> and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Aaron+Rodgers+Fantasy+Football+Rankings">Aaron Rodgers</a>-
You can tell it is June because all these players should go higher then
the 7th round in a ten team league. Every year you see good players
fall in the draft, it is rounds like this one, that fantasy owners can
capitalize on players that fall a bit too far.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8th Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/LeSean+McCoy%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">LeSean McCoy</a>- fantasy owner Chicago Blues, was smart to draft McCoy as a backup for <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Brian+Westbrook%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Brian Westbrook</a> on her team. If you have Westbrook this season, you should think long and hard about wear McCoy will fit into your draft plans.<br>
<br>
Right
now Brian should be ready for the start of the regular season, but no
one will know how long (and effective) he can play with this ailment.
It does help that Brian had surgery this month, so hopefully he will be
fine.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">9th Round Information</span><br>
<br>
<a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Jamal+Lewis+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Jamal Lewis</a>- So far in camp Jamal has been a little slow to recover from ankle surgery.<br>
<br>
Head Coach Eric Mangini, loves to use a two man committee at running back.  Last year his committee in <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Leon+Washington%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Leon Washington</a> and <a href="http://fantasyinfo.wetpaint.com/page/Thomas+Jones%27s+Fantasy+Football+Ranking">Thomas Jones</a> work out great, so look for him to get <a href="http://www.fantasy-info.com/2009/05/fantasy-info-browns-running-back-jerome.html">Jerome Harrison</a> into the mix this season.<br>

<br>
