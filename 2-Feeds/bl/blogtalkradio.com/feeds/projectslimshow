Lakatos Shames and Elysse ("Lyssie") Lakatos share more than identical features; they share identical success in the competitive field of nutrition and wellness. In 1997 Lyssie and Tammy (known as <A href="http://www.nutritiontwins.com">The Nutrition Twins</A>®) co-founded Healthy Happenings Corporation whose mission is to better the health of its clients through improved nutrition and lifestyle/behavior modification. Since relocating from Atlanta, Georgia, the twins have had stellar achievements in New York City, where they built a successful private practice servicing both individual and corporate clients such as AOL-Time Warner and Colgate Palmolive.<IMG height=245 hspace=10 src="http://www.nutritiontwins.com/twins/images/About-Us-CoverC.jpg" width=307 align=right vspace=2> <BR><BR>The Lakatos sisters have consulted at over 200 corporations. In addition to having their own nutrition counseling practice, Tammy and Lyssie are the exclusive nutritionists for NBC's celebrities and employees at the Rockefeller Plaza; and for Juva Health and Wellness, an upscale, full-service Manhattan boutique featuring top physicians (doctors, plastics surgeons and dermatologists), all of whom teach at Mt. Sinai Medical Center. Recently, they co-branded with the prestigious fitness club, The Sports Club/LA at Rockefeller Center to offer their nutrition services. The twins also have helped fuel the U.S. "Eco-Challenge" team in preparation for the 24-hour competition, the top male players on the Worldwide Senior Tennis Circuit, and participants in varied races and marathons. They have provided wellness information for almost every type of industry, for most types of sporting activities, and across multiple forms of media. <BR><BR>In the fall of 2004 they were selected as consultants for <EM>Lean Cuisine</EM>, representing <EM>Nestlé</EM> at events across the country. The Nutrition Twins have since teamed up as consultants and spokespeople for a myriad of additional companies such as <EM>Splenda</EM>, <EM>SUBWAY®</EM>, <EM>Revivalsoy</EM>, <EM>Glenny's</EM>, <EM>Adora</EM> and <EM>David Burke's Flavor Sprays</EM> (voted as <EM>Time Magazine's "Most Amazing Inventions of 2005"</EM>), all of them choosing to follow in <EM>Nestlé's</EM> footsteps. <BR><BR>The Lakatos' approachable, common sense style has also earned them editorial success. The Twins co-authored a revolutionary nutrition book, <EM>Fire Up Your Metabolism: 9 Proven Principles for Burning Fat and Losing Weight Forever</EM>, which was released in February 2004. In addition, they have their own column, "The Dish," in <EM>Remedy Magazine</EM>. This reaches millions of readers, as its primary subscribers are doctors who circulate the journal in their waiting rooms. <BR><BR>The Twins have been featured regularly as the nutrition experts on <EM>The Discovery Health channel, WABC-TV, WPIX-TV, CBS, The Learning Channel, FitTV, Oxygen Network, Life and Style, Court TV, The Daily Health Feed</EM> and <EM>Fox 5's Good Day New York</EM>. In 2006 they appeared on a 26-episode <EM>PBS</EM> series, <EM>Real Savvy Moms</EM>, where the twins served as the nutrition experts; <EM>Real Savvy Moms</EM> DVDs will be circulated to 500,000 gynecological offices across the country for patient viewing. Tammy and Lyssie were also featured in a Fall 2006 special "makeover" show of <EM>Queer Eye for the Straight Guy</EM> in which they helped two "straight guys" to each lose sixty pounds. After much media exposure, The Twins earned the respect of several producers who have pitched various television series in which Tammy and Lyssie either host and/or co-host their own show. <BR><BR>Tammy and Lyssie have become sought-after contributors by many print and online publications, from <EM>Cosmopolitan, Self, Good Housekeeping, Vogue, InStyle, Woman's Day, Woman's World, Parents, First for Women, Oxygen, Muscle Media, OK!, Star Magazine, Fitness, Glamour, People, Health, O Magazine, Lifetime, Reader's Digest, The New York Daily News, Women's Health and Fitness, Remedy</EM> and <EM>Family Circle</EM> magazines.

<P>Born Wayne Hardnett, Atlanta rapper Bone Crusher made his mark with a likeable playground machismo and a street-smart pop sensibility. Both of those qualities were on display on his 2003 debut, AttenCHUN!, and its hit single, "Never Scared." Before his success, Bone Crusher was a part of the Lyrical Giants, a crew that worked with Too Short and Erick Sermon and whose other members -- Baby B and Bizar -- both appeared on Crusher's&nbsp; album. He then went on VH-1's Celebrity Fit Club and lost a significant amount of weight. </P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Book Premise: </B></LI></UL>
<P>The 'Flavor Point Diet' approach is based entirely on the neuroscience of appetite, and specifically, sensory specific satiety: the tendency to stay hungry longer and eat more when flavors are very diverse and keep changing, and to fill up on fewer calories when flavor variety is controlled. Using flavor themes, and by directing readers to food choices that have fewer flavors designed into them during processing, the Flavor Point Diet subdues appetite and allows for weight loss with no or minimal hunger, while maintaining a perfectly healthful, balanced diet suitable for the whole family at every step of the way.</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Goals &amp; Objectives: </B></LI></UL>
<P>To offer a 'diet' that would allow for prompt enough weight loss to satisfy the public, while avoiding the food exclusions that tend to be used to deliver rapid weight loss, then followed by rebound. To base a diet approach on 'how' to control appetite and eat less, rather than on reinventing 'what' constitutes healthful eating. To devise a plan in which the nutrition is completely sound and balanced and in accord with the highest scientific standards at every step. And to devise a 'diet' that is suitable for all members of a household, so that families are engaged in a sustainable approach to both weight control, and better overall health.</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Novel Elements: </B></LI></UL>
<P>The diet is based on a very extensive scientific literature examining the neuroscience of appetite. While building in many other elements, the main focus is on the single most important thing about food: its flavor. Flavor variety stimulates appetite, increasing the calorie count required to achieve fullness (think large family meal and feeling stuffed, then still finding room for dessert). The food industry engineers superfluous flavors into innumerable products in the form of salt in sweet foods (such as breakfast cereals and desserts), sugar in salty foods (such as dressings and spreads), and artificial flavors. The Flavor Point Diet first uses flavor themes to help readers control the overall variety of flavors in their typical day, meal, and snack; and then guides readers to achieve the same thing at the level of individual foods by choosing those items that avoid or minimize unnecessary flavor additions.</P>
<P>The Flavor Point Diet approach was crafted only after an extensive review of the scientific literature on weight control, and appetite regulation. The meal plan was 'home made' rather than farmed out to professional chefs, and 'field tested' in the Katz household consisting of 2 adults and 5 children ranging in age from 6 to 17.</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Relevant clinical experience: </B></LI></UL>
<P>I have been using the principle of sensory specific satiety in dietary counseling to excellent effect for nearly 15 years.</P><BR/><BR><BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<TABLE cellSpacing=20 cellPadding=0 width="100%" border=0>

<P>To offer a 'diet' that would allow for prompt enough weight loss to satisfy the public, while avoiding the food exclusions that tend to be used to deliver rapid weight loss, then followed by rebound. To base a diet approach on 'how' to control appetite and eat less, rather than on reinventing 'what' constitutes healthful eating. To devise a plan in which the nutrition is completely sound and balanced and in accord with the highest scientific standards at every step. And to devise a 'diet' that is suitable for all members of a household, so that families are engaged in a sustainable approach to both weight control, and better overall health.</P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Novel Elements: </B></LI></UL>
<P>The diet is based on a very extensive scientific literature examining the neuroscience of appetite. While building in many other elements, the main focus is on the single most important thing about food: its flavor. Flavor variety stimulates appetite, increasing the calorie count required to achieve fullness (think large family meal and feeling stuffed, then still finding room for dessert). The food industry engineers superfluous flavors into innumerable products in the form of salt in sweet foods (such as breakfast cereals and desserts), sugar in salty foods (such as dressings and spreads), and artificial flavors. The Flavor Point Diet first uses flavor themes to help readers control the overall variety of flavors in their typical day, meal, and snack; and then guides readers to achieve the same thing at the level of individual foods by choosing those items that avoid or minimize unnecessary flavor additions.</P>
<P>The Flavor Point Diet approach was crafted only after an extensive review of the scientific literature on weight control, and appetite regulation. The meal plan was 'home made' rather than farmed out to professional chefs, and 'field tested' in the Katz household consisting of 2 adults and 5 children ranging in age from 6 to 17.</P>

<DIV align=left>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>I knew that my cholesterol had been seriously elevated for several years.

Attempts to treat my dangerously high cholesterol (triglycerides over 400) with medication resulted in triglyceride levels of almost 900. I was informed that they couldn't even measure cholesterol accurately at levels that high.

<DIV align=left>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>I quit going to that doctor - and I quit taking the medications.

<DIV align=left>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>And then I realized that I was about to turn 35. Wait a minute. I am not done living!

<DIV align=left>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>And then one day, my husband came home and changed my life forever. Just because he doesn't like to read ~ and he decided he wanted to lose some weight. He had run into a friend who had lost 45 pounds on the Atkins diet. "But that's not supposed to be safe" I protested. "How do you know?" he asked. I realized that I really didn't know enough about it to have an opinion. So I agreed to purchase and read the book on his behalf. After all, I loved to read, and if he was going on a diet, I, as the cook, would have to be briefed.</FONT> </P></DIV>
<DIV align=left>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>By the time I finished the first chapter, I was in tears. Dr. Atkins was describing ME. What's more, he swore there was an easy, healthy way to regain the old me. I finished the book, and I read it again. A few days later, three days before my 35th birthday, I started a low carb diet combining principles from Atkins and Protein Power. Five weeks later, I smoked my last cigarette. My cravings for food had gone away. Why couldn't it work for nicotine too? I don't really know if it was the diet that helped me get over my cravings for cigarettes, or the fact that the diet eliminated ALL my food cravings, which meant that I could safely quit the cigarettes without pigging out, but either way, I was able to quit smoking for good on March 4, 2000, and after the first three days, it was easy.</FONT> </P></DIV>
<DIV align=left>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>Eight weeks into this diet I had my cholesterol tested. It was within "norms" already! This is not a diet. This is a life change that this yeast bread baker and worshiper has found incredibly easy to commit to. Once you give up refined carbohydrates, and find a hidden well of energy you NEVER knew existed (even as a child) once you witness your own always-lackluster and weak hair and nails begin to grow out luxuriously strong and healthy, once you begin exercising not out of any sense of obligation or guilt but out of sheer enthusiasm for how good you feel, why, you find that sugar and flour do not tempt you. Not that I will never eat any again. Don't misunderstand me. It is just that I will never blindly eat either one again. I am now aware of the deadly chain reaction they cause inside my incredibly efficient body. And I am losing weight that I will NEVER gain back. And as God is my witness, I WILL NEVER BE HUNGRY AGAIN. I have never once been hungry since I went lowcarb. Not once. This is nothing like every other time I tried to do the right thing for myself and my body. This is different. It is unthinkable to me to ever go back to the way I was. I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that I WILL reach a "normal" weight. It may take a while, but it will happen. It is a side effect of my new way of life, you see. An unavoidable, very pleasant side effect!</FONT> </P></DIV>
<DIV align=left>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>Postscript re: cholesterol: I want to be perfectly honest with you. I have been retesting my lipids regularly and I did go through some variations. But after years of low carb eating, I can confidently say that my ratios are better than ever and the ONLY number that is even borderline is my LDL, which is a little higher than the "ideal". As I said, however, my RATIOS are very good, and many doctors consider those to be much more important the "just the numbers".&nbsp;</FONT> </P></DIV>

<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>This is a picture of us on vacation in 2002, and it's a fair representation of our weights to this day. I am proud to be able to say that we have each maintained a 65 pound loss with ease. I never did lose as many total pounds as I expected to (my thighs are the body part I am least happy with, and in truth, I rarely wear shorts like these since I feel much thinner in pants or skirts). These days I can also be found wearing my more comfortable 16s more often than the snug 14s I can still wear with pride, but I figure - hey, this is the weight and size I can maintain with ease, and this is obviously where my body is comfortable - so get used to it, and just let go of any unrealistic 'swimsuit model' goal image! One thing I have finally learned, and accepted, after more than three years of effort, is that numbers are just that - numbers, and nothing more. Healthy and happy is the ultimate goal, and YES! I am there..</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>January 2002: I go sledding with my then 10 year old son and my husband, and my life changes forever...</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>&nbsp;On my fifth ride down the hill, I bounced off the inner-tube and landed on the hard ground instead, causing a compression fracture of my L3 vertebrae that would confine me to my bed or a horrible brace for months afterwards. My spine actually continued to collapse for the first few months, but thanks to lots of care, rest, and good nutrition, and the fact that I was in pretty good shape when the accident occurred, I've made a good recovery. I still have an 11% curvature of the spine, and I don't enjoy sitting much, but by May 2002 I was riding my motorcycle again (gingerly of course) and by December of 2002, I was downhill skiing again. I did sell my dirt bike, I won't ever snowmobile again, and I can't ski the bumps, but these are things I can happily live with, considering the alternative. Because I was already working at home when this happened, I was more fortunate than most people in the same situation - I ended up with a very sophisticated wireless network that I thoroughly appreciate to this day, and I was able to carry on in my chosen career.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>Once I got my spine stabliized, I had to deal with the very large kidney stones that had announced their presence on numerous xrays taken after my accident. The very size of these stones was proof enough to my urologist and myself that these were old stones that had started to form long, long before I started low carb. (I feel the need to point this out because of that old tired myth about low carb eating causing kidney damage. In my case, it was years of low fat and yoyo dieting that preceded the kidney damage.) I had several debilitating lithotripsy procedures to pass those monsters, and then once I got over that, I promptly had a partial hysterectomy. Through all of this, low carb has been the constant, the rock, upon which I have drawn strength. No matter how out of control the rest of my life can be, I am ALWAYS in complete and total control of one thing - what does and does not go into my mouth. Maintenance has been a joy for me, and I will control my carbs, and thus my weight, for life. I still have not eaten any real sugar or fresh corn or white potatoes, and perhaps I never will - they seem like a very small price to pay in return for never again worrying about whether my butt will fit in the restaurant or airplane seat to which I am assigned. I do enjoy&nbsp; a wide range of fruit and vegetables as well as my own wholesome bread and bagels, and I can easily find acceptable ice cream, whole wheat pastas and crackers, etc. in stores across the nation.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>In October of 2002, I was honored by being featured on the Atkins Center site as a low carb success story, and later I was actually quoted by Dr. Atkins in <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312315228/trulylowcarb">Atkins for Life</A>. I wrote my first cookbook in 2000 while actively losing weight, and all the recipes in that cookbook are indeed "truly low" in carbs. I published my second low carb cookbook in November 2003. Volume II features a wide range of recipes suitable from induction through lifetime maintenance, so that <U>everyone</U> can enjoy bread, bagels, pizza, margaritas, etc. - while still maintaining their health and weight.</FONT></P>

What's more, he swore there was an easy, healthy way to regain the old me. I finished the book, and I read it again. A few days later, three days before my 35th birthday, I started a low carb diet combining principles from Atkins and Protein Power. Five weeks later, I smoked my last cigarette. My cravings for food had gone away. Why couldn't it work for nicotine too? I don't really know if it was the diet that helped me get over my cravings for cigarettes, or the fact that the diet eliminated ALL my food cravings, which meant that I could safely quit the cigarettes without pigging out, but either way, I was able to quit smoking for good on March 4, 2000, and after the first three days, it was easy.</FONT> </P></DIV>
<DIV align=left>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>Eight weeks into this diet I had my cholesterol tested. It was within "norms" already! This is not a diet. This is a life change that this yeast bread baker and worshiper has found incredibly easy to commit to. Once you give up refined carbohydrates, and find a hidden well of energy you NEVER knew existed (even as a child) once you witness your own always-lackluster and weak hair and nails begin to grow out luxuriously strong and healthy, once you begin exercising not out of any sense of obligation or guilt but out of sheer enthusiasm for how good you feel, why, you find that sugar and flour do not tempt you. Not that I will never eat any again. Don't misunderstand me. It is just that I will never blindly eat either one again. I am now aware of the deadly chain reaction they cause inside my incredibly efficient body. And I am losing weight that I will NEVER gain back. And as God is my witness, I WILL NEVER BE HUNGRY AGAIN. I have never once been hungry since I went lowcarb. Not once. This is nothing like every other time I tried to do the right thing for myself and my body. This is different. It is unthinkable to me to ever go back to the way I was. I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that I WILL reach a "normal" weight. It may take a while, but it will happen. It is a side effect of my new way of life, you see. An unavoidable, very pleasant side effect!</FONT> </P></DIV>
<DIV align=left>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>Postscript re: cholesterol: I want to be perfectly honest with you. I have been retesting my lipids regularly and I did go through some variations. But after years of low carb eating, I can confidently say that my ratios are better than ever and the ONLY number that is even borderline is my LDL, which is a little higher than the "ideal". As I said, however, my RATIOS are very good, and many doctors consider those to be much more important the "just the numbers".&nbsp;</FONT> </P></DIV>

<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>This is a picture of us on vacation in 2002, and it's a fair representation of our weights to this day. I am proud to be able to say that we have each maintained a 65 pound loss with ease. I never did lose as many total pounds as I expected to (my thighs are the body part I am least happy with, and in truth, I rarely wear shorts like these since I feel much thinner in pants or skirts). These days I can also be found wearing my more comfortable 16s more often than the snug 14s I can still wear with pride, but I figure - hey, this is the weight and size I can maintain with ease, and this is obviously where my body is comfortable - so get used to it, and just let go of any unrealistic 'swimsuit model' goal image! One thing I have finally learned, and accepted, after more than three years of effort, is that numbers are just that - numbers, and nothing more. Healthy and happy is the ultimate goal, and YES! I am there..</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>January 2002: I go sledding with my then 10 year old son and my husband, and my life changes forever...</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>&nbsp;On my fifth ride down the hill, I bounced off the inner-tube and landed on the hard ground instead, causing a compression fracture of my L3 vertebrae that would confine me to my bed or a horrible brace for months afterwards. My spine actually continued to collapse for the first few months, but thanks to lots of care, rest, and good nutrition, and the fact that I was in pretty good shape when the accident occurred, I've made a good recovery. I still have an 11% curvature of the spine, and I don't enjoy sitting much, but by May 2002 I was riding my motorcycle again (gingerly of course) and by December of 2002, I was downhill skiing again. I did sell my dirt bike, I won't ever snowmobile again, and I can't ski the bumps, but these are things I can happily live with, considering the alternative. Because I was already working at home when this happened, I was more fortunate than most people in the same situation - I ended up with a very sophisticated wireless network that I thoroughly appreciate to this day, and I was able to carry on in my chosen career.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>Once I got my spine stabliized, I had to deal with the very large kidney stones that had announced their presence on numerous xrays taken after my accident. The very size of these stones was proof enough to my urologist and myself that these were old stones that had started to form long, long before I started low carb. (I feel the need to point this out because of that old tired myth about low carb eating causing kidney damage. In my case, it was years of low fat and yoyo dieting that preceded the kidney damage.) I had several debilitating lithotripsy procedures to pass those monsters, and then once I got over that, I promptly had a partial hysterectomy. Through all of this, low carb has been the constant, the rock, upon which I have drawn strength. No matter how out of control the rest of my life can be, I am ALWAYS in complete and total control of one thing - what does and does not go into my mouth. Maintenance has been a joy for me, and I will control my carbs, and thus my weight, for life. I still have not eaten any real sugar or fresh corn or white potatoes, and perhaps I never will - they seem like a very small price to pay in return for never again worrying about whether my butt will fit in the restaurant or airplane seat to which I am assigned. I do enjoy&nbsp; a wide range of fruit and vegetables as well as my own wholesome bread and bagels, and I can easily find acceptable ice cream, whole wheat pastas and crackers, etc. in stores across the nation.</FONT></P>
<P align=justify><FONT class=Helvetica16 face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial Narrow" size=2>In October of 2002, I was honored by being featured on the Atkins Center site as a low carb success story, and later I was actually quoted by Dr. Atkins in <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312315228/trulylowcarb">Atkins for Life</A>. I wrote my first cookbook in 2000 while actively losing weight, and all the recipes in that cookbook are indeed "truly low" in carbs. I published my second low carb cookbook in November 2003. Volume II features a wide range of recipes suitable from induction through lifetime maintenance, so that <U>everyone</U> can enjoy bread, bagels, pizza, margaritas, etc. - while still maintaining their health and weight.</FONT></P>

<P>Tamilee Webb earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Physical Education and a Master of Arts degree in Exercise Science both attained at California State University, Chico. She has furthered her education with involvement in IDEA, AFAA, ACE, and FROG’S Athletic Club and is now CEO of Webb International, Inc. In 1993, Tamilee was recognized by her peers with the Fitness Instructor of the Year award, bestowed by IDEA, the association of fitness professionals, after having been a three-time nominee in the category. In 1992, she received the coveted Self Magazine Award for best lower body exercise for her third in a series of twenty-two award-winning Buns of Steel videos. Tamilee has been the recipient of numerous other awards for outstanding achievement in the field of personal fitness, including Best Exercise Video and Best Training Organization 1987, conferred by IDEA, has been honored by California State University, Chico, Outstanding Alumni of 1990 and 1996. </P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>
<P>Millions of fans worldwide have long admired Tamilee’s no-nonsense approach to mind, body, health and fitness that can be achieved within the home. Her energy, exuberance and specially designed proven workout programs have consistently elevated her to the top of the Billboard charts. Her three best-selling books “The Original Rubber Band Workout” (sold in six countries and translated into five languages), “Step-up Fitness”, both published by Workman Publishers, and her third book, “Workout for Dummies” (IDG Books), have contributed to the renown that she has so deservedly earned. </P>
<P>Tamilee has been a co-host on the Health Network Channel’s aerobic fitness shows. The network services more than 50 million households and its audience continues to grow rapidly. She has also hosted ESPN’s Fitness Pro Series, co-hosted the Buns of Steel Platinum Series, and the Buns of Steel Quick-Toning Series, and acted as a consultant for Fox Sport Body Squad Fitness Programs.</P>
<P>Tamilee’s knowledge and acquired experience, combined with her contagious energy, and effervescent personality, have made her an ideal guest speaker on top-rated television talk shows, including VH1 Booty Call, NBC’s Weekend Today, Entertainment Tonight, KTLA Morning News, The Today Show, The Other Half, Home Matters, and “E” Entertainment. Her well-toned body has graced the covers of Shape Magazine, Home Gym and Fitness Magazine, and Diet and Exercise Magazine, and she has been featured in S.D. Sports and Fitness, Fit Magazine, Men’s Fitness Magazine, Vogue and Billboard.</P>
<P>Tamilee realizes the impact that she has on those who rely on her to maintain and improve their health and fitness, and she takes her responsibility seriously. Her videos are released to the public only after having undergone extensive scientific testing and research as to their safety and effectiveness. She is always aware of the fact that her exercise programs are followed by people of different body types and levels of fitness. With this in mind, she does not treat her responsibility lightly. No video is released to the public without first receiving E.M.G. approval. Product and equipment receive her endorsements only after serious scrutiny to their quality and results. Seen on her most recent infomercial is one of her newest and approved finds, the AbAway Pro abdominal exercise machine.</P>
<P>Tamilee Webb continues to dominate in a field that has grown competitively. Her workouts have found their way into the homes and offices of people who appreciate the importance of good health and fitness of mind and body as necessary ingredients for longevity and quality of life. She has dedicated herself to a goal from which she has never allowed herself to be deterred.</P>

Her three best-selling books “The Original Rubber Band Workout” (sold in six countries and translated into five languages), “Step-up Fitness”, both published by Workman Publishers, and her third book, “Workout for Dummies” (IDG Books), have contributed to the renown that she has so deservedly earned. </P>
<P>Tamilee has been a co-host on the Health Network Channel’s aerobic fitness shows. The network services more than 50 million households and its audience continues to grow rapidly. She has also hosted ESPN’s Fitness Pro Series, co-hosted the Buns of Steel Platinum Series, and the Buns of Steel Quick-Toning Series, and acted as a consultant for Fox Sport Body Squad Fitness Programs.</P>
<P>Tamilee’s knowledge and acquired experience, combined with her contagious energy, and effervescent personality, have made her an ideal guest speaker on top-rated television talk shows, including VH1 Booty Call, NBC’s Weekend Today, Entertainment Tonight, KTLA Morning News, The Today Show, The Other Half, Home Matters, and “E” Entertainment. Her well-toned body has graced the covers of Shape Magazine, Home Gym and Fitness Magazine, and Diet and Exercise Magazine, and she has been featured in S.D. Sports and Fitness, Fit Magazine, Men’s Fitness Magazine, Vogue and Billboard.</P>
<P>Tamilee realizes the impact that she has on those who rely on her to maintain and improve their health and fitness, and she takes her responsibility seriously. Her videos are released to the public only after having undergone extensive scientific testing and research as to their safety and effectiveness. She is always aware of the fact that her exercise programs are followed by people of different body types and levels of fitness. With this in mind, she does not treat her responsibility lightly. No video is released to the public without first receiving E.M.G. approval. Product and equipment receive her endorsements only after serious scrutiny to their quality and results. Seen on her most recent infomercial is one of her newest and approved finds, the AbAway Pro abdominal exercise machine.</P>
<P>Tamilee Webb continues to dominate in a field that has grown competitively. Her workouts have found their way into the homes and offices of people who appreciate the importance of good health and fitness of mind and body as necessary ingredients for longevity and quality of life. She has dedicated herself to a goal from which she has never allowed herself to be deterred.</P>

That's pretty incredible".&nbsp; Oprah's comments were addressing Jennifer Nicole Lee's fascinating weight loss success story in which this totally focused mother of 2 toddler sons shed about 70 lbs. leading her to win the title of Ms. Bikini America. (Go to Resume section of this site to view Oprah, CBS early Morning Show, and Inside Editoin footage). And her response to why enter a figure competition after giving birth to her second son?&nbsp; "I wanted to prove the point that you can be a mother and still be sexy and fit'.&nbsp; She certainly got her point across and the media did agree.&nbsp; In 67 years of the Weider legacy, Jennifer Nicole Lee (or JNL for short) was recently named the first ever Ms Muscle and Fitness, with a letter from the editor writing about him first seeing her and a glorious spread in the February 2006 issue.&nbsp; But she not only has the men's attention, the women are fans as well.&nbsp; Just check the intimate look at JNL that Muscle and Fitness Hers showcases in their March 2006 issue. </P>

<P>JNL follows up her 2006 calendar with a bang!&nbsp; Her "Sophomore" 2007 calendar is better than ever as she gives her fans diversified looks including more than just swimwear. She teamed up with the hottest, youngest, and freshest photographer in the bikini world: Andy MacFarland who also shot her Swimsuit Annual Edition American Curves Cover. And his resume includes working with beauties such as Vida Guerra and Melyssa Ford.&nbsp; JNL states "My 2007 is better than ever, because I went above and beyond with hair, makeup, lighting, and location.&nbsp; I chose my home, South Beach, the funnest place on earth to shoot! </P>
<P>JF Turner and Associates, the biggest distributor of official licensed entertainment and professional sport memorabilia, has taken notice to JNL's rise.&nbsp; If the deal goes through JNL will join the likes of celebrities like Pamela Anderson, Anna Kournikova, and the athletic stars of the NBA, MLB, and NFL.&nbsp; Stay tuned to see if this big time deal pans out!</P>

<P>JNL teamed up with the authentic Brazilian Swimwear line Fiu Fiu (see <A href="http://www.fiufiu.com">www.fiufiu.com</A>) to create a swimsuit line so authentic, sexy, and yet functional.&nbsp; She describes her JNL/Fiu Fiu brand as "Something you can wear right from the beach, add a cover up or drawstring pant and go straight to dinner or dancing.&nbsp; My line is where functionality meets fashion making it a breeze to lead a high demanding life with style!" </P>
