Seven-year-old Julian – whom cops say may be a witness to the killings – has been missing since Darnell and Jason were shot in their Chicago home Friday. William Balfour, 27, is being held in suspicion of the murders. Chicago police said the suspect took Julian with him when he fled the scene of the carnage. Anyone with information as to Julian’s whereabouts is being asked to call 911 or the Chicago Police Department at (312)747-8380. Balfour’s mother, Michelle, told The Associated Press that her son had been married to Jennifer’s sister, Julia, for several years, but they were separated. She also said Darnell told him to move out of the family’s home last year. Jennifer’s Happier Times Earlier this year, Jennifer, 27, appeared on BlogTalkRadio from the set of The Secret Life of Bees. She called in to support Craig Lewis, frontman for The Craig Lewis Band. During the segment, Craig gave BlogTalkRadio listeners a sampling of his astounding singing talent, which blew Jennifer away. “Can you imagine what a Craig Lewis Band-Jennifer Hudson collaboration would be like?” asked host Darryl Roberts. Shrieked Jennifer: “That’s an idea, y’all!” In addition to this January 2008 show, Jennifer appeared on BlogTalkRadio in March 2007 for 90 minutes. To hear that show, click here. Meanwhile, our prayers are with you, Jennifer. The BlogTalkRadio community is praying for your nephew’s safe return as well. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/i-love-new-york/'>i love new york</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/i-love-new-york.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/i-love-new-york.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/jennifer-hudson/'>jennifer hudson</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jennifer-hudson.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jennifer-hudson.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/singing/'>singing</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/singing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/singing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Oct. 26, 2008 – In the wake of the horrific slayings of Jennifer Hudson’s mom, Darnell Donerson, 57, and brother, Jason Hudson, 29, authorities have issued a nationwide Amber Alert for the Oscar Winner’s nephew, Julian King.

Seven-year-old Julian has been missing since Darnell and Jason were shot in their Chicago home Friday. William Balfour, 27, is being held in suspicion of the murders. Chicago police said the suspect took Julian with him when he fled the scene of the carnage. Anyone with information as to Julian’s whereabouts is being asked to call 911 or the Chicago Police Department at (312)747-8380. Meanwhile, the Hudson family is offering a $100,000 reward for the boy`s safe return. Balfour’s mother, Michelle, told The Associated Press that her son had been married to Jennifer’s sister, Julia, for several years, but they were separated. She also said Darnell moved out of the family’s home last year. Jennifer’s Happier Times During this March 2007 interview, Jennifer, now 27, belted out a few joyful measures of one of her favorite gospel standards.

Seven-year-old Julian has been missing since Darnell and Jason were shot in their Chicago home Friday. William Balfour, 27, is being held in suspicion of the murders. Chicago police said the suspect took Julian with him when he fled the scene of the carnage. Anyone with information as to Julian’s whereabouts is being asked to call 911 or the Chicago Police Department at (312)747-8380. Meanwhile, the Hudson family is offering a $100,000 reward for the boy`s safe return. Balfour’s mother, Michelle, told The Associated Press that her son had been married to Jennifer’s sister, Julia, for several years, but they were separated. She also said Darnell moved out of the family’s home last year.
