Kennedy University. He worked for 14 years as a social worker in impoverished areas before returning to graduate school. Dr. Surprise received his license as a psychologist in 2009, and currently works in an advanced outpatient program for the state of California. He is a professional communicator, having given workshops and lectures on his subject, and conducts psycho educational groups on a wide variety of subjects for the state of California. The inspiration for his writing comes from a lifelong interest in psychology, metaphysics, philosophy, history, science, and his work with his clients. His interest in Synchronicity stemmed from experiencing frequent and surprising SE, and needing a working understanding of the phenomena. The model of SE he teaches was a response by SE themselves to his asking &ldquo;How does synchronicity work?&rdquo; He was born in Glen Cove Long Island. He grew up in Bethpage, New York, with his parents Gladys and Alfred, and his older brother Tom. Dr. Surprise met his wife Patricia while in college in New York. They have been married for 28 years and have two children, Vencenza and George. This afternoon, he joins the co-hosts of ISIS Paranormal Radio to discuss his new book, Synchronicity: The Art of Coincidence, Change, and Unlocking Your Mind.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/synchronicity/'>Synchronicity</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/synchronicity.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/synchronicity.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dr-kirby-surprise/'>Dr Kirby Surprise</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dr-kirby-surprise.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dr-kirby-surprise.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/coincidences/'>coincidences</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/coincidences.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/coincidences.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal/'>paranormal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/free-paranormal-radio/'>free paranormal radio</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/free-paranormal-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/free-paranormal-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Dr. Kirby Surprise received his Doctorate in Counseling Psychology in 2007 from the Institute for Integral Studies in San Francisco and his Masters in Advanced Psychodynamic and Transpersonal Studies from John F.

Growing up in a family with roots down in the Bayou, readers and candle burning for luck and money were not unusual. Ursulas mother and grandmother both have the gift of sight, although they may not admit it. Ursula did not embrace her gifts until later in life, when she allowed herself to open up spiritually and mentally. Once that happened, the flood gates opened. Always interested in the paranormal, Ursula began experimenting with EVPs. It was at this time that she started noticing her abilities to communicate with the spirits. No matter what device she used (digital recorder, tape or computer) she was receiving very clear messages. She began experimenting with ghost boxes (radio transmitters that sweep the airwaves) and once again she was getting uncanny messages from beyond. However, these were intelligent responses that referred to her by name and often mentioned her childrens names. Her senses began to develop where she began to smell and feel the presence of spirits. As her senses improved, so did her sight. Yes, she was now vividly seeing spirits to point where she could describe their gender, features and clothing. Ursula suddenly was being contacted from individual all over the globe who were drawn to her because of her gift. They convinced her that she needs to embrace her gift and help others pursue the light. Through a chance meeting over the net, Ursula was introduced to Frank Sumption, creator of the "Franks Box". He sent one to Ursula because he said he had been hearing her name for years on the boxes and thought she was supposed to have one. Since that time, he and Ursula have become long distance friends and he has shared a few more boxes with her. Ursula is now using the boxes and meditation to communicate with spirits that are looking to crossover into the light. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/evp/'>EVP</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/evp.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/evp.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/electronic-voice-phenomena/'>electronic voice phenomena</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/electronic-voice-phenomena.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/electronic-voice-phenomena.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/spirit-communication/'>spirit communication</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirit-communication.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirit-communication.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal-research/'>paranormal research</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal-research.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal-research.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal-radio/'>paranormal radio</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Ursula has always been connected spiritually.

Growing up in a family with roots down in the Bayou, readers and candle burning for luck and money were not unusual. Ursulas mother and grandmother both have the gift of sight, although they may not admit it. Ursula did not embrace her gifts until later in life, when she allowed herself to open up spiritually and mentally. Once that happened, the flood gates opened. Always interested in the paranormal, Ursula began experimenting with EVPs. It was at this time that she started noticing her abilities to communicate with the spirits. No matter what device she used (digital recorder, tape or computer) she was receiving very clear messages. She began experimenting with ghost boxes (radio transmitters that sweep the airwaves) and once again she was getting uncanny messages from beyond. However, these were intelligent responses that referred to her by name and often mentioned her childrens names. Her senses began to develop where she began to smell and feel the presence of spirits. As her senses improved, so did her sight. Yes, she was now vividly seeing spirits to point where she could describe their gender, features and clothing. Ursula suddenly was being contacted from individual all over the globe who were drawn to her because of her gift. They convinced her that she needs to embrace her gift and help others pursue the light. Through a chance meeting over the net, Ursula was introduced to Frank Sumption, creator of the "Franks Box". He sent one to Ursula because he said he had been hearing her name for years on the boxes and thought she was supposed to have one. Since that time, he and Ursula have become long distance friends and he has shared a few more boxes with her. Ursula is now using the boxes and meditation to communicate with spirits that are looking to crossover into the light. </itunes:summary><itunes:duration>01:00:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2012/03/04/isis-paranormal-radio-with-ursula-kalin.mp3" fileSize="14363086" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2012/03/04/isis-paranormal-radio-with-ursula-kalin.wma" fileSize="14363086" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>ISISXParanormal</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>EVP,electronic voice phenomena,spirit communication,paranormal research,paranormal radio,BlogTalkRadio, Blog Talk Radio</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>ISIS Paranormal Radio with Ursula Kalin</itunes:subtitle><itunes:image href="http://cdn.btrcdn.com/pics/showpics/large/bc975686-4b2d-45ea-ad4d-c95f668f0b6aisisradioicon.jpg" /></item><item><title>ISIS Paranormal Radio with Stephen Ellis - Feb 12,2012</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2012/02/12/isis-paranormal-radio-with-stephen-ellis</link><description><![CDATA[ Stephen Ellis is currently serving his fourth four-year term of office as a Referee for the Superior Court of California.

Her fascination with the world of the unseen was sparked early in life by her own mystical out-of-body experiences and communications with the other side.

Her fascination with the world of the unseen was sparked early in life by her own mystical out-of-body experiences and communications with the other side. She lives with her family in Southern California. Did you know Tony Bennett, Ernest Hemingway, and Carl Jung all had near death experiences? Or, that evidence supports Abraham Lincoln used spiritualism during the Civil War to obtain military information? Have you ever experienced bilocation or wondered about the difference between clairvoyance, clairscentience, and clairaudience? In an A-Z format (from Acheron to Zoroaster), Encyclopedia of the Unseen World provides a fascinating trip to the world beyond the known.

Turner, M.D. is the author of Medicine, Miracles and Manifestations: A Doctors Journey Through the Worlds of Divine Intervention, Near-Death Experiences, and Universal Energy; the book is a nonfiction work that explores Dr. Turner&rsquo;s career as a surgeon and his spiritual quest as he became involved in the field of Integral Medicine. Following his graduation from Ohio State University and earning his degree in Engineering Physics, Dr. Turner continued onto graduate school. About three years into his graduate studies, Dr. Turner received a book on Edgar Cayce called The Sleeping Prophet. The book changed Dr. Turner&rsquo;s life, and he became excited about the existence of a spiritual world. Dr. Turner then decided to attend Ohio State University College of Medicine where he earned his M.D. During his career as a surgeon, Dr. Turners curiosity about the spiritual world prompted him to examine several nontraditional healing modalities that broadened the scope of his patients&rsquo; recovery; healing modalities that include the use of Johrei (a Japanese healing art), chanting, meditation, soul travel, astral projection, and precognition/remote viewing. Medicine, Miracles, and Manifestations is a work that examines how metaphysical events like telepathy, remote viewing, and life after death are verifiable manifestations and are events that occur when the human brain interfaces with the universal consciousness.

He has always been able to see and understand things others could not, (though as a child he thought everyone could see what he saw!). As a young man Ahura received 6 years of intensive training under a great teacher who taught him to focus his gifts and enhance them. In addition to a wide array of metaphysical disciplines, he also trained extensively in martial arts, dance, and the visual arts. His predilection for strength and authority coupled with his natural telepathic ability led to a focus in protection and self-defense, both physical and metaphysical. He discovered that he had a natural ability not only for seeing, but being able to eradicate harmful entities and negative energy from people&rsquo;s homes, which he refers to as Psychic Policework (also known as exorcism). He developed an organization called the Unicorn Rangers Psychic Police Department through which he rids people&rsquo;s homes of dangerous entities, remove curses and teaches people to keep themselves and their loved ones safe. He trains students with similar inclinations in Psychic Policework to assist him. After years of teaching throughout the United States he realized his dream by opening his own school, where he now teaches full-time.

He has always been able to see and understand things others could not, (though as a child he thought everyone could see what he saw!). As a young man Ahura received 6 years of intensive training under a great teacher who taught him to focus his gifts and enhance them. In addition to a wide array of metaphysical disciplines, he also trained extensively in martial arts, dance, and the visual arts. His predilection for strength and authority coupled with his natural telepathic ability led to a focus in protection and self-defense, both physical and metaphysical. He discovered that he had a natural ability not only for seeing, but being able to eradicate harmful entities and negative energy from people&rsquo;s homes, which he refers to as Psychic Policework (also known as exorcism). He developed an organization called the Unicorn Rangers Psychic Police Department through which he rids people&rsquo;s homes of dangerous entities, remove curses and teaches people to keep themselves and their loved ones safe. He trains students with similar inclinations in Psychic Policework to assist him. After years of teaching throughout the United States he realized his dream by opening his own school, where he now teaches full-time. Through Unicorn Cove School of Metaphysics he offers classes in a wide array of disciplines.

He was a member of the now defunct Ghosthunters Society of Pennsylvania and has spent time investigating haunted locations all over the country. He resides in East Earl, Pennsylvania with his wife Cindy, and their extremely spoiled toy red poodle named Toby, who helps keep him sane in an insane world.

She has received honors and awards for her books on American history, and has lectured at the Smithsonian, West Point and Gettysburg. Astronomy and the space program are also favorite topics for her books, articles and lectures. In addition, Linda has ...appeared at major science fiction conventions for her two novels. Several years ago, Linda was giving a series of history lectures for the bicentennial of Rockland County, in southern New York&amp;rsquo;s beautiful Hudson Valley. One evening, someone asked about local ghosts and legends, so Linda told the one ghost story she knew. A few days later, she received a call.

Her personal area of spiritual dedication is in West African based religion including various sects of Vodou and Santeria. She is a recognized authority on these subjects. She is also deeply connected to her Native American heritage and conducts ritual in some of these traditions as well. She conducts private ceremonies in a number of different traditions depending on the needs of the client. She can perform legal marriages as well as alternative union/wedding ceremonies. She also performs house cleansings and blessings,and baby blessings as well as all other traditional clergy services. The Temple of The Altar-Native Star is an eclectic teaching oriented temple lead by Priestess/Rev. Claudia Williams and Priest/Psychic Phillip Humphreys. Together they conduct public and private ceremonies in virtually all non Judeo-Christian traditions. They enjoy performing rituals that suit their clients specific needs and make the ceremony as accessible as possible to the client. However, while they enjoy tailoring rituals to suit the tastes of clients, they adhere strictly to the appropriate confines of ceremony depending on the tradition in which they are performing a ritual. The Temple of The Altar-Native Star holds weekly Vodou rituals on Saturday nights at 8:30pm in the Starling Magickal Occult Shop Courtyard weather permitting. Ritual purpose and schedules permitting, some nights rituals include both a European Witchcraft segment as well as the traditional Vodou ritual: both parts dedicated to the same purpose. Those interested are encouraged to call and find out what deity is being honored or what issue is being addressed as ceremonies vary weekly. Tonight, Priestess Claudia re-joins us to discuss some of the difficulties associated with being a practitioner of an "alternative" religion.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/priestess-claudia/'>Priestess Claudia</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/priestess-claudia.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/priestess-claudia.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/alternative-religion/'>alternative religion</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/alternative-religion.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/alternative-religion.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/magick/'>magick</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/magick.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/magick.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/witchcraft/'>Witchcraft</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/witchcraft.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/witchcraft.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/free-paranormal-radio/'>free paranormal radio</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/free-paranormal-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/free-paranormal-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Priestess Claudia Williams is a licensed and ordained Minister of Ancient Ways in the state of Louisiana.

What is left out is that these images are recollections of something else; they are memories of experiences, some fanciful, some shatteringly real.&amp;rdquo; The first time Andrew had a precognitive dream about the future, it helped him to avert a mugging and even possibly saved his live. Over a period of twenty years, Andrew meticulously recorded his dreams and discovered the process that future or precognitive dreams are not only possible, they are common. Even more importantly, because of precognitive dreams and their quantity, Andrew was able to see his dreams were not merely isolated events, but remembered clips of a continuum of existed shared by everybody. In his ground breaking new book, Andrew Paquette destroys the myths pertaining to what dreams are, how they are described, their meaning, and why they are or are not important. Tonight, Andrew joins us live to discuss he writing in: Dreamer: 20 Years of Psychic Dreams and How They Changed My Life.</itunes:summary><itunes:duration>00:59:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2011/06/12/isis-paranormal-radio-and-andrew-paquette.mp3" fileSize="14081381" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2011/06/12/isis-paranormal-radio-and-andrew-paquette.wma" fileSize="14081381" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>ISISXParanormal</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>Andrew Paquette,Precognitive Dreams,dream interpretation,symbolism,free paranormal radio,BlogTalkRadio, Blog Talk Radio</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>ISIS Paranormal Radio and Andrew Paquette</itunes:subtitle><itunes:image href="http://cdn.btrcdn.com/pics/showpics/large/bc975686-4b2d-45ea-ad4d-c95f668f0b6aisisradioicon.jpg" /></item><item><title>ISIS Paranormal Radio with Joan Ranquet - Jun 05,2011</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2011/06/05/isis-paranormal-radio-with-joan-ranquet</link><description><![CDATA[ Joan Ranquet, the author of Communication with All Life: Revelations of an Animal Communicator, has been an energy healer and animal communicator for several years.

He unifies his three years of experience in research, healing, and teaching in his brand new book: Dream Symbology Dictionary. Schwartz delves into the fascinating phenomenon of symbology and makes the mind body connection. In his book, he explains how the waking mind is affected by the wisdom found in dreams, and he also sets guidelines for dream interpretation so that subconscious clues can be used to gain profound insights. His book contains a comprehensive compendium of symbols that appear in visions, day to day experiences and dreams so that the reader can identify personalized dream meanings that can later be used to augment one&rsquo;s life. The Dream Symbology Dictionary also helps the reader to gain an understanding of the dream self, to become aware and identify patterns of behavior, and to further understand the precognitive nature of dream symbols. Michael Schwartz has also authored the well known Health and Disease Symbology Handbook: A Mind Body Perspective, and he is the co-author of The Way of Universal Teachings.

His corporate clients have included IBM, BP, Yamaha, ABB and other industries in Europe, Asia, the United States, Africa and Australia. Over the last 20 years, he has also advised leading businesses on corporate strategy development in the Russian industrial economy. He is also the founder and Managing Director of Bristol Care Homes, a UK healthcare business. Recently achieving an MA in Philosophy from Bristol University (UK), and as a regular literature reviewer and contributor to economics blogs, Crocker continues to maintain his multi-faceted focus. From his unique synthesis of the secular and sacred, he has developed a core concern for how faith can be interpreted for the increasingly dominant atheist movement. An early adopter of evangelical Christianity, at age 14, Crocker embraced the charismatic movement in the Anglican Church. In midlife, personal crises caused him to reexamine his faith. In particular, the evangelical formulistic doctrinal idea that (divine) forgiveness depended on punishing someone else seemed perverse, even repulsive, as he believed that forgiveness needs to be freely given. He shifted away from traditional belief, eventually accepting the conclusion of secular philosophy that there may be no external God. Although he himself underwent a major re-evaluation of faith, Crocker retains a strong conviction in the value of religion as interpreted in myth. His groundbreaking new book, An Enlightened Philosophy, inspires readers to move beyond a barren confrontation between atheism and religion.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/geoff-crocker/'>Geoff Crocker</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/geoff-crocker.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/geoff-crocker.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/enlightened-philosophy/'>Enlightened Philosophy</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/enlightened-philosophy.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/enlightened-philosophy.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/atheism/'>atheism</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/atheism.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/atheism.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/metaphysical/'>metaphysical</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/metaphysical.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/metaphysical.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/spirituality-and-religion/'>spirituality and religion</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirituality-and-religion.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirituality-and-religion.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Geoff Crocker graduated from Durham University in the UK with a First Class Honors degree in economics, specializing in econometrics, public and social economics, and advanced economic theory.

Dr. Gillian Holloway is a respected expert in the area of dreams and intuition. She is the author of four books on dreams, and has taught at Marylhurst University for 16 years. Her work has been featured on ABC&rsquo;s 20/20 as well as the New York Times Health Blog and The Washington Post. Gillian&rsquo;s direct approach to dream symbolism and modern stress dreams is widely quoted by journalists. Her latest research focuses on the impact and implications of our dreams of the dead. Her book, The Complete Dream Book, is the result of 30,000 case studies of the common dreams in English speaking countries around the world. Her most recent book, The Complete Dream Book of Love and Relationships, focuses on relationship dreams and how to read the clues that they are giving you. Tonight she will discuss her writing and will reveal how dreams about the dead are often dramatically different in almost every way from typical dreams; how timing of dreams about loved ones is distinct, and comes in three separate windows of timing; how an astounding number of people dream of the &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; scene, roughly at the time the person was passing, although they had no objective knowledge of it at the time; how these dreams occur to believers and non-believers alike, and what other surprising dream patterns have emerged.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/gillian-holloway/'>Gillian Holloway</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/gillian-holloway.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/gillian-holloway.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dreams/'>dreams</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dreams.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dreams.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/communicating-with-the-dead/'>communicating with the dead</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/communicating-with-the-dead.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/communicating-with-the-dead.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dream-patterns/'>dream patterns</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dream-patterns.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dream-patterns.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dream-interpretation/'>dream interpretation</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dream-interpretation.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dream-interpretation.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Dr. Gillian Holloway, PhD, is a psychology researcher who believes that our dreams are packed with insights and that paying attention to them can help us heal, make better decisions, recognize threats, and even shed light on our relationships.

Her most recent book, The Complete Dream Book of Love and Relationships, focuses on relationship dreams and how to read the clues that they are giving you. Tonight she will discuss her writing and will reveal how dreams about the dead are often dramatically different in almost every way from typical dreams; how timing of dreams about loved ones is distinct, and comes in three separate windows of timing; how an astounding number of people dream of the &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; scene, roughly at the time the person was passing, although they had no objective knowledge of it at the time; how these dreams occur to believers and non-believers alike, and what other surprising dream patterns have emerged.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/gillian-holloway/'>Gillian Holloway</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/gillian-holloway.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/gillian-holloway.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dreams/'>dreams</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dreams.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dreams.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/communicating-with-the-dead/'>communicating with the dead</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/communicating-with-the-dead.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/communicating-with-the-dead.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dream-patterns/'>dream patterns</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dream-patterns.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dream-patterns.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dream-interpretation/'>dream interpretation</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dream-interpretation.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dream-interpretation.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></content:encoded><category domain="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">Paranormal</category><comments>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2011/04/17/isis-paranormal-radio-with-gillian-holloway/#comments</comments><enclosure url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2011/04/17/isis-paranormal-radio-with-gillian-holloway.mp3" length="13964562" type="audio/mpeg" /><guid>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2011/04/17/isis-paranormal-radio-with-gillian-holloway</guid><pubDate>Sun, 17 Apr 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><itunes:summary> Dr. Gillian Holloway, PhD, is a psychology researcher who believes that our dreams are packed with insights and that paying attention to them can help us heal, make better decisions, recognize threats, and even shed light on our relationships.

In addition to being a guest on radio talk shows nationwide, he has co-hosted a radio program and produced and hosted a series of public access television shows that air around the nation. Mr. Larson served in the US Air Force and as a special education teacher with the Los Angeles School District, and was a corporate business executive for over 20 years. Creator of the audiotape series "Points to Ponder," Larson is a native of Minnesota, where he obtained a degree in Sociology before duty in the Air Force ultimately brought him to the Los Angeles area in 1971. Larson’s familiarity with the spiritual side of life comes from his study of world religions and the ageless wisdom teachings, facilitating Christian adult Bible studies, and participating in meditation groups for many years. In these difficult times, he tends to be hopeful about our future and tries to help others see the positive as well. Larson entertains and inspires as he shares his strong conviction that we are now in a very special time of world change – one that marks the beginning of a new era of awareness which will offer tremendous opportunities for personal growth and enlightenment. Dick Larson, a long time student of the Ageless Wisdom teachings, says they are linked to an unprecedented planetary event that is just now taking place – the public emergence of the World Teacher for the Aquarian age. Tonight Larson will discuss who creates crop circles; how and why they do it; who the world teacher is and why he’s come now; who the Teacher is here to help, and what the Teacher’s presence means for our future. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dick-larson/'>Dick Larson</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dick-larson.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dick-larson.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/spirtuality/'>spirtuality</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirtuality.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirtuality.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/crop-circles/'>crop circles</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/crop-circles.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/crop-circles.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal/'>paranormal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/world-teacher/'>World Teacher</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/world-teacher.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/world-teacher.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dick Larson is a counselor with a background in education, business and communication.

Tonight Larson will discuss who creates crop circles; how and why they do it; who the world teacher is and why he’s come now; who the Teacher is here to help, and what the Teacher’s presence means for our future. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dick-larson/'>Dick Larson</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dick-larson.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dick-larson.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/spirtuality/'>spirtuality</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirtuality.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirtuality.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/crop-circles/'>crop circles</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/crop-circles.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/crop-circles.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal/'>paranormal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/world-teacher/'>World Teacher</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/world-teacher.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/world-teacher.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></content:encoded><category domain="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">Paranormal</category><comments>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2011/04/03/isis-paranormal-radio-with-dick-larson/#comments</comments><enclosure url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2011/04/03/isis-paranormal-radio-with-dick-larson.mp3" length="14587739" type="audio/mpeg" /><guid>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2011/04/03/isis-paranormal-radio-with-dick-larson</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><itunes:summary>Dick Larson is a counselor with a background in education, business and communication.

He was a finalist for the U.S. Health Care Award in 1995 for his investigation of prescription drug abuse in Alberta, Canada As a police reporter, he was twice nominated for the Michener Award for public service in Canada and in 1980, he was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for his story about reclusive author J. D. Salinger, who he met twice in New Hampshire. Clarkson has also been a sports reporter interviewing famous athletes such as basketball legend Michael Jordan and golfer Tigr Woods. Three of his books are on fear: Competitive Fire, Intelligent Fear, and Quick Fixes for Everyday Fears, which have been published in the United States, Canada, and in Europe. His latest book is The Secret Life of Glenn Gould, about a famous classical pianist. He has been interested in poltergeist cases for many years, and has interviewed many witnesses, parapsychologists and skeptics for this book. He has also studied the body’s fight-or-flight system for years and believes it may contribute to the poltergeist phenomenon. Clarkson was born in Preston, England, but has lived in Canada most of his life, including Calgary, Niagara Falls and Toronto. He currently lives with his wife, Jennifer, in Fort Erie, Ontario, near Buffalo, N.Y. and has two sons, Paul and Kevin.

Educated at the Independent Theatre School of Drama in Sydney de Angeles initially taught theatre skills in schools in Sydney then the Central Highlands of Victoria while raising a young family. De Angeles won her first writing competition aged 11 and was first published in 1987. She writes both fiction and non-fiction and won the 2006 USA COVR Visionary Fiction Award for The Quickening, An Urban Legend, published in 2006. Currently in script development for Bakery Hill, a historically based feature-length drama, Ly has also had time to write, direct and co produce a short, black comedy called Wings. The Redemption of Joe Frame (2009), her first film, explored the fine line between mysticism and madness and a follow-up documentary called Nobody, is a no-holds-barred public discussion forum on suicide, mental health and the drug crisis affecting her community and many others like it. De Angeles (a mother of three adult children) has been an advocate for the arts in the Byron Shire, directing much of her work towards the artistic and underestimated youth of the region through the YAC. The aim of many of her stage and street productions and two of her films was to raise awareness of the needs of youth for creative and innovative thinking and activities ‘above the line’. Her theatrical credits are numerous and she has a number of screenplays in the works. Her books include: Tarot Theory and Practice, The Shining Isle, The Quickening, When I See the Wild God – Urban Celtic Witchcraft, The Feast of Flesh and Spirit , Genesis – Legend of Future Past, Witchcraft – Theory and Practice, The Way of Merlyn, The Way of the Goddess, and she was a contributing writer in the anthology: Pagan Visions for a Sustainable Future .

Educated at the Independent Theatre School of Drama in Sydney de Angeles initially taught theatre skills in schools in Sydney then the Central Highlands of Victoria while raising a young family. De Angeles won her first writing competition aged 11 and was first published in 1987. She writes both fiction and non-fiction and won the 2006 USA COVR Visionary Fiction Award for The Quickening, An Urban Legend, published in 2006. Currently in script development for Bakery Hill, a historically based feature-length drama, Ly has also had time to write, direct and co produce a short, black comedy called Wings. The Redemption of Joe Frame (2009), her first film, explored the fine line between mysticism and madness and a follow-up documentary (still in post production, currently on hold) called Nobody, is a no-holds-barred public discussion forum on suicide, mental health and the drug crisis affecting her community and many others like it. De Angeles (a mother of three adult children) has been an advocate for the arts in the Byron Shire, directing much of her work towards the artistic and underestimated youth of the region through the YAC. The aim of many of her stage and street productions and two of her films was to raise awareness of the needs of youth for creative and innovative thinking and activities &lsquo;above the line&rsquo;.</span></span></p>

He then ventured to Los Angeles, acting in films, television shows, and commercials throughout the 1980s and early ’90s. After a meeting with renowned mystic healer Tim Heath, Elliott connected the dots of many chance meetings with strangers from the past several months—people claiming they had been sent to him for “healing” by their guru in India, or their psychic in New York. David Elliott learned to recognize his unique ability to feel, move, and manipulate energy; the healing work got easier, and the “reluctant” phase of his life dissipated. By 1997, his acting career had ended and he was seeing more than twenty clients a week. As David recalls, “The Universe obviously had a plan for me, so I decided to get out of the way and do the healing work.” David has had a successful healing practice in Los Angeles for the past 15 years. He is the author of The Reluctant Healer.

He then ventured to Los Angeles, acting in films, television shows, and commercials throughout the 1980s and early &rsquo;90s. After a meeting with renowned mystic healer Tim Heath, Elliott connected the dots of many chance meetings with strangers from the past several months&mdash;people claiming they had been sent to him for &ldquo;healing&rdquo; by their guru in India, or their psychic in New York. David Elliott learned to recognize his unique ability to feel, move, and manipulate energy; the healing work got easier, and the &ldquo;reluctant&rdquo; phase of his life dissipated. By 1997, his acting career had ended and he was seeing more than twenty clients a week. As David recalls, &ldquo;The Universe obviously had a plan for me, so I decided to get out of the way and do the healing work.&rdquo; David has had a successful healing practice in Los Angeles for the past 15 years. He is the author of <em>The Reluctant Healer</em>. Tonight, he joins us to discuss his latest book, <em>Healing</em>, released by Hawk Press.</span></span></p>

He was born in Sri Lanka; his father was an officer in the British Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm and his mother from a British planting family, and it was from this international family base that Nigel got his serious and obsessive interest in international human and how such affairs interface with science, religion, and philosophy. He lives with his wife and family on his estate in middle England. He has a passionate interest in projects on behalf of the deprived and disadvantaged of developing nations. He is at present working with his family and a team of European friends and volunteers on a medical and agro-development project done on behalf of the rural poor in a country in the Far East. This takes up much of his spare time. Nigel Kerner has a graduate education in biomedical science and in human behavioral psychology, and since he was young, Nigel has wanted to expose the hypocrisy of scientific, religious, and social thinking. His continued fascination with enigmatic UFO phenomenon resulted in his first book: The Song of the Greys published by Hodder & Stoughton (1997).

	<strong>Rose Rosetree &ndash; Magnetizing Money &ndash; Saturday 8 PM ET</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Rose Rosetree is a healer, a teacher, and an author. She is a graduate of the United Nations International School and holds a B.A. from Brandeis University, where the motto is &quot;Truth even unto its innermost parts.&quot; Rose Rosetree is the author of Read People Deeper, Cut the Cords of Attachment, Empowered by Empathy: 25 Ways to Fly in Spirit, Let Today Be a Holiday: 365 Ways to Co-Create with God, The Power of Face Reading, Aura Reading Through All Your Senses: Celestial Perception Made Practical, Wrinkle&rsquo;s Are God&rsquo;s Makeup: How You Can Find Meaning in Your Evolving Face, and The Roar of the Huntids. With more than 100,000 copies of her books in print, Rose Rosetree is well-known for the innovative mind-body-spirit systems she has developed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Rose has created trademarked systems and techniques for cutting the cords of attachment and aura readings; she pioneered the first system for training empaths to hone their skills. Rose is a member of the International Association for Regression Research &amp; Therapies, Inc. (IARRT) as well as the National Guild of Hypnotists, Inc. (NGH); she is a certified Consulting Hypnotist and Regression Therapist, and since 1986, Rose Rosetree has conducted Regression Therapy sessions. Rose has had more than 800 interviews, her work has been highlighted and praised in a variety of publications including The Washington Post, The Washington Times, The Los Angeles Times, and The Catholic Standard, and she has been on The Diane Rehm Show, The View, seven different segments of ABC News in Cincinnati, and The Colbert Report.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Rose was a Transcendental Meditation instructor for Maharishi Mahesh Yogi for 17 years; in 1971 Rose headed up a program, the first of its kind, in Miami, where meditation was taught for credit in a public high school, and in 1974-75, Rose syndicated a weekly column on meditation for seven newspapers in Massachusetts. In 1981-82, Rose joined forces with the Environmental Protection agency and developed a meditation training program; the program was implemented in Illinois and was the first Transcendental Meditation program to receive federal funding in the United States. Later, in 1986, Rose Rosetree began focusing on developing her original work; she began learning about healing astral debris, connecting with Ascended Masters and Archangels from Teaching of the Inner Christ, and she was named a lay minister. Rose is also a Minister of the Universal Life Church which is a nondenominational organization that supports the rights of the individual to connect with God directly. Tonight she joins us to discuss her brand new book: Magnetize Money with Energetic Literacy: 10 Secrets of Success and Prosperity for the Third Millennium.</p>

	Michael Clarkson &ndash; Saturday January 22<sup>nd</sup> at 8 PM ET</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Michael Clarkson is a non-fiction author and professional speaker who has spent 37 years as a print journalist, winning numerous awards for his investigative pieces, including the Canadian National Newspaper Award twice. He was a finalist for the U.S. Health Care Award in 1995 for his investigation of prescription drug abuse in Alberta, Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	As a police reporter, he was twice nominated for the Michener Award for public service in Canada and in 1980, he was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for his story about reclusive author J. D. Salinger, who he met twice in New Hampshire. Clarkson has also been a sports reporter interviewing famous athletes such as basketball legend Michael Jordan and golfer Tiger Woods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Three of his books are on fear: Competitive Fire, Intelligent Fear, and Quick Fixes for Everyday Fears, which have been published in the United States, Canada, and in Europe. His latest book is The Secret Life of Glenn Gould, about a famous classical pianist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	He has been interested in poltergeist cases for many years, and has interviewed many witnesses, parapsychologists and skeptics for this book. He has also studied the body&rsquo;s fight‐or‐flight system for years and believes it may contribute to the poltergeist phenomenon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
	Clarkson was born in Preston, England, but has lived in Canada most of his life, including Calgary, Niagara Falls and Toronto. He currently lives with his wife, Jennifer, in Fort Erie, Ontario, near Buffalo, N.Y. and has two sons, Paul and Kevin. Tonight, he joins us to talk about his book, Poltergeist Phenomenon: An In-Depth Investigation into Floating Beds, Smashing Glass, and Other Unexplained Disturbances.</p>

She is a member of the Woodstock Poetry Society, the Mid-Hudson Chapter of the NCGR, Delta Kappa Gamma, and the Poughkeepsie Paranormal Research Group.

She has a particularly keen interest in researching &ldquo;lost&rdquo; local history. She lives in the Catskill Mountains on the road to the lost town of Bittersweet. Tonight Marianna joins us to talk about her book: Spooky Hudson Valley published by Schiffer Publishing.</p>

She has a particularly keen interest in researching &ldquo;lost&rdquo; local history. She lives in the Catskill Mountains on the road to the lost town of Bittersweet.

In his new book, Matter to Mind to Consciousness, Baumann, a doctor in internal medicine and an expert on quantum spirituality, first educates readers on the functions of the brain and neuroanatomy.

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" align=justify><font face=Calibri size=3>T. Lee Baumann of Birmingham is an author, lecturer and doctor in internal medicine and geriatrics. His first book, God at the Speed of Light, helped to inspire the CBS TV series "Joan of Arcadia." Baumann has also appeared in two Grizzly Adams television documentaries on the afterlife and, recently, an Alabama Public TV documentary on the near-death experience.</font></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" align=justify><font face=Calibri size=3>In his new book, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Matter to Mind to Consciousness</em>, Baumann, a doctor in internal medicine and an expert on quantum spirituality, first educates readers on the functions of the brain and neuroanatomy. He then shares his findings with brain radio waves in the E.L.F. (extremely low frequency) range that could possibly explain everything from mental telepathy, conscious thought, dreams, déjà vu, instinct, mental illness and near-death experiences. "He also explains the latest medical technologies and how medical advances reveal that our infinitesimally weak brainwave activity travels into space and survives traversing the globe, many times over before dying out." Baumann asserts that the brainwave activity of all humankind - even God and dead spirits - is accessible to everyone."</font></P>

Although she has lived in several areas of the United States, Denise moved back to the Atlanta area in 1987 where she now resides with her husband, Danny. Denise and Danny have one child, a daughter. Denise has always had an affinity for all things paranormal, but after having her own supernatural experiences following the death of her mother in 1998, she began to conduct official paranormal investigations. She is a co-founder of the Southeastern Institute of Paranormal Research and has conducted hundreds of paranormal investigations.

The group was created specifically for paranormal investigations of public historic sites and museums that have a history of paranormal activity. PIHA is in the process of creating a series of DVD's that feature the museums, public historical sites and communities in Washington State. There are three regions in Washington State that will be featured. The first region is "Western Washington", the second is "The Olympic Peninsula" and the third region is "Eastern Washington". PIHA is made up of a small group of experienced, dedicated paranormal investigators who have a passion for history and an interest in the phenomena of the possible existence of paranormal activity. Their approach, equipment and procedures for paranormal investigating is primarily based on the use of technologically advanced electronic equipment and scientific logic in obtaining evidence of possible paranormal activity. Tonight, Vaughn joins us to discuss the groups investigative methods, previous investigations, and what the team has to offer the community.</font></P>

A theory regarding the stock market initially set Payne on the path to exploring the existence of a template upon which history unfolds. While reading about how the stock market followed 70 year time cycles, Payne began to wonder if history itself may not also follow an identifiable model. Following years of research he discovered a pattern of historical events that emerged in the beginnings of written history and continued until the present day. Moreover, based on the fact that these patterns were consistent and could be followed by using simple math, Payne conjectured that this template could be used to forecast major historical events in the future.

This farm is now the headquarters of the Spring Farm CARES Animal Sanctuary. She is the bestselling author of The Truth About Unicorns, The Confetti Man, Bikram's Beginning Yoga Class, If Only They Could Talk: The Miracles of Spring Farm and The Magdalen. She is a former model and actress having appeared on TV shows like Perry Mason, Living Doll, Man From Uncle, Farmer’s Daughter, The FBI, Wendy and Me, Hogan’s Heroes, Room 222 and M*A*S*H. After becoming a successful novelist and while on tour for the Confetti Man, Bonnie experienced poltergeist activity on the road and at home. Strange clawings, footsteps, and electrical malfunctions occurred causing incredible difficulties during Bonnie’s interviews: cameras would malfunction, lights would go out, and recorders would fail repeatedly. After moving to Sidney Australia, her experiences continued. She experienced a spiritual rebirth in the 1980s after encountering the books of Seth. Tonight, she re-joins us on the show to discuss her personal UFO experiences and the theories about the connection between the Bible and Alien activity.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/aliens/'>aliens</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/aliens.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/aliens.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/bible/'>Bible</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bible.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bible.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ufos/'>UFOs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/alien-encounters/'>alien encounters</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/alien-encounters.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/alien-encounters.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal/'>paranormal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bonnie Jones Reynolds grew up in Spring Farm, near Clinton, New York on a dairy farm belonging to her family since the 1840s.

A native of Canton, Ohio, Louis was raised in a small farming community. As a child he was fascinated with spirits and ghosts. He launched the Angels & Ghosts website in 2004 so that he could study spirits and ghosts more intensely. After collecting stories, Louis began studying reports for commonalities in videos, audio recordings, and images. He has worked with many field tests, investigations, and spirit communication experiments in order to determine the difference between false and real evidence. His approach to hauntings and spirits comes from a place of “no fear” and compassion.

Ionna, a direct descendant of the Mayan king, Pacal, leads Damien and another faithful follower into the jungles, ruins and underground rivers and caves that are believed to contain the 3 lost skulls of perfect crystal. Unbeknownst to them, Archimedes' arch enemy and mystical survivor of Atlantis has other ideas.

When Lanaia was 14, her grandmother abandoned her, and she landed in foster care where she had four sets of foster parents within a year. At age fifteen, she went to boarding school on her dad's GI Bill. She graduated in her junior year after which she drifted, living with various people but without a family or a home. At eighteen, she married, suffered three miscarriages and divorced. By nineteen, she began working in management for convenient stores and restaurant chains. She remarried at age 30 and had a stillborn daughter the following year. Five years later, her husband left her for a seventeen-year-old.

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt" align=justify><font face=Calibri size=3>Louis Charles is a metaphysical writer, speaker, and web publisher of the popular website, Angels and Ghosts. He is the author of Helping Ghosts: A Guide to Understanding Lost Spirits. Louis is a husband and father of three, and he has been searching for the truth of who we are for the past three decades. A native of Canton, Ohio, Louis was raised in a small farming community. As a child he was fascinated with spirits and ghosts. He launched the Angels &amp; Ghosts website in 2004 so that he could study spirits and ghosts more intensely. After collecting stories, Louis began studying reports for commonalities in videos, audio recordings, and images. He has worked with many field tests, investigations, and spirit communication experiments in order to determine the difference between false and real evidence. His approach to hauntings and spirits comes from a place of “no fear” and compassion. Tonight he joins us to discuss his book: Helping Ghosts: A Guide to Understanding Lost Spirits.</font></P>

A self-described “Born Again conspiracy theorist,” Mike’s first book Dark Mission-The Secret History of NASA (co-authored with the venerable Richard C. Hoagland) was a New York Times bestseller in 2007. His essay “The Occult History of NASA” appears in Secret and Suppressed II, also from Feral House. Mike has made numerous public appearances lecturing on the subjects of space science,NASA, physics and the link between science and spirit. His lectures from the Bay Area UFO Expo, the Conscious Life Expo, the Aetherius Society in Hollywood and an appearance at the Roswell UFO festival have been popular on Youtube, and he has been a featured guest on radio programs like Coast to Coast AM with George Noory.

<P align=justify><font face=Verdana>Tonight we will be rejoined by Shaun Belekurov about the book <em>2012 The Paranormal Cookbook</em>.

The book <em>2012 The Paranormal Cookbook</em> also includes a profile of BEK’s (black-eyed-kids), the cures of the Joker and the return of Phantom Clowns, Tulpas, Phillip the ghost and other projected thought forms, the occult werewolf theory, the trail of the Hellhound of the Ozarks and more.

<P><br><font face=Verdana><STRONG>Elizabeth Eagan-Cox – Sunday 6 PM ET</STRONG></font></P>
<P><font face=Verdana>Elizabeth Eagan-Cox, a resident of California, is a former columnist for the Old California Gazette and she is also a former librarian. She loves digging up intriguing stories about history and incorporating such facts into her writing. She has authored A Ghost of a Chance, A Ghost From the Shadows, and A Ghost Meets and Angel. As an author, she is a member of Sisters in Crime: an industry professionals organization for women who write mysteries and crime fiction. Tonight she will join us to talk about her writing. She will also speak about free website resources to help anyone discover genealogical information to conduct paranormal historical investigations. The information she will share will show you how to find out when and where a real person died, information on the modern-day equivalent to old diseases to determine the cause of someone’s death, ways of determining what a person’s former occupation really was, old real estate information and more.</font></P>

When she’s not writing, she can be found seeking inspiration in everything, pad and pencil close at hand, or curled up on the couch reading a good horror novel or magazine – or watching a scary movie…and taking notes.&nbsp; She is married to her long time love and together they have two adult children. Gray’s inspirations include fellow Mainer Stephen King, Clive Barker, Dean Koontz, Harlan Ellison, Anne Rule, and Richard Matheson. Tonight she will join us to discuss <em>Ghosts of Maine</em> a 256 page paperback that includes 54 photos, a map, and a description of over 100 haunted sites spanning every county throughout Maine.&nbsp; We will also be discussing her book: <em>New England Graveside Tales</em>.<br><br>More at:<br><br><a href="http://www.tmgray.tk/">http://www.tmgray.tk/</a><br></div><BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/seth-david-chernoff/'>Seth David Chernoff</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/seth-david-chernoff.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/seth-david-chernoff.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/manual-for-living-re/'>Manual for Living Re</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/manual-for-living-re.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/manual-for-living-re.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/t-m-gray/'>T M Gray</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/t-m-gray.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/t-m-gray.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ghosts-of-maine/'>Ghosts of Maine</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ghosts-of-maine.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ghosts-of-maine.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/new-englands-graves/'>New England's Graves</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/new-englands-graves.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/new-englands-graves.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></content:encoded><category domain="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">Seth David Chernoff</category><category domain="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">Manual for Living Re</category><category domain="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">T M Gray</category><category domain="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">Ghosts of Maine</category><category domain="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">New England's Graves</category><comments>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/blog/2010/09/17/this-weekend-on-isis-paranormal-radio/#comments</comments><guid>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/blog/2010/09/17/this-weekend-on-isis-paranormal-radio</guid><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2010 16:45:23 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>ISIS Paranormal Radio &amp; Cheralyn Lambeth - Sep 12,2010</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2010/09/12/isis-paranormal-radio-cheralyn-lambeth</link><description><![CDATA[Cheralyn Lambeth is a professional costume, prop and puppet builder for the entertainment industry, whose interest in the paranormal stems from her experiences at the various (haunted) theaters where she has worked.

He is the first neurosurgeon in Hilo, Hawaii. Following his graduation from Ohio State University and earning his degree in Engineering Physics, Dr. Turner continued onto graduate school. About three years into his graduate studies, Dr. Turner received a book on Edgar Cayce called The Sleeping Prophet. The book changed Dr. Turner’s life, and he became excited about the existence of a spiritual world. Dr. Turner then decided to attend Ohio State University College of Medicine where he earned his M.D. Medicine, Miracles, and Manifestations is a work that examines how metaphysical events like telepathy, remote viewing, and life after death are verifiable manifestations and are events that occur when the human brain interfaces with the universal consciousness.<br><br><em>Dr. Raymond Moody</em><br><br>Dr. Raymond Moody earned his MD from the Medical College in Georgia; and his Ph.D, Masters, and BA with Honors in Philosophy from the University of Virginia. He trains hospice workers, clergy, psychologists, and other medical professionals in all aspects of his work. In his private practice, he has also helped thousands of people who are coping with dying and the death of their loved ones. Dr. Raymond Moody is a world thought leader in the subject of near death studies, and he, in fact, coined the phrase “near death experience.” He has authored more than eleven books on the subject and his most famous book, Life After Life has sold 13 million copies worldwide. The book has recently been re-released for its 25th anniversary edition. Dr. Moody continues to captivate the public with his pioneering work on what happens when we die. He has appeared on Oprah, MSNBC: Grief Recovery, NBC Today, ABC’s Turning Point, Donahue, the Sally Jessy Raphael Show, Geraldo, and The Joan Rivers Show. Tonight, he will join us to discuss his most recent work, Glimpses of Eternity, which will be released in September and is a culmination of his latest findings. It is a book that will give the reader profound insights into this topic; insights that have not been revealed to the public before. Dr. Turner, and Dr. Moody will also be talking about a new venture called, Tours of the Afterlife, the science of the NDE, and the persistence of consciousness beyond the death of the physical body.<br><br>More at: <a href="http://www.lifeafterlife.com/">http://www.lifeafterlife.com/</a><br><br>More at: <a href="http://www.johnlturner.com/index.php">http://www.johnlturner.com/index.php</a><br><br><strong>Saturday at 8 PM ET – Ed Fulco</strong><br><br>Henry Edward Webster is a pseudonym for author/publisher Edward Philip Fulco. Mr. Fulco welcomes the controversy the subject of this trilogy brings to the public. He has little patience for UFO fakes, public and private debunkers, government cover-ups, or misinformation programs. It is Mr. Fulco’s hope that The Cosmic Seed Trilogy will excite the public interest in alien abductions and the UFO phenomenon. He welcomes questions about aliens, government involvement, UFO sightings, and people’s reaction to the subject.<br><br>More at: <a href="http://www.thecosmicseed.com/">http://www.thecosmicseed.com/</a><br><br><strong>Sunday at 6 PM ET – Cheralyn Lambeth</strong><br><br>Cheralyn Lambeth is a professional costume, prop and puppet builder for the entertainment industry, whose interest in the paranormal stems from her experiences at the various (haunted) theaters where she has worked.

This farm is now the headquarters of the Spring Farm CARES Animal Sanctuary. She is the bestselling author of The Truth About Unicorns, The Confetti Man, Bikram's Beginning Yoga Class, and The Magdalen. She is a former model and actress having appeared on TV shows like Perry Mason, Living Doll, Man From Uncle, Farmer’s Daughter, The FBI, Wendy and Me, Hogan’s Heroes, Room 222 and M*A*S*H. After becoming a successful novelist and while on tour for the Confetti Man, Bonnie experienced poltergeist activity on the road and at home.

presently holds two degrees in psychology and he is widely traveled
having been to Taiwan, Turkey, Egypt, Europe, Britain, and the Middle
East as well as the Indian sub-continent. Through his travels he has
mastered techniques of meditation taught by Vietnamese, Tibetan,
Western, and Indian masters. In Nepal, the Land of mysticism in the
Himalayas, Conwell learned of the Audible Life Stream and the ancient
art of dying while living. Conwell has published articles on the
Audible Life Stream in Australia and America, and he has been a
practitioner of meditation for two decades.</font><br><font face="Verdana" size="2">

Tonight, Alistair will be joining us to discuss his book: The Audible
Life Stream: Ancient Secret of Dying While Living. Conwell asserts that
few people realize what the Primordial Sound Current or the Audible
Life Stream is or that Krishna, Buddha, and Jesus all perfected
meditative techniques to turn their attentions inwards, thereby merging
with the Audible Life Stream, to become adepts at dying while living.
His book is the first to offer evidence of the Audible Life Stream and
the work emphasizes the importance of it to every person. The book
offers independent testimonial of near death experiences, out of body
experiences, and excerpts from major religious texts, simply explained
quantum physics principles, and independent anecdotes from the
increasing popular field of sound/music therapy.</font><br><font face="Verdana" size="2">

Her personal area of spiritual dedication is in West African based religion including various sects of Vodou and Santeria. She is a recognized authority on these subjects. She is also deeply connected to her Native American heritage and conducts ritual in some of these traditions as well. She conducts private ceremonies in a number of different traditions depending on the needs of the client. She can perform legal marriages as well as alternative union/wedding ceremonies. She also performs house cleansings and blessings,and baby blessings as well as all other traditional clergy services. The Temple of The Altar-Native Star is an eclectic teaching oriented temple lead by Priestess/Rev. Claudia Williams and Priest/Psychic Phillip Humphreys. Together they conduct public and private ceremonies in virtually all non Judeo-Christian traditions. They enjoy performing rituals that suit their client's specific needs and make the ceremony as accessible as possible to the client. However, while they enjoy tailoring rituals to suit the tastes of clients, they adhere strictly to the appropriate confines of ceremony depending on the tradition in which they are performing a ritual. The Temple of The Altar-Native Star holds weekly Vodou rituals on Saturday nights at 8:30pm in the Starling Magickal Occult Shop Courtyard weather permitting. Ritual purpose and schedules permitting, some nights rituals include both a European Witchcraft segment as well as the traditional Vodou ritual: both parts dedicated to the same purpose. Those interested are encouraged to call and find out what deity is being honored or what issue is being addressed as ceremonies vary weekly. The Temple of The Altar-Native Star is located at 1022 Royal Street, New Orleans, La. 70116. Tonight, Priestess Claudia joins us to discuss her book: Haunted Spaces, Public Places and her other works.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/haunted/'>haunted</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/haunted.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/haunted.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ghosts/'>ghosts</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ghosts.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ghosts.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal/'>paranormal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/spirits/'>spirits</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirits.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirits.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/witchcraft/'>Witchcraft</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/witchcraft.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/witchcraft.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Priestess Claudia Williams is a licensed and ordained Minister of Ancient Ways in the state of Louisiana.

His interests in Tibetan Buddhism took him to the Kagye Samye-Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre, a Buddhist complex associated with the Karma Kagyu School at Eskdalemiur, Dumfries, Scotland where under the patronage of a lama teacher he spent time studying the ways of eastern psychology, meeting with the Dalai lama in 1994. During the seventies and eighties he was a contributor, researcher and writer for several programmes for his local television broadcaster Tyne Tees Television. In 1979 Callum was allied to the innovative Newcastle local music scene and assisted in the birth of the national British adult spoof satirical VIZ Comic, a regular inspiration for some of its characters. As regional rock music journalist and contributor to the magazines of the day, Callum featured as a presenter and interviewer on BBC Newcastle radio rock show Bedrock. Involving himself actively in the music industry, he has recorded a number of surreal comedy songs under various guises and had a minor hit in 1980, until deciding to concentrate on television comedy. From 1982-1987 he featured on the Channel 4 live music programme THE TUBE with a variety of surreal comedy characters earning him a cult following still in existence today, and extensive inclusion on the 2005 Granada TV DVD compilation The Best of the Tube – Series I. He has appeared on national television over sixty times. Callum has contributed to paranormal and esoteric magazines and he is known on the Internet for his articles, features and Youtube videos under his pseudonym as Dan Green and his book The Lincoln Da Vinci Code (2005) and sequel The Lincoln Da Vinci Code (2006), which he has talked about on SKY television. Callum’s first DVD, The murder of Mary Magdalene; Genocide of the Holy Bloodline, is now on national release. In 2009 he was a contributing author to the book The Ancient Code and in 2010 has contributed to the book The Templar Papers. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dan-green/'>Dan Green</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dan-green.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dan-green.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/callum-jensen/'>Callum Jensen</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/callum-jensen.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/callum-jensen.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-murder-of-mary-magdalene/'>The murder of Mary Magdalene</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-murder-of-mary-magdalene.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-murder-of-mary-magdalene.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/genocide-of-the-holy-bloodline/'>Genocide of the Holy Bloodline</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/genocide-of-the-holy-bloodline.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/genocide-of-the-holy-bloodline.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/lincoln-da-vinci-code/'>Lincoln Da Vinci Code</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/lincoln-da-vinci-code.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/lincoln-da-vinci-code.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Callum lived in the North East of England for 40 years.

His interests in Tibetan Buddhism took him to the Kagye Samye-Ling Monastery and Tibetan Centre, a Buddhist complex associated with the Karma Kagyu School, located at Eskdalemiur, Dumfries, Scotland where under the patronage of a lama teacher he spent time studying the ways of eastern psychology, meeting with the Dalai lama in 1994. During the late seventies through to the eighties he was a contributor, researcher and writer for several programmes for his local television broadcaster Tyne Tees Television. In 1979 Callum was allied to the innovative Newcastle local music scene and assisted in the birth of the national British adult spoof satirical VIZ Comic, a regular inspiration for some of its characters. As regional rock music journalist and contributor to the magazines of the day, Callum featured as a presenter and interviewer on BBC Newcastle radio rock show Bedrock. Involving himself actively in the music industry, he has recorded a number of surreal comedy songs under various guises and had a minor hit in 1980, until deciding to concentrate on television comedy. From 1982-1987 he featured on the Channel 4 live music programme THE TUBE with a variety of surreal comedy characters earning him a cult following still in existence today, and extensive inclusion on the 2005 Granada TV DVD compilation The Best of the Tube – Series I. He has appeared on national television over sixty times.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Callum’s life long interest in world mysteries have seen him contribute to a number of paranormal and esoteric magazines and he is well known on the Internet for his original articles, features and Youtube videos under his pseudonym as Dan Green and his book The Lincoln Da Vinci Code (2005) and sequel The Lincoln Da Vinci Code (2006), which he has talked about on SKY television. Callum’s first DVD, The murder of Mary Magdalene; Genocide of the Holy Bloodline, is now on national release. In 2009 he was a contributing author to the book The Ancient Code and in 2010 has contributed to the book The Templar Papers.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Now living in the city of Lincoln, in the East Midlands of England, Callum is a local media celebrity through his introduction of his themed work The Lincoln Cathedral Code which has appeared on TV, radio and the national press. Callum’s interests in neurology are reinforced by his wife Avril who has the high-functioning autism condition Aspergers syndrome, as does his son Benjamin. He is a regular contributor to issues on autism and his work has been praised by world expert on savants, Dr Darold Treffert of Wisconsin, and leading British expert Prof Simon Baron Cohen at his Cambridge University institute of Autism Research who has described Callum’s work and academic book Buddha And the Autist as "very interesting and thought-provoking". Tonight, Cullum joins us to discuss the movie: The murder of Mary Magdalene; Genocide of the Holy Bloodline.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">More about the film at:</span><br><br><a href="http://www.reality-entertainment.com/films">http://www.reality-entertainment.com/films</a><br><br><strong style="font-family: Verdana;">About Steven Meyers - Sunday Night 6 PM ET</strong><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Steven Myers is an independent researcher, a lecturer and an author who has studied the Great Pyramid for more than two decades.

He is a web designer, graphic artist, a photographer and the 60 year old father of six children. He holds a passion for EVP research and he is the author of Voices from Forever. The latter work explores Randall's journey through the paranormal by way of EVP research. Randall asserts that what started out as a simple experiment turned into the most profound and eye opening experience of his life. His research has led him to believe that there is something beyond death: a greater continuation. His book explains how there is a place where the animaism of the universe and the passion of human emotion converge to reveal a glimpse of what is to come. Randall's book also explains how his attempts to make contact through EVP research has taught him that the veil between this world and what is beyond is thin, and that death is not the end of life, but the beginning of our next step.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/randall-keller/'>Randall Keller</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/randall-keller.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/randall-keller.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/voices-from-forever/'>Voices from Forever</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/voices-from-forever.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/voices-from-forever.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/evps/'>EVPs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/evps.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/evps.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/electronic-voice-phenomena/'>electronic voice phenomena</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/electronic-voice-phenomena.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/electronic-voice-phenomena.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/life-after-death/'>life after death</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/life-after-death.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/life-after-death.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Randall Keller is a member of the Perry Hall Paranormal Research Society in Maryland.

Randall's book also explains how his attempts to make contact through EVP research has taught him that the veil between this world and what is beyond is thin, and that death is not the end of life, but the beginning of our next step.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/randall-keller/'>Randall Keller</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/randall-keller.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/randall-keller.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/voices-from-forever/'>Voices from Forever</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/voices-from-forever.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/voices-from-forever.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/evps/'>EVPs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/evps.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/evps.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/electronic-voice-phenomena/'>electronic voice phenomena</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/electronic-voice-phenomena.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/electronic-voice-phenomena.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/life-after-death/'>life after death</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/life-after-death.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/life-after-death.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></content:encoded><category domain="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">Paranormal</category><comments>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2010/07/28/isis-paranormal-radio-and-randall-keller/#comments</comments><enclosure url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2010/07/28/isis-paranormal-radio-and-randall-keller.mp3" length="13566247" type="audio/mpeg" /><guid>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2010/07/28/isis-paranormal-radio-and-randall-keller</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><itunes:summary>Randall Keller is a member of the Perry Hall Paranormal Research Society in Maryland. He is a web designer, graphic artist, a photographer and the 60 year old father of six children. He holds a passion for EVP research and he is the author of Voices from Forever. The latter work explores Randall's journey through the paranormal by way of EVP research. Randall asserts that what started out as a simple experiment turned into the most profound and eye opening experience of his life. His research has led him to believe that there is something beyond death: a greater continuation. His book explains how there is a place where the animaism of the universe and the passion of human emotion converge to reveal a glimpse of what is to come. Randall's book also explains how his attempts to make contact through EVP research has taught him that the veil between this world and what is beyond is thin, and that death is not the end of life, but the beginning of our next step.</itunes:summary><itunes:duration>00:57:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2010/07/28/isis-paranormal-radio-and-randall-keller.mp3" fileSize="13566247" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2010/07/28/isis-paranormal-radio-and-randall-keller.wma" fileSize="13566247" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>ISISXParanormal</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>Randall Keller,Voices from Forever,EVPs,electronic voice phenomena,life after death,BlogTalkRadio, Blog Talk Radio</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>ISIS Paranormal Radio and Randall Keller</itunes:subtitle></item><item><title>ISIS Paranormal Radio &amp; Christopher Forest - Jul 25,2010</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2010/07/25/isis-paranormal-radio-christopher-forest</link><description><![CDATA[Christopher Forest is a fifth grade teacher in Massachusetts.

Her life here was a total immersion in a world framed with crystalline seas and malevolent appearing jungles. On the island, she basked in the inhabitant’s simple joy of life despite the majority’s poverty. Many lived in one-room board shacks that lacked even running water. It was from the Grenadians that she learned a depth of faith she’d never before imagined, a connection with one’s maker born of naiveté and a daily symbiosis with nature. Here, an overwhelming curiosity drove Lynn to spy upon the Grenadian’s and to witness secretive back-jungle voodoo practices. Thisunderground current drove the dancing and superstition that imbued the local’s celebrations with a certain frenzy. Returning to the United States, Lynn majored in Writing and Editing at North Carolina State University. Afterward, she focused on the study and promotion of emerging technologies and authored business publications from software demonstration and training manuals to case studies. An award-winning sales management career followed and presentations to many Fortune 500 executives. Throughout her career, Lynn leveraged the fortitude and higher connection realized during her youth and relied ever more upon her intuition or “voice from within.” Her morning escapes into writing and two decades of delving into the emerging intersections between science and spirituality resulted in articles which organizations such as “The Voice for Love,” and Shirley Cheng have published. Lynn’s accumulated experiences resulted in The Great Awakening – a spiritual thriller series the press has likened to “The Da Vinci Code meets A Course in Miracles.” Tonight she joins us to discuss her book: The Great Awakening.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-great-awakening/'>The Great Awakening</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-great-awakening.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-great-awakening.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/spiritual-thriller/'>spiritual thriller</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spiritual-thriller.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spiritual-thriller.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal/'>paranormal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/voodou/'>voodou</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/voodou.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/voodou.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal-radio-online/'>paranormal radio online</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal-radio-online.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal-radio-online.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[The experience that most impacted Lynn Pierson was the four years spent, beginning at the age of nine, on the Caribbean island of Grenada.

It has been a wondrous and enlightening journey of meeting and learning from some of the most fascinating and enlightened Chiropractors, DOM's, Homeopaths, Physicists and therapists in the country. On this quest for answers to his own life challenges John not only found answers for himself but also discovered and created a way to accurately test and treat the needs by distance of anyone, anywhere in the world. His work instantly changes the life of anyone he works with by accessing and eliminating the causes of physical, emotional or issues of the mind problems of virtually any kind. This is not a treating of the problem, but is a deleting of the causes, just like hitting the “delete” key on your computer, whether it is a human being, a pet or even your living or working environment. All of this is done from a distance whether it is from across the table or to anywhere around the world. Tonight, John Lucas joins us to discuss this innovative method of healing.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/john-lucas/'>John Lucas</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/john-lucas.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/john-lucas.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/natural-healing/'>natural healing</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/natural-healing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/natural-healing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/holistic/'>holistic</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/holistic.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/holistic.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/psychic/'>psychic</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/psychic.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/psychic.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal-radio-online/'>paranormal radio online</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal-radio-online.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal-radio-online.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[John Lucas has been on a healing journey for over 30 years that has taken him from coast to coast, from Sarasota on the east coast to Santa Cruz on the west and places in between.

Kimmel, an author, is an avid collector of memorabilia from World War II, and he has been collecting pieces for several decades. A few years ago, Richard began to sense that some of the pieces in his collection had something mysterious attached to them and that some of the pieces in his World War II collection generated strange feelings. By using a pendulum as well as the assistance of several psychics, Richard investigated the strange feelings he was receiving further and he has figured out the locations and origins associated with World War II items. Using a practice known as psychometry, Richard has determined information about his collection and he shares his experiences with the pendulum, the psychics that have helped him, and the use of psychometry in WWII Ghosts: Artifacts Can Talk. The book is filled with detailed descriptions, myriad photographs, and his work which he identifies as “paranormal archeology.” Richard is a Korea era veteran and a former U.S. Army combat photographer who has been on Haunted Voices Radio, the Maury Povich Show and numerous other paranormal radio shows. He is a member of NJGO-New Jersey Ghost Organization and has participated in numerous, high profile investigations. Richard has more than sixty years of experience collecting wartime artifacts, and he has shared his research in various locations throughout the US via lectures, television, and radio.

Christopher has worked with ex military official, law enforcement, ranchers, and a network of skywatchers as he documented the most intense wave of unexplained activity ever witnessed in a single region of North America. His ten year paranormal investigation resulted in three books of his “mysterious valley” trilogy; The Mysterious Valley, Enter the Valley, and Secrets of the Mysterious Valley. His investigations into the unexplained explored Native American Legends, cryptozoology, livestock deaths, secret military activity, and the local folklore within the largest alpine valley has been put into one of the largest databases of unexplained occurrences gathered from a single geographic area. He shares his findings in his trilogy as well as in his new book, Stalking the Tricksters, which was recently released by Adventures Unlimited Press.

Spirit Central Awaits Us shares how Judith, her two children an her in-laws found a new place to live in Upstate New York and what happened to them all before and after they began living there. Members of the New York Pennsylvania Paranormal Society, the ISIS Paranormal Investigations Team and a medium named Bonnie Richter confirm that the McCrodden’s home gets frequent visits from spirits in the home. The book also details the many supernatural episodes the author has experienced throughout her life. Whether she’s discussing a move to an attic apartment decorated the way she had described years earlier as a teenager – and living with its spirits – or telling how guardian angels saved her and a friend from a gas explosion at a diner, Ms. McCrodden presents a convincing tale. The author says her home is “inhabited, not haunted,” and living with Spirits is a daily reminder that there is everlasting life which sustains her faith in God and the afterlife. Tonight, Judith McCrodden joins us to talk about her book and her many paranormal experiences.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/judith-mccrodden/'>Judith McCrodden</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/judith-mccrodden.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/judith-mccrodden.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/spirit-central-awaits-us/'>Spirit Central Awaits Us</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirit-central-awaits-us.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirit-central-awaits-us.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal-activity-in-new-york/'>Paranormal activity in New York</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal-activity-in-new-york.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal-activity-in-new-york.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/real-paranormal-experiences/'>real paranormal experiences</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/real-paranormal-experiences.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/real-paranormal-experiences.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/free-online-paranormal-radio/'>free online paranormal radio</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/free-online-paranormal-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/free-online-paranormal-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Judith McCrodden is the author of Spirit Central Awaits Us, a true story relating the experiences had by Judy and her family.

childhood psychic experiences, some of the paranormal events she experienced in
her teens, and the unexplainable activity that goes on in her present home.&nbsp; We will also talk to Judy about what it was like
to have a paranormal team investigate her home, what kind of resolution she has
found and how she deals with ongoing activity.&nbsp;

He is a prolific author who has been creating fiction since his childhood, and who later pursued publication in his late 20’s. He authored his first novella at the age of 17 entitled Asylum. His first novel, Goat Dance, was published in 1989, and after that he began producing a book a year, sometimes more. Mr. Clegg is chiefly a supernatural fiction writer and his fiction career spans a period of roughly 20 years of constant writing and publication. Doug’s fiction has won the Bram Stoker Award, the International Horror Guild Award, and the Shocker Award.

By the age of 31, she was suffering from advanced Systemic Lupus and was given a short time to live. It was at this time that she had a spiritual awakening that changed her life, an awakening with the Pleiadians, and from the energy of this awakening, Christine was able to begin the self healing process. She has been symptom free for the past twenty-five years. Christine now works with the Pleiadians and initiates people to this awakening as she has been doing for the past twenty years. Christine Day has worked in the United States, Belgium, Brazil, and Argentina and she has students that come from all over the world. Her spiritual work expanded so quickly that she had to establish main centers from where she would teach her work. Her students come to her centers to further levels of initiations from this work, “Frequencies of Brilliance.” The Pleiadians have channeled 14 levels of the Frequencies of Brilliance initiations to Christine to date. Her students become practitioners of this work: a powerful healing modality, and Christine initiates and certifies teachers in this method of healing. Christine began her own web-casting show, a 1 1/2 hour broadcast that goes worldwide from Las Vegas, Nevada which airs every second month. She presently resides in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Tonight she will be joining us to discuss her book, Pleiadian Initiations of Light, recently released by New Page Books.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/christine-day/'>Christine Day</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/christine-day.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/christine-day.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/pleiadian-initiations-of-light/'>Pleiadian Initiations of Light</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/pleiadian-initiations-of-light.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/pleiadian-initiations-of-light.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/healing/'>healing</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/healing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/healing.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal/'>paranormal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/free-paranormal-radio/'>free paranormal radio</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/free-paranormal-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/free-paranormal-radio.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[A native of Australia, Christine Day had a tramautic childhood which involved cult ritual abuse.

Tonight, she will be joining us to discuss her film, “What on Earth? ... Inside the Crop Circle Mystery. ”The film explores intriguing reports and offers intense discussions, all of which were filmed over a period of six summers and which offer the viewer an in-depth insider’s view of opinions and information about crop circles: a phenomena and subject that is radically misunderstood. The filming of the documentary takes place in Europe and it is a film filled with provocative material that questions fundamental assumptions about who we are, and our purpose for being here. The film explores awe-inspiring, unbelievably intricate crop circles which have been showing up all over the planet for hundreds, if not thousands of years. The viewer gets to see Suzanne interact with “croppies,” as they go crop circle chasing, share discussions, theories, and their fascination with crop circles. You are presented with evidence that defies the notion that all crop circles are created by humans, and the potential motive of crop circle hoaxes is debated too.

From that moment on, Carol maintained a curiosity in life after death. At the age of thirteen, Carol lost her father, and both or her sisters reported seeing him by their sides at different times after his passing. Carol resided in a haunted home with her sisters and mother when she was thirteen and she remained in the home until her mid twenties. She sought out information on spirit communication. When she got older, she met up with Mark Sarro and the Chester County Paranormal Research Society. Now Carol visits historic destinations while investigating the paranormal and she relies on all of the latest ghost research techniques and equipment. She currently resides in Chester County, Pennsylvania, but she spends much of her free time with the Ghosts in Gettysburg.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">Tonight we’re going to have a
live interview with the founder of SPOOKS (the Springfield Paranormal
Organization Operating with Kinetic Surveillance), Shaun Belekurov.<span>&nbsp; </span>Shaun is the author of 2012: The Paranormal
Cookbook.<span>&nbsp; </span>He has investigated
chupacabras, Bigfoot sightings, hellhounds, and other fascinating
creatures.<span>&nbsp; </span>He has carried an interest in
paranormal events since he was young and his intense studies have led him to
write his first book on the subject.<span>&nbsp; </span>His
book explores a variety of paranormal subjects including signs, symbols,
quantum physics, synchronicity, and hauntings; you can read about Tulpas,
Phantom Clowns, projected thought forms, hellhounds, and werewolves, among
other amazing topics.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tune in at 8 PM ET
on February 13, 2010 for a live interview with Shaun Belekurov.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">In addition, we will be having
a live interview on Sunday with the author, educator, and astronomer Stephan
Martin.<span>&nbsp; </span>Stephan has authored <em>Cosmic Conversations: Dialogues on the
Nature of the Universe and the Search for Reality</em> which has been released
for publication by New Page Books.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
work examines the nature of the universe and the possible answers to big
questions like “What is the universe?”<span>&nbsp; </span>“What
is time and space,”<span>&nbsp; </span>“where is the
universe: is it outside us or in us?” and more.<span>&nbsp;
</span>We will be talking about Stephan’s view of the universe, how other
people define the universe, and we will also be discussing the significance that
language has over our ability to define what the universe is.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s going to be an awesome conversation
about what defines our reality.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please
join us for the interview on Valentine’s Day at 2 PM Eastern Time: a special
episode and air time.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">Tonight we’re going to have a
live interview with the founder of SPOOKS (the Springfield Paranormal
Organization Operating with Kinetic Surveillance), Shaun Belekurov.<span>&nbsp; </span>Shaun is the author of 2012: The Paranormal
Cookbook.<span>&nbsp; </span>He has investigated
chupacabras, Bigfoot sightings, hellhounds, and other fascinating
creatures.<span>&nbsp; </span>He has carried an interest in
paranormal events since he was young and his intense studies have led him to
write his first book on the subject.<span>&nbsp; </span>His
book explores a variety of paranormal subjects including signs, symbols,
quantum physics, synchronicity, and hauntings; you can read about Tulpas,
Phantom Clowns, projected thought forms, hellhounds, and werewolves, among
other amazing topics.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tune in at 8 PM ET
on February 13, 2010 for a live interview with Shaun Belekurov.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">In addition, we will be having
a live interview on Sunday with the author, educator, and astronomer Stephan
Martin.<span>&nbsp; </span>Stephan has authored <em>Cosmic Conversations: Dialogues on the
Nature of the Universe and the Search for Reality</em> which has been released
for publication by New Page Books.<span>&nbsp; </span>The
work examines the nature of the universe and the possible answers to big
questions like “What is the universe?”<span>&nbsp; </span>“What
is time and space,”<span>&nbsp; </span>“where is the
universe: is it outside us or in us?” and more.<span>&nbsp;
</span>We will be talking about Stephan’s view of the universe, how other
people define the universe, and we will also be discussing the significance that
language has over our ability to define what the universe is.<span>&nbsp; </span>It’s going to be an awesome conversation
about what defines our reality.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please
join us for the interview on Valentine’s Day at 2 PM Eastern Time: a special
episode and air time.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>

This has involved him in a series of ‘hands on’ investigations encompassing everything from poltergeist infestations, hauntings and spirit possession to claims of alien abduction. From this solid groundwork he has developed a reputation as a speaker and presenter at various conferences across the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. This in turn developed into Brian acting as an adviser and participant in various international TV and radio broadcasts involving almost all aspects of the paranormal. Following years of active investigations, which allowed truly amazing glimpses and encounters with things normally hidden from view, Brian began specialising in the esoteric aspects of Rosslyn Chapel and in 2005, along with a small, hand selected team, he was permitted to test some of his theories involving specific sonic frequencies within its enigmatic structure. This in turn lead to the discovery of a area inside the Chapel which Brian is convinced is a still active ‘portal’ leading to what may be a store of forbidden knowledge. Unfortunately, for various reasons he has been unable to continue with this project although this situation may change in the future. Other works by Brian Allan include The View From the Abyss (1st and 2nd editions), The Barriers of Belief, Rosslyn, Between Two Worlds, The Hole in the Sky, The Believers and he is the creator of the CD The Rosslyn Frequencies. Tonight we will be talking about the paranormal with Brian, his books, and two new films that Brian Allan has appeared in Ancient Code: The Movie, and The Rosslyn Frequency: Uncovering the Hidden World of the Knights Templar.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal/'>paranormal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/rosslyn-chapel/'>Rosslyn Chapel</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/rosslyn-chapel.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/rosslyn-chapel.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-ancient-code/'>The Ancient Code</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-ancient-code.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-ancient-code.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/brian-allan/'>Brian Allan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/brian-allan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/brian-allan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/rosslyn-frequency/'>Rosslyn Frequency</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/rosslyn-frequency.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/rosslyn-frequency.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Brian Allan is a lifelong researcher into the mysteries and contradictions posed by paranormal phenomena and has devoted his life to seeking answers to some of these anomalies.

This has involved him in a series of ‘hands on’ investigations encompassing everything from poltergeist infestations, hauntings and spirit possession to claims of alien abduction. From this solid groundwork he has developed a reputation as a speaker and presenter at various conferences across the length and breadth of the United Kingdom. This in turn developed into Brian acting as an adviser and participant in various international TV and radio broadcasts involving almost all aspects of the paranormal. Following years of active investigations, which allowed truly amazing glimpses and encounters with things normally hidden from view, Brian began specialising in the esoteric aspects of Rosslyn Chapel and in 2005, along with a small, hand selected team, he was permitted to test some of his theories involving specific sonic frequencies within its enigmatic structure. This in turn lead to the discovery of a area inside the Chapel which Brian is convinced is a still active ‘portal’ leading to what may be a store of forbidden knowledge. Unfortunately, for various reasons he has been unable to continue with this project although this situation may change in the future. Other works by Brian Allan include The View From the Abyss (1st and 2nd editions), The Barriers of Belief, Rosslyn, Between Two Worlds, The Hole in the Sky, The Believers and he is the creator of the CD The Rosslyn Frequencies.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">Last night’s interview on ISIS
Paranormal Radio with George P. Hansen was outstanding!<span>&nbsp; </span>He’s an eloquent guest and he explained many
of the arguments he set forth in his book <em>The
Trickster and the Paranormal</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>We
talked with Mr. Hansen about his work in parapsychology and he explained his
work and success in ganzfeld experimentation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>He also got into Trickster characteristics as they are revealed in
mythology and how the constellation of characteristics help to explain some of
the ways that society views paranormal and supernatural events.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mr. Hansen’s theory examines liminality,
antistructure, and binary opposites and how such concepts are linked to the
Trickster constellation as well as the supernatural.<span>&nbsp; </span>We talked in depth about the lives of Saints,
Holy Madness, Fools for God, psychics, and more.<span>&nbsp; </span>What’s more, Mr. Hansen explains the concept
of the “betwixt and the between,” otherwise known as liminality, and the dangers
associated with liminality.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you
missed the live show, head to our archives to hear the interview!<span>&nbsp; </span>Feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:isisinvestigator@aol.com">isisinvestigator@aol.com</a> to comment;
we look forward to hearing from all of our listeners.<o:p> <br></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">Next week, we are airing a
special episode with Rose Rosetree on her latest book <em>Become the Most Important Person in the Room: Your 30-day Plan for
Empath Empowerment.</em><span>&nbsp; </span>We’ve had Rose
on the show with us before and she is a sheer delight!<span>&nbsp; </span>We’ll be discussing, at length, Rose’s
step-by-step guide to improving your empathic abilities naturally.<span>&nbsp; </span>This special episode will air on Saturday,
January 16<sup>th</sup> from 8 to 9 pm Eastern Time.<span>&nbsp; </span>We hope you will join us in the ISIS
Paranormal chat room to poses questions for the guest!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">Last night’s interview on ISIS
Paranormal Radio with George P. Hansen was outstanding!<span>&nbsp; </span>He’s an eloquent guest and he explained many
of the arguments he set forth in his book <em>The
Trickster and the Paranormal</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>We
talked with Mr. Hansen about his work in parapsychology and he explained his
work and success in ganzfeld experimentation.<span>&nbsp;
</span>He also got into Trickster characteristics as they are revealed in
mythology and how the constellation of characteristics help to explain some of
the ways that society views paranormal and supernatural events.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mr. Hansen’s theory examines liminality,
antistructure, and binary opposites and how such concepts are linked to the
Trickster constellation as well as the supernatural.<span>&nbsp; </span>We talked in depth about the lives of Saints,
Holy Madness, Fools for God, psychics, and more.<span>&nbsp; </span>What’s more, Mr. Hansen explains the concept
of the “betwixt and the between,” otherwise known as liminality, and the dangers
associated with liminality.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you
missed the live show, head to our archives to hear the interview!<span>&nbsp; </span>Feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:isisinvestigator@aol.com">isisinvestigator@aol.com</a> to comment;
we look forward to hearing from all of our listeners.<o:p> <br></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">Next week, we are airing a
special episode with Rose Rosetree on her latest book <em>Become the Most Important Person in the Room: Your 30-day Plan for
Empath Empowerment.</em><span>&nbsp; </span>We’ve had Rose
on the show with us before and she is a sheer delight!<span>&nbsp; </span>We’ll be discussing, at length, Rose’s
step-by-step guide to improving your empathic abilities naturally.<span>&nbsp; </span>This special episode will air on Saturday,

Paranormal chat room to poses questions for the guest!</p>

Hansen - Jan 10,2010</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2010/01/10/ISIS-Paranormal-Radio-George-P-Hansen</link><description><![CDATA[George P, Hansen was a professional parapsychologist for a period of eight years, three of which he was employed by the Rhine Research Center in Durham, North Carolina, and the remaining five years where he was employed by the Psychophysical Research Laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey. Hansen’s experimentation included experiments with card guessing, remote viewing, ganzfeld, electronic random number generators, seance phenomena and ghosts. Hansen has been active in several UFO, psychic, and New Age organizations and he also help establish a skeptics group. Hansen has been published in a number of scientific journals and his papers focus on mathematical statistics, deception and fraud, the skeptics movement, exposes of hoaxes, and conjurers in parapsychology. Hansen is further a member of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, and the author of Ghost and Liminality as well as the book The Trickster and the Paranormal. The latter book examines why UFOs and parapsychology are shunned by conventional science; how literary criticism and anthropology apply to the paranormal; why mystical practices and psychic phenomena are associated with one another; and why tabloids choose to put paranormal issues as features on their front page. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal-radio-show/'>paranormal radio show</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal-radio-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal-radio-show.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-triskster-and-the-paranormal/'>The Triskster and the Paranormal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-triskster-and-the-paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-triskster-and-the-paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/parapsychology-and-psychics/'>parapsychology and psychics</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/parapsychology-and-psychics.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/parapsychology-and-psychics.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/george-hansen/'>George Hansen</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/george-hansen.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/george-hansen.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal-radio-podcast/'>paranormal radio podcast</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal-radio-podcast.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal-radio-podcast.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[George P, Hansen was a professional parapsychologist for a period of eight years, three of which he was employed by the Rhine Research Center in Durham, North Carolina, and the remaining five years where he was employed by the Psychophysical Research Laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey.

why UFOs as well as parapsychology are shunned by establishment science, how

you miss last Sunday’s show on ISIS Paranormal Radio?<span>&nbsp; </span>Then you missed a fantastic show!<span>&nbsp; </span>We had the pleasure of interviewing Nicole
Bray along with her co-author Robert Dushane about their paranormal groups, investigations,
and experiences.<span>&nbsp; </span>We talked about the
books that Bray and DuShane have written, including Haunted Michigan Nightlife,
Paranormal Lansing, and the Haunted History of Kalamazoo too.<span>&nbsp; </span>The discussion involved the sharing of ideas
about why paranormal events happen, the differences between different types of
hauntings, and how paranormal investigations are handled.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you missed the show, hit up our archives
now and listen in!<span>&nbsp; </span>We have also written
a book review on Haunted Michigan Nightlife which can be accessed on the
official <a href="http://isisinvestigations.com/Mich-haunted-nightlife.html">ISIS
Paranormal Investigations</a> website if you want to know more about the cases
that are covered in the book.<span>&nbsp; </span>Feel free
to check out the review at your leisure.<span>&nbsp;

via a telephone interview in June this past year.<span>&nbsp; </span>Stephanie was kind enough to speak with us in
the wee hours of the morning as we were calling her from New York and she
resides in Australia! =)<span>&nbsp; </span>We truly
appreciated Stephanie’s time, and you will find the interview tremendously
informative.<span>&nbsp; </span>Check out our June 2009

Nicole grew up in a home where the former owner of the home committed suicide, and she began to research the phenomena that occurred around her on a daily basis. Eventually, her passion for the paranormal led her to start one of the most well-known paranormal investigations teams in the state of Michigan. She has co-authored Michigan’s Haunted Nightlife and Paranormal Lansing with Reverend Robert DuShane, published by Schiffer Books. Robert is the founder of WPARanromal Inc., a Michigan non profit, clergy led Paranormal Investigation team based in Southwest Michigan. Tonight we will also be joined by Robert DuShane. Robert is the founder of WPARanormal Incorporated, and he grew up in a Portage home where seeing Indians roaming about was a regular occurrence. Robert didn’t suspect at the time that the site of the home was once a site of an Indian massacre. Such instances cause Robert’s interests in the paranormal to flourish and he became a paranormal investigator as well as the host of WPARanormal Talk Radio which was founded in 2003.

As a child, she was interested in supernatural stories; anything from vampire legends to folktales about witchcraft, and then there was her family’s favorite, Unsolved Mysteries. At thirteen, Angela Kaufman found Doreen Valiente's ABC's of Witchcraft and became increasingly focused on Wiccan spirituality and magick as well as the power of dreams, divination, and energy work. Now, many years later, she is a priestess in the Dragon Warriors of Isis coven, and she has begun to put all her interests to work in learning how to recognize the natural and supernatural in all things.

Tsoukalos has been the Director of Erich von Däniken’s Center for Ancient Astronaut Research (A.A.S. R.A. - Archaeology, Astronautics, and SETI Research Association) for the past decade. Tsoukalos has often been described as a genuine Indiana Jones looking to alter the world’s perceptions about Ancient Astronaut Theory. Giorgio is also the well-known Publisher of the Legendary Times Magazine: a research journal totally dedicated to Ancient Astronaut Theory. Giorgio is considered a leading expert in the field and he has had appearances on The Travel Channel, The History Channel, the Sci-Fi Channel, the National Geographic Channel, as well as Coast to Coast AM. He has had a number of radio and television spots internationally as well as on programs like Ancient Aliens, and UFO Hunters where he has reported about the most recent discoveries in the field of Ancient Astronauts. Giorgio produced and starred in Ancient Aliens in 2009, a two hour long documentary that appeared on the History Channel; the film was produced by Prometheus Entertainment. In the film, Giorgio was joined by other professionals in the field including David H. Childress, Erich von Däniken, Jason Martell, Dr. Luis E. Navia, Michael A. Cremo, Barry Downing and others. A well traveled man; Giorgio has been to fifty four different countries and continues his world travels. As Erich von Däniken's official United States representative, Giorgio A. Tsoukalos will be joining ISIS Paranormal Radio to discuss his work and Erich von Däniken’s latest book History Is Wrong.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/aliens/'>Aliens</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/aliens.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/aliens.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ufos/'>UFOs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ncient-astronaut-theory/'>ncient Astronaut Theory</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ncient-astronaut-theory.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ncient-astronaut-theory.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/legendary-times/'>Legendary Times</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/legendary-times.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/legendary-times.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal/'>Paranormal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Giorgio A.

The film is a documentary on the Romanian strigoi, ghosts, and forest spirits. Justin and Matthew are American film makers that traveled to Romania to create their latest production to interview the local people and to collect and compile the legends and lore of the people related to vampires and supernatural happenings. Matthew Vincent and Justin Blair traveled to the west of the Carpathian Mountains in Romania to find out about Romanian supernatural beliefs. While the team was aware of the eerie reputation of Transylvania attributed to Bram Stoker and Dracula, they found the lore of the region much more exciting. The film makers documented stories about the strigoi, a creature with similar characteristics to the vampire, but also having characteristics similar to ghosts. The film examines countless strigoi reports, reports of strange abductions, reports on pricolici (a weredog), and more.

Matthew Vincent and Justin Blair traveled to the west of the Carpathian Mountains in Romania to find out about Romanian supernatural beliefs. While the team was aware of the eerie reputation of Transylvania attributed to Bram Stoker and Dracula, they found the lore of the region much more exciting.

In 1989, Bauval published a study which argued that the layout of the three Giza Pyramids and their relative position to the Nile was intended to replicate the layout of the three stars in Orion’s belt and their relative position to the Milky Way. The thesis is known as the Orion Correlation Theory and is the subject of Bauval’s first book: The Orion Mystery, which has been translated into more than twenty languages and has been highlighted on the BBC, ABC, the Discovery Channel, and others. Bauval later co-authored the Message of the Sphinx with Graham Hancock, and he then followed the latter publication with Secret Chamber, Tailsman (also with Graham Hancock), and The Egypt Code. Bauval is presently working on a new book entitled Sirius Rising, which will trace the influence of the Egyptian Star-Goddess Sopdet (Sirius) from prehistoric times to the early Christian Era and which will focus on Her role in the rebirth cult and temple rituals and alignments. Bauval resides in Spain and once resided near the Giza pyramids with his wife Michelle while working on The Egypt Code. Tonight, Robert Bauval will be joining us to discuss The Egypt Code: a book which examines the ground/sky correlation of Egyptian landmarks and examines the possibility of a grand plan spanning 3,000 years of pharaonic civilization involving pyramids and major temple sites along the Nile. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/egypt/'>Egypt</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/egypt.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/egypt.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/pyramids/'>Pyramids</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/pyramids.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/pyramids.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/stars/'>Stars</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/stars.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/stars.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/alignment/'>Alignment</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/alignment.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/alignment.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal/'>paranormal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Robert Bauval was born in Alexandria Egypt and later traveled to England to pursue his education in Building Construction and Management at the University of the South Bank in London.

Peggy Schmidt works with Andrea Martnishn as they share their enthusiasm through their books, walking tours, special events, and paranormal investigations. Tails of the Afterlife: True Stories of Ghost Pets was recently released by Schiffer Books in 2009 and is a 160 page paperback that explores how departed pets communicate with their former owners with “Kisses” and “Postcards” from heaven and there are a number of heartwarming animal related stories shared in the text. The book highlights true stories about animal spirit visitations, and further examines how the love between a pet and pet owner can transcend the physical plane. Questions addressed in the text include whether or not animals communicate with the living after they have passed on, if animals can see spirits, and if animals can protect you at your bedside from spirits too. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/animals/'>animals</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/animals.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/animals.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/spirits/'>spirits</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirits.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirits.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/spirit-communication/'>spirit communication</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirit-communication.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirit-communication.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/life-after-death/'>life after death</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/life-after-death.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/life-after-death.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ghosts/'>ghosts</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ghosts.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ghosts.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Peggy Schmidt is the author of Tails of the Afterlife: True Stories of Ghost Pets and a partnered owner of Ghost Tours of Phoenixville, a company that was born from the collaborative efforts between two lifelong friends that have maintained a serious interest in the unexplained.

When he was as young as the age of 7, he began having paranormal and unexplainable experiences. Not quite understanding what was happening at the time, the events that he experienced led him to continued interests in the paranormal. At the age of 15, he began studying different haunted places, haunted cemeteries, and other paranormal subjects. Once he realized that paranormal activity is real and paranormal events do occur, his interests pertaining to the “other side” increased immensely. Now, he has dedicated himself to the continued study of the paranormal and to seeking out the answers that so many others seek. He is a member of the Dragon Warriors of Isis coven and he is working his way toward eldership, so that one day he can teach others what has been freely taught to him.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paganism/'>paganism</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paganism.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paganism.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/wicca/'>Wicca</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/wicca.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/wicca.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/occult/'>occult</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/occult.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/occult.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/magick/'>magick</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/magick.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/magick.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal/'>paranormal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Justyn's interests in the paranormal began at a very early age.

<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Justyn's
interests in the paranormal began at a very early age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was as young as the age of 7, he
began having paranormal and unexplainable experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not quite understanding what was happening at
the time, the events that he experienced led him to continued interests in the
paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the age of 15, he began
studying different haunted places, haunted cemeteries, and other paranormal
subjects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once he realized that
paranormal activity is real and paranormal events do occur, his interests
pertaining to the “other side” increased immensely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, he has dedicated himself to the
continued study of the paranormal and to seeking out the answers that so many
others seek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is a member of the
Dragon Warriors of Isis coven and he is working his way toward eldership, so
that one day he can teach others what has been freely taught to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justyn has been featured in The Discovery
Channel’s “A Haunting” and in the documentary “14 Degrees” produced by New
Gravity Media.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Justyn's
interests in the paranormal began at a very early age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was as young as the age of 7, he
began having paranormal and unexplainable experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not quite understanding what was happening at
the time, the events that he experienced led him to continued interests in the
paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the age of 15, he began
studying different haunted places, haunted cemeteries, and other paranormal
subjects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once he realized that
paranormal activity is real and paranormal events do occur, his interests
pertaining to the “other side” increased immensely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, he has dedicated himself to the
continued study of the paranormal and to seeking out the answers that so many
others seek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is a member of the
Dragon Warriors of Isis coven and he is working his way toward eldership, so
that one day he can teach others what has been freely taught to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justyn has been featured in The Discovery
Channel’s “A Haunting” and in the documentary “14 Degrees” produced by New
Gravity Media.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

More on Angela Kaufman<br>
<br>
Angela Kaufman, a witch, psychic artist and profound tarot card reader, has maintained a lifelong belief in paranormal phenomena. As a child, she was interested in supernatural stories; anything from vampire legends to folktales about witchcraft, and then there was her family’s favorite, Unsolved Mysteries. At thirteen, Angela Kaufman found Doreen Valiente's ABC's of Witchcraft and became increasingly focused on Wiccan spirituality and magick as well as the power of dreams, divination, and energy work.<br>
<br>
Now, many years later, she is a priestess in the Dragon Warriors of Isis coven, and She has begun to put all her interests to work in learning how to recognize the natural and supernatural in all things.&nbsp; At the suggestion of Pat and Dayna, she is thrilled to be getting the opportunity to utilize her interests in the supernatural combined with a long held hobby of drawing to assist the ISIS Paranormal Investigation team as a psychic artist.&nbsp; Tonight, Angela will be joining co-hosts Dayna and Patricia to discuss Interfaith Relationships!<br>

Turner, M.D. - Aug 16,2009</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/isisparanormal/2009/08/16/isis-paranormal-radio-and-john-l-turner-md</link><description><![CDATA[Dr. John L. Turner, M.D. is the author of Medicine, Miracles and Manifestations: A Doctor's Journey Through the Worlds of Divine Intervention, Near-Death Experiences, and Universal Energy; the book is a nonfiction work that explores Dr. Turner’s career as a surgeon and his spiritual quest as he became involved in the field of Integral Medicine. Following his graduation from Ohio State University and earning his degree in Engineering Physics, Dr. Turner continued onto graduate school. About three years into his graduate studies, Dr. Turner received a book on Edgar Cayce called The Sleeping Prophet. The book changed Dr. Turner’s life, and he became excited about the existence of a spiritual world. Dr. Turner then decided to attend Ohio State University College of Medicine where he earned his M.D. During his career as a surgeon, Dr. Turner's curiosity about the spiritual world prompted him to examine several nontraditional healing modalities that broadened the scope of his patients’ recovery; healing modalities that include the use of Johrei (a Japanese healing art), chanting, meditation, soul travel, astral projection, and precognition/remote viewing. Medicine, Miracles, and Manifestations is a work that examines how metaphysical events like telepathy, remote viewing, and life after death are verifiable manifestations and are events that occur when the human brain interfaces with the universal consciousness. This evening, Dr. Turner will be joining us for a special 90 minute airing from 6 PM to 7:30 PM ET. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/manifestations/'>manifestations</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/manifestations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/manifestations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/miracles/'>miracles</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/miracles.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/miracles.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/medicine/'>medicine</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/medicine.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/medicine.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal/'>paranormal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/spirits/'>spirits</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirits.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spirits.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Dr. John L.

As a child, she was interested in supernatural stories; anything from vampire legends to folktales about witchcraft, and then there was her family’s favorite, Unsolved Mysteries. At thirteen, Angela Kaufman found Doreen Valiente's ABC's of Witchcraft and became increasingly focused on Wiccan spirituality and magick as well as the power of dreams, divination, and energy work. Now, many years later, she is a priestess in the Dragon Warriors of Isis coven, and She has begun to put all her interests to work in learning how to recognize the natural and supernatural in all things. At the suggestion of Pat and Dayna, she is thrilled to be getting the opportunity to utilize my interests in the supernatural combined with a long held hobby of drawing to assist the ISIS Paranormal Investigation team as a psychic artist.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/tarot-readings/'>tarot readings</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/tarot-readings.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/tarot-readings.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/tarot/'>tarot</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/tarot.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/tarot.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/free-readings/'>free readings</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/free-readings.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/free-readings.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/paranormal/'>paranormal</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/paranormal.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/wicca/'>Wicca</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/wicca.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/wicca.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Angela Kaufman, a witch, psychic artist and profound tarot card reader, has maintained a lifelong belief in paranormal phenomena.
