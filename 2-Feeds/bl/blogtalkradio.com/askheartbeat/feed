However, what they do not agree on are the causes of the problems between Black men and women. Some believe that Black men are the problem while others contend that Black women contribute disproportionately to Black male/female conflict. Its time to examine the ways in which men and women are socialized to not only enter, but to navigate relationships with each other. What are the ways socialization affects how Black men and women perform specific gender scripts and sex roles in romantic relationships? Our special guest is Kedrick Griffin, Senior DIrector of Prograns of Men Can Stop Rapes program for young men. Hell share the goals of their "Men of Strength (MOST)" Club and its impact on the rape culture so prevalent in the Black community.

The rate of marriage is at an all time low in the African American community; and is the lowest among all other racial groups in the United States. Upon doing research, we came across a trending topic on twitter with persons of color, ages ranging from 25-45 years, stating why they are single and unmarried. In 2001, according to data collected by the U.S Census: African Americans are the most uncoupled ethnicity at 43.3 percent for black men, and 41.9 percent for black women in contrast to 27.4 percent and 20.7 percent for whites respectively. In a 2006 Washington Post article written by Washington writer, Joy Jones, Marriage Is For White People. It&rsquo;s been her observation that women are being hit the hardest, and that marriage may not be as possible or sustainable as she would like. Since marriage isn&rsquo;t a possibility, black women turn to negated effects like having babies out of wedlock, birth control, divorce and remarriage which has completely transformed the social landscape. In our conclusion, we believe a cultural war is being waged against the institution of marriage in the African American community. We decided to do an in depth documentary film on why peoples of color are single. Join us tonight as we discuss the issue of singleness in the Black community with producer/director Adam Butler.

We address the question of why men insist on having the upper hand in any situation involving a female, demanding that a woman "submit" herself to their dominance and control? In light of the Congressional hearings on women and mens fear of birth control, the battle to overturn Roe v. Wade, and the war being waged on women around the world, I think it relevant to reference Valerie Solanas 1967 S.C.U.M. Manifesto. Finally, when a man believes that female submission is a good thing for a relationship or marriage, what exactly is it that he is expecting? Must a woman submit for her man to be happy? Lets discuss the whole concept of submission and its appropriateness in the modern relationship and marriage.

We address the question of why men insist on having the upper hand in any situation involving a female, demanding that a woman "submit" herself to their dominance and control? In light of the Congressional hearings on women and mens fear of birth control, the battle to overturn Roe v. Wade, and the war being waged on women around the world, I think it relevant to reference Valerie Solanas 1967 S.C.U.M. Manifesto. Finally, when a man believes that female submission is a good thing for a relationship or marriage, what exactly is it that he is expecting? Must a woman submit for her man to be happy?

Black men across the country repeatedly state that monogamy is counter to their nature and that through marriage, women attempt to control male sexuality.

Surprisingly, there are growing numbers of Black women that agree with this position, and believe that polygamous marriages should be made legal.

Black men across the country repeatedly state that monogamy is counter to their nature and that through marriage, women attempt to control male sexuality. Other men say that polygamous unions would be a way to resolve the issue of high rate of single black women in the U.S., and to ensure that children have fathers around. Surprisingly, there are growing numbers of Black women that agree with this position, and believe that polygamous marriages should be made legal.

Most of the accused perpetrators have been trusted and influential members of the community - people no one would suspect of being a pedophile. Statistics on the sexual assaults of children under the age of 18 are shocking and deeply disturbing. Trafficking, molestation, rape, and prostitution have become commonplace. The majority of these crimes by Black men against Black children being tolerated and seemingly accepted in our communities. Why? What s going on with Black men? Why are these beasts not being arrested and prosecuted en masse? Why the silence by women and lack of action by allegedly "good black men?" Guest experts include Dr. Joyce Morley-Ball of doctorjoyce.com, and Sylvia Coleman of blacksurvivors.org.

Spending time getting to know someone, patiently discovering who and what they are over a period of months seems to be a concept that is foreign to singles in 2011. Men dont want to pay for dates and women allow them to get away with it. In the place of dating is the male-centered hookup - instant physical involvement with false intimacy that uisually leads to heartbreak.

Why is it that a female being "submissive" to them is so important to Black men? What is behind the push to make Black women feel guilty for being assertive and demanding in her relationships? And why is it that so many Black women are willing to dumb down their intelligence and turn over their power to men that are nowhere near on their level, just to have a relationship or be married?

He tells you that it is his right and privilege to lead you because he is "on point". Do Black women resist getting with men they feel are on their level educationally and professionally, or do they avoid these men because of their mandate that women submit?

These standards have been consistently been ridiculed by Black men all over BlogTalkRadio! Enough already! Tonight I'll be asking some hard questions: Why do so many Black men feel that a woman seeking an established mate, or a man with a college degree, or a mate with no stray children, or a man that has never been married or locked up in prison, and that has himself together is wrong? Why are Black women with standards consistently condemned for being "too picky" by Black men? It would seem that many Black men believe Black women have no right to demand to have a man on her level educationally, emotionally, socially or economically, nor the right to reject any man as a date or potential long-term partner for not meeting her standards. We'll be discussing this and other conflicts concerning standards of behavior, achievement and expectations Black women have of the men they want to love and marry tonight.

Most of it would seem to be a major difference in foundational principles and beliefs about what makes a man, what makes a woman, and what makes a relationship "work."

Why do so many Black men choose to shoot down the messenger because they don't like the message - resorting to name calling, blaming and denigrating females?

Tonight we look at how men feel about a "strong" woman; the possible long-term impact of a woman being raised to be independent of men, and why so many men seem confused about the roles of men and women in 2010. Is there a societal backlash against women due to their independence and the demands now being placed on men to change? Have men and the concept of commitment and marriage kept up with the changes in women? What role does the modern man play in women's lives and in relationships?

As we prepare to move into 2010, many of you will be leaving old loves and relationships behind. What are your plans for next year? If you ended up disgusted with the way you were treated, fed up with men (or women), and frustrated about how your last relationship ultimately turned out, this is a great show for you! We'll focus on how you can seek something different and hopefully much better for 2010. In the meantime, ask yourself what behaviors do you now recognize as self-defeating?

In this lifestyle choice, the female is the dominating partner that rules the male with a no-nonsense expectation of adherence to her demands. Our guests include Melissa Febos, author of a soon to be published book entitled "Whip Smart!" Elihu, a male submissive, and I.G. Frederick, author of "Dommemoir."

Almost half the Black female population over the age of 18 in the U.S. is single. We'll explore the nuances of love between races, what Black women need that they aren't getting from Black men, and the fears and stereotypes which may be preventing Black women from opening their arms and hearts to White men. Does love really have a color? Cheryl Y. Judice, Ph.D., is a sociologist and professor of African American Studies at Northwestern University and the author of the only scholarly treatise on black females with White men entitled Interracial Relationships - Black Women and White Men. Karyn Folan is the author of a soon to be released book on the same subject entitled "Don't Bring Home A White Boy and other Notions that Keep Black Women From Dating Out." Karyn feels that "Black women aren't doing anything 'wrong' as far as dating goes... but the math is against us if we're only looking at black men. We outnumber them in some major cities at a ratio which some experts say could be as high as 10:1. That means we have two choices: look beyond race for romantic partners or remain single." Cicely J. is the author of the soon to be released book Black Men vs. White Men – The Black Woman's Choice. Cicely feels that more and more Black women are falling for their Mr. Right in the form of blonde hair and blue eyes because Darnell, DaQuan, and Tyrone are not equipped to meet her halfway.

On the flip side we have men and women that have no standards at all and take anything that comes along just to avoid being alone. Is it unrealistic for an educated Black woman to want to have a similarly educated Black man by her side? Why is it that women think book smarts is so important.

Why are many men so hesitant to give their commitment, preferring to play it fast and loose with booty calls and friends with benefits (FWB) type relationships? What is it that men need to see or hear before they willingly and happily commit? Discussion of male commitment fears, what commitment means to men and women, and why men seem to avoid it!

My special guest will be Alan Roger Currie, author of Mode One and host of BlogTalk show Up Front and Straightforward. Also appearing will be author Saundra E. Harris and Deidre Bacon, hosts of WSER Sassy Entertainment with host Sassy & Dlyte which brings you provocative and entertaining Internet radio every Thursday @ 9pm EST/ 6PM PST. We'll discuss the sexual double standard men have which demands that to be worthy of marriage, a woman must be relatively untouched by other men. Where did this attitude originate and why do Black men have it? Should women tell the truth or pretend to be less experienced than they are to protect men's egos? We'll also investigate women's sexuality in long-term relationships and marriage... how do women decide between the man that is stable and the man that is a sexual God? In other words, how do women choose between the stable nice guy who may be trustworthy and a good father figure, but who is sexually boring and the guy that makes her feel like a total woman but won't commit? This is a very real challenge for many, many American women. Many do settle for the good guy, only to be sorry about it later. Many choose the player who is good in bed, and they're sorry about that choice later as well. What to do ladies? What to do?

With Black churches filled primarily with women, is the Pastor in a position to teach equality and understanding and responsibility to men, or are they instead brainwashing women into accepting misogynistic treatment by men as the norm? Is this really the kind of relationship that Black men expect? Could this be the real reason Black women are not marrying... they refuse to place themselves under the foot of a male that believes he is superior to women? Should Christians date non-believers?

Black men have messed up minds and belief systems because they demand that Black women subjugate themselves. What would we do that for? How is religion and male dominance helping Black women in 2009? This is the #1 topic on the table for this broadcast. With Black churches filled primarily with women, is the Pastor in a position to teach equality and understanding and responsibility to men, or are they instead brainwashing women into accepting misogynistic treatment by men as the norm? Is this really the kind of relationship that Black men expect? Could this be the real reason Black women are not marrying... they refuse to place themselves under the foot of a male that believes he is superior to women? Should Christians date non-believers? Why would a man in 2009 think its okay to use the Bible as justification to control and abuse women? That's my stance - what's yours?

To these fellows, a woman who would dare upset the well estblished imbalance of power by requesting an equal share, respect and opportunities for females is viewed as someone whose goal is to destroy the Black family, and Black men in particular. Nothing could be further from the truth. <BR>
<BR>
Taking a stand against male oppression and fighting for women to have the right to make choices for her own life does not mean that such a woman is against you. Being pro-woman does not mean that one is anti-male. <BR>
<BR>
According to the dictionary, feminism is "the movement for the full social, political and economic equality of all people." When viewed in those terms, how could any decent man be against the feminist movement? <BR>
<BR>
For thousands of years, society has been constructed to place men in a position of superiority over women. Our social structure has placed males in control, which means men have conveniently had things their way for generations. Men have been judge jury and executioner over what is right and wrong for women generations. Men will of course resist and resent any female that would have the gall to say that the old way ain't benefitting her, so she has no interest in participating in that system. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Why I Decided to Become a Feminist <BR>
</STRONG>I am compelled to write this post after many months of listening to Black men complain about "the natural order of things" as they relate to Black women subjugating themselves to men. That, along with the Biblical quotes used to justify persecution of adult women and the sexuality of both women and girls inspired me to investigate the reasons so many Black men felt entitled to have things the way they wanted. <BR>
<BR>
Several blog posts followed including The Male Struggle for Control of Female Sexulity, Are Black Men Judgmental Haters of Black Women?, and the upcoming radio broadcast How Religion Messes Up the Minds of Men. The last straw was delivered to my e-mail box in the form of a link to an Internet radio program. <BR>
<BR>
The guest was a middle aged Black man who purports to be a leader in the men's rights movement. What possible rights could men want that they don't already have? I wondered to myself. I clicked the link only to be saddened and dismayed at the majority of the guest's statements, as they expressed a toxic anger and deep rage at Black women. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Let The Shit Fly <BR>
</STRONG>The guest led off the interview by expressing his belief that the Black woman has failed to address the needs of Black men, especially her own sons. He provided no facts to back up his rather brash statement. Nor did he elaborate on which needs men have that Black women failed to address, but he didn't need to. The statement was like throwing gasoline on an already burning fire, and was enough to start the finger pointing and blaming of Black women by the Black male callers, which proceeded unabated throughout the 2 hour show. <BR>
<BR>
I continued to listen as he railed on, stating that all hell broke loose in America when the 1970s feminist movement came into being. His opinion was that all the dysfunction in the Black community, the collapse of every institution such as our churches, schools, families and communities was due to the distortion of gender roles brought about by feminists. He felt Gloria Steinheim's statement: "a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle" was a declaration of gender war. <BR>
<BR>
Let me stop here and interject my thoughts. <BR>
<BR>
When the honorable guest spoke of what Black women failed to do for Black men, I wondered where the Black men were in this equation. I mean, on one hand women are angrily charged with failure when we TRY to raise a young black man. We're told "a woman cannot raise a boy into a man!" But we try valiantly anyway, since Dad is nowhere around, preferring his crack pipe, White woman, or his boyz to the day to day responsibility of his son's psyche and success in life. <BR>
<BR>
"This is where Black women have failed!" he shouts. "Black women are not raising their sons into good Black men!" <BR>

Has texting become the newest addition to the list of "if you can’t beat 'em, join 'em?" I believe the growing preference for texting has a lot to do with its impersonal nature.

Listen to the broadcast here:&nbsp; <a href="Podcast%20of%204/17/08%20Interview%20with%20Doc%20Love">Podcast of 4/17/08 Interview with Doc Love</a><br><br>I am very familiar with Doc Love through his work on the website AskMen.Com, and for several years I've posted my criticism of his theories and belief systems about women and how men can be successful with them.&nbsp; Basically he attempts to label and categorize women's emotional response so that men can use logic and exhibit the "appriopriate" behaviors to gain control of the relationship and the woman. In my mind, the things Doc Love proposes men do to "get" a woman are ridiculous games, full of pretense, and unworthy of a true man with solid confidence seeking a woman of similar character. <br><br>Basically, we disagree on so many issues about this stuff it's not even funny.<br><br>I had to consider that perhaps at least a part of our opposing stance has to do with racial and cultural differences, because his market is primarily young Caucasian men and I of course interact primarily with women (of all races), and Black men and women in particular.&nbsp; I have almost 2 decades of experience on the web interacting with men and women all over the world, and notice a very real difference in how each responds to the opposite sex.&nbsp; <br><br>But back to Dock Love.&nbsp; Many the behaviors he espouses are things that would make a woman that was serious and with her stuff together (allegedly the type of woman a man would want to marry), shoot him to the curb with an immediacy that would make his head spin!<br><br>For example. one of Doc Love's primary guidelines is that after a guy gets a woman's home phone number, he should not call her for 4 to 9 days.&nbsp; Let's just use 7 days as a guideline since its just about in the middle of the range.&nbsp; Here is a typical scenario of how that would go with a woman that is not desperate and stupid:<br><br>Solid interesting together woman meets a guy, he gets her number telling her how interested he is in getting to know her.&nbsp; She doesn't give her number out to every knucklehead that asks for it, so she sees him as someone special and is very excited about the possibilities of a date with him and the opportunity to find out more about him. <br><br>But he sits on the number, playing the Doc Love game so he won't be "predictable", and doesn't call her for a week.&nbsp; According to Doc Love, he is building up interest and that she is thinking about him and hanging around waiting for him to call.&nbsp; <br><br>HAHAHA!&nbsp; NOT!<br><br>That woman, who is confident and secure in herself and her desirability is doing no such thing. She was excited the first day, a little less so by the second, and by the third she is irritated and tells her friends he must be married or a player.&nbsp; By the fourth day she has blown him off as just another number collecting fool and shakes her head at how stupid men are and miss out on opportunities by playing stupid games.&nbsp; <br><br>By the fifth day she is disgusted and hits the happy hour with her sorors.&nbsp; There she meets a great guy that is funny, enthusiastic, and makes his interest in her known.&nbsp; He calls the next day to touch base and tell her he enjoyed meeting her and is busy with a project at work, but wants to call her so they can have a chat on the phone or meet up for a drink.&nbsp; He makes her laugh.&nbsp; He asks what time is good (respecting her work schedule as well).&nbsp; They decide to chat on the phone as they are both under tight deadlines.&nbsp; They have a great 20 minute conversation and she goes to bed with a smile.&nbsp; They've agreed to get together for a drink the next day.&nbsp; This is Friday.&nbsp; She has a date, she has a man that is paying attention to her, and who is interesting and handsome.&nbsp; She can't wait for the date.&nbsp; THAT is the man she is thinking about.&nbsp; All night and all the next day.<br><br>So when homey from last week calls trying to be all casual, after sweating for a week following his Doc Love rules, he gets "WHO? Oh you!&nbsp; Well I'm seeing someone else, so bye!"&nbsp; You did not "build interest" fool, you knocked yourself out of the ring!<br><br>Get this guys, hanging onto a REAL woman's phone number, not a silly insecure girl with low self esteem desperate for a date, is not the way to do things.&nbsp; However, if you are okay with dating silly insecure girls with low self esteem, then by all means play those games.<br><br>Some guys say well you can't call too soon, women don't like it if you call too soon.<br><br>That is bull too.<br><br>For one thing, if a woman likes you, there is no such thing as too soon.&nbsp; You can call her 10 minutes later and its not too soon.&nbsp; I have a survey operating on my website which has polled more than 5,000 single men and women over a 2 year period and I can tell you flatly that waiting to call a woman that is excited about talking to you does NOT help anything.<br><br>On the flip side if she is not into you, it won't matter if you call her the next day or a month later, she still won't be interested.&nbsp; It's not how soon you called, its that she wasn't interested in the first place!&nbsp; And really, you should find that out SOONER rather than later so you can get on with your life.&nbsp; So call already!<br><br>Another of Doc Love's theories that I disagree strongly with is this:&nbsp; Women With High Interest Level will chase men that are a challenge, and always keep dates.&nbsp; He says that if a woman does break a date, she is not interested.&nbsp; That is so not true!<br><br>Not only does the reality of our lives sometimes get in the way of dating (illness, work, children from prior relationships, menstrual cramps, etc.) sometimes women can sense that a man is trying to control her response and behavior and getting a little too cocky about how much she is into him.&nbsp; So in order to bring him down a notch or two, she flips the script on him and breaks a date so that HE will be in the "I wonder what she feels for me" seat.&nbsp; Kinda levels the playing field.&nbsp; Does not always mean she isn't interested.&nbsp; It just means she recognizes the game you are playing and she plays it back!<br><br>Now when I mentioned my opposing viewpoints to Doc Love, he termed women who thought as I do about a man not calling "structured."&nbsp; When I tried to explain my thoughts, he rudely talked over me and drowned me out.&nbsp; Poor manners!&nbsp; Whatever happened to "ladies first?"&nbsp; Doc Love claimed that structured women are the only ones that will not respond positively to his system and that they should be kicked to the curb.<br><br>Well if that is the case, I say all women need to be "structured" with regards to how they expect men to treat them!&nbsp; Have some boundaries and standards for the men in your life.&nbsp; Remember, WOMEN CHOOSE MEN.&nbsp; So if he does not treat you in the way you expect to be treated, with the respect and attention you want, then he is not offering you the RELATIONSHIP you want.&nbsp; If you give him what he wants at your expense, he'll be happy and you will be miserable.&nbsp; And ultimately, you will leave him anyway, which is what Doc Love's system purports to prevent.<br><br>Dating is about providing an opportunity to explore another person's heart, mind and spirit, and to find the common ground upon which you might involve yourselves on a deeper level.&nbsp; Dating is about learning, not only about your partners, but about yourself!&nbsp; By showing appreciation, caring and respect to those you date, allowing them to know who you are, and encouraging them the to share themselves, you can create new relationships that are solid and rewarding.&nbsp; Not every woman you date is going to become a girlfriend or wife, but your life will still be fun, full and richer because you had the courage to be real.&nbsp; And for that you have my respect.<br><br>Deborrah Cooper (<a href="http://www.askheartbeat.com">Ms. HeartBeat</a>) <br><BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/love/'>love</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/love.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/love.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dating/'>dating</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dating.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dating.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/advice/'>advice</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/advice.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/advice.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/love/'>love</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/love.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/love.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/romance/'>romance</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/romance.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/romance.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/relationships/'>relationships</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/relationships.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/relationships.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/doc-love/'>Doc Love</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/doc-love.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/doc-love.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/men/'>men</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/men.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/men.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/women/'>women</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/women.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/women.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dating-games/'>dating games</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dating-games.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dating-games.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[I was invited by Alan Roger Currie, host of blogtalk show Upfront and Straightforward and author of Mode One to co-host his show earlier this evening, and participate in the interview with Doc Love.

period and I can tell you flatly that waiting to call a woman that is excited about talking to you does NOT help anything.<br><br>On the flip side if she is not into you, it won't matter if you call her the next day or a month later, she still won't be interested.&nbsp; It's not how soon you called, its that she wasn't interested in the first place!&nbsp; And really, you should find that out SOONER rather than later so you can get on with your life.&nbsp; So call already!<br><br>Another of Doc Love's theories that I disagree strongly with is this:&nbsp; Women With High Interest Level will chase men that are a challenge, and always keep dates.&nbsp; He says that if a woman does break a date, she is not interested.&nbsp; That is so not true!<br><br>Not only does the reality of our lives sometimes get in the way of dating (illness, work, children from prior relationships, menstrual cramps, etc.) sometimes women can sense that a man is trying to control her response and behavior and getting a little too cocky about how much she is into him.&nbsp; So in order to bring him down a notch or two, she flips the script on him and breaks a date so that HE will be in the "I wonder what she feels for me" seat.&nbsp; Kinda levels the playing field.&nbsp; Does not always mean she isn't interested.&nbsp; It just means she recognizes the game you are playing and she plays it back!<br><br>Now when I mentioned my opposing viewpoints to Doc Love, he termed women who thought as I do about a man not calling "structured."&nbsp; When I tried to explain my thoughts, he rudely talked over me and drowned me out.&nbsp; Poor manners!&nbsp; Whatever happened to "ladies first?"&nbsp; Doc Love claimed that structured women are the only ones that will not respond positively to his system and that they should be kicked to the curb.<br><br>Well if that is the case, I say all women need to be "structured" with regards to how they expect men to treat them!&nbsp; Have some boundaries and standards for the men in your life.&nbsp; Remember, WOMEN CHOOSE MEN.&nbsp; So if he does not treat you in the way you expect to be treated, with the respect and attention you want, then he is not offering you the RELATIONSHIP you want.&nbsp; If you give him what he wants at your expense, he'll be happy and you will be miserable.&nbsp; And ultimately, you will leave him anyway, which is what Doc Love's system purports to prevent.<br><br>Dating is about providing an opportunity to explore another person's heart, mind and spirit, and to find the common ground upon which you might involve yourselves on a deeper level.&nbsp; Dating is about learning, not only about your partners, but about yourself!&nbsp; By showing appreciation, caring and respect to those you date, allowing them to know who you are, and encouraging them the to share themselves, you can create new relationships that are solid and rewarding.&nbsp; Not every woman you date is going to become a girlfriend or wife, but your life will still be fun, full and richer because you had the courage to be real.&nbsp; And for that you have my respect.<br><br>Deborrah Cooper (<a

<br>
<br>
This was the subject of discussion on March 19th on the Sucka Free Dating Talk Show.  And I discovered some interesting facts as well as wildly negative perceptions of nice guys, especially by men!
<br>
<br>
Nice guys were labeled as losers, social rejects, short, angry little dickheads with no skills, weak and effeminate.  Nice guys are angry at players.  But players understand women's needs and give them what they want, make them feel hot and sexy and womanly and attractive. 
<br>
<br>
Nice guys instead try to befriend women and approach in a way that makes a woman see him as a brother, not a lover.  Nice guys also tended to be overly giving, supplicating, and much too agreeable which made women feel like they could walk all over him and he'd just lay there and take it. 
<br>
<br>
Women hate that kind of thing, and want a man to be strong - mentally, physically, and emotionally.
<br>
<br>
Rom Wills, author of the book "Nice Guys and Players - Becoming The Man Women Want" concluded the interview with three action items for nice guys:
<br>
<ol>
<li>
 Hit the gym and get your body into shape.  Looking like a Tele-Tubby, soft and fat, or soft and skinny does not inspire lust in women.  Muscle up and look manly!
</li>
<li>
Learn to recognize when a woman is showing an interest in you.  Women flirt in subtle ways and what players have over nice guys is the ability to pick up on that interest and exploit it!
</li>
<li>
Respect yourself and feel that you have value.  Stop putting yourself down and sucking up to women trying to get their approval all the time.  Mental strength means you are confident and comfortable in your skin as a man, whether a particular woman wants you or not.
</li>
</ol>
Listen to the March 19th broadcast for the full story!

<br>
<br>
This was the subject of discussion on March 19th on the Sucka Free Dating Talk Show.  And I discovered some interesting facts as well as wildly negative perceptions of nice guys, especially by men!
<br>
<br>
Nice guys were labeled as losers, social rejects, short, angry little dickheads with no skills, weak and effeminate.  Nice guys are angry at players.  But players understand women's needs and give them what they want, make them feel hot and sexy and womanly and attractive. 
<br>
<br>
Nice guys instead try to befriend women and approach in a way that makes a woman see him as a brother, not a lover.  Nice guys also tended to be overly giving, supplicating, and much too agreeable which made women feel like they could walk all over him and he'd just lay there and take it. 
<br>
<br>
Women hate that kind of thing, and want a man to be strong - mentally, physically, and emotionally.
<br>
<br>
Rom Wills, author of the book "Nice Guys and Players - Becoming The Man Women Want" concluded the interview with three action items for nice guys:
<br>
<ol>
<li>
 Hit the gym and get your body into shape.  Looking like a Tele-Tubby, soft and fat, or soft and skinny does not inspire lust in women.  Muscle up and look manly!
</li>
<li>
Learn to recognize when a woman is showing an interest in you.  Women flirt in subtle ways and what players have over nice guys is the ability to pick up on that interest and exploit it!
</li>
<li>
Respect yourself and feel that you have value.  Stop putting yourself down and sucking up to women trying to get their approval all the time.  Mental strength means you are confident and comfortable in your skin as a man, whether a particular woman wants you or not.
</li>
</ol>
Listen to the March 19th broadcast for the full story!
