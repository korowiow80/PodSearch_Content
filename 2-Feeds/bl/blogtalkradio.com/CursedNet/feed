31,2011</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/cursednet/2011/08/31/reflections-in-the-dark--byron-lebeau-returns--aug-252011</link><description><![CDATA[ (Used with permission) Last weeks show had so much information it still warrants another session with Byron LeBeau covering the UFO/Alien Deception. After having experience working with the then world&rsquo;s authority on UFOs, the now-deceased Colman Von Keviczky during the 1970s & 80s, Byron decided to become a UFO researcher in his own backyard on Long Island, N.Y., joining a local UFO investigative group. It was the springboard for his subsequent UFO & paranormal discussions, produced & hosted by Brian on local public access TV, circa 1995. By the end of 2005, Brian met both Greg Messina & Richard Stout through a &ldquo;coincidental&rdquo; series of UFO-related events, which actually led to the present collaboration between Richard & Brian &ldquo;brokered&rdquo; by Greg. The fruit of this combined endeavor is THE CURS-ED NET and a similarly named Blogtalk Radio show. The importance of this book can be summed up with the following admonition: To be forewarned is to be forearmed! Covering current events, news, media, the normal and paranormal Reflections In The Dark will go deeper into the shadows to reveal what is really going on out there.

When he was 24 years old, he had a "Saul on the road to Damascus" type of epiphany while reading the Bible. Thus began his Christian walk. He became interested in bible prophecy concerning the "end times" about 1996. In 1997, his first book Apocalypse Soon was published and became a bestseller in Ireland. It entered the Irish bestsellers list after an interview with Gareth OCallaghan, on RTE radio, who said he "read it in one sitting and was gripped." Another book The Apocalypse Generation was also a success. There has recently been amazing interest to-date in this new book The Nephilim and the Pyramid of the Apocalypse, published by Kensington Publishing, which Patrick believes is the FIRST EVER book proving overwhelmingly who built the pyramids and why. Patrick has a B.Sc. and M.A. in Business Studies from Trinity College, Dublin. He also holds a Degree in Theology and recently received an Honorary Doctorate in Christian Literature from the California Pacific School of Theology, Glendale, California, as a result of the research done in his book, The Nephilim and the Pyramid of the Apocalypse (Kensington Publishing). Dr. Heron is the Executive Producer of a TV special entitled Apocalypse and the End Times which is a Grizzly Adams production. This has been shown all over the United States and is currently available on DVD in stores nationwide. Patrick owns and runs his own company in Dublin, Ireland, where he lives with his family. He is not associated with any particular church or denomination. If you would like to do an interview or a "lifestyle piece", please click on Contact Us, above.

We cannot earn heaven on our own, despite any good works, lest we boast as per the writings of St. Paul.

We brought forth many witnesses to bear truth to ALL of the above.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/aliens/'>Aliens</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/aliens.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/aliens.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ufos/'>UFOs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/buzz-aldrin/'>Buzz Aldrin</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/buzz-aldrin.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/buzz-aldrin.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/edgar-mitchell/'>Edgar Mitchell</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edgar-mitchell.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/edgar-mitchell.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/supernatural/'>Supernatural</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/supernatural.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/supernatural.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></content:encoded><category domain="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">Paranormal</category><comments>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/cursednet/2011/07/17/curs-ed-net-breakthrough-radio-in-retrospect/#comments</comments><enclosure url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/cursednet/2011/07/17/curs-ed-net-breakthrough-radio-in-retrospect.mp3" length="26314420" type="audio/mpeg" /><guid>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/cursednet/2011/07/17/curs-ed-net-breakthrough-radio-in-retrospect</guid><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jul 2011 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><itunes:summary> This is Part 1 of a two-part, [approximate] four and a half hour retrospective of the KEY personalities and themes we had discussed over the last three years on this Internet podcast.

We will be delving deep into his book, "By Design" and cover topics such as: -EYE DESIGN & COLOR -IMPORTANCE OF THE FEATHER -AVIAN LUNG and more! Jonathan received his B.Sc. (hons) in Chemistry and his Ph.D. (Physical Chemistry) from Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. He has co-authored papers in mainstream scientific journals including one on high-temperature superconductors published in Nature when he was 22 years old. He has long been interested in apologetics, and was a co-founder of the Wellington Christian Apologetics Society (New Zealand). His first book Refuting Evolution (1999, 2008) was written to counter a teachers guidebook by the National Academy of Sciences (USA), Teaching about Evolution and the Nature of Science. It now has over 400,000 copies in print. He later wrote Refuting Evolution 2 (2002, 2010) and the highly acclaimed Refuting Compromise (2004, 2010), both as responses to attacks on the biblical view of history, plus the booklet Mammoth: Riddle of the Ice Age. Jonathan is co-author of the updated Creation Answers Book, 15 Reasons to Take Genesis as History (2006) and the booklet Why is there Death and Suffering? (2001). In 2008, he finished By Design: Evidence for nature&rsquo;s Intelligent Designer&mdash;the God of the Bible. And in 2010, Dr Sarfati wrote The Greatest Hoax on Earth? Refuting Dawkins on evolution, a response to leading atheopath Richard Dawkins&rsquo; latest book The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution (see website). He works full-time for Creation Ministries International in Atlanta GA, having relocated there in April 2010 from the Brisbane, Australia office.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/jonathan-sarfati/'>Jonathan Sarfati</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jonathan-sarfati.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jonathan-sarfati.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/evolution/'>Evolution</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/evolution.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/evolution.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/creationist/'>Creationist</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/creationist.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/creationist.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/creation-ministries/'>Creation Ministries</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/creation-ministries.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/creation-ministries.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/bible/'>Bible</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bible.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bible.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ We welcome back Dr. Jonathan Sarfati from Creation Ministries International.

He always knew what he wanted to believe, but had no way to express what he was thinking and no evidence to support his views. In his freshman year of college, he was exposed to the information for creation for the first time and soon after adopted it as his modus operandi. He says he felt a tremendous joy when he realized his science and his religion were no longer at odds. This joy (and, he says, Creation magazine and the Journal of Creation) enabled him to get through the in-depth evolutionary training of his undergraduate and graduate programs with his faith intact. He obtained a BS in Applied Biology from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1992. He then spent four years teaching high school biology, chemistry, physics and electronics before going to the University of Miami to obtain his PhD in Marine Biology. He successfully completed this program in 2003 with a dissertation on “Cnidarian Fluorescent Proteins.” While in Miami, he studied the genetics of pigmentation in corals and other invertebrates, designed and built an aquaculture facility for Caribbean corals, performed well over 500 SCUBA dives, many of them at night, and licensed a spin-off product of his research (a patented fluorescent protein) to a biotech company. He is currently a senior scientist and speaker for CMI-USA in Atlanta, Georgia, where he lives with his wife, Leanne, and children and is currently researching human genetics and other issues related to biblical creation.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/creation/'>Creation</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/creation.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/creation.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/dinosaurs/'>Dinosaurs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dinosaurs.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/dinosaurs.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/bible/'>Bible</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bible.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bible.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/evolution/'>Evolution</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/evolution.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/evolution.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/god/'>God</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/god.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/god.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Dr. Carter was converted to Christ at an early age, but did not know what to do with the theory of evolution.

(hons) in Chemistry and his Ph.D. (Physical Chemistry) from Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. He has co-authored papers in mainstream scientific journals including one on high-temperature superconductors published in Nature when he was 22 years old. He has long been interested in apologetics, and was a co-founder of the Wellington Christian Apologetics Society (New Zealand). His first book Refuting Evolution (1999, 2008) was written to counter a teachers guidebook by the National Academy of Sciences (USA), Teaching about Evolution and the Nature of Science. It now has over 400,000 copies in print. He later wrote Refuting Evolution 2 (2002, 2010) and the highly acclaimed Refuting Compromise (2004, 2010), both as responses to attacks on the biblical view of history, plus the booklet Mammoth: Riddle of the Ice Age. Jonathan is co-author of the updated Creation Answers Book, 15 Reasons to Take Genesis as History (2006) and the booklet Why is there Death and Suffering? (2001).

	ANCIENT MYTHS REFLECT SOME BIBLICAL TRUTHS</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	[A short look at King Wells Jr.s&rsquo; new book, <strong><em>ANCIENT MYTHS AND THE BIBLE</em></strong>, as noted by Byron LeBeau; the subtitle: Understanding the Bible and the Endtimes from a Mythological World View.]</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	King Wells Jr. is a software engineer out of Dallas, Texas; he is also a scriptural student who has come to the conclusion that the Fallen Angels &amp; demons are our true enemy and are the ones perpetrating the fa&ccedil;ade of the UFO phenomenon&hellip;similar to the views of yours truly, Richard Stout (<strong>THE <em>CURS-</em>ED NET,)</strong> as well as Chuck Missler &amp; Mark Eastmann (<strong>ALIEN ENCOUNTERS,)</strong> G.H. Pember (<strong>EARTH&rsquo;S EARLIEST AGES) &amp;</strong> I.D.E. Thomas (<strong>THE OMEGA CONSPIRACY.)</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	What King focuses in on in this short text is just how our early myths <strong><em>pop-up</em></strong> and how some are closely similar to the tales told in The Holy Bible. <strong><em>Which came first---as in the chicken or the egg&hellip;???</em></strong> We know that God made the chicken so <strong><em><u>all things stem from this &ndash; and not the other way round!!!</u></em></strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The author illustrates this theme in sundry ways, and I will just mention a few of these things so the potential reader of this book can get a flavor for what is being presented:</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The author does a good job in demolishing the so-called &lsquo;Sons of Seth&rsquo; thesis (as it relates to THE GIANTS of Genesis 6:4 (16-17,) which was also reviewed by all of the authors mentioned above.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	THE GREAT FLOOD was echoed in many cultures&hellip;but it is a remembrance of the original flood as stated in Genesis (23) [and similar to the &ldquo;chicken &amp; egg&rsquo; problem as stated above.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	A good analysis of Satan&rsquo;s names in other cultures are connected,, as in &lsquo;Apollo,&rsquo; &lsquo;Apollyon,&rsquo; &lsquo;Abaddon,&rsquo; &lsquo;Osiris,&rsquo; etc. (34-35.)</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	There is an interested &lsquo;take&rsquo; at both the <strong><em>Leviathan &amp; Behemoth</em></strong> (as mentioned in JOB 40 &amp; 41) but how they each take on the persona of the Antichrist &amp; the False Prophet of <strong><em>The Book of Revelation</em></strong> as well as how another culture (China) incorporates the dragon motif into its astronomy (42-48.) [These are &ldquo;invincible&rdquo; beasts and can only be dealt with by God Himself &ndash; {{a theme that we bring out in our book as well as my website, <a href="http://www.inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/">www.Inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com</a>&nbsp; }} The Chinese have five different types of dragons, and the author brings out some key ideas about <strong><em>THE RED DRAGON</em></strong> that ties in with</p>
<p>
	The Holy Scripture of our Bible.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	There is an interesting parallel between the ancient myth of &lsquo;Hercules&rsquo; with the scriptural Samson (especially as it relates to a lion) which according to King, <strong><em>is a foreshadowing of Jesus</em></strong> (62-63.0</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The author discusses the subject of magic and how it is all <em>not in keeping with what God wants us involved in</em> regardless of how you look at it (65-66.)</p>
<p>
	The &ldquo;STRONG DELUSION&rdquo; that St. Paul speaks to in 2 THESS. 2:9 will involve, according to this author, Satan&rsquo;s use of UFOs, and he references movies like <strong><em>Independence Day, StarGate &amp; SIGNS (Mel Gibson)</em></strong> to back-up his point (86-89) while he dramatizes parts of the book of <strong><em>Revelation</em></strong> to relate the two-level battle of Satan with Jesus. As King puts it, &ldquo;<strong><em>The gods of the pagans will fight the Most High God when he returns but shall be utterly defeated.&nbsp; This battle will be witnessed by the entire world.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	There is a chapter on &ldquo;ASTROLOGY&rdquo; and a little history as to how it separated itself from &lsquo;astronomy&rsquo; with a short discussion on <strong><em>the Zodiac.&nbsp;</em></strong> He cites sources to indicate that the various signs of the Zodiac are probably pagan corruptions of a biblical truth (92-113.)</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This is an engaging book and worth reading!</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	[Side note: On page 94, King references &ldquo;a woman clothed with the sun and moon under her feet&rdquo; as most likely &ldquo;VIRGO&rdquo; in the Zodiac; another possible interpretation was cogently presented by Brother Peter Dimond in his pamphlet, <strong><em>THE BIBLE PROVES THE TEACHINGS OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH,</em></strong> and a free copy of this pamphlet can be gotten by going to the web page, &ldquo;BIBLICAL REALITY CHECK&rdquo; located at <a href="http://inspectorblebeau.pbworks.com/BIBLICAL-REALITY-CHECK">http://inspectorblebeau.pbworks.com/BIBLICAL-REALITY-CHECK</a></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	[If you decide to go through this exercise, Brother Peter shows how this woman is none other than the <strong><em>Blessed Virgin Mary,</em></strong> with scriptural back-up on page 14 of same which reflects evidence that the end of chapter of 11 &amp; the beginning of chapter 12 of <strong><em>Revelation are</em> <u>one continuous idea!</u></strong>]</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<div>
	<p>
		King makes it clear in his conclusion that what God and the prophets have told us is the determining factor, and that factor <strong><em><u>is not based on any Babylonian mythos!</u></em></strong> &nbsp;The pagan myths have tried to subvert the biblical meaning. In the author&rsquo;s parting words, &ldquo;<strong><em>Let God be true and every man a liar.</em></strong></p>

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em>While reading some information about exorcism techniques from Pastor Chris Ward, I made the following 2 +2 analogy:</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The below citation comes from Pastor Chris Ward while discussing the do&#39;s the dont&#39;s of exorcism::::if this goes for exorcism, then everything that has been told a hypnotist by an abductee could be nothing but lies enfolded within lies--SO WHY BELIEVE ANYTHING THEY SAY? {{A POSSIBLE TRUTH: If the paranormal is demonic <b>ipso facto</b>---then abductees are mouthing demonic information--making everything out of their mouths nothing but lies also......}}</p>
<p>
	Never use hypnotism-technics. Never use the hypnotic technique of calling up the Gatekeeper and asking the client to step aside or go down. This is pure hypnosis and New Age. When did Jesus ever do this? How do you know that you are not enabling or even empowering the evil spirit? Speak directly to the client. Ask them if they can hear the evil spirits. If they can then ask them to interpret. Never ask them to step aside for the evil spirit to step up to bat. Tell the client to not let them speak through them but to them. This always works. It is often the best way to demonstrate to the client that they do have some authority and to establish client authority. It can be the key to setting them free and empowering the client once they recognize the spirits are subject to authority.</p>

<p>
	<em>While reading some information about exorcism techniques from Pastor Chris Ward, I made the following 2 +2 analogy:</em></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The below citation comes from Pastor Chris Ward while discussing the do&#39;s the dont&#39;s of exorcism::::if this goes for exorcism, then everything that has been told a hypnotist by an abductee could be nothing but lies enfolded within lies--SO WHY BELIEVE ANYTHING THEY SAY? {{A POSSIBLE TRUTH: If the paranormal is demonic <b>ipso facto</b>---then abductees are mouthing demonic information--making everything out of their mouths nothing but lies also......}}</p>
<p>
	Never use hypnotism-technics. Never use the hypnotic technique of calling up the Gatekeeper and asking the client to step aside or go down. This is pure hypnosis and New Age. When did Jesus ever do this? How do you know that you are not enabling or even empowering the evil spirit? Speak directly to the client. Ask them if they can hear the evil spirits. If they can then ask them to interpret. Never ask them to step aside for the evil spirit to step up to bat. Tell the client to not let them speak through them but to them. This always works. It is often the best way to demonstrate to the client that they do have some authority and to establish client authority. It can be the key to setting them free and empowering the client once they recognize the spirits are subject to authority.</p>

When the warfare turns Supernatural, I am a person that is no longer a pushover for the Kingdom of darkness(aliens /demons), Instead of being threatened by the enemy (aliens/demons),In JESUS I become a threat to the enemy. One of the things things I have learned along the way is, if you have the attention of the enemy (aliens/demons), you also have the attention of God. And if GOD is with you who can be aginst you? (Romans 8:31) A Battle always precedes a breakthrough! Whats in a name that the aliens/demons flee? Whats in a name that the captives GO Free!? Whats in a name that every knee shall bow?

	<br />
	As I sit here writing this blog, I am thinking I have so much to be thankful for.&nbsp; I am thrilled to have been a part of something so big in these past 5 years, and yet it seems so small in the eyes of the average person, or the unbeliever.&nbsp; I am thankful for the many blessings the LORD has put into my lap, and not just within this ministry, but life in general.&nbsp; Of course, taking on the position of spreading the message of Jesus Christ comes with a price, and much prayer and spiritual warfare must be taken into account.<br />
	<br />
	&nbsp;<em>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. -Ephesians 6:10-12</em><br />
	<br />
	I have certainly been through a lot, but I am not about to delve into the lows at this time because this blog is not about that.&nbsp; I want to focus on how grateful I am as producer of CURS-ED NET BREAKTHROUGH RADIO (CNBR), for all of the many guests we have had on this year.&nbsp; Some of them were returning guests,&nbsp;and some being new to the show.&nbsp; Either way, they have all brought something fresh; enlightening and uplifting to the table.&nbsp; We have had return guests, Dr. Joye Pugh, Joe Jordan, L.A. Marzulli, Chuck Missler, and Pastor Chris Ward, all come back with powerful messages and knowledge.&nbsp; Our new guests; Andrew Hoffman, Minister Dante Fortson, Paul Christopher, Tom (from Future Quake) Bionic, and Destiny Lab have made a mark in this ministry and have carried it to greater heights for God.&nbsp; I thank the LORD for all of you and your willingness to come on as guests, helping this small podcast reach over 120,000+ listeners for Christ.<br />
	<br />
	I would also like to thank Sheila Broughton, who I had the pleasure of co-hosting a show with this year titled, PARANORMAL: SIMPLY ENTERTAINMENT OR MUCH MORE?&nbsp; This was a podcast that had an in-depth look at how youth in particular can be sucked into believing the lies from Satan and what to watch out for.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	And I&nbsp;cannot dismiss the awesome testimonies that Joe Jordan has brought on the CURS-ED NET <em>cyber</em> waves&nbsp;this year, topping it off with a powerful and emotional testimony of Joyce Ahrens and her son Dan.&nbsp; To all of&nbsp;you who have been courageous enough and strong enough to come out with these explosive testimonies, (yes, including you, Alice M.) you ROCK!!!<br />
	<br />
	Some of you may have&nbsp;listened to &quot;Into the Archives&quot; series, which were a three part series delving into prophecy, UFOs and the Antichrist.&nbsp; These were files that were recorded in October of 2005 when I was introduced to co-author of the CURS-ED NET, Richard Stout.&nbsp; What&#39;s incredible is, the views he held back then still apply today, and since then he has received further confirmation through visions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich is a very close friend of mine and&nbsp;is someone I consider as a spiritual mentor, and brother in Christ.&nbsp; I am thrilled to have been able to add these important&nbsp;audio files, and I highly suggest everyone have a listen to all three parts.&nbsp; So, another big thank you to my friend and brother for the permission to use these files.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	And last but not least, I must say that the host of CNBR is truly living up to his nickname, the Bulldog.&nbsp; Through a year&nbsp;of uncertainty with health issues, battling cancer, losing his mother and helping run this podcast, Byron LeBeau has had his <em><span style="text-decoration: underline">JOB</span></em> moment! Through this, he has come out a stronger, more passionate man for the Lord Jesus than I have ever witnessed so far.&nbsp; Byron, you have truly inspired me, to continue on this path no matter how rough it gets.&nbsp; Thank you for your patience, dedication and enthusiasm that you have brought forward, making this podcast what it is today.<br />
	<br />
	<strong><span>1 Corinthians 15:58</span></strong><br />
	Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Philippians 2:16</strong><br />
	as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.<br />
	<br />
	And of course...to the listening audience.&nbsp; Thank you for your emails, chat sessions, and continued downloads of CURS-ED NET BREAKTHROUGH RADIO.&nbsp; And once again,&nbsp;the God of&nbsp;Israel, in all three personalities (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) for the blessings you&#39;ve bestowed upon me and the opportunity to produce this show for the past 2 1/2 years.<br />
	<br />
	We have had an interesting year so far, with a continued recession, a major oil spill in the Gulf, and natural disasters setting records.&nbsp; I believe 2011 will be even more interesting, bringing prophecy into fulfillment and a revival among&nbsp;true believers.&nbsp; This revival will ignite a flame in people&#39;s hearts across the world and help people understand, in a nutshell,&nbsp;the very message we are trying to convey on this very podcast.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Romans 10:12</strong><br />
	For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile&mdash;the same <strong>Lord</strong> is <strong>Lord</strong> of <strong>all</strong> and richly blesses <strong>all</strong> <strong>who</strong> <strong>call</strong> on him,<br />
	<br />
	Oh, and another thing!&nbsp; I finally got the chance to meet up with Joe Jordan (<em>right</em>), from CE-4 Research Group this year.&nbsp; And, NO, that&nbsp;is not a UFO hovering above our heads in the picture.&nbsp; :)<img alt="Joe Jordan &amp; Greg Messina, Orlando, FL. 2010" src="http://www.thecurs-ednet.net/images/joe-greg-fl.jpg" style="width: 395px" title="Joe Jordan &amp; Greg Messina, Orlando, FL. 2010" /><br />

The star seemed to be drawing me in. I followed it along the road but found it headed in the wrong direction...I thought "I must be crazy" so I went back home. The next evening the star seemed to be twinkling at me again, and this time I figured if I took another direction I could follow it; so I did. I did not know at this time that the Septuagint translates what we would call "Lucifer" as Hesperus, which is the evening star. I did not know that Hesperus was called the son of the dawn (Isaiah 14:12) and the wandering star (Jude 13). After that night I simply knew I was going to heaven when I died. I did not want to be on earth, nor did I want to be in this body. ...I felt a sense of purpose, but I didn't want to have a purpose because that only meant spending more time on earth away from that light...<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/testimony/'>Testimony</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/testimony.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/testimony.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ingram-fry/'>Ingram Fry</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ingram-fry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ingram-fry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/lucifer/'>Lucifer</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/lucifer.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/lucifer.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/bible/'>Bible</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bible.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/bible.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ufo/'>UFO</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufo.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufo.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Please welcome Ingram Fry from New Zealand!The following is an excerpt from Ingram's testimony: One night I saw the evening star twinkling at me, I started to follow it.

Formed back in 2005 with Arkalogik on vocals (green glasses in picture) and Genetix handling the beats this unique duo has developed some of the most thought provoking hip hop you might have ever heard. They are passionate about making music with meaning and purpose and the songs they create force the listener to ask themselves life examining questions that demand answers. Their new double album "The Evolution Antidote" and "The Original Sin" digs into the Creation/Evolution debate, the Nephilim, UFOS and aliens, secret societies, the occult, the new world order, the new age movement and how all of these matters and more tie into Biblical prophecy and the end times deception. They specialize in exposing the lie of evolution and connecting the dots back to the garden of Eden and the original sin. They effectively use sound clips and quotes from both sides of the debate mixed with the hard hitting beats of Genetix to emphasize their points and add credence and clarity to their arguments. While many of the beats used by Genetix have that hard underground grimy sound they also have upbeat, and even comical songs. A variety of styles but all with the same clever approach. Destiny Lab has even been known to perform a song or two in monkey masks and lab coats to illustrate the absurdity of evolutionism. Each and every track is solid and leaves you curious to learn more about Destiny Lab and the subject matters they discuss and the connections to world history and the Bible. Recently picked up by War Records out of San Deigo these guys are sure to make some waves and cause some lively discussions in the industry.www.DestinyLab.com<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/destiny-lab/'>Destiny Lab</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/destiny-lab.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/destiny-lab.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ufos/'>UFOs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/evolution/'>Evolution</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/evolution.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/evolution.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/jesus-christ/'>Jesus Christ</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jesus-christ.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jesus-christ.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/christian-rap/'>Christian Rap</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/christian-rap.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/christian-rap.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Destiny Lab is an Oregon based Christian/Creationist rap group who are dedicated to; the exploration, discovery, understanding and the truth about the mysteries of man and nature.

research into the UFO phenomenon in 1972. Born and raised in northeast New Jersey , he periodically witnessed an assortment of unusual nocturnal lights. One particular instance was at the Wanaque Reservoir, a hotbed for UFO activity during 1966 and 1967, approximately 40 miles from his home. One week after observing a bright red and green spinning object above the water, he contacted the late J. Allen Hynek, founder of the Center for UFO Studies. They began exchanging pertinent information via letters. Since that time, Paul has continued his diligence in the field, and strives to keep abreast of every UFO related circumstance. This work is a reflection of his long-standing passion for the subject and 25 years of extensive research. Alien Intervention by Paul Christopher About this title: The mystifying connection between the Occult, the New Age movement, and the UFO phenomenon. From both a Christian and objective perspective, and through his unique approach, Paul Christopher reveals a complex and ingenious scheme that is rapidly unfolding as we plunge headfirst towards the climactic date of December 21st 2012. What distinguishes this expose from all the others is the careful, thorough and accurate in-depth treatment of the three primary movements. Does the Bible address this phenomenon? Do the Scriptures predict increased activity of this type as history comes closer to a precipice? Are there human co-conspirators who are facilitating the "plan"? Are the world systems that are being implemented pawns in the hands of so-called other-worldly beings? These and other relevant questions are given careful attention by Mr. Christopher.

My first name is correct but to protect other people's lives I cannot give my last name. I hope you will understand and perhaps you know too, the seriousness of the hour and the times we are in. "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." Ephesians 6:12 I hope my testimony will encourage you to find peace and freedom in Jesus Christ. You CAN be set free! ...One of my children had a UFO experience. That child "alienated" me, left their spouse and moved to New Mexico. I cannot say if this was the reason that child rejected me. There were many causes I believe going back to the messy divorce as well as some of my own behavior following that divorce.

She works in agricultural research at a major university and for 20 years, Kimberly has experienced the phenomenon of sleep paralysis. Until recently, she had ascribed it to the medical explanation of paralysis associated with REM sleep; but an experience in November 2009 changed her perspective. Kimberly met Joe Jordan and other respected researchers at the "Last Days Conference" in Nashville, TN in April of this year. Although she has been a born-again Christian since the age of nine, Kimberly's walk with the Lord didn't start maturing until late in the year 2000. On February 8, 2000, when she was nine months pregnant with her first child, the world as she knew it ended with the sudden death of her first husband. She began earnestly seeking the Lord and His truth, and is still in the process of learning. My eyes have been opened, especially over the past two years. I have realized that, by large, the Christian church is completely unaware of what is going on in the world and the average Christian has no idea what spiritual warfare is, let alone how to conduct it. Where does a person turn to who experiences direct spiritual attacks that are disguised as sleep paralysis, UFO abductions, New Age "revelations", etc.?

She works in agricultural research at a major university and for 20 years, Kimberly has experienced the phenomenon of sleep paralysis. Until recently, she had ascribed it to the medical explanation of paralysis associated with REM sleep; but an experience in November 2009 changed her perspective. Kimberly met Joe Jordan and other respected researchers at the "Last Days Conference" in Nashville, TN in April of this year. Although she has been a born-again Christian since the age of nine, Kimberly's walk with the Lord didn't start maturing until late in the year 2000. On February 8, 2000, when she was nine months pregnant with her first child, the world as she knew it ended with the sudden death of her first husband. She began earnestly seeking the Lord and His truth, and is still in the process of learning. My eyes have been opened, especially over the past two years. I have realized that, by large, the Christian church is completely unaware of what is going on in the world and the average Christian has no idea what spiritual warfare is, let alone how to conduct it. Where does a person turn to who experiences direct spiritual attacks that are disguised as sleep paralysis, UFO abductions, New Age "revelations", etc.? They turn to those who are eager to take them in, and it's not the church, it's false teachers preaching a "new" gospel.

I got divorced and started an acting career in Minneapolis. First, I was a gypsy at the Renaissance Festival, then I landed a role in Tony-N-Tina's wedding. It was a car accident that brought me back home again where my study of the occult began to deepen. I met some local witches, started celebrating new moons and pagan holidays with them. I read books by Drunvalo Melchizedek, Greg Braden, Doreen Virtue, Diane Stein and others. I dove deep into the "sacred geometry" and manifesting through my thoughts as these New Age gurus promote. It is magic, just like the book "The Secret" that is witch craft plain and simple. I got initiated into Shamanism by a Chile'an Grandmother....more magic by another name, is still the same. Then I connected with the energy healer crowd and took classes from some of them. I met Crystal and Indigo "children"....the ET's restablished contact and began to download into me their "light language". I was a Light Worker; healer and a mystic.

I got divorced and started an acting career in Minneapolis. First, I was a gypsy at the Renaissance Festival, then I landed a role in Tony-N-Tina's wedding. It was a car accident that brought me back home again where my study of the occult began to deepen. I met some local witches, started celebrating new moons and pagan holidays with them. I read books by Drunvalo Melchizedek, Greg Braden, Doreen Virtue, Diane Stein and others. I dove deep into the "sacred geometry" and manifesting through my thoughts as these New Age gurus promote. It is magic, just like the book "The Secret" that is witch craft plain and simple. I got initiated into Shamanism by a Chile'an Grandmother....more magic by another name, is still the same. Then I connected with the energy healer crowd and took classes from some of them. I met Crystal and Indigo "children"....the ET's restablished contact and began to download into me their "light language". I was a Light Worker; healer and a mystic. My psychic abilities increased as satan increased his hold on me. I heard L.A. Marzulli on Coast to Coast...I wrote him and he told me my only hope was to give my life to the Lord Jesus Christ. So, on December 27, 2009 that is what I did! One of my favorite scripture's says it pretty clearly; Rev 12:11 "And they overcame him by the blood of the lamb, and by the word of their testimony, and loved not their lives unto the death" -Dori Courtesy:www.CE4RESEARCH.com<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ufo/'>UFO</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufo.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufo.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/abduction/'>Abduction</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/abduction.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/abduction.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/testimony/'>Testimony</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/testimony.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/testimony.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ce-4-research/'>CE-4 Research</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ce-4-research.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ce-4-research.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/deliverance/'>Deliverance</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/deliverance.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/deliverance.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ ...I was abducted again, as I watched out my bedroom window, the largest space ship I had ever seen or could conceive of was floating silently away from our farm house.

Don't miss Franks testimony tonight. Frank Scavarda, 48 years old, is currently residing in the New Paltz area of upstate New York. Born and raised to Catholic parents in the Bronx, NY, . Frank has been serving our Lord Jesus Christ since March, 1995. His conversion experience was a radical, supernatural and life-changing event that caused Frank to never look back at his “old life”. Under the leadership of Bishop Gerald Kaufman, Frank’s love for the poor caused him to gravitate towards various evangelistic ministries and outreaches earning him his Urban Missionary Credentials which led him to serve in various ministries such as Door-to-Door home visits, Street Evangelism, Homeless and Hospital Ministries along with being a Altar Counselor with the Salvation message. Of the many evangelistic ministries he participated in, his love for feeding the poor and helping contribute to running a “love kitchen” was at the heart of his walk – serving the poor. In his work in the homeless kitchen, Frank personally cooked and served thousands of meals to the homeless. Frank has been an entrepreneur most of his adult life. He is currently finishing a ministry booklet called “The Truth About Babies”. This booklet’s theme is geared towards exposing the history of abortion, the Eugenics movement and Planned Parenthood’s evil agenda. Frank is currently married to his wife Lisa for 12-years and has 2 children, Jovani, 20 yrs old and a “late in life: surprise daughter Savannah, 3 years old.

Don't miss Franks testimony tonight. Frank Scavarda, 48 years old, is currently residing in the New Paltz area of upstate New York. Born and raised to Catholic parents in the Bronx, NY, . Frank has been serving our Lord Jesus Christ since March, 1995. His conversion experience was a radical, supernatural and life-changing event that caused Frank to never look back at his “old life”. Under the leadership of Bishop Gerald Kaufman, Frank’s love for the poor caused him to gravitate towards various evangelistic ministries and outreaches earning him his Urban Missionary Credentials which led him to serve in various ministries such as Door-to-Door home visits, Street Evangelism, Homeless and Hospital Ministries along with being a Altar Counselor with the Salvation message. Of the many evangelistic ministries he participated in, his love for feeding the poor and helping contribute to running a “love kitchen” was at the heart of his walk – serving the poor. In his work in the homeless kitchen, Frank personally cooked and served thousands of meals to the homeless. Frank has been an entrepreneur most of his adult life. He is currently finishing a ministry booklet called “The Truth About Babies”. This booklet’s theme is geared towards exposing the history of abortion, the Eugenics movement and Planned Parenthood’s evil agenda. Frank is currently married to his wife Lisa for 12-years and has 2 children, Jovani, 20 yrs old and a “late in life: surprise daughter Savannah, 3 years old.

<P>by Richard Stout

<P>{{Edited with commentary by Byron <A id=p-9bab2c49169814c77c194c896979a43fe719c13c class=WikiLink href="http://inspectorblebeau.pbworks.com/LeBeau"><SPAN style="COLOR: #114488">LeBeau</SPAN></A>. This will be an attempt by Richard to have an eclectic running description via scripture of the events that may happen in the near future by citing all of the actual scriptural passages (that relate to same) in such a way so as to distinguish between two marked events regarding those who <EM>have chosen</EM> or <EM>will choose</EM> Jesus Christ, regardless of the consequences-even unto death! The clues are gathered from the inspired writers in such a way so the meanings become clear. Furthermore, it is one thing to <EM>say you are saved,</EM> but quite another to actually be saved. Part of this treatise is meant to reflect on this difference <B>so that one does not labor under a false sense of security.</B> Suffering is part of <EM>enduring unto the end,</EM> and according to the scripture as being presented, there are <EM>different levels</EM> of suffering depending upon your relationship with Jesus Christ. Only Jesus knows which camp you belong to, and if you qualify, you will not suffer anymore than is necessary for your own salvation <B>as per the words of Jesus Himself.</B>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>INTRODUCTION: <EM>HERE TODAY – GONE TOMORROW</EM>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This treatise is an attempt to show through God’s word that there are two escapes (exoduses) which will take place, one just before the beginning of the seven year peace treaty spoken of in Daniel 9:27, or within the first three and one-half years just prior to the Antichrist’s reign (called the ‘hour of trial’ as per Revelation 3.) The other Exodus escape will happen just before the <EM>Son of Man</EM> (Christ) will make His appearance – (called THE SECOND COMING) and <B>His angels</B> will gather the elect (Mark 13: 26-27.) Study this scripture carefully while I go through a short history of the <B>trumpet,</B> its uses and symbolism in the Bible. </P>
<P>Before we start with the <EM>first</EM> EXODUS, I would like to begin with 2PETER 1:20-21, as referenced in the NIV Bible. No prophecy of scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation (v.21,) for prophecy had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<DIV class=breakout>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</DIV>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The next scriptural citation is taken from 2TIM. 3:16-17, where all scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. Next is ACTS 17:11, that begins, “For they received the message with great eagerness and examined the scriptures every day to see what Paul said was true.” Let’s now consider several <B>KEYS WORDS</B> to see exactly what this means. {{Richard uses <B>KEY WORDS</B> here exactly how he did in our co-authored book, “THE <EM>CURS</EM>-ED NET,” in order to arrive at the more EXACTING meaning of the words being portrayed, in this case, using “VINE’S COMPLETE EXPOSITORY DICTIONARY."}}
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<DIV class=breakout>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</DIV>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>‘Examine’ in Greek = (anakrino) meaning “to investigate” – “of searching or engraving.” The word ‘search’ in Greek (eraunao or ereunao) is “to search, examine-of the Holy Spirit, as searching all things, acting in the spirit of the believer; to search out.”
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<DIV class=breakout>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</DIV>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The word ‘search’ in general is “to explore-scrutinize; to examine in order to find something lost or concealed.” The word ‘concealed’ means “something hidden (as in hidden information within) &amp; examine-to study-analyze.” ‘Analyze’ is “to separate into parts”&amp; ‘analysis’ means” basic principles so as to determine the nature of the whole.” (In short, it is what is being said, or the meaning behind the verse or verses as a whole.) This is why we use <B>KEY WORD ANALYSIS</B> in the Greek, Hebrew &amp; English dictionaries, etc.
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<DIV class=breakout>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</DIV>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>{{All the meanings to follow are from either VINE’S, THE AMERICAN HERITAGE COLLEGE DICTIONARY, or NELSON’S BIBLE DICTIONARY.}} </P>

<P>{{Edited with commentary by Byron <A id=p-9bab2c49169814c77c194c896979a43fe719c13c class=WikiLink href="http://inspectorblebeau.pbworks.com/LeBeau"><SPAN style="COLOR: #114488">LeBeau</SPAN></A>. This will be an attempt by Richard to have an eclectic running description via scripture of the events that may happen in the near future by citing all of the actual scriptural passages (that relate to same) in such a way so as to distinguish between two marked events regarding those who <EM>have chosen</EM> or <EM>will choose</EM> Jesus Christ, regardless of the consequences-even unto death! The clues are gathered from the inspired writers in such a way so the meanings become clear. Furthermore, it is one thing to <EM>say you are saved,</EM> but quite another to actually be saved. Part of this treatise is meant to reflect on this difference <B>so that one does not labor under a false sense of security.</B> Suffering is part of <EM>enduring unto the end,</EM> and according to the scripture as being presented, there are <EM>different levels</EM> of suffering depending upon your relationship with Jesus Christ. Only Jesus knows which camp you belong to, and if you qualify, you will not suffer anymore than is necessary for your own salvation <B>as per the words of Jesus Himself.</B>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>INTRODUCTION: <EM>HERE TODAY – GONE TOMORROW</EM>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This treatise is an attempt to show through God’s word that there are two escapes (exoduses) which will take place, one just before the beginning of the seven year peace treaty spoken of in Daniel 9:27, or within the first three and one-half years just prior to the Antichrist’s reign (called the ‘hour of trial’ as per Revelation 3.) The other Exodus escape will happen just before the <EM>Son of Man</EM> (Christ) will make His appearance – (called THE SECOND COMING) and <B>His angels</B> will gather the elect (Mark 13: 26-27.) Study this scripture carefully while I go through a short history of the <B>trumpet,</B> its uses and symbolism in the Bible. </P>
<P>Before we start with the <EM>first</EM> EXODUS, I would like to begin with 2PETER 1:20-21, as referenced in the NIV Bible. No prophecy of scripture came about by the prophet’s own interpretation (v.21,) for prophecy had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<DIV class=breakout>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</DIV>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The next scriptural citation is taken from 2TIM. 3:16-17, where all scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. Next is ACTS 17:11, that begins, “For they received the message with great eagerness and examined the scriptures every day to see what Paul said was true.” Let’s now consider several <B>KEYS WORDS</B> to see exactly what this means. {{Richard uses <B>KEY WORDS</B> here exactly how he did in our co-authored book, “THE <EM>CURS</EM>-ED NET,” in order to arrive at the more EXACTING meaning of the words being portrayed, in this case, using “VINE’S COMPLETE EXPOSITORY DICTIONARY."}}
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<DIV class=breakout>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</DIV>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>‘Examine’ in Greek = (anakrino) meaning “to investigate” – “of searching or engraving.” The word ‘search’ in Greek (eraunao or ereunao) is “to search, examine-of the Holy Spirit, as searching all things, acting in the spirit of the believer; to search out.”
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<DIV class=breakout>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</DIV>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The word ‘search’ in general is “to explore-scrutinize; to examine in order to find something lost or concealed.” The word ‘concealed’ means “something hidden (as in hidden information within) &amp; examine-to study-analyze.” ‘Analyze’ is “to separate into parts”&amp; ‘analysis’ means” basic principles so as to determine the nature of the whole.” (In short, it is what is being said, or the meaning behind the verse or verses as a whole.) This is why we use <B>KEY WORD ANALYSIS</B> in the Greek, Hebrew &amp; English dictionaries, etc.
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>
<DIV class=breakout>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</DIV>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>{{All the meanings to follow are from either VINE’S, THE AMERICAN HERITAGE COLLEGE DICTIONARY, or NELSON’S BIBLE DICTIONARY.}} </P>

Michael Bennett, PhD - Sep 28,2009</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/cursednet/2009/09/28/j-michael-bennett-phd</link><description><![CDATA[ J. Michael Bennett, PhD, has spent a career in the sciences, serving as a leader in a governmental aerospace laboratory, as well as operating his own successful technology development enterprise. He received his Ph.D in engineering in 2003, after ending a 10 year education hiatus while working. He served as a leader in a military lab for sixteen years, developing protection technologies and other weird science contraptions. Since 2003, he has operated his own company, which combined technology development and consulting for military, governmental and commercial organizations, with his own in-house development of novel protection technologies. These technologies, invented and patented by Dr. Future, have been a major success in the marketplace, currently protecting police cars, race cars and military vehicles, and soon to include commerical buildings. He currently hosts the weekly radio show “Future Quake”, under the radio moniker of “Doctor Future”. This show can be heard daily at 4PM Central Time on WENO AM 760 in Nashville, TN. In 2008, Bennett was invited to speak at a United Nations and World Council of Churches-sponsored international conference in Montreal, Canada, with the conference theme of "Reconnecting Heaven and Earth, in Spirit, Space and the Human Psyche". This group has also created a new, ecumenical religious order called "The Order of the Transfiguration", an "ecumenical order with links to the United Nations and the World Council of Churches", which studies "apparitions, post-mortem contacts with dead saints, invocations of saints and angels", amongst other things, which "is dedicated as a 'mid-wife' of a New Humanity in a New World Order".<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/j-michael-bennett/'>J Michael Bennett</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/j-michael-bennett.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/j-michael-bennett.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/future-quake/'>Future Quake</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/future-quake.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/future-quake.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ufos/'>UFOs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/jesus/'>Jesus</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jesus.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jesus.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/aliens/'>Aliens</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/aliens.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/aliens.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ J.

This group has also created a new, ecumenical religious order called "The Order of the Transfiguration", an "ecumenical order with links to the United Nations and the World Council of Churches", which studies "apparitions, post-mortem contacts with dead saints, invocations of saints and angels", amongst other things, which "is dedicated as a 'mid-wife' of a New Humanity in a New World Order".<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/j-michael-bennett/'>J Michael Bennett</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/j-michael-bennett.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/j-michael-bennett.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/future-quake/'>Future Quake</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/future-quake.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/future-quake.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ufos/'>UFOs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/jesus/'>Jesus</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jesus.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jesus.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/aliens/'>Aliens</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/aliens.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/aliens.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></content:encoded><category domain="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">Spirituality</category><comments>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/cursednet/2009/09/28/j-michael-bennett-phd/#comments</comments><enclosure url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/cursednet/2009/09/28/j-michael-bennett-phd.mp3" length="24904378" type="audio/mpeg" /><guid>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/cursednet/2009/09/28/j-michael-bennett-phd</guid><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2009 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><itunes:summary> J. Michael Bennett, PhD, has spent a career in the sciences, serving as a leader in a governmental aerospace laboratory, as well as operating his own successful technology development enterprise. He received his Ph.D in engineering in 2003, after ending a 10 year education hiatus while working. He served as a leader in a military lab for sixteen years, developing protection technologies and other weird science contraptions. Since 2003, he has operated his own company, which combined technology development and consulting for military, governmental and commercial organizations, with his own in-house development of novel protection technologies. These technologies, invented and patented by Dr. Future, have been a major success in the marketplace, currently protecting police cars, race cars and military vehicles, and soon to include commerical buildings.

Two, including the one just mentioned, I would rank as the absolute most terrifying experiences of my life and the most memorable – so memorable, in fact, that I have remembered nearly every detail for 30 years. The first, and as far as I know, more minor experiences I had were similar in that I recall hearing a loud buzzing sound and then being unable to move my entire body. In both instances I was on a bed and lying down alone. I know I was less than 12 years old and I don’t remember any other details beyond that. ...I lived for nearly 30 wondering what had happened and why it had happened to me. Then I started hearing and reading about people who had experienced “abduction” type events and many of these experiences sounded much like what had happened to me. So, I started researching to try and figure it all out. Since I was a Christian and could not dismiss the fact that I had been freed from these experiences in the name of Jesus Christ, I was cautious about the whole aliens from another world theory. I didn’t dismiss it though and was searching the Bible along with keeping up with what was happening in the UFO community. I was quickly being seduced by lying spirits – so much so that UFO related television, books, and news articles were all I really wanted to pay attention to. By the grace of God, however, I have been able to see that this entire scheme is a satanic plot. -Caleb<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/joe-jordan/'>Joe Jordan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/joe-jordan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/joe-jordan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ce-4-research/'>CE-4 Research</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ce-4-research.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ce-4-research.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-fourth-kind/'>The Fourth Kind</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-fourth-kind.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-fourth-kind.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/jesus/'>Jesus</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jesus.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jesus.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/abductions/'>Abductions</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/abductions.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/abductions.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Experience Testimony of “Caleb” from Texas: I have had at least 4 (and maybe more) experiences with one that would fit a classic “alien abduction” scenario.

I was completely paralyzed and overcome with terror and immediately sensed these beings were evil. It was very dark in the room but I could see that they were wearing hooded robes, gold necklaces, and had reptilian skin and large black eyes. They looked almost exactly like Sleestaks from the old TV show, Land of the Lost. They floated around to the side of the bed. I sensed that the one in the middle was their leader. The leader reached down and grabbed my arms with his hands on my biceps and lifted me out of bed. I felt almost completely weightless like a helium balloon. When I was in a standing position, but not touching the floor, his mouth opened wide and he breathed a furnace-hot blast of sulfur-smelling air in my face. Then we began to rotate and sink headfirst in the floor. I thought they were taking me to hell and I said, "I rebuke you in the name of Jesus", and instantly I was back in my bed, my heart was pounding out of my chest and I was soaked with sweat. For a long time it didn't cross my mind that I had experienced a classic "alien" abduction until I saw some other people's stories that mirrored mine. It was, I think, 1997 when I had an encounter. I don’t know why me, and why then. Years after the encounter, I was surfing around on the internet and found the Alien Resistance website and posted my story on the CE4 Research Group website. I don’t remember hearing anything about the “alien”/evil entity connection before then. I currently read(listen to CD) the Bible almost every day and research on the internet as much as possible to do what I can to resist the deception and confusion these entities are bringing to people. -Jason Courtesy:www.CE4RESEARCH.com<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/joe-jordan/'>Joe Jordan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/joe-jordan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/joe-jordan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ce-4-research-group/'>CE-4 Research Group</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ce-4-research-group.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ce-4-research-group.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-fourth-kind/'>The Fourth Kind</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-fourth-kind.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-fourth-kind.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ufo/'>UFO</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufo.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufo.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/spiritual-warfare/'>Spiritual Warfare</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spiritual-warfare.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/spiritual-warfare.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's my story: I was asleep in my basement bedroom when I woke up suddenly and noticed 3 beings standing at the foot of the bed.

I felt there was a piece of my childhood that was missing. Over the past 20+ years, Jesus had brought up memories of my childhood, one at a time, and I had dealt with it. But I knew that something was still missing. One day I received an email from a friend about aliens and deception. It triggered something deep within me from childhood. All of a sudden I remembered sitting in the window wishing that a spaceship would come and take me away...away from that abusive home. -Janet Courtesy: CE-4 Research Group <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/alien-resistance/'>Alien Resistance</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/alien-resistance.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/alien-resistance.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ce-4-research/'>CE-4 Research</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ce-4-research.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ce-4-research.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ufos/'>UFOs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/joe-jordan/'>Joe Jordan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/joe-jordan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/joe-jordan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/deliverance/'>Deliverance</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/deliverance.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/deliverance.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Janet will be sharing with us.

10,2009</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/cursednet/2009/08/10/joe-jordan-testimonies-segment-14</link><description><![CDATA[Kevin [from Utah] will be sharing with us tonight. A strangeness of UFOs, Entities, Sleep Paralysis, inexplicable illnesses, hearing anomalies, and vivid or lucid visions settled over my life with a consistency that left me confused, paranoid, and depressed. These accumulated over a whole life, but were now getting out of control and becoming dangerous. I had retreated from the world feeling “different,” useless, and dysfunctional, and though a Christian, absolutely alone. Under the circumstances, I saw no way to serve and constantly begged God to get me off the planet and take me home. He didn’t, and in January of ’09 as the global economy collapsed, I lost my job. I began reading everything from UFOs to CE4s to MILABS to Mind Control to figure out what had hold of me and found others also suffering. In July I drove to Roswell for the UFO Convention and the met Joe Jordan. Our talk was chilling, but transformative in that he represented a vanguard of Christians who were uncovering the author of this multi-faced phenomenon and defeating it with the name of Jesus. I told Joe I’d stopped the Sleep Paralysis by calling out to Jesus and he asked me if I would testify to that by standing on stage during his talk. Weighing in against stage fright and serving in this small way, I agreed. Hoping for the future that if I can serve at all, let it be where I am so profoundly equipped. -Kevin Courtesy:www.CE4RESEARCH.com<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/alien-resistance/'>Alien Resistance</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/alien-resistance.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/alien-resistance.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ce-4-research/'>CE-4 Research</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ce-4-research.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ce-4-research.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ufos/'>UFOs</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ufos.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/joe-jordan/'>Joe Jordan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/joe-jordan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/joe-jordan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/deliverance/'>Deliverance</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/deliverance.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/deliverance.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Kevin [from Utah] will be sharing with us tonight.

When he was 24 years old, he had a "Saul on the road to Damascus" type of epiphany while reading the Bible. Thus began his Christian walk. He became interested in bible prophecy concerning the "end times" about 1996. In 1997, his first book Apocalypse Soon was published and became a bestseller in Ireland. It entered the Irish bestsellers list after an interview with Gareth O'Callaghan, on RTE radio, who said he "read it in one sitting and was gripped." Another book The Apocalypse Generation was also a success. There has recently been amazing interest to-date in this new book The Nephilim and the Pyramid of the Apocalypse, published by Kensington Publishing, which Patrick believes is the FIRST EVER book proving overwhelmingly who built the pyramids and why. Patrick has a B.Sc. and M.A. in Business Studies from Trinity College, Dublin. He also holds a Degree in Theology and recently received an Honorary Doctorate in Christian Literature from the California Pacific School of Theology, Glendale, California, as a result of the research done in his book, The Nephilim and the Pyramid of the Apocalypse (Kensington Publishing). Dr. Heron is the Executive Producer of a TV special entitled Apocalypse and the End Times which is a Grizzly Adams production. This has been shown all over the United States and is currently available on DVD in stores nationwide. Patrick owns and runs his own company in Dublin, Ireland, where he lives with his family. He is not associated with any particular church or denomination. If you would like to do an interview or a "lifestyle piece", please click on Contact Us, above.

Another explosive testimony folks, you won't want to miss this one. People want evidence, they got it...right here on Curs-ed Net Breakthrough Radio with Byron LeBeau & Joe Jordan. ...I'd learned everything I knew about UFOs from watching Spielberg movies. I stepped out of the car minutes later feeling pretty lucky to have seen one, and looking up for the slightest possibility of seeing one again. Sure enough, the lights were visible though the leafless branches of the trees, approaching slowly and silently. I shared the news, and my mother and sister were just as ecstatic as I was. My mother flashed "SOS" in Morse code to see what the craft would do. My brothers Eric and Neal stayed in the car because (as I'd say in hindsight) they were smarter. ...The thing told Beth not to describe its appearance any further until I “got to know them better.” Unlike me at that time, Jodi had only vaguely remembered hearing something in the media about the beings associated with UFO’s and abductions.

From the memories that I have I can say that I was brought up with UFOs being a topic in my home. My dad was a UFO fanatic and he went to great lengths to get magazines each month and any other documentation that could prove the existence of UFOs.

In recent years Malone has organized several successful conferences (Ancient of Days & Roswell UFO Conference) which affirm the more credible aspects of secular UFO and abduction research, and investigates such reports from an evangelical perspective. Malone believes that the occult teachings and doctrines of modern (alleged) aliens, as well as intentional disinformation, is best countered with sound, verifiable research, coupled with sound Biblical doctrine. While affirming that UFOs are real (see his UFOs 101 lecture), and the fact that many people today are experiencing contacts with non-human intelligences, Malone feels the "extra-terrestrial hypothesis" (aliens) is the least provable and least likely explanation for the phenomena (and therefore an "article of faith" for it's adherents - i.e., a religious viewpoint). His research has led him to instead favor a man-made view of suppressed technology as the probable explanation behind most UFO reports, and the Genesis 6 paradigm, which teaches that people are being brought into communication with deceiving angels intent on promoting an anti-christ worldview of global government (aka "The New World Order"). In short, he feels people are dealing with fallen angels and global conspiracies, not true aliens from other planets.

And I realized I might soon have to deal with another abduction experience, even though i knew what it was... so I got on the AR and then CE4 website right then and read the guide to self-deliverance on there, and verbally rebuked outloud in the name and authority of Jesus Christ.</itunes:summary><itunes:duration>01:00:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/cursednet/2009/01/27/joe-jordan-testimonies-segment-3.mp3" fileSize="14509790" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/cursednet/2009/01/27/joe-jordan-testimonies-segment-3.wma" fileSize="14509790" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>Cursed Net Radio</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>Aliens,Abductions,Testimony,Joe Jordan,Paranormal,BlogTalkRadio, Blog Talk Radio</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Joe Jordan Testimonies-Segment 3 (Nicole M.)</itunes:subtitle></item><item><title>Joe Jordan Testimonies-Segment 2 (Cathy Land) - Jan 06,2009</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/cursednet/2009/01/06/joe-jordan-testimonies-segment-2</link><description><![CDATA[There are people who are willing to share their private and emotional past with us.

Marzulli on UFO Deception - Nov 12,2008</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/cursednet/2008/11/12/la-marzulli-on-ufo-deception</link><description><![CDATA[L.A. Marzulli, author, composer and researcher had no use for God after the age of 13, when he stopped attending the Catholic church of his parents. When he was 18, his 16-year-old girlfriend was killed in an accident. Deeply affected by this, he felt there was no God whatsoever. To ease the pain, he sought relief from many sources including drugs. By the age of 21, Marzulli moved into an ashram. Though he’d left the church, he found himself drawn to other spiritual expressions, especially the New Age movement. His fascination with unusual phenomena drew him deeper and deeper into the supernatural and occultist world. By age 30, however, he realized something crucial: that none of his experiences did a thing to change what was on the inside. ...He now believes in God and sees the current fascination with UFOs and other unusual phenomena as tools that the enemy is using to deceive people. It bothered him that Satan was deceiving so many, just as he’d been deceived. He wanted to warn others as to what was really happening, and equip other believers to share their faith with those who were caught up in supernatural phenomena.

<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Bible Gateway Clues Using the Supporting Evidence Found in 1 Enoch 18 &amp; 19</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>by Richard Stout</strong></p>
<p>{{Richard may have found the clues to why the Fallen Angels have been linked to the seven star system – the Pleiades, and also how the Pleiades are continually being linked to THE NEW AGE literature through Ufology and the alleged contactees who – in many instances – get their “information” from those who <em>hail from the Pleiades.</em>’ As Richard uses key word analysis in critical verses within chapters 18 &amp; 19 of Enoch, I will also give suggestive evidence to support this contention. Byron <span style="color: #000000">LeBeau</span>}}</p>
<p>I ENOCH 18:14: <em>And I beheld seven stars like blazing mountains and like spirits entertaining me.</em></p>
<p>‘Stars’ in this verse has two symbolic meanings, as “blazing mountains” &amp; “as spirits.” Firstly, <em>blazing mountains</em>: The word ‘blaze’ is “a bright and or steady light or glare,” a brilliant striking display.” The word ‘mountain’ in NELSON’S BIBLE DICTIONARY means “something that is elevated, an elevated place or position, (high up) – as in literal stars shining in outer space.</p>
<p>There is mention of seven stars. In the Bible we also have mention of the Pleiades, as in JOB 9:9, 38:31 (TWICE) JOB 38:32 &amp; AMOS 5:8. There are seven distinct stars seen in the Pleiades, and the fact it is mentioned in the Bible so it may well indicate that this is a place of the seven literal stars.</p>
<p>The second symbolic meaning of the word ‘stars’ is “spirits.” Stars are symbolic of angels (REV. 1:16-20 &amp; 2:1 &amp; 3:1; also in the Book of Jude, (JUDE 13) as wandering stars. It is mentioned in the Book of Enoch {{Ethiopian}} as “stars.” Angels are also spirits (HEB. 1:14.) So then the second symbolic meaning of ‘stars’ here is “angels.” But are they good or fallen angels? Let’s see!</p>
<p>In I ENOCH 8, it mentions seven particular (angels) who left their first estate (Heaven) and came to Earth with the purpose of cohabitating with the daughters of men (GEN. 6:1-2.) These seven Fallen Angels are mentioned in this book in chapter 18. As these are the only seven angels who have taught men evil things and are listed in the Book of Enoch, then verse 14 (above) must also be referring to these specific angels (as stars.)</p>
<p>Here is a list of their names: Azazyel; Amazarah; Armers; Barkayal; Akibeel; Ramiel; Asaradel. We believe that the seven stars of the Pleiades <em>are</em> the seven stars (Fallen Angels) so listed in Enoch. Let’s take a close look at the verses in chapter 18 of 1 ENOCH:</p>
<p>VERSE 15: “Then the angel said, ‘This place until the consumption of heaven and earth will be the prison of the stars and the host of heaven.’”</p>
<p>This ‘place’ <em>is</em> the seven stars of the Pleiades. The word ‘prison’ in Greek (teresis) means “a watching – keeping” similar to a “place of keeping.” This means that the seven stars of the Pleiades will be a prison, a place of keeping of these seven fallen angels. {{Is it any wonder that the Pleiades – in particular – is so often mentioned in <b>THE NEW AGE CONTACTEE literature?</b> I have often mentioned this seemingly bizarre connection from people who track <em>the Semjases</em> of the Pleiadian system, such as Richard Thompson who recorded the New Age “gibberish” of Semjasa (as contactor) who gave the same to Billy Meier which Richard cited in his book, “ALIEN IDENTITIES;” recently I saw Gary Bates cite another reference to Semjase <span style="color: #000000">Semjaza</span> in his book, “ALIEN INTRUSION;” this time it revolved around “her” <span style="color: #000000">possible disguised Fallen Angel</span> feeding false or misguided information to author Brad Steiger as well as Fred Bell, grandson of Alexander Graham Bell, so it seems that this ‘lady’ <span style="color: #000000">QUEEN OF HEAVEN</span> from the Pleiades is very active in UFO circles; even Whitley Strieber seems to have had sex with <b>a similar</b> Fallen Angel (posing as a female, going by he name of Ishtar, a mother-goddess of Babylon, who has many names in different cultures throughout the world,) as per his own admission in the book, “COMMUNION.” Perhaps Enoch’s clue about the seven stars as well as the actual mention of the Pleiades in The Bible are <b>not coincidental</b> in my humble opinion, and the names they give out may simply be <b>clues</b> as to whom they really are ~~ i.e., FALLEN ANGELS, and with its fruit, by <em>any other name</em> smells as bitter!.}}</p>
<p>Now who is the host of heaven? Could it be also that he is in prison with the seven? We look up the word ‘host’ in VINE’S DICTIONARY it is listed as host, but also as “host” (of angels.) This meaning in Greek (stratia) = “an army” and is used of ‘angels’ in LUKE 2:13 &amp; ‘stars’ in ACTS 7:42. ‘Army’ here in general means a large number or group of. So the seven stars (angels) will be in a place of keeping (the Pleiades) with the other Fallen Angels (hosts of heaven, the army of angels.) The word ‘heaven’ here in Greek (ouranos) is used in connection with the expression “of the aerial heavens.” ‘Aerial’ means in general “in the air, living in the air, atmosphere,” plus ‘heavens’ meaning “the sky or universe as seen from earth.”</p>
<p>So the host of heaven (a large number of “Fallen Angels” together with the “aerial heavens,” mean “they” are in earth’s air, sky, “atmosphere, but also “they” are in space – the Pleiadian system.) So the question becomes: How can they be or travel to both places?</p>
<p>Let’s look at the word ‘place’ again. In Greek we have (phottoklisia) for (ope) meaning “a hole” while in the KJV Bible, it is “place;” it says to see the word <em>opening.</em> The word ‘opening’ in Greek (anoigo) is used transitively as literally “a door or gate.” The word ‘hole’ in general (pholeos) is “a lair.” A ‘lair’ is a “dwelling place or hideaway.” This could represent the place of keeping (the Pleiades.) If we were to look at the word ‘portal,’ it means “a doorway, as entrance,” or a (“gate”.)</p>
<p>This, then, is how the stars (as Fallen Angels) can be in the aerial (sky – air of earth) and the heavens (space-universe): <b>by using a doorway!</b> (How many times have the “aliens” mentioned that they came from the Pleiades? ) A LOT! The Fallen Angels as aliens? Yes! (At least this is how it is portrayed in the ‘Billy Meier contactee literature.’) {{In our book, “THE <em>CURS</em>-ED NET,” we show that these aliens are Fallen Angels trying to deceive us into believing they are ETs coming from galaxies far far away – but they really come from their first estate – being <em>thrust down as rebellious angels</em> and into the curs-ed net – their newly found SECOND ESTATE!}} </p>
<p>It is mentioned many times in “THE <em>CURS</em>-ED NET” that these angels are here to deceive us. If we look at the word ‘deceive,’ in Greek (aparte) it states “deceit or deceitfulness” akin to (apatao) “to deceive” or that which gives a false impression (effect) whether by appearance, statement or influence. The effect <b><em>is</em>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>the UFO phenomenon; the appearance <em>is</em><b> of false aliens; the statement </b><em>is</em><b> that UFOs &amp; aliens exist, and the influence used </b><em>is</em><b> by supernatural means. Using the Greek meaning (phrenapatao) under the word ‘deceive’ we have the meaning <em>literally</em> “to deceive in one’s mind.” ‘Influence’ is having the power to “affect” a person or course of events (as the UFO phenomenon does.) To further show that these Fallen Angels are connected to the UFOs, we uncover the following:
        <p> </p>
        <p>VERSE 16: “The stars which roll over the fire are those which transgressed the commandments of God before their time arrived, as in (transgress, violating, committing an offense against God’s laws.) So these are the Fallen Angels.</p>
        <p>The word ‘’stars’’ again means angels – which (“roll over fire.”) The word ‘roll’ in general has a meaning of “to travel, to wander,” (as mentioned in Jude 13 ~~ <em>relating to the wandering stars.</em>) Remember the words ‘aerial heavens’ and ‘portal.’ The meaning of the word <em>roll</em> means “to travel, wander” so these angels could travel from the Pleiades to the earth via a doorway-gate!<b> Just to let you know, the word ‘wander’ in Greek (polanao) means “deceit” &amp; says to see the word <em>deceit – c#6</em> meaning “which states also the meaning of (planao) which is akin to (plane.) In English it means </b>planet!<b> It also means to deceive by leading into error , to seduce. So the term <em>wandering stars</em> is equated to the term <em>deceitful angels;</em> also the word ‘deceit’ in REV. 12:9 (as present participle) is used with the definite article as a title of the devil, “the deceiver” – <em>literally</em> “the deceiving ones.” So these Fallen Angels are working for and connection with Satan. We now look at the word <em>over</em> as in roll “over” fire.
        <p>The word ‘over’ in Greek (proistemi) means “to direct, attend to” &amp; is translated “to rule.” The word ‘direct’ in general means “to control” &amp; is the ability to manage an instrument or a set of instruments, to guide a machine or vehicle, (as in UFOs as instruments of accomplishing a deceptive agenda?) In Latin (rotulus) “roll” is the diminutive of (rota) which is “wheel” (and may be symbolic of a UFO!) See the word <em>roll</em> as mentioned earlier in VERSE 16 of this chapter under consideration in ENOCH. </p>
        <p>The next word after ‘direct’ is the word ‘attend,’ which means “to be present with, to accompany.” The word ‘accompany’ means “to be or go with and to co-exist with,” (as in the Fallen Angels occupying the fire, the brilliant shiny objects.) The next word in the verse is ‘fire’ and in Greek (puroo) is translated as “being on fire” (a symbolism;) it mentions to see the word 'fiery.’ <em>Metaphorically</em> the word ‘fiery’ is “of the darts of the evil one” (the devil) [EPH. 6:16.] </p>
        <p>To continue with the word ‘fire’ we notice that in Greek it is symbolic of the “danger of destruction” as mentioned in JUDE 23. The word ‘destruction’ here means ‘’metaphorically’’ “a spiritual destitution.” This word ‘fire’ is symbolic of the object in which the Fallen Angels control and occupy. It generally is associated with “luminosity &amp;/or brilliance.” ‘Brilliant’ means “looking illuminated, full of light,” and in Latin is (beryl.) ‘Beryl’ in general means “transparent to translucent.” ‘Transparent’ means capable of transmitting light so that objects or images (UFOs or alien forms) can be seen, (and is usually effective at night.)</p>
        <p>‘Translucent’ means transmitting light and causing diffusion to prevent perception or distinct images (as in using light to cover up the true shape of the object.) In Latin it means “to shine through,” where ‘through’ means “here &amp; there, in &amp; around,” (just as UFO lights &amp; colors change positions with the patterns of changing lights.) {{If you refer to the web page, “NIGHT SIEGE within THE CURSED NET,” located at<br />
        <a href="http://inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/NIGHT+SIEGE+within+THE+CURS-ED+NET"><span style="color: #0367ad">http://inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/NIGHT+SIEGE+within+THE+CURS-ED+NET</span></a><br />
        you will see several examples from fairly recent Ufological lore that clearly show how UFOs use sequential bright lights in presenting themselves to the spectators on the planet Earth.}} These lights contain ‘’colors’’ and if we look at this word ‘color’ in Greek – it says to see the word <em>cloke</em> <span style="color: #000000">cloak</span> – a pretense and in Greek (epikalumma) means “a covering, a means of hiding,” where (epi) = “upon” &amp; (kalupto) = “to cover.” – hence, ”a pretext, a cloke for wickedness” (evil,) so this light used to cover or hide this object is used for an evil cause.</p>
        <p>Lastly, we look at the word ‘shine’ and in Greek we see several interesting meanings: 1) is (perelampo) = “to shine around;” 2) (periastrapto) = “to flash around, or to shine round about” where (peri) &amp; (astrape) mean “to shine bright” (brilliance.) so now to finish this understanding, we have Fallen Angels who travel via a door or gateway from the Pleiades to the Earth and back again. This portal leads to an invisible place (heaven.) The seven stars are not seen as we see it through a telescope. This place of keeping is through another dimension which we cannot see, yet when they come here to this world, they (by supernatural power) become visible and appear as UFOs and are construed as “aliens” from elsewhere which actually interact with the human beings on this planet. {{As we have pointed out in “THE <em>CURS</em>-ED NET,” the only real<b> evidence we have as to where they possibly could come from, is the story that relates to those angels <em>cast down</em> from their first estate; all other assumptions are just that – assumptions, which seem to have no bearing on total reality. CF. the book, “ALIEN INTRUSION,” by Gary Bates, and you will get an eyeful of all of the obstacles that preclude ETs from galaxies far far away. Of course the dimensional hypothesis would be appropriate since heaven is in another dimension, so for the angels to be cast down would imply going from one dimension to another- rather than from one galaxy to another, and all the baggage that goes along with it. CF. also the web page, <a href="http://inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/STUMBLING+BLOCK+to+INTELLIGENT+DESIGN"><span style="color: #0367ad">http://inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/STUMBLING+BLOCK+to+INTELLIGENT+DESIGN</span></a> that gives a concise bird’s eye view of the problems inherent in THE BIG BANG theory as well as the general tenets of evolution <em>in favor of</em> a young universe that was created by – yes – THE CREATOR who is the God of the Bible, whose Son is Jesus Christ, second Person of the Blessed Trinity. It all has a symmetry to it, with no loose ends; even the third Person of the Trinity is fully understood if you go to the web page, TRINITY explained FULLY, compliments of Biblical scholar, Walter Martin, and found at the following link:<br />
        <a href="http://inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/TRINITY+explained+FULLY"><span style="color: #0367ad">http://inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/TRINITY+explained+FULLY</span></a> }}
        <p>In essence then, these deceptive spiritual beings (who have <em>shape-shifting</em> capabilities,) can direct, control and occupy the <em>fire</em> that is the object of their rule. This object or objects (fire being the symbol of that object,) shine with brilliant light – a light that flashes around (forming patterns) and which shines round about (encompassing the object<a href="http://inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/s" class="WikiLink" id="p-c685a325107544818ece9fd82f85add6c239f7b2"><span style="color: #0367ad">s</span></a>.) To be sure, evil is its contents! Remembering that the word <em>appear</em> in Greek (phaino) means “to shine,” there seems to be a confirmation “round about” {{no pun intended, as all these ideas come swimming together into one larger concept which throws a <em>mighty light</em> on the whereabouts of this now – SECOND ESTATE – which St. Jude alludes to in his letter within the New Testament.}} </p>
        <p>So this <em>fire</em> is symbolic of shining brilliant flashing objects, which by meaning of the word ‘shine’ (in Greek) have the ability to appear. The word ‘appear’ in the passive voice also means “to be brought forth into the light, to become evident, to appear” (as UFOs all of a sudden do.) They are evident to the eye. The word ‘appearance in Greek (eidos) is that which “strikes the eye,” (as so many people have noticed shiny objects in the sky.) It also means “that which is exposed to view,” an external appearance of a form or shape which is the object. </p>
        <p>Look at the word ‘apparition’ in Greek (phantasma) &amp; (phaino) [from the word ‘appear’ earlier.] Here it means “to shine.” It is a phantasm or phantom that appears and also shines &amp; glows (as some alien creatures have been seen doing;) {{the <em>chupa cabra</em> comes immediately to mind, and it has actually been known to have had sequential colors on its body as seen by some who have glimpsed this “<em>demon out of hell</em> who sucks its prey in a paranormal fashion – as if it were fashioned by demons themselves, and yes, their eyes are red.}} There is mention of <em>ghosts</em> in MATT. 14:26 &amp; MARK 6:49 in the Bible. Remember that these Fallen Angles are spirits (HEB. 1:14,) and can walk through walls and do other supernatural things just as these “aliens” creatures have been reported as doing. {{Perhaps the latter are conveniently mistaken for the former? In a secular humanistic society which is prone to see things in a “nuts &amp; bolts” fashion, it would follow like night follows day ~~~but ~~ it doesn’t make it correct!}}</p>
        <p>Ask yourself then if these angels/spirits have the ability to go through walls! We know that matter (i.e., a true alien body of flesh &amp; blood of some sort,) cannot by itself go through a wall! Then how do they do it? {{OCCAM’S RAZOR applies:}} Because…they are ‘’really spirits’’ that are Fallen Angels (or demons) disguised as aliens<b> {{This would include either “shape-shifters” as postulated in the 19th chapter of 1 ENOCH regarding the angels…or the spirits of demons temporarily taking residence in a shell of some sort which could easily have been <em>cloned</em> by a supernatural agency with highly super technological intellectual skills. SEE?}}
        <p>We continue now with ENOCH, chapter 19, VERSE 2. This verse is also connected to the prior information given. </p>
        <p>VERSE TWO: “And being numerous in appearance made men profane, and caused them to err.” There is more to verse two, but it is not needed. Here. We now uncover its meaning and show its knowledge in connection with chapter 18, verses 14, 15 &amp; 16.</p>
        <p>The word ‘numerous’ means “many,” as earlier mentioned in chapter 18, verse 15 as the “host of heaven” – meaning “host (of angels)” and a large number as in the word “numerous” above. The word ’in’ here means “the characteristic, attribute, or property of, and also the activity, occupation, or function of,” (i.e., in character of that which they, the Fallen Angles portray.)</p>
        <p>The word ‘appearance’ here in Greek (eidos) is an “external appearance form or shape,” (the appearance of UFOs but more so of the forms or images of alien creatures – ghostly or not.) Also the word ‘appear’ has a meaning that signifies “to shine” (as some of their creatures and images do.) The word ‘form’ from above in Greek is (morphe) &amp; in English is “morph.” So if we look at the word ‘’metamorphosis’’ (meta) means “ an alteration, beyond, highly developed &amp; transformation.” ‘Metamorphosis’ means to be able to transform into different forms (externally) in appearance, character, function, etc., (just as the Fallen Angels have the ability to do.) To go further with this, ‘meta’ above means “beyond” and in Greek ‘’meta’’ means “beside.”</p>
        <p>‘Beyond’ in Greek (peran) means “on the other side &amp; across” &amp; is used with the definite article, signifying the region beyond.” ‘Region’ in Greek (chora) means “a space lying between two limits.” (This can mean in our world and time the outer space distance between Earth &amp; the Pleiades, but also the connection being the “doorway-gate” from their invisible dimension, (i.e., the place of keeping, “prison” spoken of earlier and our present visible dimension here in our atmosphere.) The word ‘dimension’ is a point in space (as in the limits between) or in space &amp; time that would be the (portal) time gateway space. The word ‘para’ also means “beyond” and in Greek means “besides” as the word ‘meta’ does.</p>
        <p>The word ‘beside’ in general has a meaning in <em>archaic</em> as being “nearby” – not far away. (With the supernatural ability of these Fallen Angels to travel using a gateway between dimensions, from their perspective, the trip would be most likely “very short!”) {{In 1 Enoch 18:7 there is an expression called the path of the angels<b> which I <em>intuit</em> to be the dimensional doorway between heaven &amp; our earth, so this very thesis Richard is presenting would give some type of credence to this idea, although it is impossible to prove by today’s scientific method. This is always the <em>rub</em> when you try to connect dots spiritually; this is the reason that faith is so important – but a reasoned faith is not beyond our capability to figure out since God has given us all that is necessary to love Him - </b>so we are without excuse!<b>}} Did you know that the word ‘near’ in general has a meaning of “within a short distance or interval in space or time” [?] An interval is a space between two points. So these Fallen Angels travel here through a portal, are in control and occupy the “fire” which are the shining brilliant objects, and have the ability to change shapes and forms into whatever” alien-like creature” they wish to – supernaturally! They can appear wherever they wish in their character (as Grays, Reptilians, etc.,) and are able to function as that character to further deceive us into believing they are ‘’real’’ aliens. In short, they have the ability to make that “creature” function as if it had a nature all of its own – {{reflecting </b>the perfect façade<b> with few the wiser!}}
        <p>The next part of VERSE TWO states “They made men profane, and caused them to err.” The word ‘men’ here symbolizes mankind over the years. ‘Profane’ means that they (the Fallen Angels) “made” (i.e. shaped mankind) to be non-religious &amp; unclean before God, through deception, with man believing the lies. ‘Err’ means “by teaching deceitful falsehoods, disclosing harmful knowledge through chosen abductees (“receivers”) who transmit so-called alien messages which are supposed to contain helpful spiritual truth, yet is fed to us as poisonous ones – directly in opposition to God’s own word. {In chapter nine of “THE <em>CURS</em>-ED NET,” entitled ‘Show &amp; Tell,’ it becomes painfully obvious that that is what psychics &amp; mediums’ function is: to convince the masses of humanity that the mediums can talk to dead people when, in fact, they are talking to familiar spirits.<b>}} Through these teachings over the centuries, generations of abductees would gain false truth of a race or races of false beings who are portrayed by evil spirits &amp; Fallen Angels, only to do man harm by turning him away from God. {{This is what I personally believed happened with the ‘DOGON TRIBE’ phenomenon: This tribe received knowledge about the Sirius double star system that was very accurate, and they could not possibly have known the information…but the Fallen Angels (who according to ENOCH, chapter 8, schooled men in the knowledge of astronomy and astrology,) so it does not take a genius to figure out that this tribe was being given information to get them to adore these same <em>cast down</em> beings and Oannes was posing as one of these Fallen Angels as a disguised ET god! CF. “THE SIRIUS MYSTERY” by Robert Temple for <em>the ostensible</em> details of this. It’s a beautiful story but a <em>better</em> façade! Once you connect the Enochian dots, even the most obtuse will eventually see the façade for what it really is, since the DOG-STAR will have opened the curtain symbolically, and the wizard is unmasked for whom he really is – symbolically, of course!}}
        <p>Do you know that the word ‘err’ in ‘’archaic’’ means “to stray” and in Latin “to wander” [?] Remember JUDE 13 in the Bible, and the expression “wandering stars” where Jude is using to symbolize the Fallen Angels ~~ and remember that ‘wander’ in Greek means “deceit” (as in deceitful angels.) No wonder they have caused men to err. If one is to believe in the word of God – who loves us – then this knowledge is power – the power of the truth of scripture, but having His Son Jesus Christ as your savior is the ultimate power** that these Fallen Angels have no chance against those who believe in God’s word and whose savior is Jesus Christ. The Fallen Angels’ direction leads to a second death (eternal death) but Christ’s direction in our lives leads to everlasting life and peace from those masking as deceptive ‘aliens.’</p>

Using the Greek meaning (phrenapatao) under the word ‘deceive’ we have the meaning “to deceive in one’s mind.” ‘Influence’ is having the power to “affect” a person or course of events (as the UFO phenomenon does.) To further show that these Fallen Angels are connected to the UFOs, we uncover the following:

<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Bible Gateway Clues Using the Supporting Evidence Found in 1 Enoch 18 &amp; 19</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>by Richard Stout</strong></p>
<p>{{Richard may have found the clues to why the Fallen Angels have been linked to the seven star system – the Pleiades, and also how the Pleiades are continually being linked to THE NEW AGE literature through Ufology and the alleged contactees who – in many instances – get their “information” from those who <em>hail from the Pleiades.</em>’ As Richard uses key word analysis in critical verses within chapters 18 &amp; 19 of Enoch, I will also give suggestive evidence to support this contention. Byron <span style="color: #000000">LeBeau</span>}}</p>
<p>I ENOCH 18:14: <em>And I beheld seven stars like blazing mountains and like spirits entertaining me.</em></p>
<p>‘Stars’ in this verse has two symbolic meanings, as “blazing mountains” &amp; “as spirits.” Firstly, <em>blazing mountains</em>: The word ‘blaze’ is “a bright and or steady light or glare,” a brilliant striking display.” The word ‘mountain’ in NELSON’S BIBLE DICTIONARY means “something that is elevated, an elevated place or position, (high up) – as in literal stars shining in outer space.</p>
<p>There is mention of seven stars. In the Bible we also have mention of the Pleiades, as in JOB 9:9, 38:31 (TWICE) JOB 38:32 &amp; AMOS 5:8. There are seven distinct stars seen in the Pleiades, and the fact it is mentioned in the Bible so it may well indicate that this is a place of the seven literal stars.</p>
<p>The second symbolic meaning of the word ‘stars’ is “spirits.” Stars are symbolic of angels (REV. 1:16-20 &amp; 2:1 &amp; 3:1; also in the Book of Jude, (JUDE 13) as wandering stars. It is mentioned in the Book of Enoch {{Ethiopian}} as “stars.” Angels are also spirits (HEB. 1:14.) So then the second symbolic meaning of ‘stars’ here is “angels.” But are they good or fallen angels? Let’s see!</p>
<p>In I ENOCH 8, it mentions seven particular (angels) who left their first estate (Heaven) and came to Earth with the purpose of cohabitating with the daughters of men (GEN. 6:1-2.) These seven Fallen Angels are mentioned in this book in chapter 18. As these are the only seven angels who have taught men evil things and are listed in the Book of Enoch, then verse 14 (above) must also be referring to these specific angels (as stars.)</p>
<p>Here is a list of their names: Azazyel; Amazarah; Armers; Barkayal; Akibeel; Ramiel; Asaradel. We believe that the seven stars of the Pleiades <em>are</em> the seven stars (Fallen Angels) so listed in Enoch. Let’s take a close look at the verses in chapter 18 of 1 ENOCH:</p>
<p>VERSE 15: “Then the angel said, ‘This place until the consumption of heaven and earth will be the prison of the stars and the host of heaven.’”</p>
<p>This ‘place’ <em>is</em> the seven stars of the Pleiades. The word ‘prison’ in Greek (teresis) means “a watching – keeping” similar to a “place of keeping.” This means that the seven stars of the Pleiades will be a prison, a place of keeping of these seven fallen angels. {{Is it any wonder that the Pleiades – in particular – is so often mentioned in <b>THE NEW AGE CONTACTEE literature?</b> I have often mentioned this seemingly bizarre connection from people who track <em>the Semjases</em> of the Pleiadian system, such as Richard Thompson who recorded the New Age “gibberish” of Semjasa (as contactor) who gave the same to Billy Meier which Richard cited in his book, “ALIEN IDENTITIES;” recently I saw Gary Bates cite another reference to Semjase <span style="color: #000000">Semjaza</span> in his book, “ALIEN INTRUSION;” this time it revolved around “her” <span style="color: #000000">possible disguised Fallen Angel</span> feeding false or misguided information to author Brad Steiger as well as Fred Bell, grandson of Alexander Graham Bell, so it seems that this ‘lady’ <span style="color: #000000">QUEEN OF HEAVEN</span> from the Pleiades is very active in UFO circles; even Whitley Strieber seems to have had sex with <b>a similar</b> Fallen Angel (posing as a female, going by he name of Ishtar, a mother-goddess of Babylon, who has many names in different cultures throughout the world,) as per his own admission in the book, “COMMUNION.” Perhaps Enoch’s clue about the seven stars as well as the actual mention of the Pleiades in The Bible are <b>not coincidental</b> in my humble opinion, and the names they give out may simply be <b>clues</b> as to whom they really are ~~ i.e., FALLEN ANGELS, and with its fruit, by <em>any other name</em> smells as bitter!.}}</p>
<p>Now who is the host of heaven? Could it be also that he is in prison with the seven? We look up the word ‘host’ in VINE’S DICTIONARY it is listed as host, but also as “host” (of angels.) This meaning in Greek (stratia) = “an army” and is used of ‘angels’ in LUKE 2:13 &amp; ‘stars’ in ACTS 7:42. ‘Army’ here in general means a large number or group of. So the seven stars (angels) will be in a place of keeping (the Pleiades) with the other Fallen Angels (hosts of heaven, the army of angels.) The word ‘heaven’ here in Greek (ouranos) is used in connection with the expression “of the aerial heavens.” ‘Aerial’ means in general “in the air, living in the air, atmosphere,” plus ‘heavens’ meaning “the sky or universe as seen from earth.”</p>
<p>So the host of heaven (a large number of “Fallen Angels” together with the “aerial heavens,” mean “they” are in earth’s air, sky, “atmosphere, but also “they” are in space – the Pleiadian system.) So the question becomes: How can they be or travel to both places?</p>
<p>Let’s look at the word ‘place’ again. In Greek we have (phottoklisia) for (ope) meaning “a hole” while in the KJV Bible, it is “place;” it says to see the word <em>opening.</em> The word ‘opening’ in Greek (anoigo) is used transitively as literally “a door or gate.” The word ‘hole’ in general (pholeos) is “a lair.” A ‘lair’ is a “dwelling place or hideaway.” This could represent the place of keeping (the Pleiades.) If we were to look at the word ‘portal,’ it means “a doorway, as entrance,” or a (“gate”.)</p>
<p>This, then, is how the stars (as Fallen Angels) can be in the aerial (sky – air of earth) and the heavens (space-universe): <b>by using a doorway!</b> (How many times have the “aliens” mentioned that they came from the Pleiades? ) A LOT! The Fallen Angels as aliens? Yes! (At least this is how it is portrayed in the ‘Billy Meier contactee literature.’) {{In our book, “THE <em>CURS</em>-ED NET,” we show that these aliens are Fallen Angels trying to deceive us into believing they are ETs coming from galaxies far far away – but they really come from their first estate – being <em>thrust down as rebellious angels</em> and into the curs-ed net – their newly found SECOND ESTATE!}} </p>
<p>It is mentioned many times in “THE <em>CURS</em>-ED NET” that these angels are here to deceive us. If we look at the word ‘deceive,’ in Greek (aparte) it states “deceit or deceitfulness” akin to (apatao) “to deceive” or that which gives a false impression (effect) whether by appearance, statement or influence. The effect <b><em>is</em>
<ul>
    <ul>
        <li>the UFO phenomenon; the appearance <em>is</em><b> of false aliens; the statement </b><em>is</em><b> that UFOs &amp; aliens exist, and the influence used </b><em>is</em><b> by supernatural means. Using the Greek meaning (phrenapatao) under the word ‘deceive’ we have the meaning <em>literally</em> “to deceive in one’s mind.” ‘Influence’ is having the power to “affect” a person or course of events (as the UFO phenomenon does.) To further show that these Fallen Angels are connected to the UFOs, we uncover the following:
        <p> </p>
        <p>VERSE 16: “The stars which roll over the fire are those which transgressed the commandments of God before their time arrived, as in (transgress, violating, committing an offense against God’s laws.) So these are the Fallen Angels.</p>
        <p>The word ‘’stars’’ again means angels – which (“roll over fire.”) The word ‘roll’ in general has a meaning of “to travel, to wander,” (as mentioned in Jude 13 ~~ <em>relating to the wandering stars.</em>) Remember the words ‘aerial heavens’ and ‘portal.’ The meaning of the word <em>roll</em> means “to travel, wander” so these angels could travel from the Pleiades to the earth via a doorway-gate!<b> Just to let you know, the word ‘wander’ in Greek (polanao) means “deceit” &amp; says to see the word <em>deceit – c#6</em> meaning “which states also the meaning of (planao) which is akin to (plane.) In English it means </b>planet!<b> It also means to deceive by leading into error , to seduce. So the term <em>wandering stars</em> is equated to the term <em>deceitful angels;</em> also the word ‘deceit’ in REV. 12:9 (as present participle) is used with the definite article as a title of the devil, “the deceiver” – <em>literally</em> “the deceiving ones.” So these Fallen Angels are working for and connection with Satan. We now look at the word <em>over</em> as in roll “over” fire.
        <p>The word ‘over’ in Greek (proistemi) means “to direct, attend to” &amp; is translated “to rule.” The word ‘direct’ in general means “to control” &amp; is the ability to manage an instrument or a set of instruments, to guide a machine or vehicle, (as in UFOs as instruments of accomplishing a deceptive agenda?) In Latin (rotulus) “roll” is the diminutive of (rota) which is “wheel” (and may be symbolic of a UFO!) See the word <em>roll</em> as mentioned earlier in VERSE 16 of this chapter under consideration in ENOCH. </p>
        <p>The next word after ‘direct’ is the word ‘attend,’ which means “to be present with, to accompany.” The word ‘accompany’ means “to be or go with and to co-exist with,” (as in the Fallen Angels occupying the fire, the brilliant shiny objects.) The next word in the verse is ‘fire’ and in Greek (puroo) is translated as “being on fire” (a symbolism;) it mentions to see the word 'fiery.’ <em>Metaphorically</em> the word ‘fiery’ is “of the darts of the evil one” (the devil) [EPH. 6:16.] </p>
        <p>To continue with the word ‘fire’ we notice that in Greek it is symbolic of the “danger of destruction” as mentioned in JUDE 23. The word ‘destruction’ here means ‘’metaphorically’’ “a spiritual destitution.” This word ‘fire’ is symbolic of the object in which the Fallen Angels control and occupy. It generally is associated with “luminosity &amp;/or brilliance.” ‘Brilliant’ means “looking illuminated, full of light,” and in Latin is (beryl.) ‘Beryl’ in general means “transparent to translucent.” ‘Transparent’ means capable of transmitting light so that objects or images (UFOs or alien forms) can be seen, (and is usually effective at night.)</p>
        <p>‘Translucent’ means transmitting light and causing diffusion to prevent perception or distinct images (as in using light to cover up the true shape of the object.) In Latin it means “to shine through,” where ‘through’ means “here &amp; there, in &amp; around,” (just as UFO lights &amp; colors change positions with the patterns of changing lights.) {{If you refer to the web page, “NIGHT SIEGE within THE CURSED NET,” located at<br />
        <a href="http://inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/NIGHT+SIEGE+within+THE+CURS-ED+NET"><span style="color: #0367ad">http://inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/NIGHT+SIEGE+within+THE+CURS-ED+NET</span></a><br />
        you will see several examples from fairly recent Ufological lore that clearly show how UFOs use sequential bright lights in presenting themselves to the spectators on the planet Earth.}} These lights contain ‘’colors’’ and if we look at this word ‘color’ in Greek – it says to see the word <em>cloke</em> <span style="color: #000000">cloak</span> – a pretense and in Greek (epikalumma) means “a covering, a means of hiding,” where (epi) = “upon” &amp; (kalupto) = “to cover.” – hence, ”a pretext, a cloke for wickedness” (evil,) so this light used to cover or hide this object is used for an evil cause.</p>
        <p>Lastly, we look at the word ‘shine’ and in Greek we see several interesting meanings: 1) is (perelampo) = “to shine around;” 2) (periastrapto) = “to flash around, or to shine round about” where (peri) &amp; (astrape) mean “to shine bright” (brilliance.) so now to finish this understanding, we have Fallen Angels who travel via a door or gateway from the Pleiades to the Earth and back again. This portal leads to an invisible place (heaven.) The seven stars are not seen as we see it through a telescope. This place of keeping is through another dimension which we cannot see, yet when they come here to this world, they (by supernatural power) become visible and appear as UFOs and are construed as “aliens” from elsewhere which actually interact with the human beings on this planet. {{As we have pointed out in “THE <em>CURS</em>-ED NET,” the only real<b> evidence we have as to where they possibly could come from, is the story that relates to those angels <em>cast down</em> from their first estate; all other assumptions are just that – assumptions, which seem to have no bearing on total reality. CF. the book, “ALIEN INTRUSION,” by Gary Bates, and you will get an eyeful of all of the obstacles that preclude ETs from galaxies far far away. Of course the dimensional hypothesis would be appropriate since heaven is in another dimension, so for the angels to be cast down would imply going from one dimension to another- rather than from one galaxy to another, and all the baggage that goes along with it. CF. also the web page, <a href="http://inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/STUMBLING+BLOCK+to+INTELLIGENT+DESIGN"><span style="color: #0367ad">http://inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/STUMBLING+BLOCK+to+INTELLIGENT+DESIGN</span></a> that gives a concise bird’s eye view of the problems inherent in THE BIG BANG theory as well as the general tenets of evolution <em>in favor of</em> a young universe that was created by – yes – THE CREATOR who is the God of the Bible, whose Son is Jesus Christ, second Person of the Blessed Trinity. It all has a symmetry to it, with no loose ends; even the third Person of the Trinity is fully understood if you go to the web page, TRINITY explained FULLY, compliments of Biblical scholar, Walter Martin, and found at the following link:<br />
        <a href="http://inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/TRINITY+explained+FULLY"><span style="color: #0367ad">http://inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/TRINITY+explained+FULLY</span></a> }}
        <p>In essence then, these deceptive spiritual beings (who have <em>shape-shifting</em> capabilities,) can direct, control and occupy the <em>fire</em> that is the object of their rule. This object or objects (fire being the symbol of that object,) shine with brilliant light – a light that flashes around (forming patterns) and which shines round about (encompassing the object<a href="http://inspectorblebeau.pbwiki.com/s" class="WikiLink" id="p-c685a325107544818ece9fd82f85add6c239f7b2"><span style="color: #0367ad">s</span></a>.) To be sure, evil is its contents! Remembering that the word <em>appear</em> in Greek (phaino) means “to shine,” there seems to be a confirmation “round about” {{no pun intended, as all these ideas come swimming together into one larger concept which throws a <em>mighty light</em> on the whereabouts of this now – SECOND ESTATE – which St. Jude alludes to in his letter within the New Testament.}} </p>
        <p>So this <em>fire</em> is symbolic of shining brilliant flashing objects, which by meaning of the word ‘shine’ (in Greek) have the ability to appear. The word ‘appear’ in the passive voice also means “to be brought forth into the light, to become evident, to appear” (as UFOs all of a sudden do.) They are evident to the eye. The word ‘appearance in Greek (eidos) is that which “strikes the eye,” (as so many people have noticed shiny objects in the sky.) It also means “that which is exposed to view,” an external appearance of a form or shape which is the object. </p>
        <p>Look at the word ‘apparition’ in Greek (phantasma) &amp; (phaino) [from the word ‘appear’ earlier.] Here it means “to shine.” It is a phantasm or phantom that appears and also shines &amp; glows (as some alien creatures have been seen doing;) {{the <em>chupa cabra</em> comes immediately to mind, and it has actually been known to have had sequential colors on its body as seen by some who have glimpsed this “<em>demon out of hell</em> who sucks its prey in a paranormal fashion – as if it were fashioned by demons themselves, and yes, their eyes are red.}} There is mention of <em>ghosts</em> in MATT. 14:26 &amp; MARK 6:49 in the Bible. Remember that these Fallen Angles are spirits (HEB. 1:14,) and can walk through walls and do other supernatural things just as these “aliens” creatures have been reported as doing. {{Perhaps the latter are conveniently mistaken for the former? In a secular humanistic society which is prone to see things in a “nuts &amp; bolts” fashion, it would follow like night follows day ~~~but ~~ it doesn’t make it correct!}}</p>
        <p>Ask yourself then if these angels/spirits have the ability to go through walls! We know that matter (i.e., a true alien body of flesh &amp; blood of some sort,) cannot by itself go through a wall! Then how do they do it? {{OCCAM’S RAZOR applies:}} Because…they are ‘’really spirits’’ that are Fallen Angels (or demons) disguised as aliens<b> {{This would include either “shape-shifters” as postulated in the 19th chapter of 1 ENOCH regarding the angels…or the spirits of demons temporarily taking residence in a shell of some sort which could easily have been <em>cloned</em> by a supernatural agency with highly super technological intellectual skills.

        <p>We continue now with ENOCH, chapter 19, VERSE 2. This verse is also connected to the prior information given. </p>
        <p>VERSE TWO: “And being numerous in appearance made men profane, and caused them to err.” There is more to verse two, but it is not needed. Here. We now uncover its meaning and show its knowledge in connection with chapter 18, verses 14, 15 &amp; 16.</p>
        <p>The word ‘numerous’ means “many,” as earlier mentioned in chapter 18, verse 15 as the “host of heaven” – meaning “host (of angels)” and a large number as in the word “numerous” above. The word ’in’ here means “the characteristic, attribute, or property of, and also the activity, occupation, or function of,” (i.e., in character of that which they, the Fallen Angles portray.)</p>
        <p>The word ‘appearance’ here in Greek (eidos) is an “external appearance form or shape,” (the appearance of UFOs but more so of the forms or images of alien creatures – ghostly or not.) Also the word ‘appear’ has a meaning that signifies “to shine” (as some of their creatures and images do.) The word ‘form’ from above in Greek is (morphe) &amp; in English is “morph.” So if we look at the word ‘’metamorphosis’’ (meta) means “ an alteration, beyond, highly developed &amp; transformation.” ‘Metamorphosis’ means to be able to transform into different forms (externally) in appearance, character, function, etc., (just as the Fallen Angels have the ability to do.) To go further with this, ‘meta’ above means “beyond” and in Greek ‘’meta’’ means “beside.”</p>
        <p>‘Beyond’ in Greek (peran) means “on the other side &amp; across” &amp; is used with the definite article, signifying the region beyond.” ‘Region’ in Greek (chora) means “a space lying between two limits.” (This can mean in our world and time the outer space distance between Earth &amp; the Pleiades, but also the connection being the “doorway-gate” from their invisible dimension, (i.e., the place of keeping, “prison” spoken of earlier and our present visible dimension here in our atmosphere.) The word ‘dimension’ is a point in space (as in the limits between) or in space &amp; time that would be the (portal) time gateway space. The word ‘para’ also means “beyond” and in Greek means “besides” as the word ‘meta’ does.</p>
        <p>The word ‘beside’ in general has a meaning in <em>archaic</em> as being “nearby” – not far away. (With the supernatural ability of these Fallen Angels to travel using a gateway between dimensions, from their perspective, the trip would be most likely “very short!”) {{In 1 Enoch 18:7 there is an expression called the path of the angels<b> which I <em>intuit</em> to be the dimensional doorway between heaven &amp; our earth, so this very thesis Richard is presenting would give some type of credence to this idea, although it is impossible to prove by today’s scientific method. This is always the <em>rub</em> when you try to connect dots spiritually; this is the reason that faith is so important – but a reasoned faith is not beyond our capability to figure out since God has given us all that is necessary to love Him - </b>so we are without excuse!<b>}} Did you know that the word ‘near’ in general has a meaning of “within a short distance or interval in space or time” [?] An interval is a space between two points. So these Fallen Angels travel here through a portal, are in control and occupy the “fire” which are the shining brilliant objects, and have the ability to change shapes and forms into whatever” alien-like creature” they wish to – supernaturally! They can appear wherever they wish in their character (as Grays, Reptilians, etc.,) and are able to function as that character to further deceive us into believing they are ‘’real’’ aliens. In short, they have the ability to make that “creature” function as if it had a nature all of its own – {{reflecting </b>the perfect façade<b> with few the wiser!}}
        <p>The next part of VERSE TWO states “They made men profane, and caused them to err.” The word ‘men’ here symbolizes mankind over the years. ‘Profane’ means that they (the Fallen Angels) “made” (i.e. shaped mankind) to be non-religious &amp; unclean before God, through deception, with man believing the lies. ‘Err’ means “by teaching deceitful falsehoods, disclosing harmful knowledge through chosen abductees (“receivers”) who transmit so-called alien messages which are supposed to contain helpful spiritual truth, yet is fed to us as poisonous ones – directly in opposition to God’s own word. {In chapter nine of “THE <em>CURS</em>-ED NET,” entitled ‘Show &amp; Tell,’ it becomes painfully obvious that that is what psychics &amp; mediums’ function is: to convince the masses of humanity that the mediums can talk to dead people when, in fact, they are talking to familiar spirits.<b>}} Through these teachings over the centuries, generations of abductees would gain false truth of a race or races of false beings who are portrayed by evil spirits &amp; Fallen Angels, only to do man harm by turning him away from God. {{This is what I personally believed happened with the ‘DOGON TRIBE’ phenomenon: This tribe received knowledge about the Sirius double star system that was very accurate, and they could not possibly have known the information…but the Fallen Angels (who according to ENOCH, chapter 8, schooled men in the knowledge of astronomy and astrology,) so it does not take a genius to figure out that this tribe was being given information to get them to adore these same <em>cast down</em> beings and Oannes was posing as one of these Fallen Angels as a disguised ET god! CF. “THE SIRIUS MYSTERY” by Robert Temple for <em>the ostensible</em> details of this. It’s a beautiful story but a <em>better</em> façade! Once you connect the Enochian dots, even the most obtuse will eventually see the façade for what it really is, since the DOG-STAR will have opened the curtain symbolically, and the wizard is unmasked for whom he really is – symbolically, of course!}}
        <p>Do you know that the word ‘err’ in ‘’archaic’’ means “to stray” and in Latin “to wander” [?] Remember JUDE 13 in the Bible, and the expression “wandering stars” where Jude is using to symbolize the Fallen Angels ~~ and remember that ‘wander’ in Greek means “deceit” (as in deceitful angels.) No wonder they have caused men to err. If one is to believe in the word of God – who loves us – then this knowledge is power – the power of the truth of scripture, but having His Son Jesus Christ as your savior is the ultimate power** that these Fallen Angels have no chance against those who believe in God’s word and whose savior is Jesus Christ. The Fallen Angels’ direction leads to a second death (eternal death) but Christ’s direction in our lives leads to everlasting life and peace from those masking as deceptive ‘aliens.’</p>

Using the Greek meaning (phrenapatao) under the word ‘deceive’ we have the meaning “to deceive in one’s mind.” ‘Influence’ is having the power to “affect” a person or course of events (as the UFO phenomenon does.) To further show that these Fallen Angels are connected to the UFOs, we uncover the following:

<p>by Richard Stout</p>
<p>REVELATION 13:18: <em>This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man’s number. His number is 666.</em></p>
<p>Firstly, I want the reader to be aware that there is a comma after the word ‘beast,’ which means it indicates a separation of ideas within the structure of a sentence. So calculate the number of the beast is one idea, and then for its “man’s number,” is another idea. There is a separation here that is very important. It is <b>not saying</b> to calculate the number of a man. NO! It is saying to calculate the number of the beast. <em>Then it says</em> for it is man’s number (plural!) Therefore MANKIND’S # &amp; the beast’s # of 666 are <b>the same number!</b></p>
<p>All of these non-believers who did not accept Christ as their Lord &amp; Savior, have become <b>one with the beast</b> and therefore part of the beast. The following key word analysis will show the breakdown of this.</p>
<p>We start with the word ‘calculate’ which generally means “to evaluate the numerical value of” (as in 666.) The word ‘numerical’ means “relating to a number or series of numbers” (again 666) as a designated number. To ‘designate’ is “to give a name or title to,” which in this case the 666 represents the name &amp; number of the beast as a whole. <b>666</b> is the name &amp; title of the whole beast of which there are three who make up the one. ‘Designate’ in Latin means “to mark” (which may allude to <em>the mark of the beast</em> perhaps.) The word ‘title’ is an “identifying” name – a descriptive name, an “epithet.”</p>
<p>An ‘epithet’ is a term used to characterize a person or thing (the whole beast.) To ‘characterize’ is “to describe the qualities or peculiararities of;” it also means a “distinctive mark.” So the number 666 is evaluated to hold symbolic meaning for the character &amp; qualities of the beast. Its attributes are shown in REVELATION 13:16, 13:7, &amp; 13:13-15. </p>
<p>The beast will be as evil as evil can be. He will possess supernatural power (REV. 13:13) and anyone who does not worship the beast will be killed (REV. 20:3.) <b>666</b> is his name which holds the sum of his character, and is the total # of the beast. The WHOLE beast – not just the Antichrist, reflects that each number <b>6</b> represents a beast. Remember 666 is NOT the number of a man: <em>it is the number of a beast</em> (symbolically) which includes mankind.</p>
<p>The FIRST beast here is the Antichrist mentioned as the first beast in REV. 13:12. In REV. 13:11, <em>another</em> beast – a second beast is mentioned with two horns. He is the <b>FALSE PROPHET.</b> So the word <b>beast</b> is a culmination of the first &amp; second beast, as well as a third beast. WHO IS THE THIRD BEAST?</p>
<p>Let’s look at REVELATION 13:18, where the word ‘beast’ is the culmination of all the beasts , (one &amp; two) as well as the third beat. The beast hence is not one individual person, and the Bible makes this clear (REVELATION 13.) The Beast out of the sea is the Antichrist (also known as the first beast, per 13:12.) REVELATION 13:11 mentions another beast out of the earth with two horns; this is the second beast, but there is a third. The second Beast is the False Prophet (of REV. 19:20 &amp; 20:10.) To find the third Beast, we must look at REV. 13:18 (NIV) that states,</p>
<p>“If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast,” (and the comma means a separate idea) –so continuing, “for it is man’s (as a plural of mankind) number.” How does mankind become the third beast? It contains all those people who accept <b>the mark of the beast</b> (the Antichrist) and who embody the number <b>666,</b> and therefore who worship him with an undying spirit. All these unbelievers have become part of the beast themselves, where 666 is the number &amp; name of the entire beast; therefore it stands for the following:</p>
<p>1) 6 – the Antichrist<br />
2) 6 – the False Prophet<br />
3) 6 – Mankind – as unbelievers.</p>
<p>Remember, ‘six’ is the number of man – mankind, and being that the Antichrist &amp; False Prophet are also human beings (possessed) their numbers are also ‘six.’ REV. 13:18 states in one idea the number of the beast, for it is <em>also</em> man’s number, and his number is <b>666</b> - so 666 stands for the entire beast – and therefore mankind must be included.</p>
<p>As the true God of the Bible contain three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, so shall this beast portray deceivingly its own form with <em>three aspects</em> to it. The Antichrist is the first beast, so he will portray the Father. The False Prophet is the second beast so he will portray the Son (Christ.) The third beast will be the unholy spirit <em>of mankind</em> (all those who accept the mark of the beast and worship him; therefore they become part of this beast. </p>
<p>This unholy spirit of these unbelievers will portray the Holy Spirit. He is now throughout the world living within all of Christ’s true believers – His real church. The unholy spirit of mankind is also accompanied by evil spirits who also dwell within the unbelievers, which further contributes to the evil of the unholy spirit of the unbelievers.</p>

<p>1) 6 – the Antichrist<br />
2) 6 – the False Prophet<br />
3) 6 – Mankind – as unbelievers.</p>
<p>Remember, ‘six’ is the number of man – mankind, and being that the Antichrist &amp; False Prophet are also human beings (possessed) their numbers are also ‘six.’ REV. 13:18 states in one idea the number of the beast, for it is <em>also</em> man’s number, and his number is <b>666</b> - so 666 stands for the entire beast – and therefore mankind must be included.</p>
<p>As the true God of the Bible contain three persons, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, so shall this beast portray deceivingly its own form with <em>three aspects</em> to it. The Antichrist is the first beast, so he will portray the Father. The False Prophet is the second beast so he will portray the Son (Christ.) The third beast will be the unholy spirit <em>of mankind</em> (all those who accept the mark of the beast and worship him; therefore they become part of this beast. </p>
<p>This unholy spirit of these unbelievers will portray the Holy Spirit. He is now throughout the world living within all of Christ’s true believers – His real church. The unholy spirit of mankind is also accompanied by evil spirits who also dwell within the unbelievers, which further contributes to the evil of the unholy spirit of the unbelievers.</p>
