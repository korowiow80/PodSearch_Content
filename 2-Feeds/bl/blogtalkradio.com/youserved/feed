Chad Robichaux & Toby Nunn will appear during hour two. Eric is a past guest and author of several books, to include "The only thing worth dying for". He has a new book out called Fearless. FEARLESS is the story of a man of extremes, whose determination was fueled by faith, family, and the love of a woman. It&rsquo;s about a man who waged a war against his own worst impulses and persevered to reach the top tier of the U.S. military. Always the first to volunteer for the most dangerous assignments, Adam&rsquo;s final act of bravery led to the ultimate sacrifice. Chad (former Marine and current MMA fighter) and Toby (past guest, former Soldier, Author and Documentary Star) are joining us to discuss the MIghty Oaks Wounded Warrior Foundation. Born out of calling of the Lord through Isaiah 61, The Mighty Oaks Wounded Warrior Foundation is a Christian-based nonprofit organization committed to mending the brokenhearted men of our nation with a specific calling to help young wounded veterans and their families. It is our goal to help these Wounded Warriors find a new life purpose after enduring hardship through their service to our great country. Our programs focus on a Spiritual Based Healing to the heart of the warrior; along with training them in reintegration skills through 3 separate programs held in the isolated and beautiful high mountains of Westcliffe, Colorado. The Mighty Oaks 10 and 6 day programs focus on dealing with Combat Trauma, Mens Character, and Family Support for Combat Trauma Spouses and Family Members. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military/'>military</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/eric-blehm/'>Eric Blehm</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/eric-blehm.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/eric-blehm.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/chad-robichaux/'>Chad Robichaux</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chad-robichaux.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/chad-robichaux.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/toby-nunn/'>Toby Nunn</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/toby-nunn.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/toby-nunn.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military-news/'>military news</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military-news.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military-news.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ This week we will be joined by Eric Blehm during the first hour.

Blake is the author of A Different View: Travels with Team Easy, Iraq 2007. Rather than combat, this book is about the day-to-day life with troops in Iraq. The focus is on the 90-99 percent of the time that is tedium or boredom, rather than the one percent that is the focus of most photographs seen on the news. Dave will join us on behalf of Liberty Run Marines Group. On April 16-21, 2012 a group of runners representing combat veterans and wounded warriors from Beirut, Lebanon to the current campaigns in Iraqi and Afghanistan, will run from Jersey City, NJ to Jacksonville, NC to honor the 29 year anniversary of the Beirut Embassy bombing on April 18, 1983. The 600+ mile run will pause 63 minutes, one minute for every victim of the deadly attack, beginning at the time of the attack. At the completion of the run on the morning of Saturday, April 21, a commemoration ceremony will take place at the Beirut Memorial with a Wreath Presentation. The runners will be be welcomed at the completion of their run by a Chrome and Fire Salute with a bike and car show following the ceremony. Doug is the creator of the popular character Earthworm Jim, childrens book author, and very accomplished artist. Doug will auction an Earthworm Jim piece at Dallas Comicon in May 2012 to benefit Wounded Warrior Project.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military/'>military</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/blake-powers/'>blake powers</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blake-powers.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/blake-powers.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/liberty-run-marines-group/'>liberty run marines group</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/liberty-run-marines-group.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/liberty-run-marines-group.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/support-the-troops/'>support the troops</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/doug-tennapel/'>doug tennapel</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/doug-tennapel.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/doug-tennapel.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ We will be joined by Blake Powers, Rose Phillips, and Doug TenNapel tonight.

Blake is the author of A Different View: Travels with Team Easy, Iraq 2007. Rather than combat, this book is about the day-to-day life with troops in Iraq. The focus is on the 90-99 percent of the time that is tedium or boredom, rather than the one percent that is the focus of most photographs seen on the news. Dave will join us on behalf of Liberty Run Marines Group. On April 16-21, 2012 a group of runners representing combat veterans and wounded warriors from Beirut, Lebanon to the current campaigns in Iraqi and Afghanistan, will run from Jersey City, NJ to Jacksonville, NC to honor the 29 year anniversary of the Beirut Embassy bombing on April 18, 1983. The 600+ mile run will pause 63 minutes, one minute for every victim of the deadly attack, beginning at the time of the attack. At the completion of the run on the morning of Saturday, April 21, a commemoration ceremony will take place at the Beirut Memorial with a Wreath Presentation. The runners will be be welcomed at the completion of their run by a Chrome and Fire Salute with a bike and car show following the ceremony. Doug is the creator of the popular character Earthworm Jim, childrens book author, and very accomplished artist. Doug will auction an Earthworm Jim piece at Dallas Comicon in May 2012 to benefit Wounded Warrior Project.</itunes:summary><itunes:duration>02:37:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/youserved/2012/04/18/you-served-radio.mp3" fileSize="37566926" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/youserved/2012/04/18/you-served-radio.wma" fileSize="37566926" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>You Served</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>military,blake powers,liberty run marines group,support the troops,doug tennapel,BlogTalkRadio, Blog Talk Radio</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Episode #190 - Blake Powers, Dave English, Doug TenNapel</itunes:subtitle><itunes:image href="http://cdn.btrcdn.com/pics/showpics/large/abc23d55-9c4a-439c-b042-f0cf077a7cf9vamc-youserved-logo.jpg" /></item><item><title>Episode #189 - Maryanne Michael and Rick J.

Don received his BS degree in Biology and Art at Birmingham-Southern College in 1981, paying his way with a nightclub act as a comic ventriloquist. Initially he enrolled in art classes as a respite from the rigors of premedical studies. Soon, however, he was exposed to the process of composite imagery, and began exploring techniques in ballpoint drawing. Don continued to pursue artistic interests as a hobby during medical training at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. After receiving his M.D. in 1985, Dr. Stewart moved north to Minnesota, to complete an internship in surgery at the Mayo Clinic. The lifestyle of a surgical resident proved, however, to be at odds with his creative side. By years end, Don opted to discontinue his medical studies, after accepting awards for both short fiction and poetry, and publishing his first two composite drawings. He has since worked as a graphic artist, writer, and creative consultant through his company, DS Art. Recently, Don has completed a Marine Corps themed composite drawing and is now working on an Army themed composite drawing. During the second hour we will be joined by Jaeson Parsons of Graffiti of War. Jason &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; Parsons was born in Chicago, IL. Before joining the military he spent ten years in the global derivative markets, ending his career as Director of Institutional Sales for a Chicago brokerage firm. In June 2005 he joined the Army as a Combat Medic; by November he deployed to Ar Ramadi, Iraq with the 54th Engineer Battalion. In 2009 he was medically discharged (honorable) and now he is a full time student at West Virginia University. Doc is an original collaborator and director of operations for the Graffiti of War project as well as the Vice Chairman of the Graffiti of War Foundation.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military/'>military</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/iraq/'>iraq</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/afghanistan/'>afghanistan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/support-the-troops/'>support the troops</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military-news/'>military news</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military-news.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military-news.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Tonight on You Served Radio we will be joined by doctor turned artist Don Stewart.

camosock.com. The CAMOSOCK&reg;, Military Christmas Stocking, was designed to become a true keepsake for the Soldier, Marine, Sailor, Airmen, Coast Guardsmen or National Guardsmen that receives one. Displaying the stocking will become a wonderful addition to any familys Christmas Holiday traditions. All sourcing, labor and manufacturing are 100% Made in the USA. In the second hour we have two guests. Retired SF soldier and owner of Professionalsoldiers.com, and Chef John Defienze will be on to talk about a recent trip they made over to Afghanistan with 4 other chefs to cook Thanksgiving dinner for the forward-deployed troops. Master Sergeant (Ret) Jeff Hinton is a seventeen year veteran of the Special Forces with three years in the 82nd Airborne Division Infantry. Unit assignments included the 1-505th Airborne Infantry Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group, Special Mission Unit, a combat tour with Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT) Desert Storm, 1st Special Forces Group and culminating in a staff position with Special Forces Command. Chef John Deflieze is the chef de cuisine at Technique, the student-run restaurant of Le Cordon Blue College of Culinary Arts in Scottsdale. Before joining Le Cordon Bleu, Chef Deflieze held a variety of positions from saucier to executive chef at resorts and restaurants in Scottsdale, Ariz. A certified chef with the American Culinary Federation, Deflieze is a L&rsquo;Espirit d&rsquo; Excellence Award recipient, a two-time winner of the Crystal Apple Award and a nominee for Educator of the Year. Jeff Hinton recently graduated from Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts in Scottsdale and decided to put his new culinary degree to work by going back to the battle fields and swapping out MREs for a traditional Thanksgiving for more than 1500 active troops with his teacher, John Defineze.

from the documentary Ride For Lance. Chief Petty Officer Lance Vaccaro, a United States Navy SEAL, gave his life for his country in 2008. On June 17th, 2010, four riders and a support team, all friends of Lance, launched the The Lance Vaccaro Memorial Ride and rode from Virginia Beach to Alaska and back in his honor. They covered 12,000 miles in 31 days, and met folks from large cities and small towns across North America, including active duty troops, veterans, and the families of deployed and fallen troops who shared their stories of pride and heartbreak. A film crew accompanied them along the way and captured over 100 hours of footage, and nearly 30,000 high definition photographs. In the second hour we will have more returning guests. Bob Goodman and Wally Ward from Get it Done Consulting will be on to talk about the 2nd graduating class of Train-Mentor-Train. http://www.getitdoneconsulting.com/ <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military/'>military</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/iraq/'>iraq</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/afghanistan/'>afghanistan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/navy-seals/'>Navy Seals</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/navy-seals.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/navy-seals.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military-news/'>military news</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military-news.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military-news.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Tonight we have returning guest, Scott Mactavish from the documentary Ride For Lance.

One of the most critical battles of the Afghan War is now revealed as never before. Lions of Kandahar is an inside account from the unique perspective of an active-duty U.S. Army Special Forces commander, an unparalled warrior with multiple deployments to the theater who has only recently returned from combat there. Southern Afghanistan was slipping away. That was clear to then-Captain Rusty Bradley as he began his third tour of duty there in 2006. The Taliban and their allies were infiltrating everywhere, poised to reclaim Kandahar Province, their strategically vital onetime capital. To stop them, the NATO coalition launched Operation Medusa, the largest offensive in its history. The battlefield was the Panjwayi Valley, a densely packed warren of walled compounds that doubled neatly as enemy bunkers, lush orchards, and towering marijuana stands, all laced with treacherous irrigation ditches. A mass exodus of civilians heralded the carnage to come. In the second hour will be Vic Freudenberger who is a Marine Veteran of WWII and Korea. Vic joined the Marines 73 years ago this month. While in the Marines, Vic found out they began experimenting with Paratroopers because of the success the Germans were having pre-war and then in 1940. Vic was then in the attached to the 1st Marine Division and were sent to the Solomons an enemy airfield on Guadalcanal. Not just a veteran of WWII, Vic was also a veteran of the Korean War.

The producer of the album is George Daly former VP of Columbia Records and Elektra Records. The album is titled "Hero" and the first single release is also the title track "Hero". The record label at first wanted to do a more traditional music video for "Hero" but the band members decided they wanted to dedicate this music video to the soldiers who sacrifice for their country. They felt this could be the rare opportunity to entertain people with a video on MTV an VH1 and across the internet with a real message. A video that would raise peoples awareness about the sacrifices thousands of soldiers are making for our country. They are raising funds to create the video through kickstarter.com and other grassroots efforts. In the second hour we will talk to Micah Clark, the founder of Camp Patriot. Camp Patriot exists to take Disabled U.S. Veterans on outdoor adventures. The task is monumental. Today, there are over 2.3 million disabled veterans in the U.S. The number of disabled men and women veterans is growing with each day the war on terror continues. These brave veterans sacrificed much in order to ensure our safety and freedom. All of these veterans had dreams about the future, but many of those dreams were lost due to injuries suffered in the line of duty. Outdoor activities that they hoped to do in the future have vanished due to their disability. We want to thank these veterans by showing them that with the right help, they can again enjoy the great outdoors. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/camp-patriot/'>Camp Patriot</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/camp-patriot.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/camp-patriot.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/iraq/'>iraq</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/afghanistan/'>afghanistan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/support-the-troops/'>support the troops</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/jon-collins-band/'>Jon Collins Band</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jon-collins-band.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/jon-collins-band.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[ First up tonight is The Jon Collins Band is backed by About Records in San Francisco and we have distribution through Universal Records.

This visit to Normandy is the culmination of an intensive program National History Day offers for students and teachers called the Albert H. Small Student and Teacher Institute. The program is dedicated to the events of the Normandy invasion during WWII &ndash; ensuring students today have an understanding of the individuals who served in that war and the significance of their sacrifice.

The program will launch in Washington, D.C. on June 18 with a dinner at Ft. McNair featuring a keynote address from one of the beach masters at Omaha.

RAISE SUPPORT FOR TAPS George Kraehe Has Completed Marathons in 14 States to Date, Runs to Honor America’s Fallen. Running 50 marathons in 50 states may seem like an insurmountable task, but George Kraehe is up to the challenge. The attorney and National Guardsman is running to remember America’s fallen military heroes and to raise support for TAPS, the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors. TAPS provides comfort and care to anyone grieving the death of a military service member. SGT Leo Dunson is a Operation Iraqi Freedom Veteran of the U.S. Army that has incorporated his experiences in the military and in life into his music career.His first album “Soldier Music,” set him aside in a different category besides just being called an average rapper. Songs like "If I Don't Make It Home." A song letter written from Iraq to his family and friends talking to them about his last wishes if he wasn't to make it back home from war. Other songs like "Over There" and " My 1st Kill" where he tells in detail about the first time he had to kill someone at war. Sgt Dunsons' music shows a lot of emotions, its shows us the good, the bad and the ugly side of what it is like to be a Soldier.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military/'>military</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/iraq/'>iraq</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/afghanistan/'>afghanistan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/support-the-troops/'>support the troops</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/national-guard/'>National Guard</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/national-guard.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/national-guard.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[NATIONAL GUARDSMAN PLANS TO RUN 50 MARATHONS IN 50 STATES TO RAISE SUPPORT FOR TAPS George Kraehe Has Completed Marathons in 14 States to Date, Runs to Honor America’s Fallen.

SGT Leo Dunson is a Operation Iraqi Freedom Veteran of the U.S. Army that has incorporated his experiences in the military and in life into his music career.His first album “Soldier Music,” set him aside in a different category besides just being called an average rapper. Songs like "If I Don't Make It Home." A song letter written from Iraq to his family and friends talking to them about his last wishes if he wasn't to make it back home from war. Other songs like "Over There" and " My 1st Kill" where he tells in detail about the first time he had to kill someone at war. Sgt Dunsons' music shows a lot of emotions, its shows us the good, the bad and the ugly side of what it is like to be a Soldier.</itunes:summary><itunes:duration>02:02:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/youserved/2011/03/23/episode-133-george-kraehe-leo-dunson.mp3" fileSize="29091550" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/youserved/2011/03/23/episode-133-george-kraehe-leo-dunson.wma" fileSize="29091550" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>You Served</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>military,iraq,afghanistan,support the troops,National Guard,BlogTalkRadio, Blog Talk Radio</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Episode #133- George Kraehe, Leo Dunson</itunes:subtitle></item><item><title>Episode #132- Sons of Anarchy, Adam Gordon - Mar 16,2011</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/youserved/2011/03/16/episode-132-sons-of-anarchy-adam-gordon</link><description><![CDATA[First up will be 'Sons of Anarchy' stars Theo Rossi (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0744331/) and Kim Coates (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0167649/).

In the second hour we will be talking to Adam Gordon. Adam was a soldier featured in the book Landigal by James Christ. James is a past guest of You Served Radio and an accomplished author who has written 5 books about ETTs and large but mostly unknown battles in Afghanistan.

I never stopped sending boxes and his legacy grew into a not-for-profit which, to date, has sent over 400,000 lbs of supplies and support to all branches of the military.</itunes:summary><itunes:duration>02:01:00</itunes:duration><media:group><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/youserved/2011/03/09/episode-131-jacobs-light-foundation.mp3" fileSize="28816950" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/youserved/2011/03/09/episode-131-jacobs-light-foundation.wma" fileSize="28816950" type="audio/x-ms-wma" /></media:group><itunes:author>You Served</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:keywords>military,iraq,afghanistan,support the troops,Jacobs Light Foundation,BlogTalkRadio, Blog Talk Radio</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Episode #131- Jacobs Light Foundation</itunes:subtitle></item><item><title>Episode #130 - Scott Mactavish, David Bellavia - Mar 02,2011</title><link>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/youserved/2011/03/02/episode-130--scott-mactavish-david-bellavia</link><description><![CDATA[Scott Mactavish enlisted at 17, attended NYU Film School on the GI Bill, and spent the first decade of his career working on very big (and very bad) Hollywood films. Following the attacks of 9/11, he re-focused on stories of honor, courage and commitment, including the story of Navy SEAL LT Michael Murphy, which is now in development. Scott is the owner of Mactavish Pictures which is a motion picture development and production company founded by filmmaker, best-selling author and U. S. Navy veteran Scott Mactavish. They specialize in original long-form content, including non-fiction television shows, documentaries and feature films. Their projects have appeared on major broadcast networks, including PBS, HBO, Comcast, Pseudo Comedy Network, and ESPN, and at film festivals and theatrical screenings around the world. Next up will be past guest and good friend of Troy, CJ, and Marcus, Mr. David Bellavia. David is the author of House to House and is a valor-award winning Iraq vet. As the co-founder of Vets for Freedom, Bellavia's been a stalwart advocate of conservative policies and his organization has spent millions helping elect Republicans. In 2008 he stepped aside from a run for the 26th district for Congress from NY to let Chris Lee run (at the request of the state GOP leadership). Now that the seat is vacant from Chris Lee resigning, David is throwing his hat back into the ring to fill that seat and this time without the NY GOP's support behind him. David has also been recommended for the Medal of Honor from his actions in Fallujah during the offensive of November 2004 and that recommendation is still pending. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/david-bellavia/'>David Bellavia</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/david-bellavia.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/david-bellavia.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/house-to-house/'>House to House</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/house-to-house.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/house-to-house.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/congress/'>Congress</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/congress.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/congress.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/navy/'>navy</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/navy.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/navy.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/army/'>army</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/army.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/army.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Scott Mactavish enlisted at 17, attended NYU Film School on the GI Bill, and spent the first decade of his career working on very big (and very bad) Hollywood films.

Beginning in the early 1990’s, dozens of homeless veterans programs have come into existence across the United States. Street Vets is the culmination of a year-long chronicling of the life and times of ten men living at one of these programs: The Homeless Veterans Fellowship - a transitional housing program aimed at assisting homeless Veterans into self sufficiency. The film provides a remarkably candid view of the long-term scars of war and personal tragedy that, in many cases, have led to alcohol, drug abuse…and life on the streets.

They are also always giving military discounts as well. The inn is a favorite among the top Savannah inn hotels in the historic district, the easy-living hotel mansion offers a hotel lodging alternative. Accommodations at Azalea Inn and Gardens afford a happy introduction to playful southern charms, catching the less-hurried pace of Savannah. The Savannah guest guest may sashay over to Forsyth Park for a walk under the oaks; mosey over to Leoci’s Italian Trattoria for an oven-fired thin crust pizza and salad, or gallivant through beautiful Savannah squares, walking up Abercorn Street to a nostalgic Savannah favorite—Leopold’s Ice Cream. Check out this beautiful place at http://azaleainn.com/ Gina Elise, Michael Z. Williamson and Blake Powers will be joining us to give all our listeners an udpate on how the Operation Fight Post Holiday Blues trip to Landstuhl, Germany turned out. Overall the stats look great with over 150 books signed and given out by Michael, and over 100 troops served a great meal by these folks, Ellen Adams and many USO volunteers. However there are a lot more great stats and stories to share so be sure to tune in and hear it directly from those that participated. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/azalea-inn/'>Azalea Inn</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/azalea-inn.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/azalea-inn.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/operation-fight-post-holiday-blues/'>Operation Fight Post Holiday Blues</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/operation-fight-post-holiday-blues.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/operation-fight-post-holiday-blues.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/veterans-day/'>Veterans Day</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/veterans-day.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/veterans-day.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/support-the-troops/'>support the troops</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/wounded-warriors/'>wounded warriors</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/wounded-warriors.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/wounded-warriors.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Teresa Jacobson of Azalea Inn and Gardens will come on the show to talk about how her gorgeous Bed and Breakfast gave vets a fee night at the Inn on Veterans Day 2010.

The website will allow the storyteller to create a written account of their experience and to include video, audio, photos, or art they may have. Storytellers receive no money for their efforts. However, 100% of all donations made on the website will be given to the Wounded Warrior Project, a non-profit organization created to, “honor and empower wounded warriors; raise awareness and enlist the public’s aid for the needs of severely injured service men and women; help severely injured service members aid and assist each other; and to provide unique, direct programs and services to meet the needs of severely injured service members” Danfung Dennis who is the is the Director and Filmmaker of the film, HELL AND BACK AGAIN. The story follows the US Marines Echo Company, 2/8 Marine Regiment, as they launch a major assault on a Taliban stronghold in Southern Afghanistan. Within hours of being dropped deep behind enemy lines, Sergeant Nathan Harris’s unit is attacked from all sides. Cut off and surrounded, the Marines fight a ghostlike enemy and experience immense hostility from displaced villagers. Frustration grows on both sides, as any common ground, or success, seems elusive. The parallel story begins with Sergeant Harris’s return home to his wife in the US, after he is severely injured. He’s in terrible physical pain, and becomes addicted to his pain medication. But his psychological pain may be worse, as he attempts to reconcile the immense gulf between his experiences at war, and the terrifying normalcy of life at home. These two stories intertwine to communicate both the extraordinary drama of war and the no less shocking experience of returning home.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military/'>military</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/iraq/'>iraq</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/afghanistan/'>afghanistan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/support-the-troops/'>support the troops</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/marines/'>Marines</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/marines.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/marines.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nathan Tierney - “The Frontlines” website www.thefrontlines.com provides veterans, family members and friends, a venue for telling a story about their experiences while serving in any branch of the armed forces, to include the Coast Guard and National Guard.

He served in the Kadhimiya District of west Baghdad from 2008 to 2009 with the 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment of the Army’s 1st Infantry Division--the storied “Big Red One.” In Kadhimiya, Matt coordinated 1-18 IN’s “non-lethal” operations, which included management of his battalion’s Commander Emergency Response Program (CERP) projects, local governance support, and his battalion’s information and psychological operations. In this capacity, Matt oversaw the expenditure of $13 million in CERP funds on development projects like micro-grants, school refurbishments, and solar-power street lights throughout west Baghdad, projects that were planned and executed in partnership with local Iraqi government leaders. As a field representative for Spirit of America, Matt will live and work alongside Marine units in Helmand province, Afghanistan where he will help the Marines identify humanitarian and economic development needs on the ground and channel American private sector support to meet those needs.

He served in the Kadhimiya District of west Baghdad from 2008 to 2009 with the 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment of the Army’s 1st Infantry Division--the storied “Big Red One.” In Kadhimiya, Matt coordinated 1-18 IN’s “non-lethal” operations, which included management of his battalion’s Commander Emergency Response Program (CERP) projects, local governance support, and his battalion’s information and psychological operations. In this capacity, Matt oversaw the expenditure of $13 million in CERP funds on development projects like micro-grants, school refurbishments, and solar-power street lights throughout west Baghdad, projects that were planned and executed in partnership with local Iraqi government leaders. As a field representative for Spirit of America, Matt will live and work alongside Marine units in Helmand province, Afghanistan where he will help the Marines identify humanitarian and economic development needs on the ground and channel American private sector support to meet those needs.

(http://www.gallantfew.org) is a 501c3 non-profit dedicated to easing the transition of a warrior from active military service to a peaceful and fulfilling civilian life. We focus on these major areas: social networking, professional networking, emotional support and physical assistance. Ted Carney is the founder of "The Honor Buckle" (www.honorbuckle.com) is intended to be a gift for military service men and women. It is the highest civilian gift of honor that you can give to one of our citizens that have put their life on the line for our country. Proceeds from Honor Buckle go to benefit disabled veteran organizations and nonprofit organizations that support our service men and women. Each Honor Buckle is individually handmade by a custom jeweler in the USA. They are made in groups of 250 at a time, and take 8-9 weeks to complete. Jan Scruggs, founder at president of Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. Scruggs was a wounded and decorated Vietnam War veteran, having served in the 199th Light Infantry Brigade of the U.S. Army. He felt a memorial would serve as a healing device for a different kind of wound – that inflicted on our national psyche by the long and controversial war. In May 1979, Scruggs took $2,800 of his own money and launched the effort. Gradually, he gained the support of other Vietnam veterans in persuading Congress to provide a prominent location on federal property somewhere in Washington, D.C.. After a difficult struggle, Congress responded and the site chosen was on the Mall near the Lincoln Memorial.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/vietnam-veterans-memorial-fund/'>vietnam veterans memorial fund</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/vietnam-veterans-memorial-fund.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/vietnam-veterans-memorial-fund.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/gallant-few/'>Gallant Few</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/gallant-few.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/gallant-few.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military-supporting-charities/'>Military Supporting Charities</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military-supporting-charities.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military-supporting-charities.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/support-the-troops/'>support the troops</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/honor-buckle/'>Honor Buckle</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/honor-buckle.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/honor-buckle.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Karl Monger is the founder of Gallant Few (http://www.gallantfew.org) is a 501c3 non-profit dedicated to easing the transition of a warrior from active military service to a peaceful and fulfilling civilian life.

Aside from his time in the Army, Rockie has always been a professional musician. It was inevitable that his talent would eventually attract the attention of industry insiders and in the Fall of 2005, the most powerful man in the music industry, Universal Music Group worldwide Chairman, Doug Morris, saw Rockie perform. Morris signed Rockie to a record contract on the spot. A father of three daughters, Rockie is dedicated and hardworking. He is either writing music (he co-wrote all of the original songs on the new album and his Universal Records debut), making music (in his Nashville based recording studio) or performing music. He has also earned a reputation for being one of the nicest guys in showbiz, always willing to help out and never leaving before shaking the last hand and signing the final autograph. Even in the busiest times, Rockie always finds time to give back. In 2004, he co-founded a Minnesota-base charitable organization called Tribute To The Troops, which recently celebrated its 7th year and has donated over $200,000 to troops related causes. Joining us in the second hour is Richard Lowry, author of New Dawn: The Battles for Fallujah. Richard is also the author of "The Gulf War Chronicles", "US Marine in Iraq: Operation Iraqi Freedom, 2003" and the award winning ""Marines in the Garden of Eden". <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military/'>military</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/iraq/'>iraq</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/afghanistan/'>afghanistan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/richard-lowry/'>Richard Lowry</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/richard-lowry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/richard-lowry.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/rockie-lynne/'>Rockie Lynne</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/rockie-lynne.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/rockie-lynne.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever since he picked up a guitar at age 12 in his hometown of Statesville, NC, playing music has been a central focus of Rockie Lynne’s life.

As far back as he can remember, SFC Hertig always knew he wanted to serve in the military. Although he originally planned on serving in the Marine Corps, in the footsteps of his father and uncle, he ultimately joined the Army in order to be an Infantryman. Was was awarded the Silver Star Medal. We'll also talk with Ryan Brown of Bridge of Sighs. BoS is a great friend of You Served and we'll have a send off interview for their upcoming trip to GTMO. Our last guests will be Scott Beauchamp. The Scott Thomas Beauchamp controversy concerns the publication of a series of diaries by Scott Thomas Beauchamp (b. 1983 St. Louis, Missouri) – a private in the United States Army, serving in the Iraq War, and a member of Alpha Company, 1-18 Infantry, Second Brigade Combat Team, First Infantry Division. In 2007, using the pen name "Scott Thomas", Beauchamp filed three entries in The New Republic about serving at Forward operating base Falcon, Baghdad. These entries concerned alleged misconduct by soldiers, including Beauchamp, in post-invasion Iraq. Several publications and bloggers questioned Beauchamp's statements. The New Republic investigated the statements, first standing by the content of Beauchamp's articles for several months, then concluding that they could no longer stand by this material. A U.S. Army investigation had previously concluded the statements in the material were false.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military/'>military</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/iraq/'>iraq</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/afghanistan/'>afghanistan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/support-the-troops/'>support the troops</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military-news/'>military news</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military-news.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military-news.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[2005 - SFC Michael Hertig.

With the pre-release of the single “These Four Walls,” the band fast began building a fanbase and receive accolades in the U.S. and abroad. “These Four Walls,” written by Mylon while serving in the U.S. Army is easy to relate to by anyone who has gone through periods of both isolation and hope. In August of 2009, the song hit both #1 on the Mevio Music Alley's Hitmaker Podcast from Japan and was the most requested song for October 2009 on Blockhead Internet Radio. 7 Years Today plays music branded “American Heavy Rock.” The focus is creating a song that means something to the listener. Its about being honest and true. The sound is a fusion of hard rock from both modern and past eras, blues-influenced guitar solos, a rhythm section that forms a driving pulse, and a voice somewhere between Layne Staley and Johnny Cash. 7 Years Today can be found online at http://www.7yearstoday.com/ We'll also be joined by Colby Donaldson, Host of History's Top Shot and of Survivor: The Australian Outback and Survivor: Heroes vs. Villans. Sixteen of the nation's most skilled marksmen have been carefully selected to compete for the title. Some have professional shooting experience, some are amateurs--and all will showcase breathtaking timing, speed and accuracy in their quest to win the $100,000 prize package and the title of "Top Shot." The winner will ultimately have to be skilled in everything from muzzle-loading muskets and modern pistols to slingshots and throwing knives. Each week, contenders will face both team and individual elimination challenges until one winner remains. Every challenge will focus on the weapons, technologies and techniques of different historical eras as high-speed HD cameras capture the skillful execution of each test in extreme slow-motion. Top Shot premiers Sunday, June 6, at 10/9c on HISTORY.

Overton, Jr. is the Executive Director Veterans of Modern Warfare (www.vmwusa.org). Veterans of Modern Warfare is the nation's newest national Veterans service organization, focused on mutual assistance to Veterans with military service from 1990 - the time of the Persian Gulf War that ushered in a new era of modern warfare - through the present, including the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Donald D. Overton, Jr. entered active duty in the U.S. Army on 2 February 1988 and upon completion of both Basic Training at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina and Advanced Individual Training at Ft. Gordon, Georgia, he was awarded the MOS of 31K, Combat Signaler. Next was Airborne School and ultimately an assignment to HHC 3rd BN 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment 82nd Airborne Division. In August of 1990 he deployed with the Advance Party of the 82nd Airborne Division to Saudi Arabia in preparation of Operations Desert Shield / Desert Storm.

After throwing the grenade away from his fellow Soldiers before it detonated, he used his own body to shield a Soldier from the blast. Maj Jason Amerine will also join us on You Served Radio. Jason was the A-team commander of ODA 574 which is the subject of the book The Only Thing Worth Dying For. Jason will talk with us about that experience in the opening days of Enduring Freedom, getting to know Hamid Karzai and what the terrible day of Dec 5th, 2001 has meant to him. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military/'>military</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/iraq/'>iraq</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/afghanistan/'>afghanistan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/the-only-thing-worth-dying-for/'>The Only Thing Worth Dying For</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-only-thing-worth-dying-for.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/the-only-thing-worth-dying-for.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ghanzi-providence/'>Ghanzi Providence</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ghanzi-providence.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ghanzi-providence.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></content:encoded><category domain="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">Military</category><comments>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/youserved/2010/02/19/episode-20/#comments</comments><enclosure url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/youserved/2010/02/19/episode-20.mp3" length="29293006" type="audio/mpeg" /><guid>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/youserved/2010/02/19/episode-20</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><itunes:summary>Our first guest will be Maj Troy Scott.

Garry is the acclaimed satirist and comic artist of Doonesbury. We are going to talk to Garry about his strip and some of the characters he has developed since 9/11. We will discuss BD's role mentoring Toggle and the creation of Toggle himself. We will also talk with Garry about his creation and The Sandbox milblog website and book featuring milblogs from many popular bloggers and the efforts he has put forth in raising money for The Fisher House foundation. Last but not least we will talk with him about what it was like for him as a resident of NYC to live through the day of 9/11/01 and how he has seen the city change. Garry will be the only physical guest on tonight as the rest of the night will be dedicated to honoring some of those lost on 9/11. We will read stories of the lives of some of those lost at The Pentagon, at the WTC, and in Pennsylvania. It will be a night to read and reflect on those lives that were taken from us as a country and more importantly from those who loved and knew them.

Our first guest will be Maj Eric Egland. He is a former Republican candidate in 2008 congressional run. Eric Egland is a counter-terrorism consultant to the Department of Defense and is an active military reservist. His experience in national security includes working to defeat terrorism, insurgency and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in operational, analytical, and advisory roles. He was in Saudi Arabia on September 11th, 2001 and has since served in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. His experiences in the Middle East are featured in a Fox News documentary on Iran. He is the founder of Troops Need You, a non-profit organization that continues the American tradition of mobilizing citizens to directly support the troops in Iraq, bypassing the bureaucracies in Washington and Baghdad. The project is part of a plan for victory in Iraq detailed in a book authored by Major Egland, titled The Troops Need You, America: Six Ways to Help Them Win.(www.troopsneedyou.com) We are also happy to be talking to Country music star Mark Wills. We will talk about his new album, "2nd Time Around" and his support of USA Cares. USA Cares exists to provide military families with financial support and other critical resources in their time of need. www.usacares.org We also have Mr. Gary Winkler. Gary is the author of the new book about Abu Ghraib and Lynndie England "TORTURED: Lynndie England, Abu Ghraib and the Photographs that Shocked the World" - LYNNDIE ENGLAND'S ONLY AUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY. In addition to revealing the young Army Reservist's thoughts and feelings about her role in the abuse, the author delves deeper into England's twisted relationship with Corporal Charles Graner, the questionable conduct of the war and the Bush-era torture policies that contributed to the culture of abuse that came to exist at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/mark-wills/'>Mark Wills</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/mark-wills.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/mark-wills.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/usa-cares/'>USA Cares</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/usa-cares.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/usa-cares.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/abu-ghraib/'>Abu Ghraib</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/abu-ghraib.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/abu-ghraib.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/maj-eric-egland/'>Maj Eric Egland</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/maj-eric-egland.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/maj-eric-egland.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military-support/'>Military Support</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military-support.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military-support.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[For our 1-year anniversary show, we're privileged to have a great lineup to celebrate.

Our first guest will be Maj Eric Egland. He is a former Republican candidate in 2008 congressional run. Eric Egland is a counter-terrorism consultant to the Department of Defense and is an active military reservist. His experience in national security includes working to defeat terrorism, insurgency and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in operational, analytical, and advisory roles. He was in Saudi Arabia on September 11th, 2001 and has since served in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. His experiences in the Middle East are featured in a Fox News documentary on Iran. He is the founder of Troops Need You, a non-profit organization that continues the American tradition of mobilizing citizens to directly support the troops in Iraq, bypassing the bureaucracies in Washington and Baghdad. The project is part of a plan for victory in Iraq detailed in a book authored by Major Egland, titled The Troops Need You, America: Six Ways to Help Them Win.(www.troopsneedyou.com) We are also happy to be talking to Country music star Mark Wills. We will talk about his new album, "2nd Time Around" and his support of USA Cares.

We will be discussing what is and what is not considered torture. First up we will have Marine LTC (ret) Neal Puckett. Neal is the attorney for CPT Roger Hill, and this is Neal's second time on You Served Radio. He and Roger were on the show back on May 7th, 2009 when we talked with both of them about Roger's Article-32 hearing. Neal was also the attorney for LTC West and some of the marines accused in the Haditha incident. He has also been involved with a lawsuit against Congressman Murtha. After Neal we will be talking with CPT (ret) Jason Meszaro. Jason is the author of "Interrogation of Morals" that reveals first-hand experience with interrogation techniques used in Afghanistan, which he participated in, and at Gitmo, which he watched. You won't want to miss tonight's show as it will surely be controversial and should help highlight a lot of issues and facts that are being glossed over or completely missed by the media today. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/enhanced-interrogation/'>Enhanced Interrogation</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/enhanced-interrogation.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/enhanced-interrogation.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/torture/'>Torture</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/torture.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/torture.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military/'>Military</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/afghanistan/'>Afghanistan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/iraq/'>Iraq</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tonight's show is a special one where Troy and CJ will be talking with experts on enhanced interrogation, and dealing with the outcome of enhanced interrogation.

Also Tom will be talking with us about the motivation and driving Factors behind the songs “Freedom’s Stain” and “Angry Clouds”. The band recently sent us some signed Angry Cloud CDs to auction on our new You Served store at ebay, which is raising money for The Fisher House charity. We here at You Served are very appreciative of that gesture and we are excited to have Tom on the show tonight. We will also have Mr. Doug Eldridge. Doug is the founder of DLE Sports Management Group (http://www.dlesports.com/) and after growing up as an Army brat with great principles instilled into him he decided to take his physical talents and do something with it. Doug is running 10 marathons in 12 months to raise $100,000 (he calls is the 10-12-100 campaign) for the Wounded Warrior Project. Doug says himself that “It’s a daunting endeavor, but I feel I must give of myself to encourage others to give as well.” You can read about Doug’s travels as he goes from one marathon to another on his blog at http://www.10-12-100.blogspot.com/<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military/'>military</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/iraq/'>iraq</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/afghanistan/'>afghanistan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/support-the-troops/'>support the troops</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/wounded-warrior-project/'>Wounded Warrior Project</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/wounded-warrior-project.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/wounded-warrior-project.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[On tonight’s show we will have Tom Neely from the band, Bridge of Sighs (http://www.bosband.com/) talking with us about their recent tour at Gitmo, what they observed and what they came away from that tour with, and when they are going back.

Doug says himself that “It’s a daunting endeavor, but I feel I must give of myself to encourage others to give as well.” You can read about Doug’s travels as he goes from one marathon to another on his blog at http://www.10-12-100.blogspot.com/<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military/'>military</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/iraq/'>iraq</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/iraq.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/afghanistan/'>afghanistan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/support-the-troops/'>support the troops</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/support-the-troops.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/wounded-warrior-project/'>Wounded Warrior Project</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/wounded-warrior-project.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/wounded-warrior-project.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></content:encoded><category domain="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/">Military</category><comments>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/youserved/2009/05/14/Episode-38/#comments</comments><enclosure url="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/youserved/2009/05/14/Episode-38.mp3" length="30273747" type="audio/mpeg" /><guid>http://www.blogtalkradio.com/youserved/2009/05/14/Episode-38</guid><pubDate>Thu, 14 May 2009 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><itunes:summary>On tonight’s show we will have Tom Neely from the band, Bridge of Sighs (http://www.bosband.com/) talking with us about their recent tour at Gitmo, what they observed and what they came away from that tour with, and when they are going back.

Tobia. P.J. wrote the Washington Post Article exposing the article-32 hearing and the grave injustices being imposed on CPT Hill and 1SG Scott. We are also talking with NY National Guard SGM, Dave Oliver. Dave joined the regular army in 1985 as an Infantryman. He served four years, two in Germany and two in Georgia. After ETS, he joined the New York Army National Guard. Dave has served as a infantry team leader, squad leader, scout platoon section leader, scout platoon sergeant, infantry platoon sergeant, first sergeant and operations sergeant major. Since 9-11 he has deployed for six homeland security missions to include Operation Noble Eagle and Operation Jump Start. In addition Dave has served two tours of duty for Operation Enduring Freedom.

Brandon is an outspoken advocate of soldier's being active in the political process of this country. Brandon wrote the book, "The War I Always Wanted: The Illusion of Glory and the Reality of War", and has served since 2007 as the Vice Chairman of VoteVets.org--a 100,000-member organization dedicated to getting veterans elected to public office. We are also talking with Professor Andrew Lubin, a proud member of the distinguished USMC Combat Correspondents Association, Andrew has spent much of 2006 and 2007 in Iraq, and Afghanistan. Embedded with Marine - Army - National Guard units, he's out in the field with the "boots on the ground," and covering the story with the 0311's and 0811's in Ramadi, Mahmudiyah, and the Khyber Pass who are getting the job done. Prior to those embeds, Andrew was one of only 5 journalists on the beaches in Beirut with the 24 Marine Expeditionary Unit as they evacuated the American refugees, and earlier he was in Okinawa with 12th Marines. Andrew is about to go back to Afghanistan to do another embed so we are touching base with him before he does. In addition to those great guest we are talking to Clint Van Winkle, author of "Soft Spots: A Marine’s Memoir of Combat and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder". SOFT SPOTS moves effortlessly back and forth across time and continents as war scenes in reality are intermixed with war ravages remembered. Van Winkle desperately sought help from the Veteran’s Administration, but each trip to a VA facility would be another maddening adventure into bureaucratic red tape and ineptitude. He discovered it was an indifferent system that gives lip service about their concern for veterans but in reality seems to abandon them. <BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/brandon-friedman/'>Brandon Friedman</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/brandon-friedman.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/brandon-friedman.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/ptsd/'>PTSD</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ptsd.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/ptsd.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/afghanistan/'>afghanistan</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/afghanistan.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/operation-anaconda/'>Operation Anaconda</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/operation-anaconda.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/operation-anaconda.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/andrew-lubin/'>Andrew Lubin</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/andrew-lubin.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/andrew-lubin.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[During this week's show we will be talking with Brandon Friedman, veteran of Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan and the initial invasion force into Iraq.

Amy Bonanno. Amy just returned from a one year tour in Afghanistan as part of Task Force Phoenix. She was the Public Affairs officer for the the southern Afghan region, based out of the volatile Kandahar region. We will be talking about her tour as a PAO, some of the things that happened then, like the prison break, FDD teams, and the famed Nick Meo affair. Also keeping in line with our theme of talking about the challenges of women serving in the military we will probably chat about what challenges and unique issues she saw versus her male counterparts. We'll also be talking with Dana Canedy, author of "A Journal For Jordan". The book is based off the private journal of First Sergeant Charles Monroe King. In the book, 1SG King gives timeless advice from a father to his son in the form of a regular journal.

But, is it affecting our troops who are fighting a multi-front war and maintaining split households? On this show we will be talking to Ken Fisher who is Chairman and CEO of the Fisher House Foundation, a not-for-profit organization that constructs “comfort homes” for families of hospitalized military personnel and veterans. Founded in 1990 by his late uncle Zachary Fisher, the program aids more than 10,000 guest families each year and has saved families more than $80 million. To date, the foundation has built 38 houses at military bases and VA medical centers across the country and overseas, in Landstuhl, Germany. It plans to complete 21 more houses by the end of 2010. We will be talking to Ken about all the great things that Fisher House does and how the American people can help Fisher House help our Warriors and their families. We'll also be talking with Mr. Nathaniel Long, CEO of the VA Mortgage Center. Mr. Long will discuss whether or not Veterans will be affected by the current mortgage crisis and whether now is a good time to buy. Rounding out our line up is Mr. Jeff Rose. Jeff Rose is a Certified Financial Planner and co-founder of Alliance Investment Planning Group. He is also the author of Good Financial Cents, a financial planning and investment blog.

Mr Bucha was a two time All-American swimmer. After graduating from West Point, he was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army. In Phuoc Vinh, Vietnam, Captain Bucha of the 3rd battalion, 187th Infantry, 3rd Brigade 101st Airborne Division led a recon patrol that encountered strong resistance. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions between March 16-19, 1968.He later taught at West Point and became president of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. Most recently he served as a foreign policy adviser to Barack Obama's 2008 successful presidential campaign. We will also have three other very special guests. One is another blogger from the VAMC You Served blog, Claire who writes about life of a military spouse - the hardships, the joys, and everything in between. Kat from Operation Love from Home will be giving us an update on the Christmas Card Drive that she held in Oct and Nov. Last but not least, we will have on Kim Cameron who is a singer/songwriter who recently released a song dedicated to America's Military.

Since 1993, more than 12,500 troops have been discharged under the Clinton-era "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. Could a halt to the policy really solve the military's manning issues? We'll also chat with Scott Kesterson who is deployed with combat troops in Afghanistan. This week's Tribute to Freedom: Staff Sgt. Omar Hernandez of Fort Bliss, Texas, was awarded the prestigious Silver Star Medal and the Purple Heart for risking his personal safety to rescue two teammates from the line of fire while in Iraq in 2007. After having already completed several months of a deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Staff Sgt. Hernandez was on dismounted patrol with two members of the Iraqi National Police when the group came under attack by insurgents. Both men, whom Staff Sgt.

Since 1993, more than 12,500 troops have been discharged under the Clinton-era "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. Could a halt to the policy really solve the military's manning issues? We'll also chat with Scott Kesterson who is deployed with combat troops in Afghanistan. This week's Tribute to Freedom: Staff Sgt. Omar Hernandez of Fort Bliss, Texas, was awarded the prestigious Silver Star Medal and the Purple Heart for risking his personal safety to rescue two teammates from the line of fire while in Iraq in 2007.

Hernandez was on dismounted patrol with two members of the Iraqi National Police when the group came under attack by insurgents. Both men, whom Staff Sgt.

He is also a great writer and musician. During this show, Zach will come on to talk about his music in a combat environment and share a few songs he's written. You can also check out his MySpace page in the meantime. Emily Custer began piano lessons at four, and added violin and voice instruction over the next few years, she soon discovered her ‘bent’ toward composing. By five years old, she was singing harmonies with any song, always switching from part to part. As an adult, it was rather humbling for her mother to play a simple little song on the piano and have her then six year old daughter proceed to add an intricate obbligato part, totally ‘on the fly’! Young Emily did not begin writing down the tunes she composed until she was in third grade. Emily recently composed and sang the patriotic tune "Thank You", which I'll play during the show. Operation Baghdad Pups is a non-profit organization dedicated to assisting troops in bringing home pets they've come to know and love that were strays in the combat zone. They do not just save animals; it also brings comfort and peace of mind to our troops. The SPCA International team has had the pleasure of getting to know many of the animals we have rescued. They are smart, resilient, inquisitive, playful and we believe they are grateful for the opportunity to live without fear in the United States.

Young Emily did not begin writing down the tunes she composed until she was in third grade. Emily recently composed and sang the patriotic tune "Thank You", which I'll play during the show. Operation Baghdad Pups is a non-profit organization dedicated to assisting troops in bringing home pets they've come to know and love that were strays in the combat zone. They do not just save animals; it also brings comfort and peace of mind to our troops. The SPCA International team has had the pleasure of getting to know many of the animals we have rescued. They are smart, resilient, inquisitive, playful and we believe they are grateful for the opportunity to live without fear in the United States.

On tap for this show is a little about military voting. We'll discuss what is and is not authorized political activity in and out of uniform and get your opinions as well. I'll also give you "A Soldier's Perspective" about fighting a counter-insurgency - time permitting. We'll also have SGT Freedom as our guest on this week's show. He puts out regular videos geared towards political and military topics. You can learn more about SGT Freedom at www.sgtfreedom.org. I'll also be playing an interview with Florida National Guardsman, CPT Jeremy Hopkins, who will talk about his unit's involvement in assisting victims of Tropical Storm Fay. Time permitting, we'll also discuss the military health care system. If you think socialized medical care is the way to go for this country, wait until you hear what I have to say.<BR/><BR/><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/voting/'>voting</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/voting.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/voting.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/military/'>military</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/military.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/regulations/'>regulations</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/regulations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/regulations.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search/elections/'>elections</a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/elections.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/elections.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a> | <a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/search//'></a><a href='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/rss_tiny.gif' border='0' /></a><a href='itpc://www.blogtalkradio.com/rss/tag/.rss'><img src='http://www.blogtalkradio.com/img/itunes_trans.png' border='0' /></a>  <BR/><BR/>]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[We'll discuss relevant military topics.
