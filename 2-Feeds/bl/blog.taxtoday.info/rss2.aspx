&lt;P style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: black; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"&gt;&lt;FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 22px"&gt;One change addresses the amount that one can owe to be considered for a streamlined agreement. &amp;nbsp;One aspect of a streamlined agreement is that it can be approved without the need for a financial statement as long as the taxes will be paid within the time span allotted by the law. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is a welcome aspect for those who are reticent about revealing intimate details of their financial position to the IRS.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P style="BACKGROUND: white; MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%; TEXT-ALIGN: center" align=center&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: black; LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"&gt;&lt;FONT style="FONT-SIZE: 22px"&gt;Keep in mind that interest and penalties will continue to accrue on the unpaid balance. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Interest is currently calculated at a daily rate of three percent.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Penalties are calculated at a monthly rate of a half of a percent.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
