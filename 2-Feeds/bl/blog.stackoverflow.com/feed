			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hard to believe it&#8217;s been only six months since the last moderator election on Stack Overflow&#8230;</p>
<p>Remember <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/">A Theory of Moderation</a>? It talks about how moderators are the &#8220;human exception handlers&#8221; on Stack Overflow, elected to deal with those rare situations the normal community moderation can&#8217;t handle. It also notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The most common moderator task is to follow up on <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/improved-flagging/">flagged posts</a>. Every post contains a small <strong>flag link</strong>, which anyone with 15 reputation can use.</p></blockquote>
<p>Over 200K users with at least 15 reputation have accessed Stack Overflow in the past three months. That&#8217;s a lot of folks able to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/04/raising-a-red-flag/">raise a red flag</a> &#8211; and a lot of them <em>do</em>.</p>
<p>With 12 moderators on Stack Overflow, handling the more than 1,300 flags each day has become an increasingly heavy load to bear &#8211; so we&#8217;re looking for a few good men or women willing to step up and help. If you&#8217;re an experienced, community-minded member of Stack Overflow, willing to devote a bit of time each day to assisting your comrades, visit <strong><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/election">http://stackoverflow.com/election</a> </strong>and nominate yourself.</p>
<p>Of course, needing more moderators is <em>a good problem to have</em> - it means Stack Overflow is thriving, its community able to recognize when a something on the site needs attention. That said, there&#8217;s something a bit wrong with this many flags going to the exception handlers, when many of them can and should be handled by other <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/03/new-10k-rep-tools-now-available/">trusted members</a> of the community. Last fall we started experimenting with ways of presenting <em>some</em> flags &#8211; those most likely to require actions available to ordinary users &#8211; to the 10K users first, and forward them only to moderators when unresolved in a reasonable period of time. We&#8217;ll be expanding this in the next month to put <em>flagging</em> for action (close, delete, re-open, etc.) and <em>voting</em> for action in the same league when it comes to requiring moderator intervention. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello. <a href="http://stackexchange.com/users/482412/samthebrand">Sam Brand</a> here. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m part of <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/11/the-art-of-organizing-chaos/">the CHAOS at Stack Exchange</a>. I handle certain “special projects” across the network, oversee syndication, and occasionally poke my head into our communities to make sure our platform works to deliver killer content to the outside world. A couple weeks ago, I embarked upon one of these experiments.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11817" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/teh-hawtness-300x293.png" alt="" width="300" height="293" /></p>
<h2>What I did</h2>
<p>Each day of the week (May 7 &#8211; May 11) I dropped into <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?sa=X">Google Trends: Hot Searches</a> to find a buzzy keyword about which I could ask a question at one of our sites. I did this mostly out of curiosity; I’d never used the vast majority of our 85 sites. Who are the experts at our <a href="http://biology.stackexchange.com/">biology site</a>? How might some of these communities react to a noob? A small part of this experiment was <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/01/eating-our-own-careers-dogfood/">dogfooding</a> to better acquaint myself with the product and communities that it’s my job to know. But that was just a small part&#8230;</p>
<p>The bigger goal was to see how equipped our network is to take advantage of the  most popular, topical keywords on earth. You know, the keywords me, you, your mom and your de-friended friends are most likely to plug into a search field at any given time &#8212; keywords like “Dancing with the Stars,” “National Donut Day,” “Barack Obama” and “Facebook” &#8212; the most popular search term on earth.</p>
<p>Stack Exchange, of course, was built for the long-tail. We thrive on questions that only a few of you have. But that doesn’t mean our communities can’t generate pieces of widely-appealing, high-quality content, and do so happily. Right? Just because something’s “hot” now doesn’t mean it won’t be useful to a Google Goggler on his hoverboard in the distant future. Or does it?</p>
<p>Here’s what resulted when I asked six “hot” questions across six sites over five days:</p>
<ol>
<li>Monday, May 7 - &#8221;<strong>Facebook IPO</strong>&#8220; - Personal Finance &amp; Money - <a href="http://money.stackexchange.com/questions/14975/i-am-a-small-retail-investor-can-i-invest-in-the-facebook-ipo-at-the-ipo-price">I am a small retail investor. Can I invest in the Facebook IPO at the IPO price?</a> [Closed]</li>
<li>Tuesday, May 8 - &#8221;<strong>Where the Wild Things Are</strong>&#8220; - Skeptics - <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/9372/does-where-the-wild-things-are-frighten-children-to-a-degree-that-author-mauri">Does &#8216;Where the Wild Things Are&#8217; frighten children to a degree that author Maurice Sendak failed to comprehend?</a> [Closed]</li>
<li>Wednesday, May 9 - &#8221;<strong>Great Pacific Garbage Patch</strong>&#8220; - Biology - <a href="http://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/2212/is-the-great-pacific-garbage-patch-beneficial-for-marine-wildlife">Is the &#8220;Great Pacific Garbage Patch&#8221; beneficial for marine wildlife?</a></li>
<li>Wednesday, May 9 - &#8221;<strong>Barack Obama&#8221; &amp; &#8221;Same-Sex Marriage</strong>&#8220; - History - <a href="http://history.stackexchange.com/questions/1983/barack-obama-is-the-first-us-president-to-support-same-sex-marriage-but-who-was">Barack Obama is the first US President to support same-sex marriage. But who was the first head of government in human history to do so?</a></li>
<li>Thursday, May 10 - &#8221;<strong>Wolfenstein 3D</strong>&#8220; - Gaming - <a href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/65746/wolfenstein-3d-is-now-available-for-free-online-but-is-this-version-any-differe">Wolfenstein 3D is now available for free online. But is this version any different than the original?</a></li>
<li>Friday, May 11 - &#8221;<strong>Flesh-Eating Bacteria</strong>&#8220; - The Outdoors - <a href="http://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/1497/what-can-an-injured-person-in-the-outdoors-do-to-prevent-infection-by-flesh-eati">What can an injured person in the outdoors do to prevent infection by flesh-eating bacteria?</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Click through, or take my word for it when I tell you : <strong>Creating high-quality content </strong>(based around hot keywords or not)<strong> is a challenge</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/06/can-stack-exchange-capitalize-on-hot-trends/seths-drawing-bigger/" rel="attachment wp-att-11826"><img class="alignright  wp-image-11826" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/seths-drawing-bigger-1024x665.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="239" /></a>Asking is a challenge. (Quick! Come up with a clever question about <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends?q=chagas+disease">Chagas Disease</a>. Go!) Answering is a challenge. (We are very aware how much work our users put into helping others.) There is no silver bullet when it comes creating smart niche content or newsstand-quality content that your aunt wants to read while she gets a perm in a hair chair.</p>
<h3>However&#8230;</h3>
<p>At some of our sites content creation is more difficult than at others. <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/">Skeptics</a>, where I asked my second question, might be the most difficult site to engage on our network. The site is accessible to everyone (<a href="http://mashable.com/2010/10/21/why-does-the-web-love-cats/">Cats!</a>), but the community asks that you become familiar with some strict ground rules before jumping in (<a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3060/do-cats-always-land-on-their-feet">Cats AND science!</a>).</p>
<p>I didn’t play by the rules when I asked <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/9372/4070">question #2</a> (a pointless, overwrought question, I admit) and my question got shuttered. I can live with this. Stack Exchange can live with this. In this case, it’s not a too-strict FAQ or a crabby moderator preventing us from adding to the Internet; It’s me. Hate the player, not game played at Skeptics, a site that consistently churns out Q&amp;A leagues more rigorous than any other user-generated content on the net. It is the site’s strict ground rules that enable it to do so.</p>
<p><em>However&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Sometimes a site’s rules can get in the way of creating the sort of topical content that would make the net a better place. What happened with <a href="http://money.stackexchange.com/q/14975/5139">Question #1</a> illustrates this well. A couple Mondays ago, investing in Facebook seemed like a pretty good idea. So, like thousands of others I googled: “How can I invest in Facebook’s IPO?” What resulted were a jumble of links that referred to E-Trade’s involvement in the initial public offering, but no stories that told me directly whether I was eligible to bid on the shares at the IPO price. I just wanted an answer. So I took the query to our <a href="http://money.stackexchange.com/">Personal Finance site</a>, where the question was quickly closed. The reason for the closure? A similar question had previously been asked at the site, but about Skype’s IPO. Needless to say, Skype is not Facebook, and neither question will ever answer anyone’s question about getting in on any upcoming IPOs. Lacking a <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/">canonical answer</a>, this is a case where a site should really learn to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/dr-strangedupe-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-duplication/">love the duplicates</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>: So, what can we do? How can Stack Exchange improve in cases like these when a good question with a hot proper noun gets shut down?</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>: Vote to reopen. Not enough rep? Ask your friends to vote to reopen. Flag for moderator attention. And <strong>make your case in the comments</strong>. If you want an expert answer, put in a little work to deserve it.</p>
<p>Our moderators, like new users, can use a little poking and prodding. They own the sites as much as you or I. But more than anyone, they can make sites change (Server Fault’s FAQ went through <a href="http://meta.serverfault.com/questions/2894/voting-on-the-faq-rewrite-round-2">a pretty radical change</a> just this past February).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Lest you think all my hot topic assaults were for naught, think again. Check out our biology site for a <a href="http://biology.stackexchange.com/a/2221/423">comprehensive answer</a> to my question about the &#8220;Great Pacific Garbage Patch.&#8221; Read <a href="http://outdoors.stackexchange.com/a/1498/138">here</a> to protect yourself from &#8220;flesh-eating bacteria.&#8221;  Look <a href="http://history.stackexchange.com/a/1985/282">here</a> to find out which modern head of state first sanctioned gay marriage. As for <a href="http://gaming.stackexchange.com/q/65746/13524">Wolfenstein 3D</a>… Several weeks after asking, nobody has yet found any difference between the classic game and the free web-based version. That&#8217;s the verdict, for now. Maybe in the future, someone wearing Google Goggles will come along and leave a more definitive answer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/about">this old picture</a>?</p>
<p><img style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/VennDiagramSmall.png" alt="Wiki Blog Digg Reddit Forum Venn Diagram" width="220" height="216" border="0" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s that &#8220;Blog&#8221; circle supposed to be about, you ask? WHERE&#8217;S THE BLOGGING?</p>
<p>Since Stack Overflow launched, we&#8217;ve been trying to explain that it&#8217;s not just a Q&amp;A platform: it&#8217;s also a place where you can publish things that you&#8217;ve learned: recipes, FAQs, HOWTOs, walkthroughs, and even bits of product documentation, as long you format it as a question and answer.</p>
<p>As Jeff <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/">wrote</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a question that you already know the answer to</li>
<li>if you’d like to document it in public so others (including yourself) can find it later</li>
<li>it is OK to ask, and answer, your own question on a relevant Stack Exchange site.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a long time we&#8217;ve been pleading for people to write <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/">more canonical answers</a> so the same questions don&#8217;t keep coming up again and again, and we even have the Self-Learner badge which you can only earn by answering your own question. Still, I&#8217;m not sure if the message is getting through to everyone, as evidenced by the misguided comments that sprout up whenever someone answers their own question.</p>
<p>How can we make this any clearer? Maybe a big bold checkbox will help.<img style="margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/AnswerYourOwnQuestion.png" alt="Answer Your Own Question Checkbox" width="455" height="57" border="0" /></p>
<p>Now when you ask a question, you&#8217;ll see that checkbox right there, reminding you of the option to answer your question on the spot. Furthermore, the answer will be published at the same time as the question, avoiding that awkward moment where well-meaning people rush in to answer something you&#8217;ve already got an answer for.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a tiny checkbox that doesn&#8217;t change the mechanics of Stack Exchange in any way, but we have a bold goal for this new feature: we&#8217;re trying to move even more of the world&#8217;s long-tail, detailed knowledge into Stack Exchange. It works for all 83 sites (and their metas), you get to keep the reputation you earn, and you&#8217;ll get a lot more eyeballs than you can get on your blog (no offense… even my blog doesn&#8217;t get 24,300,000 monthly uniques).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a year and half ago <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/new-global-inbox/">we introduced the Global Inbox</a>, that lovely little red number our analytics tell us everybody loves.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/05/revamped-notifications/inbox/" rel="attachment wp-att-11719"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11719" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/inbox.png" alt="" width="388" height="34" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re fiercely protective of the inbox, making sure only actionable things directed at you go into it.  Comments, answers, a handful of post notices, Stack Overflow Careers messages, and the like.  That&#8217;s why that little red number is so loved, clicking it shows you awesome, interesting things as a rule.</p>
<p>However, since day one we&#8217;ve had a another class of general information notifications, badge awards, revisions, election announcements, and so on.  Stuff that&#8217;s good to know, but not always stuff you can respond to.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s how we&#8217;ve always displayed those notifications:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/05/revamped-notifications/big-orange-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-11727"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11727" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/Big-Orange1.png" alt="" width="626" height="63" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s not bad enough, notifications make you dismiss every, <em>single</em>, <strong><em>one -</em></strong> while the Global Inbox is a one-click, friction-less dismiss.  This means that it&#8217;s more work to go through your less interesting messages.</p>
<p>This is obviously all out of whack, so we&#8217;ve completely reworked the notification system, cribbing liberally from the well received Global Inbox:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/05/revamped-notifications/clicky/" rel="attachment wp-att-11738"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-11738" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/clicky.png" alt="" width="539" height="208" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notifications are now&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8230;a tab in <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/new-global-inbox/">the Stack Exchange Genuine dropdown</a></li>
<li>&#8230;global: get a badge on Stack Overflow and you&#8217;ll see the notice on Gaming</li>
<li>&#8230;dismissed with one click, just like the inbox</li>
<li>&#8230;available historically: the last 45 are available, rather than disappearing forever once read</li>
</ul>
<p>Since notifications aren&#8217;t as important as inbox notices, whenever you have unread inbox messages we&#8217;ll display the red inbox indicator rather than the gray notification indicator.  Of course, once you open the drop down you&#8217;ll see that you also have new notifications.</p>
<p>Hopefully this notification change removes just a bit of friction from using your favorite Stack Exchange sites. I know I for one won&#8217;t miss Big Slidy Orange one bit.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thank you to everyone who organized or attended a Stack Overflow meetup! Our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/">Meetup Everywher</a><a href="http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/">e</a> community has grown to over 4,400 people in almost 600 cities, and many of those people signed up for meetups in their areas this year. Many meetups were small, but we hope you all had a good time and that those smaller groups had an even better opportunity to get to know each other.</p>
<p>Our official hashtag is #SOmeetup, and we&#8217;ve seen a lot of great pictures and stories on Twitter, Flickr and YouTube so far. If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to upload yours yet, please do! Take a look at some of what people have shared so far:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Milan, Italy</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/Milano-IT/">Milan meetup group</a> was our largest this year with 101 RSVPs to their event!

<p>The New York City meetup took place in two parts: the first was a series of talks at <a href="http://www.projective.co/">Projective Spac</a>e (a coworking space on Manhattan&#8217;s Lower East Side), and the second was socializing over beers and snacks at Onieals on Grand.</p>
<p>The first session&#8217;s talks provided information on cool new technologies and gave people some conversation topics.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bobbygrace">Bobby Grace</a> shared knowledge about responsive web design and designing <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> for multiple devices.</p>
<p><a href="http://kevingessner.com/">Kevin Gessner</a> spoke about how <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">elasticsearch</a>&#8216;s database is &#8220;magic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stack Exchange developer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/70613/matt-sherman">Matt Sherman</a> taught us how to meet &#8220;hot singles&#8221; in our area &#8211; a.k.a what tech recruiters can learn from online dating.</p>

<h2>Bangalore, India</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/abkolan/status/196484634891141121"><img class="size-medium wp-image-11659 alignleft" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/SOmeetup_Bangalore-246x300.png" alt="" width="246" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the agenda our Bangalore group brainstormed on their <a href="http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/Bangalore-IN/654972/">meetup.com page</a>:</p>
<p>1. Agenda/Plan/Activity Announcement or Meetup start</p>
<p>2. Screening tech talk videos.</p>
<p>3. Lightening talks 5 ~ 10 minute presentations about whatever</p>
<p>4. Talk to the Gurus (If there is anyone with more than 5k reputation or any senior programmer) &#8211; Share your experience or QA session.</p>
<p>5. Barcamp style &#8211; One track &#8211; a &#8216;lab&#8217; kinda area where people can plugin laptops and show off.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>Stack Overflow name tags (shown on the left) helped people get to know each other and allowed them to show off their current amounts of Stack Overflow reputation.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Paris, France</h2>
<p>The Paris meetup was hosted by <a href="http://www.dojoboost.com/">DojoBoost</a>. Though turnout was fairly small, it seems like everyone had a good time and engaged in interesting discussions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://plus.google.com/106661248019508703534/posts/itv2jPmLiYq"><img class="size-full wp-image-11689 aligncenter" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/SOmeetup_Paris3.png" alt="" width="582" height="268" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Presentations</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve also found some of the slides online for presentations given at meetups around the world. If you missed this event and want to see what people were discussing, take a look at these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drungli &#8211; a <a href="http://issuu.com/drungli/docs/drungli_stackoverflow">presentation on usability</a> from the Milan meetup</li>

</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the lifecycle of a Stack Exchange site, we&#8217;ve long held the philosophy that &#8220;it takes as long as it takes&#8221; to build a sustainable community:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/when-will-my-site-graduate/">How long can a site stay in beta?</a></h2>
<p>The simple answer is, <em>it takes as long as it takes</em>. We’ll wait. If a site needs more activity, go out and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/a-recipe-to-promote-your-site/">evangelize it</a>. As long as your site shows <strong>steady progress</strong> and continues to make the Internet a better place to get expert answers to your questions, it will march on.</p></blockquote>
<p>But when a site struggles to maintain any semblance of <em>steady progress</em> — when it&#8217;s struggling to garner an audience, a healthy core of experts, and a steady stream of questions — it becomes increasingly unlikely that the site will find a core audience to sustain it.</p>
<p>Next week, we&#8217;re shutting down six sites that fall into this category:</p>
<ul>
<li>Astronomy</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Literature</li>
<li>Firearms</li>
<li>Healthcare IT</li>
<li>Theoretical Physics</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing inherently wrong with these topics, or with the good folk who put time and effort into trying to make them work. They will likely make great Stack Exchange sites… someday. But so far, the network just hasn&#8217;t been able to provide these sites with the audience they need to make them work. Maybe they&#8217;ll find a niche on a different site, or be reborn at some later date as the Stack Exchange audience continues to grow. But for now, we&#8217;re shuttering the windows before they&#8217;re broken.</p>
<p>The knowledge that went into these sites is not lost. In keeping with our promise not to hoard what was given freely, all content on closed sites will be available for download from the Area 51 page corresponding to each site, in the same format and with the same <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">open license</a> as the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/09/creative-commons-data-dump-sep-11/">data dumps for graduated sites</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve always been reluctant to close a site once it entered public beta. These were difficult choices, as many people are fond of these subjects. Still, we’ve been somewhat remiss in not taking action sooner.</p>
<p>If it’s of any consolation, we have learned a lot from watching these sites grow and evolve. We are hard at work on a next-generation <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/">Area 51</a>, with the goal of making site creation easier, faster <em>and</em> more educational: one of the most frequent stumbling blocks for new sites has been the learning curve for folks unfamiliar with Stack Exchange &#8211; providing them with help and guidance is key to creating a vibrant, healthy site.</p>
<p>Thank you all for the the knowledge and hard work you&#8217;ve poured into these sites. Because of it, someday there <em>will</em> be a site on astronomy… and economics… and literature… and the rest. Stronger and better than ever.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" style="margin-left: 2em;" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/meetup-2012.png" alt="2012 Stack Overflow Meetups!" width="220" height="250" />In case you  haven&#8217;t heard, April 28th is the <a title="Stack Overflow Meetup Everywhere: April 28th!" href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/03/stack-overflow-meetup-everywhere-april-28-2012/">2nd annual Stack Overflow Meetup Everywhere</a> day! We want all Stack Overflow and tech-themed Stack Exchange users to have a chance to grab a beer, present projects, and spend some time with each other offline. However you format the event is great; this day is about bringing the community together, so plan whatever kind of event you need to in order for your city to have fun.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re less than a week away from the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/">Meetup</a> day (April 28), so if you haven&#8217;t already secured a venue, it&#8217;s important to get that done. Several people have asked about company sponsorship for their local events. Stack Exchange&#8217;s stance is this: A company donating space/food/drink for the event is fine, but that using the event as an avenue for marketing or as a captive audience opportunity to profit is not ok.  At the end of the day, this is about the community gathering together and having fun!</p>
<p>In addition to securing a venue, you need attendees! Help spread the word wherever you hang out on- and offline. Here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the hashtag #SOMeetup on Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube when posting about Stack Overflow MeetUps</li>
<li>Post a link to your local MeetUp page on Facebook and Twitter, email the page to your friends, promote in blog posts, etc.</li>
<li>Use the custom Stack Overflow MeetUp <a title="MeetUp Widgets" href="http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/widgets">widgets</a></li>
<li>Invite a friend or two to come with you (or coworkers!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to bring business cards so you can network at the event, and take lots of pictures! We want to see them posted on Twitter and Flickr (#SOMeetup) afterwards!</p>
<h2>Tips for organizers</h2>
<p>For those of you organizing the meetups, we have some tips to help your event run smoothly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post signs to direct attendees to the right location.</strong> If you&#8217;re not on the first floor, or if you&#8217;re in a room down the hall, or even if you&#8217;re right up front in the window of a bar, post some sort of sign to let people know they&#8217;re in the right place. (You can download Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange <a title="SO &amp; SE Logos" href="http://stackexchange.com/about/logos">logos from our website</a>.)</li>
<li><strong>Have organizers identify themselves.</strong> Have a Stack Overflow t-shirt? Wear it! If not, consider posting to your meetup group with an easily identifiable accessory or outfit description. This is another way that people will know they&#8217;re in the right place &#8211; and they&#8217;ll know who you are so they can thank you for making the event possible!</li>
<li><strong>Use name tags.</strong> Especially with larger groups, name tags will help break the ice and allow people to get to know each other. You can put either your real name, or your username on Stack Overflow, or both. (Bonus: Include your rep or a badge you&#8217;re particularly proud of earning, and other people will have something to ask you about.)</li>
<li><strong>Have a purpose. </strong>If your goal is just to socialize, then meeting in a bar with no planned event is fine. If you want the event to be more educational, have a set of presenters to give talks on tech subjects, and hand out a program with the speakers&#8217; names and presentation titles as people walk in the door. (These don&#8217;t have to be fancy &#8211; a half sheet of paper with a list of plain text is sufficient.) If it&#8217;s a discussion group, have a list of topics in case the conversation starts to fizzle. Knowing what you want to get out of the event will help ensure its success.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re still stuck for ideas, check out some of the events that your peers are planning!</p>
<ul>
<li>Ryan Alexander planned the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/London-GB/642402/">London meetup</a> at the TIMGroup offices, where there will be pizza (and hummus for vegans!), lightning talks, and an Xbox Kinect.</li>
<li>Urmo Kaber has tentatively planned the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/Tartu-EE/657302/">Tartu meetup</a> to include a hacking challenge followed by several presentations on topics ranging from JavaScript tricks to the <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>.</li>
<li>The folks in <a href="http://www.meetup.com/stackoverflow/Cambridge-MA/653292/">Cambridge, MA</a> are meeting up at a bar and focusing on the &#8220;who&#8217;s who&#8221; of the Cambridge Stack Overflow community, introducing users by name, reputation score, which users are also moderators, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck with your planning, and we look forward to seeing you in person and online on April 28!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, I<a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/01/hot-topics-a-contest-formula-that-works/"> outlined a contest formula</a> called “Hot Topics,” which has become a staple in CHAOS’s site-promotion efforts. For those who missed that post, Hot Topics initially worked like this:<strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Pick a topic of the week, and enter everyone who asks a question related to that topic into a random drawing to win a prize. The number of entries a person gets is equal to the number of questions they ask about the topic of the week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We now have a few variations on this contest format.<strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Variations on the Hot Topic Format</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Highest-scored post &#8211; Like the name suggests, instead of raffling off prizes, we reward the question or answer that has the highest score.</li>
<li>Most-viewed post &#8211; Similar to the “Highest-scored post”, in this variation we reward the post that gets the most views during the contest.</li>
<li>Showdown &#8211; Showdown contests are slightly different than Hot Topic contests because they involve two topics, pitted against each other. Our first showdown contest was <a href="http://skyrimvsmw3.com/">Skyrim versus Modern Warfare 3</a> &#8211; a battle to see which game got the most views and which users asked the top-voted question and answer in each category.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><strong><a href="http://skyrimvsmw3.com/"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RptkTR1y5XnpaDWLGeMT1sYukIepMTuBYsT8ZcIyZOCNq9VtWgSJmk4E5JpeFs3ka145DlIHc2aZ1dH00pXEXOAMa1x1NA_u8F8ipw77rLklQ58UQic" alt="" width="290px;" height="84px;" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p>Skyrim vs. MW3 successfully engaged the Gaming community, but it hinged on a manufactured rivalry that didn’t make much sense. Because of that, we’re now using this form of contest when there is a pre-existing event hinged on a showdown scenario. For example, Marvel Comics’ blockbuster event for 2012 is the mini-series<a href="http://marvel.com/comic_books/issue/41188/avengers_vs_x-men_2012_1"> Avengers vs. X-Men</a>. Just as the series pits two premier super teams in battle, the current<a href="http://avx.stackshowdown.com/"> Avengers vs. X-Men contest</a> running on SciFi goes right along with that by pitting our<a href="http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/avengers"> Avengers questions</a> against our<a href="http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/x-men"> X-Men questions</a> in a battle for views.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/04/more-notes-on-contest-format/avx/" rel="attachment wp-att-11566"><img class="size-medium wp-image-11566 aligncenter" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/avx-300x121.png" alt="" width="300" height="121" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center" dir="ltr"><strong>Drawbacks of the Hot Topic Format</strong></p>
<p>The Hot Topics contest and variations thereof are generally successful in engaging the community and celebrating important events, but there are some drawbacks:<strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They primarily incentivize posting. While posting questions and answers is arguably the most important component of the Stack Exchange model, there are several other actions that keep our sites running too &#8211; voting and sharing to name a couple.</li>
<li>Only a few people can win, and whether you win is largely left to chance. That is, while you can promote your post by sharing it with your social networks, it’s mostly out of your control how many votes or views it gets.</li>
<li>Because there are only a few winners, the competition tends to be very selfish: you can’t vote for or share other people’s posts without hurting your own chances of winning.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center" dir="ltr"><strong>Our Newest Contest Format: The Mission</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/04/more-notes-on-contest-format/mission6/" rel="attachment wp-att-11567"><img class="size-medium wp-image-11567 aligncenter" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/mission6-300x200.png" alt="Mass Effect 3 Mission 6" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>To rectify the shortcomings of Hot Topics, we’ve come up with a new kind of promotion: the Mission. Here’s how it works:<strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">The Mission promotion is pretty simple: design a series of levels, each one more difficult than the last, and give prizes to everyone who completes them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We first tried this style of promotion<a href="http://me3missions.com/"> to celebrate the release of Mass Effect 3</a> on Gaming, and it was wildly successful. We ran the contest for 3 weeks, and ended with over 900 questions tagged Mass Effect 3! Nine people completed the entire series of Missions (6 total), and over 50 completed Mission 1.</p>
<p>Our second contest with this format was held on Ask Different to<a href="http://thenewipadishere.com/"> celebrate the release of the new iPad</a>. Instead of 6 Missions there were 3 Levels, and numbers were adjusted accordingly. Additionally, there was a voting requirement.<strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center" dir="ltr"><strong>Benefits and Drawbacks of Missions</strong></p>
<p>There are several benefits to this type of contest in comparison to Hot Topic or Showdown contests.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can incentivize activities besides just asking and answering questions. You can also change the numbers and actions according to what is most appropriate for the site.</li>
<li>The first Level/Mission is relatively easy to complete, and they get gradually more difficult. Therefore, users can choose the extent to which they want to be involved.</li>
<li>Instead of giving prizes to a set number of people, everyone who completes a certain set of tasks wins. We do put a limit on the number of prizes we can give out per level just so we don’t go bankrupt, but we try to set the limit to be higher than the number of people predicted to complete the Mission based on average site statistics. (As those of you who completed Level 3 in the<a href="http://thenewipadishere.com/"> iPad contest</a> know, we vastly underestimated you! For this we apologize and will try to do better in the future.)</li>
<li>Because multiple people can win each Mission/Level, the contest tends to be less competitive. You can vote for and share other people’s posts without hurting your own chances of winning, which better preserves the way the site works naturally.</li>
<li>Winning is more controllable. That is, each Mission or Level lays out a few actionable tasks, such as “ask or answer 35 posts and share 15 posts.” We do impose a minimum score requirement on some of them, but the minimum score is always achievable without having to game the system.</li>
</ul>
<p>These benefits don’t mean that the Mission-style contest is perfect; here are some drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sub-par posts are a concern in Mission-contests for a few reasons. First of all, later Missions require users to post a large number of questions and answers, and the focus on quantity may reduce the quality of the posts. Additionally, the extrinsic motivation that large prizes introduce can cause a flood of new questions, which can overburden the moderators and the community in general (see meta threads<a href="http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1240/does-the-current-competition-bring-out-the-worst-in-users"> here</a> and<a href="http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/questions/1197/how-do-we-keep-the-exciting-promotion-from-reducing-the-quality-of-the-site"> here</a> for more detail).</li>
<li>Asking people to share a set number of posts may cause them to exhaust their social networks, making sharing less effective in the future.</li>
<li>Mission-style contests require a large time commitment to complete, and we give out a significant number of prizes. Therefore, they are only appropriate when coupled with a very important event in the community, such as the release of a highly anticipated game or product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, choosing a contest format depends heavily on the site and the event. Any site that is receiving CHAOS attention is eligible for a contest. However, as stated above, Mission contests will probably only be run on sites that already have  big events happening in their community. I’m optimistic that with these few basic contest models and the <a href="http://meta.apple.stackexchange.com/q/1260/13125">suggestions provided in meta</a>, we can continue to improve and come up with something that fits our sites even better.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re doing this to help those developers who build on our API find an audience for their hard work, in a similar vein to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/05/community-promotion-ads/">Community Promotion Ads</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the current guidelines for getting an app listed:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be free, and thus available to all our users</li>
<li>It must be listed on <a href="http://stackapps.com/?tab=apps">Stack Apps</a></li>
<li>It must work on all Stack Exchange sites</li>
<li>It must be awesome (we&#8217;re hand curating these for now)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Congratulations to all the winners</h1>
<p>You should definitely check them out.</p>
<p>If none of these apps float your boat there are plenty more <a href="http://stackapps.com/questions/tagged/app">available on Stack Apps</a>, or you could <a href="https://api.stackexchange.com/">jump in and build your own</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stack Overflow Careers 2.0 re-launched a year ago, and since then we’ve been steadily making improvements to it. While we’ve added a lot of new features for developers to <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/03/enterprise-vs-consumer-development/">find great jobs</a> and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/codeplex-and-other-gateway-drugs/">show off their stuff</a>, we’ve been a bit…neglectful of the employer side.</p>
<p>Well, not any more. We’ve just wrapped up a big set of changes to how companies find and track the perfect developers for their jobs. So if you’ve ever considered hiring a developer, read on for the details.</p>
<h2>Some Background</h2>
<p>Stack Overflow Careers launched with one goal: help developers find great jobs. We do that in two ways: developers can go looking for jobs on our <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs">jobs board</a>, or they can <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/cv/get-one">create profiles</a> showing off their work and let employers come to them.</p>
<p>From the employer’s point of view, these were two completely separate products. You either bought a job listing and collected applications, or you bought a search subscription and searched in our database. You could buy both, but they wouldn’t share any information between them.</p>
<p>No big deal, we thought. Well, it turns out that these products are really complementary and a lot of employers would like to use both. Job listings bring in lots of programmers who are actively looking for jobs, but they don’t reach the pool of really great candidates who already have jobs but may be willing to talk. Candidate search excels at the latter, since 25,000 of the 32,000 searchable profiles in Careers are people who are not actively looking for a job.</p>
<p>So we set out to bridge that gap and bring job listings and search together.</p>
<h2>Messaging</h2>
<p>First, we tackled messaging. We consolidated all of your messages into one simple new interface:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11470" title="messages" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/messages1.png" alt="" width="650" height="172" /></p>
<p>We’re obviously not breaking any new UI ground here: this looks and works like an email client. The important thing is that it combines everything into a nice, clean view: developers can easily see which jobs they’ve applied to and which companies have contacted them, and employers can see who they’ve contacted and who has applied to their jobs.</p>
<h2>Candidate Tracker</h2>
<p>The second piece we tackled was tracking candidates. Previously, when applications came in they just went into a big pile of resumes and cover letters, and you couldn’t do anything with them – not even sort them into “keep” and “reject” piles. Similarly, if you found an awesome developer via search, you could message them, but you couldn’t take notes or even easily keep track of their response. So we decided to combine these things together into a new candidate tracker:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11471" title="candidate-tracker" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/candidate-tracker.png" alt="" width="650" height="264" /></p>
<p>We took a lot of cues from <a href="http://trello.com/">Trello</a> (which we love – you should really try it if you haven’t): each candidate shows as a card with a picture, name, rating, and a short summary that you can create to keep all the candidates straight. You can drag them around between various states of the hiring process, and you can click them to see all their details:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11472" title="popup" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/popup.png" alt="" width="650" height="311" /></p>
<p>From the expanded card, you can easily see all of a candidate’s information, make notes, and send messages. At each stage of the process you can either advance the candidate, or dismiss them from the list (always reversible, of course).</p>
<h2>Candidate Search</h2>
<p>This paved the way for integrating search with job listings. Now when you search, you’re searching to fill a particular position and all the candidates you save will be associated with that job. This makes it possible to keep two separate lists for two jobs (if, say, you’re looking for a front-end jQuery developer and a back-end python/mysql dev), and lets you associate a job listing with each search to get even more candidates.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11473" title="search" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/search.png" alt="" width="650" height="376" /></p>
<p>This also let us cross off a frequent complaint: you’ll no longer see the same candidates showing up over and over again in searches. Once you’ve saved or dismissed a candidate, they’ll stop showing up in searches for that job, so you won’t have to keep paging past them to get to the new results.</p>
<h2>Job Listings</h2>
<p>Finally, we took another look at job listings and added some stats to help you track where all your applications came from:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11474" title="listing" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/listing.png" alt="" width="650" height="263" /></p>
<p>This page now shows the number of views your job listing has gotten, what percentage of those people clicked a link in your job listing, and how many ended up applying for your job. We also show you where people came from, so if you posted the listing on our board, then tweeted it and posted it on your website you can actually see how many came from each place.</p>
<p>We also added embed codes for our <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/03/enterprise-vs-consumer-development/">fancy new apply button</a>. That means that if you list your jobs on your company website, you can now directly embed a button to apply for the job with Careers. It opens a popup which lets developers apply to the job without ever leaving your website:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11475" title="apply-popup" src="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/wp-content/uploads/apply-popup.png" alt="" width="650" height="314" /></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>That’s it for this round! This was a big change on the back end, and it sets the stage for a lot more changes we’re going to jump into working on next. If you’re already a customer, let us know what you think on <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com">meta.stackoverflow.com</a> or <a href="mailto:careers@stackoverflow.com">via email</a>. If you’re a developer and you’d really like to work with some kickass fellow developers using Stack Overflow, email your boss or hiring manager and tell them to try <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Careers</a>!</p>
