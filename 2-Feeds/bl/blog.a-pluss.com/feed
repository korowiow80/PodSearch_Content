			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When writing cause and effect essays an effective, informative and above all structured introduction is necessary in order to help setup the data and arguments that will be utilized in the body of the paper. The introduction acts as a way of introducing the topic, the facts, contrasting and complimentary views and finally the method of comparison and contrast to be utilized by the researcher. As such for the introduction in this type of essay of particular issues, events and scientific discoveries the following format must be followed in order to sufficiently introduce the paper:</p>
<p><strong>The First Paragraph of Cause and Effect Essays must present the Facts of the Case</strong></p>
<p>An essay about cause and effect functions by presenting the facts of a case and the resulting or possible outcome of such actions. As such, the initial paragraph must have a topic sentence that immediately presents the issue at hand. The supporting details within the paragraph itself must also detail several aspects of the case as well whether in the form of statistics, quantitative data or other means of portraying the needed information.<span id="more-2114"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Second Paragraph of your Cause and Effect Essay Must Detail the Possible/Resulting Effects of Such Actions</strong></p>
<p>After the initial paragraph has been written on your essay it then becomes necessary to present a brief summary of possible effects seen in other similar cases. While this particular section does not necessarily have to be incredibly detailed, readers should be able to immediately discern the facts presented in the 1st paragraph of your essay and discern the possible or resulting effects that might occur based on the example provided of a similar case. By doing this not only will the essay have a means of comparison but it also prepares readers for the various facts and arguments that will be presented in the body of the paper.</p>
<p><strong>The Third and Last Paragraph of your Essay Must Indicate How the Arguments will be Utilized</strong></p>
<p>In the last section of your introduction, the third paragraph must explain how cause and effect will be established. This involves explaining what particular aspects will be explored, how will they explored within your essay and what means of examination will be conducted.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://blog.a-pluss.com/wp-content/uploads/a-pluss.com/2012/04/accounting-research-paper.jpg" alt="accounting-research-paper" title="accounting-research-paper" width="200" height="137" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2106" />Accounting research papers allow you to pursue, in-depth, a question or issue that interests you.  Even if accounting is your least favorite subject, there are ways to make it more appealing to write. Alternatively, if this is your career path, a research paper in accounting allows you to preview issues, specializations, and firms that interest you. Let’s consider ways to make the process less onerous.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Start early:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
From day one, if the syllabus includes accounting research papers, contemplate topics and resources. Don’t operate in a fog of uncertainty and ignorance.  If you’ve never written a research paper before, learn now!</p>
<ol>
<li>Approach the professor/teaching assistant – clarify expectations for this accounting research paper</li>
<li>Pump the librarian about relevant holdings:
<ul>
<li>specialized periodicals, </li>
<li>general business journals, e.g., The Harvard Business Review, </li>
<li>archived theses/dissertations,</li>
<li>Specialized databases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Librarians are often ludicrously over-qualified and tragically under-utilized.</li>
<li>Ask permission to see (not take home and copy) an exemplary past paper.  It does not hurt to ask.</li>
<li>Politely interrogate class veterans.</li>
<li>You have already paid for the on-campus writing support resources.  Have you exploited them?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Choose topics that compel YOUR interest:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
CPAs/CAs see themselves as James Bond-style heroes, or crime scene investigators. The rest of us struggle to maintain such enthusiasm.Therefore, choose a subject for your accounting research paper with long-term appeal<br />
<span id="more-2098"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Does class discussion suggest intriguing potential topics?  Take note!</li>
<li>Sample The Wall Street Journal/Economist/Financial Times regularly to see who is accounting for what, or should be.</li>
<li>Explore how scholars approach issues, whether through field study, experimental, analytical, or empirical methods (e.g., <a href="http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=0021-8456" target="_blank">wiley.com</a>, <a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/management-accounting-research/" target="_blank">journals.elsevier.com</a>).Or search by Method of Reasoning, Treatment, or Area of Accounting at <a href="http://raw.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank">raw.rutgers.edu</a>.</li>
<li>Are annual reports published for prospective employers?
<ul>
<li>IPOs often reveal new data.</li>
<li>Take the current example of a law firm: <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2007/03/30/the-publicly-traded-law-firm-2/" target="_blank">blogs.wsj.com</a></li>
</li>
</ul>
<li>Does a business issue in another course intrigue you?  How does GAAP treat this, and how will it look under the new FASB codification scheme?</li>
<li>How are matters handled overseas, e.g., in India?</li>
<li>Assemble a vocabulary of relevant search terms</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Submit proposed topics early to get maximum assistance from professor/others:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Phrase topic as a question</li>
<li>Seek help in framing thesis statement</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hand in drafts to keep on track:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is your proposed supporting evidence credible?</li>
<li>Is your literature search complete?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exchange proofing of research papers in accounting with classmates:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read aloud</li>
<li>Cross-check with Grammarly.com, or WhiteSmoke.com, or equivalents</li>
</ul>

Why lists? Because academic writing requires research and research is best organized with lists.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So, let’s learn how to deal with lists. </p>
<h2>Bulleted List: Defining the Phenomenon with Pinpoint Accuracy.</h2>
<p>Now welcome our special guest – the question that students ask most often: “What is a bulleted list?”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>A bulleted list is a list of equally important elements</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now, wave good-bye to this problem and let’s move on.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Whenever dealing with a bulleted list, check whether you have to use the traditional bullet point range or you can be original&#8230;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now that’s a lot to choose from! Let’s see how to get your list bulleted the right way in different formats. </p>
<h2>Bulleted List in EVERY Possible Variation: Check This Table Out!</h2>

<p>Congratulations – now you know everything you need about asp, css and html for bulleted list creation!</p>
<h2>Bulleted List vs. Numbered List: Remember the Crucial Differences.</h2>
<p>Finally, don’t forget that there’s a difference between numbers and bullets – so choose wisely!<br />
<strong>Bulleted List</strong>	</p>
<ul>
<li> enumerates the elements</li>
<li>makes all elements equal</li>
<li>is used for short lists</li>
<li>conveys short messages</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Numbered List</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>introduces a hierarchy into the list</li>
<liis used for long lists></li>
<li>provides a considerable amount of information</li>
</ul>
<p>You’re almost there &#8211; only 5 tips left. Learn everything about list-making!</p>
<h2>Bulleted List Creation: Learn Five Important Recommendations!</h2>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://blog.a-pluss.com/wp-content/uploads/a-pluss.com/2012/04/text-editor.jpg" alt="text-editor" title="text-editor" width="200" height="229" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2057" />Do you entirely rely on your text editor for finding the right words and the correct spelling? Yes, it is always there when you need it. Every time you want to write the word “entrepreneurship” or any other difficult word, you simply turn to your text editor. However, there are cases when text editor software can become your false friend. Take care! Do not be deceived by text editors! Here is a list of difficult cases, in which your text editors are of no assistance and it is only you who can edit your documents.</p>
<h2>Text editor: tricky misspells</h2>
<p>The following common misspells are number one in the list of mistakes that are not noticed by text editors:</p>
<ul>
<li>your – you’re;</li>
<li>there – their, they’re</li>
<li>then – than;</li>
<li>its- it’s;</li>
<li>to – two, too;</li>
<li>anyway – any way.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Text editor: confusable words</h2>
<p>The second large group of words that will jumble your text editors includes these confusables which are grammatically correct, but have absolutely different meanings:</p>
<ol>
<li>accept – except;</li>
<li>amoral – immoral;</li>
<li>adopt – adapt;</li>
<li>break – brake;</li>
<li>decent – descent;</li>
<li>diary – dairy;</li>
<li>desert – dessert;</li>
<li>die- dye;</li>
<li>faze – phase;</li>
<li>gorilla – guerrilla;</li>
<li>martial – marital;</li>
<li>peace – piece;</li>
<li>personnel – personal;</li>
<li>reign &#8211; rain;</li>
<li>through – threw;</li>
<li>waist – waste.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any of these pairs can deceive even the best text editor. If the spelling is correct, text editors consider any of these words as correct and do not care for the context and meaning. Try to take care of these confusables and choose the right variant for every single case.</p>
<h2>A text editor can be intrusive</h2>
<p><span id="more-2053"></span><br />
<img src="http://blog.a-pluss.com/wp-content/uploads/a-pluss.com/2012/04/editor-of-texts.jpg" alt="editor-of-texts" title="editor-of-texts" width="200" height="233" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2059" />What is even worse, your text editor can become intrusive and offer assistance when you do not actually need it. For example, when you need to use proper nouns or difficult terms in your papers, your text editor may warn you that these words are incorrect. The explanation is simple. The database of your text editor doesn’t contain those words. Yes, you may want to double check the spelling of proper nouns and specialized terms, but you do not need to worry. Text editors can be good, but still not perfect. Here are a few examples of correct spelling which can be marked by your text editor as wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walsingham (a British architect);</li>
<li>Wolpe (an American psychologist);</li>
<li>Bienvenu (an American scientist);</li>
<li>Bossangoa (a city in Central Africa);</li>
<li>Yiyang (a city in Central China).</li>
<li>aldehyde (a chemical term);</li>
<li>endotracheal (a medical term).</li>
</ul>
<p>As you see, even if a word is marked by your text editor, it might still be correct. On the other hand, if the word is not marked by your text editor, it might still be wrong. So, you should take control of the situation and become an editor of texts. There are a lot of cases when you know better than your text editor software.</p>

<p>For those who keep asking, “How can I write a report?,” here are two excellent samples of report writing:<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<td style="border: 1px solid #666;">Business Report on <em>McDonald’s</em><br />
<em>McDonald’s</em> must be one of the most recognized brands in the world. However, according to recent research, the company is currently suffering considerable losses and experiencing great staff turnover. Since the company hires mostly students and offers rather low salaries, the problem seems quite essential.<br />
To solve the issue, the following steps are recommended: </p>
<ul>
<li>Raising wages;</li>
<li>Hiring more qualified staff;</li>
<li>Creating unions.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the company to maintain stability in future, it is recommended to offer staff more flexible work schedules.

<td style="border: 1px solid #666;">Business Report on <em>Starbucks</em><br />
<em>Starbucks</em> is one of the most memorable brands of coffee shops. However, the company seems to have lost its popularity greatly and is searching for efficient solutions.<br />
Obviously, the company should:</p>
<ul>
<li>allow shops more flexibility in promoting the brand; </li>
<li>stop using the “kit of parts” method for building stores;</li>
<li>add a unique atmosphere to each of the stores.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, in future, it will be reasonable for the company to strive to keep pace with Caribou Coffee, one of the most dangerous rivals.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://blog.a-pluss.com/wp-content/uploads/a-pluss.com/2012/03/how-to-critique-an-article.jpg" alt="how-to-critique-an-article" title="how-to-critique-an-article" width="200" height="184" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2030" />Sooner or later, every student will have to write an article critique. This assignment is not very difficult for a person who knows how to analyze academic studies critically. However, undergraduate students sometimes struggle with such papers. Take a look at this article if you don’t know how to critique an article. It will surely be of great use to you.<br />
<H2>How to Critique an Article: Your First Steps</H2><br />
A person who has to critique a journal article should pay attention to such aspects as research methodology, hypothesis, analysis of findings, and theoretical background of the study. This is a model that will help you analyze a study critically:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you need to look at the hypothesis formulated by the researchers. You need to determine if it can or cannot be properly tested by research methods used in the study..</li>
<li>Secondly, you need to look at the dependent and independent variables of the study. Can the relations between them be traced and measured? If the relations between these variables cannot be properly measured, this study is most likely to be flawed.</li>
<li>Almost every study is based on some theory or even a set of theories. This is why you need to learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of these theoretical models.</li>
<li>Researchers can employ a variety of methods to collect and analyze data. So, you should assess these research methods and determine whether they fit this particular study.</li>
<li>Think about the findings of the study and its potential implications. Does this study offer anything new about the topic, problem or question?</li>
</ol>
<p><H2>How to Critique an Article: Dos and Don’ts</H2><br />
When you write your paper, you need to stick to several rules that will help you write a good critique. These rules of thumb can be of great use to people who don’t know how to critique an article:<br />
<span id="more-2028"></span><br />
<img src="http://blog.a-pluss.com/wp-content/uploads/a-pluss.com/2012/03/article-critique.jpg" alt="article-critique" title="article-critique" width="200" height="197" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2032" />
<ol>
<li>First, you should avoid transforming your critique into a simple summary. Certainly, a critique has some elements of a summary, but its main purpose is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the critiqued work.</li>
<li>If the author uses terms that you don’t know, you should look them up in the dictionary. Remember that improper word choice can greatly reduce the quality of your paper.</li>
<li>Don’t criticize or praise an aspect of the article unless you can back up your claims with good examples. For instance, if you think that the author’s hypothesis is trivial, you need to explain why it is trivial.</li>
<li>Don’t separate the research article your are critiquing from other studies done in the same area. Look at other research articles and determine whether they support the ideas of the author.</li>
</ol>
<p><H2>How to Critique an Article: Other Important Points to Keep In Mind</H2><br />
Finally, students should remember that an article critique is not another boring paper, but a great chance to show off your analytical skills and erudition. If you approach it as an interesting challenge, you’ll find this task easier. Hopefully, now you have a better idea of how to critique an academic article.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://blog.a-pluss.com/wp-content/uploads/a-pluss.com/2012/03/introduction-to-poetry-analysis.jpg" alt="introduction-to-poetry-analysis" title="introduction-to-poetry-analysis" width="200" height="273" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2020" />Introduction to Poetry is one of the famous poems by Billy Collins. In it, the author expresses his views on the interpretation of poetry. In addition, he shows the most common mistakes that people can make while studying poetry and literature, in general. This article will give several insights into this poem and show how it can be interpreted and analyzed.</p>
<h2>Introduction to Poetry Analysis: Understanding a Work of Art</h2>
<p>In his poem, Billy Collins attempts to demonstrate that there is no universal way of studying and understanding poetry. He shows how students and even professional critics can misinterpret and misunderstand. This is how Collins describes their efforts:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
But all they want to do<br />
is tie the poem to a chair with rope<br />
and torture a confession out of it.<br />
They begin beating it with a hose<br />
to find out what it really means.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
(Billy Collins)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Overall, he stresses the idea that a poem is not a mathematical equation that can be easily solved by a single method. Such an approach to literature is utterly flawed because it completely overlooks the individuality of the author.  </p>
<h2>Introduction to Poetry Analysis:  Analyzing Literature</h2>
<p>Introductions to Poetry is a very interesting work because it shows how people can approach literary works. Here are some examples that you may consider:<br />
<span id="more-2018"></span><br />
<img src="http://blog.a-pluss.com/wp-content/uploads/a-pluss.com/2012/03/analysis-of-introduction-to-poetry.jpg" alt="analysis-of-introduction-to-poetry" title="analysis-of-introduction-to-poetry" width="200" height="192" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2022" />
<ol>
<li>First, Billy Collins compares poems to paintings when he asks the readers to “take a poem and hold it up to the light like a color slide”. So, at first, he urges people to focus on visual images that a poem conjures.</li>
<li>Moreover, the author asks readers to listen to the melody of a poem, when he says “press an ear against its hive”. Unfortunately, many people don’t read poetry aloud, and as a result they don’t fully understand it.</li>
<li> When Billy Collins urges readers to “waterski across the surface of a poem”, he asks them to go beyond the limits of convention. So, if you have to do an Introduction to Poetry analysis, try to come up with various interpretations, even if they run contrary to popular opinion.</li>
<li>Finally, an analysis of Introduction to Poetry should be based on the study of rhyme, meter, figurative language, and rhetoric. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Introduction to Poetry Analysis: Main Lessons</h2>
<p>So, Introduction to Poetry is a very interesting poem. It is also a set of guidelines to how a person should analyze poetry; moreover, it also warns readers against possible pitfalls of studying poetry as some kind of data set. Hopefully, you won’t forget about Billy Collins’ recommendations when writing your papers.</p>

Indeed, university standards are much higher than those of your high school. However, there is no need to panic. Check this universal recipe to understand what you need to complete high quality <strong>university essays</strong> and receive excellent grades for them.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>University essay: about this recipe</strong><br />

This is a classic recipe of a homemade university paper. Certainly, the first thing you should remember about your university projects is that they are all different. You will see that different professors have different requirements depending on their subjects and even personal views. However, most papers deserving good grades share a number of common features which you can find in this recipe.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<ol>
<li>Understand your topic and bear in mind that most <strong>university essay</strong> questions are debatable. There is not a single right answer and you need to show that you see different sides of the problem. You may use appropriate constructions, such as on the one hand, on the other hand, at the same time, not only…, but also.</li>
<li>Investigate your topic. Find resources related to your topic, read them carefully, analyze and synthesize what you have read and draw your own conclusions. The latter part is especially important. In contrast to high school, summarizing and paraphrasing of what you have read would not impress your tutors. Include your own understanding of the problem.</li>
<li>Make a claim. Express your main conclusion in the form of a thesis statement at the end of the introduction paragraph. When making claims in university essays, try to spark the interest of your readers. The worst possible response to your claim is the reader’s question “So what?” The best response is “I would like to learn more about it”.</li>
<li>Develop creative arguments. When writing essays, university students are expected to predict the counterarguments of potential readers. Imagine your tutors or peers reading your paper and saying “What about…?” Try to answer their questions before they are asked.</li>
<li>Plan your paper. Develop an outline to improve your university essay structure. Decide in what paragraph to include each of your arguments to gain maximum effects. Start writing. Mind university essay word limit.</li>
<li>Add appropriate tone and careful language. Use respectful and amiable tone for your university essays to acknowledge the fact that your position is only one of possible perspectives. Your goal is to show why you think your readers may share your views, instead of persuading the audience that your claims are absolute truths. To achieve this goal, use careful language, such as “these findings suggest that”, “it seems that”.</li>
<li>Add a reference list in proper format. Make a break. Leave your paper for several hours and let it cool down.</li>
<li>Proofread several times before serving. Take care of proper presentation (font, spacing, margins, and citation style).</li>
</ol>
<p>So, this was a classic recipe of an outstanding <strong>university essay</strong>. You may use it to impress your professors during the term or on special occasions, such as exams and applications.</p>
