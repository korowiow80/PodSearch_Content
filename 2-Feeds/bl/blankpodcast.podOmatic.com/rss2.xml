      <title>The BLANK Podcast - Episode 5</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1141411/600x600_1067825.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EPISODE 5 NOTES 

&#8220;Cock-A-Doodle-Doo&#8221; 

We're back with over 30 minutes of love to give! Oh, and Happy Turkey Day, everyone! Sorry for the delay. Like I said last time personal issues sprang up, which made it hard to get this show out&#8212;we actually recorded this in late October, but it took me forever to edit. In this episode we wing it with no prep time whatsoever (it was the wife's idea, so blame her!) So enjoy the show and have a wonderful week! 

TOPICS (FYI: * denotes a permanent show segment.) 

01. We have a long (ha-ha) discussion about male genitalia.  

02. *Movie Time!: We spill the beans on Zack and Miri Make a Porno. 

03. The wife shows me some love...and then spoils it by ranting about having to cook for me.

&#8220;Don&#8217;t Hiatus&#8221;
                
Yes, we&#8217;re going on hiatus for a little while. Personal issues have strung up that need to be dealt with and it&#8217;s hard to do that when you have a show to run and you&#8217;re the only person doing it (i.e. editing, posting, etc.) Don&#8217;t worry. We&#8217;ll have a few companion pieces following soon after this one to keep you busy. So enjoy the show and have a wonderful week!  
                
TOPICS (FYI: * denotes a permanent show segment.)

09. The Lottery: Did we win&#8230;? 
10. *The Stoner Corner: Mary Jane couldn&#8217;t be with us this time around, so we pulled a clip from Youtube.com to teach you the finer points of &#8220;getting high for the first time&#8221;.

&#8220;An Accident Waiting to Happen&#8221;

Is it? You be the judge! In our first episode we have an actual format! Michelle and I talk about everything from really weird stuff to Jizz Chips. Did we do as good as (or better than) the zero episode? You tell us! Thanks!


TOPICS (FYI: * denotes a permanent show segment.)

1.	Patting ourselves on the back (but only for the first six minutes)
2.	Celebrity voice mail (?)
3.	*Really Weird Stuff: eBay (petrified thumb rock) and Craigslist (Lego guy)
4.	Dude&#8217;s underarm hair
5.	Michelle is a mixing pot of ethnicity and nicknames
6.	*At the Station: Stupid people at the pump
7.	Jizz Chips, 2 Drunks and a Podcast (Again&#8230;?!?) and a rant
8.	Southern boy speak and the mystery of Danny T
9.	Number One with a Bullet promo

&#8220;Test Drive Down the Information Highway&#8221;

TOPICS: 

1. Testing the sound &quot;quality&quot; (C...U...P?) 
2. 1-900-Michelle
3. 2 Drunks and a Podcast get props
4. Podcasting fan...sort of
5. Segway: Driving or riding?
6. Movies: The Spirit
7. Training day with roaches
8. A word from our sponser: Boner Pill X
9. Mike, the REAL podcast fan
10. Pussy whipped and crying inside

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1141411/600x600_1067815.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the other promo that I mentioned in the Naughty Version show notes. This one is a lot shorter and a lot cleaner (it's so clean a nun could listen to it and still feel good about herself the next day).

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1141411/600x600_1067815.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before we released Episode #0 (you heard it, right?) I wanted to make sure that we had a promo ready to go. What you are about to hear is the first idea that popped in my head--shows you just how sick I am :o) 
                                                                                                            I wanted to make a promo that conveyed my love for podcasts, our weird/corny/unfunny explicit humor (gotta warn the parents that this ain't for the kiddies, after all!) and give out the usual contact info. But I wanted to do it in a fun way that you might not have heard before.
                                                                                                            Well, Michelle wasn't as entertained by it as I was (I think she said something about watching old people cross the street was more entertaining), so I decided to try and think of something else as quickly as possible b/c I was ready to post our first episode. So I threw together the music version (sorry...I know it's not that great) and was going to delete this one but then I thought &quot;Screw it&quot; and decided to post it anyway.
                                                                                                            Let me know what you think at blankpodcast@gmail.com or www.myspace.com/blankpodcast.
