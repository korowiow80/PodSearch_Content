<p>Old friend of the Blueprint, Paul Mosley, is back, and he&#8217;s got his new album <em>The Romantic</em> in his pocket and a fine ukulele in his mitts. He gives us exclusive live performances of a few songs from the new record, as well as joining in with some admittedly drunken chat with Chris, who interrupts more often than Jeremy Paxman (in Paxman&#8217;s defence he usually has something relevant to say when he does it).</p>
<p>Sit back and enjoy a free half hour of slightly cracked jollity and fine music, before heading off with the Blueprint Podcast&#8217;s recommendation to buy The Romantic (and perhaps some of its associated merchanise) from <a href="http://paulmosley.greedbag.com/buy/the-romantic-deluxe-edition-cd-2/" target="_blank">the official Paul Mosley shop</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might want to run a hot bath before you listen to this week’s episode, because it’s possibly the darkest and dirtiest episode of The Blueprint so far and you might want to wash it off you after you hear it.</p>
<p>We move in and out of various issues whilst involving a strange encounter in the street, which takes us onto the quite unconnected issue of service standards, leading of course to prostitution, sexism, prejudice against millionaires, time travel karaoke.</p>
<p>Eventually we get onto a quirky story involving Lord Sir Alan Sugar of Apprentice and someone who really really liked reading his autobiography. From there we arrive at a groundbreaking new idea to replace boring old-fashioned applause.</p>
<p>Join us next week for more Blueprint frolics.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A thrill-packed episode this week. We hear news from Dave, who is still in France seeking out Xavier Laurent, and there&#8217;s a News Roundup as well as a game of Quotations to task your brain.</p>
<p>We also discuss some quirky stories, including one in which a pilot does something so inexplicable as to make us say bad things about all pilots, possibly risking our future admittance to aircraft. We&#8217;re sure that most if not very nearly all pilots aren&#8217;t stupid idiots who stumble into planes and press two buttons before throwing coffee around, but the story in question suggests that there&#8217;s at least one who does.</p>
<p>Please take a few moments to complete our <a href="http://www.podtrac.com/audience/start-survey.aspx?ver=1&amp;pid=Xtdh_eZMtpk$">listener survey</a> so we know what we&#8217;re doing right and wrong and to whom.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be back with episode 83 next Friday so please join us then and tell your friends how lovely we are, because we&#8217;re always telling ours about how much we like you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many thanks to everyone who listened to Episode 80 and the return to the cyberwaves of The Blueprint. A special thanks to our American and Chinese listeners who far outnumbered everyone else (including our home turf in the UK!)</p>
<p>We hope that Chinese listeners were pleased to hear themselves featured in the Who&#8217;s The Greatest game we played during episode 80, and that they also understood what the hell was going on.</p>
<p>For the American listeners to our British banter, warm greetings. Please can you send us some American things? For every American thing we receive we will send you a British thing. No cars please, they&#8217;re a paperwork nightmare.<br />
This week we&#8217;re back with some quirky news stories, a News Roundup and a bit of uplifting chat about how winter makes everyone want to hide in a cupboard until the sun comes out again.</p>
<p>James&#8217; Entropy Hoover is his intellectual property and if you build one you have to give him a wheelbarrow full of money.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/news/Graffiti-may-stain-church-for.6588322.jp">Graffiti may stain church for years</a></p>
<p>Now  I&#8217;m not religious at all, but I do appreciate a nice building, and for  better or worse churches are some of the best old buildings around.</p>
<p>Trouble  is, whatever little twat did this doesn&#8217;t give a flying one about anything  older than they are and will now become a legend at school for their  graffiti getting in the local paper.  The idea of the police appealing for witnesses seems daft because any  other kids who were around at the time aren&#8217;t going to grass on 6TBK (or  Shorty). They could look out for a big fat kid ordering 60 Burger King  meals, but I don&#8217;t hold out much hope.</p>
<p>When I was about 13, I  offered my newly-bleached school haversack around the class for them to  graffiti on with a marker pen so that it would look cool. Previously  another kid had tried to graffiti their own new bag with the names of  bands they liked and it looked contrived, so I thought my plan was  better. The only rule was that they weren&#8217;t allowed to write over the  picture of Humphrey Bogart that I&#8217;d drawn in the middle (it was the 1980s and old films were very cool then. I&#8217;d copied the Bogart picture from a <em>Casablanca </em>poster I had on my bedroom wall). It did look  pretty good by morning break the same day.</p>
<p>Sadly a lot of my pals  used the opportunity to declare their love for their boy and  girlfriends, and a few weeks later when they had all finished with each  other my bag became a moving noticeboard of heartbreak and shame. It  soon looked like it had been censored by the CIA.</p>
<p>In two or three  weeks 6TBK will probably no longer love Shorty and start going out with  her mate instead. The cops should hang around looking for 6TBK returning  to the scene to scribble it out.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the absence of any new podcast episodes, I (Chris) thought that I&#8217;d throw up some blog entries here instead. Here&#8217;s one now.</p>
<p>This morning my train to work is about a quarter full of people who appear to share my Monday morning feelings of muted despair in the face of the week ahead. We are all alone in the same way that we would be in a lift, ignoring each other but probably able to take a pretty good stab at speaking one another’s thoughts.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe it’s Monday already.”</p>
<p>“I felt so upbeat on Friday, but now look.”</p>
<p>“I wasted my free time, and now I have to go to work again.”</p>
<p>“I should leave this job and get a new one.”</p>
<p>“I should leave society and go and live in a camper van.”</p>
<p>“I can’t afford a camper van.”</p>
<p>Most of us work five days out of seven, and then we spend two days tidying up after ourselves and getting ready for the next five. We feel a sense of great accomplishment because we’ve got all of our washing done ready for us to wear and throw back into the washing basket ready for next weekend’s triumph of organisation and good laundry practice. We are pleased that we have five plastic containers in the freezer each holding a meal for us to eat at our desks while our bosses fail to notice or reward the fact that we never go out for a proper lunchbreak.</p>
<p>These things prepared, maybe we can have a Good Week this week. We will eat healthily, exercise in the evenings and get enough sleep. We will keep our homes presentable so that the invisible people who deliver the daily takeaway menus and Aldi leaflets will think that we are switched-on and contented.</p>
<p>But now it is Monday morning, and the train is lying to us. We almost glance at each other as we realise that even though it’s two minutes late, the electronic sign in the station is pretending that or train has already been and gone. We watch the sign cycle through information about trains to exotic places ten miles in the opposite direction and we all experience a sort of damp panic at the idea that our train really has been through the station without us noticing it.</p>
<p>Then we take comfort in each other. Not like how other people’s friends or other people’s families do; not with hugs or reassuring chats, not with offers of help or even vague gestures of support. We just look at each other in the knowledge that we are the same loose group who always get on our train, and we can’t all be wrong.</p>
<p>We’re like raindrops looking at each other to make sure it’s raining. There must be times when a raindrop goes too early, right? There has to be an over-eager and inexperienced raindrop involved in every time we remark that we’re sure we just felt rain and then stand with our palms and faces pointing skyward waiting for confirmation. Perhaps if we could hear better we’d sometimes hear a lone raindrop shouting “Leeroy Jenkins!” and launching itself at the ground while the rest roll their eyes and await the proper signal.</p>
<p>Then our train arrives and we forget that there was ever a problem. It isn’t a big enough story to tell anyone about. Well not out loud anyway. Not unless it happens a lot, at which point you can still only tell each other, but we never speak to the other people who get on our train.</p>
<p>We are strangers who know a few things about one another. The guy with the mod-style haircut probably knows that I have recently given up smoking because I no longer stop outside the station for a cigarette when I arrive. I believe that the attractive but unconfident-looking girl is probably a student because she disappears outside term time and looks a bit too young to be a teacher. It’s like a very low-circulating but equally valid celebrity magazine.</p>
<p>The train driver looks at where most of us are standing and carefully positions the doors of the train somewhere else. We move towards them like the world’s worst tennis players anticipating a ball, as one of us hits the jackpot and finds the door stop in front of us, before realising that the Devil has given us a deal. The one who stands before the door must now stab at the &#8220;open&#8221; button until the driver activates it just at the moment where we start to feel ridiculous.</p>
<p>On the other side of the door, people who work where we live wait to disembark while one of them casually, then purposefully and finally frantically jabs at the interior version of the door button. Then they emerge, for some reason always appearing surprised, and start their day. In our minds, they get the hell out of our way so that we can get on. Their faces are familiar too, but they don’t belong to us. They don’t get on our train, they get off it.</p>
<p>There are plenty of seats on our train so we all take two and place a bag on the seat next to us, knowing that anyone insane enough to want to sit next to someone is someone we don’t want to sit next to. Most of us fiddle with our phones; some read a copy of Metro left on the seat. Unlike the journey home there are hardly ever any drunks and so nobody speaks to us except for the train conductor asking to see our tickets. Once in a while there are two people who know each other and they come to life while the rest of us silently and passively hate them.</p>
<p>Today the train passed a horse in a small field. It wore headgear but no saddle, and was alone; running in jubilant circles around a drinking trough.  It must have thought it was Friday.</p>

<p>We found ourselves a friendly pub where we were well looked-after by staff and customers alike. Chris beat the landlord at darts, while Dave did card tricks and played guitar. It was a great night out, and it took us most of the next day to be ready to record podcasts.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Chris, feet well and truly under the table at the pub in Nottingham:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Episode 76, we reminisce about our old pal Xavier Laurent, who has refused to speak to us for some time now following the various problems we had with translators. Dave&#8217;s been putting some work in on that front, so we&#8217;ll hopefully have some Xavier-based information to give you soon, but not this week.</p>
<p>Dave talks us through how France narrowly avoided becoming a far-right-wing nation, but it soon descends into bum jokes.</p>
<p>Chris has conducted an experiment by reading a load of propaganda to find out what it might have been like to be a Nazi. Happily he managed to avoid becoming one. Phew. We discuss the Nazis in a manner which avoids the use of any facts whatsoever.</p>
<p>All in all, though, we&#8217;re happy, chuckling dudes. Quite early on, Chris mentions Gil Gerard, who played Buck Rogers in the late 1970s-early 1980s version of the franchise. However, as a kid, Chris had a massive crush on Erin Gray, who played Wilma Deering, so we&#8217;ll have a picture of her instead.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We like to stick a flag on world events once in a while, and with the recent pointless conviction of the founders of Pirate Bay, we tackle noise theft in this episode.</p>
<p>Having reloaded their special foot-shooting gun some years after taking down Napster and causing file-sharing to become the many-headed monster that it is today, the people who themselves live in order to make huge sums of money from the work of creative people who are paid far less have done it again.</p>
<p>Pirate Bay is still there, and even if it wasn&#8217;t, Mininova is, and so is Piraboogle and all the rest of them.</p>
<p>Spotify, which is pretty much the same thing that Napster suggested ten years ago, has now occupied a position whereby everything is legal, the music industry make money out of it, and the consumer gets instant access to free tunes. Perfect, if wholly ridiculous that they didn&#8217;t just let Napster provide the same service back in the day.</p>
<p>They could do the same thing with movies and TV shows if they felt like it. In fact, I can legally watch On Demand television through my Virgin Media connection, but if I miss, say <em>Lost</em> one day and wanted to catch up with it the next, it would be illegal for me to download the episode using bittorrent using the same connection. Mental.</p>
<p>The Napster case just fragmented the issue and made it unmanageable for years. The Pirate Bay issue will do the same thing again, and here&#8217;s the kicker &#8211; it was fragmented already, because bittorrent doesn&#8217;t rely on one website&#8217;s existence to work. It relies on bittorrent clients which are available for free download. Even those are plentiful.</p>
<p>The lawyers can play Whack-A-Mole until they retire, and it&#8217;s they who are really sucking the money out of the music and DVD industries. They&#8217;re the ones who have somehow got people convinced that chasing website owners is better than actually trying to do something positive about the way that copyrighted content is delivered in the 21st Century.</p>
<p>Spotify works, so create the exact same service for movies and TV shows, you absolute bunch of idiots.</p>
<p>Rant over. We also give you a scat singing masterclass during this episode, but not before a thrilling game of Dog Bingo.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this week&#8217;s podcast. This week&#8217;s photo is of some file sharing.</p>

Hitler killed that little tash he had as a style option, but other dictators were smart enough to go for a more generic style so that people didn&#8217;t use a finger across the top lip to create a simple yet effective impersonation of them.</p>

<p>Nerds are on my mind again. Possibly I think of nerds because I am one. Possibly because I worry about them and how upset they get about things like the new <em>Star Trek </em>film.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for this reason that I regale you with the story ofhow myself, Dave and some other old pals all went to watch <em>Highlander II</em> together, and the way we felt about that.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tell the people, episode 71 is here. Once again it&#8217;s Chris podcasting on his own, which sounds totally rude.</p>
<p>We bring you the lastest from The Blueprint Podcast News Roundup, which this week focuses on the worlds of Law, Twitter, celebrities, The Cure, The Ting Tings, and quasi-computer-illiterate office workers.</p>
<p>Then, it&#8217;s a journey into the World of Men via their facial hair. If you think about it for long enough, any hair is a bit weird, and the way we style it and cut it and so on is even weirder. Facial hair seems doubly so.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 430px"><img title="Some moustaches yesterday" src="http://www.blueprintpodcast.com/blog-images/moustache1.gif" alt="Some moustaches yesterday - which one should I go for?" width="420" height="382" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Some moustaches yesterday - which one should I go for?</p></div>
<p>This train of thought comes about because Chris is about to embark on a most male trial, that of the growing of a charity moustache. If you&#8217;d like to sponsor Chris to grow a moustache and help terminally-ill people and their loved ones to enjoy a better quality of life, please go to <a title="http://www.justgiving.com/chris-tash" href="http://www.justgiving.com/chris-tash" target="_blank">http://www.justgiving.com/chris-tash</a> and give as much or as little as you feel comfortable with.</p>
<p>Episode 72 will be steaming your way in but a week from now.</p>

<p>And <strong>ALSO</strong>&#8230;</p>
<p>Hi everyone.</p>

Hi everyone.
I, Chris, am growing a charity moustache during the month of April 09. It&#8217;s in aid of the Hartlepool and District Hospice, which provides terminally ill people and their loved ones with a better quality of life.
I&#8217;ll be posting photos of my tash progress here and on Twitter so that sponsors can see their investment flourish as well as give to a very good cause.
We&#8217;ve never asked you for a penny for 69 episodes of Blueprint fun, so please give a few quid to charity &#8211; you can donate online by going to&#8230;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have become Twits recently, or at least Chris has, and you&#8217;ll find him (me (him)) Twittering most days.</p>
<p>Twitter is a fun little thing. It&#8217;s a bit like an unholy union between the status updates of Facebook and the chat rooms of the Internet&#8217;s earlier days. The best thing about it is that many famous people are there, and you can pretend that you&#8217;re friends with them, even if they largely ignore your sicophantic overtures.</p>
<p>So far, I have been ignored by Stephen Fry, Jonathan Ross and Richard Herring. Oh, and Wesley Crusher from Star Trek, as well. Not a bad list of ignorers, I trust you&#8217;ll agree. I aim to be ignored by royalty and a talking animal by the end of this year.</p>
<p>You can come and see what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes if you go to <a title="http://twitter.com/BlueprintPod" href="http://twitter.com/BlueprintPod" target="_blank">http://twitter.com/BlueprintPod</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A podcast really isn&#8217;t a podcast until it&#8217;s dealt with the thorny issue of foreign news bulletins which use the song <em>Tequila!</em> as their background music.</p>
<p>Finally we&#8217;re putting that right, can&#8217;t believe it took us until episode 67 to do that.On the upside, though, it gives Chris a chance to tell a story with no ending about a day out in London he had about a decade ago.</p>
<p>I feel a bit like James Bond at the moment, because I&#8217;m typing this using my electronic laptop computer, and what&#8217;s more I&#8217;m doing so in a hotel in Cairo. Get me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the time of writing, the city of London is recovering from what sounds like a post-nuclear war nightmare. Those hurricanes and earthquakes you hear about in non-English speaking countries are nothing compared to the grisly horror that smashed London yesterday.</p>
<p>It snowed a bit.</p>
<p>Literally millions of flakes of snow smashed into London&#8217;s gold-paved streets, causing the distant memory of the Word War II Blitz to spring back into glorious Technicolor as plucky Londoners stayed at home or got taxis instead of buses.</p>
<p>London&#8217;s famous buses were absent from the city all day, as the presence of wintry weather meant that any attempt to drive a bus in the city would have meant famous landmarks such as the Houses of Parliament, Nelson&#8217;s Column and the London Eye would have been destroyed in an orgy of runaway buses skidding violently into the historic structures.</p>
<p>National television obviously responded, allowing the rest of the United Kingdom to sympathise with the capital. The BBC provided vital help for stranded Brits by showing news pieces [<em>this next bit is absolutely true</em>] in which a man from the Automobile Association demonstrated how to scrape snow off a car.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in countries like Norway, Finland, Greenland, Canada, Switzerland, Russia and Iceland, time stood still as eyes turned toward London filled with fear and wondering how the city would possibly cope with it being a bit snowy. Sadly, at no point in time have eyes from London ever turned back towards those countries to see how they do it.</p>
<p>Today, the clearup continues as national news continues to bring reports that the snow has gone slushy or icy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may be taken aback by the blatant Google-courting in the title of this week&#8217;s episode. Hopefully, though, you&#8217;ll find this one to be full of laughs, smiles and occasional clearing of the throat.</p>
<p>We kick things off pretty quickly with a game of Who on Earth? for which Dave had prepared a sort of audio B movie, and then get into some pseudo-gritty reportage with mention for Heathrow Airport and its new runway. It&#8217;s one of those local news stories with international ripples. The international part would be the idea that a new runway would increase traffic in and out of the English capital. The local part would be that if you live in London it will be noisier.</p>
<p>An Australian naval commander is cornered by a men&#8217;s magazine called <a title="Ralph - an Australian men's magazine" href="http://ralph.ninemsn.com.au/" target="_blank">Ralph</a> into making a mildly sexist remark, and when it&#8217;s taken out of context and passed around the media, he ends up being demonised. No fair, say the Blueprint.</p>
<p>Regular listeners will be surprised to hear that we&#8217;ve managed to negotiate ourselves another audience with our French counterpart, Xavier Laurent, and this time we&#8217;ve got working translation equipment, so will things go a bit more smoothly now?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also got our News Roundup, and Dave goes in a mood for your entertainment.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As 2009 swings into action, bringing with it uncertainty for many, disaster for some, and hopefully joy and happiness for others, The Blueprint Podcast continues to provide you with a bit of fun chat all the way from England.</p>
<p>In this episode, Dave visits a farty shop, which brings us to discussion of why farts are funny, and why egg sandwiches smell of farts when they aren&#8217;t made of poo.</p>
<p>The hamster portion of the episode relates to the extraordinary behaviour of Chris&#8217;s son&#8217;s hamster recently, and does not concern Richard Hammond on this occasion, although both had experiences with certain superficial similarities.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/613064.stm" target="_blank">another example of a hamster doing the same thing</a> from the BBC News website, as mentioned in the podcast.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, let&#8217;s start with a Christmas apology. Those of you who turned up here on Boxing Day expecting a new episode will doubtless be incandescent with rage that we didn&#8217;t post one. </p>
<p>In the words of Doctor Who, we&#8217;re sorry, we&#8217;re so sorry.</p>
<p>The reason, much as I wish it was more exciting, was a simple broken Internet connection, and it was more time-consuming than usual to get it fixed because of the presence of Christmas.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;re here now, and we&#8217;ve got a good episode to usher in 2009. In epiosde 60, we play a new game of Who&#8217;s The Greatest, in which Dracula, The Mummy, The Wolfman and Frankenstein&#8217;s Monster are tested against various odd benchmarks.</p>
<p>We also try to ascertain what Marconi plays in the Starship song <em>We Built This City</em>. Chris thinks it says &#8220;La Bamba&#8221;, Dave thinks &#8220;the bongos&#8221;, and the Internet reckons it&#8217;s &#8220;the Mamba&#8221;.</p>
<p>Following the recording of this episode, we had a further delve into the world of knowledge, and here&#8217;s what Wikipedia says a &#8220;mamba&#8221; can be:</p>
<p>Mamba, a genus of snakes<br />
<em>Mamba</em>, a 1930 film<br />
Armstrong Siddeley Mamba, an aircraft engine<br />
Mamba (roller coaster), a hypercoaster<br />
Mamba Armoured Personnel Carrier<br />
Mamba (candy)<br />
Mamba, the nickname of NBA player Kobe Bryant<br />
Mamba, Tibet</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also aware that it&#8217;s a type of Adidas trainer. So, which of those things could Marconi be playing? I suppose it&#8217;s possible that Marconi could be playing Kobe Bryant at basketball, but it seems somehow incongruous, and being British we know little of this &#8220;basket ball&#8221; of which you speak.</p>
<p>Your answers would be massively appreciated, especially if you&#8217;re Bernie Taupin, Martin Page, Dennis Lambert, and Peter Wolf (they wrote the song), or a member of Starship (they sang it).</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px"><img alt="Marconi plays the Mamba, or the bongos, or La Bamba. YOU decide." src="http://www.blueprintpodcast.com/blog-images/marconi-plays-the-mamba.jpg" title="Marconi builds a city on rock n roll." width="450" height="340" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Marconi plays the Mamba, or the bongos, or La Bamba. YOU decide.</p></div>
<p>All silliness aside, both Chris and Dave wish you and the people who matter to you a very happy 2009. </p>
<p>If 2008 has been great, then here&#8217;s to more of the same. If 2008 has been soul destroying, then here&#8217;s hoping that &#8217;09 is so different as to be unrecognisable as a year at all.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be back in a week, keep it sleek.</p>

But we&#8217;re here now, and we&#8217;ve got a good episode to usher in 2009. In epiosde 60, we play a new game of Who&#8217;s The Greatest, in which Dracula, The Mummy, The Wolfman and Frankenstein&#8217;s Monster are tested against various odd benchmarks.
We also try to ascertain what Marconi plays in the Starship song We Built This City. Chris thinks it says &#8220;La Bamba&#8221;, Dave thinks &#8220;the bongos&#8221;, and the Internet reckons it&#8217;s &#8220;the Mamba&#8221;.
Following the recording of this episode, we had a further delve into the world of knowledge, and here&#8217;s what Wikipedia says a &#8220;mamba&#8221; can be:
Mamba, a genus of snakes
Mamba, a 1930 film
Armstrong Siddeley Mamba, an aircraft engine
Mamba (roller coaster), a hypercoaster
Mamba Armoured Personnel Carrier
Mamba (candy)
Mamba, the nickname of NBA player Kobe Bryant
Mamba, Tibet
We&#8217;re also aware that it&#8217;s a type of Adidas trainer. So, which of those things could Marconi be playing? I suppose it&#8217;s possible that Marconi could be playing Kobe Bryant at basketball, but it seems somehow incongruous, and being British we know little of this &#8220;basket ball&#8221; of which you speak.
Your answers would be massively appreciated, especially if you&#8217;re Bernie Taupin, Martin Page, Dennis Lambert, and Peter Wolf (they wrote the song), or a member of Starship (they sang it).
Marconi plays the Mamba, or the bongos, or La Bamba. YOU decide.
All silliness aside, both Chris and Dave wish you and the people who matter to you a very happy 2009. 
If 2008 has been great, then here&#8217;s to more of the same. If 2008 has been soul destroying, then here&#8217;s hoping that &#8217;09 is so different as to be unrecognisable as a year at all.
We&#8217;ll be back in a week, keep it sleek.</itunes:summary>

<p>Received Pronounciation is what brings us onto the subjects of Frankenstein and mentalism, because of actor Ernest Thesiger&#8217;s thorough use of the letters in words, and Polish mind reader Chan Canasta&#8217;s unique way of speaking in a second language.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re straight into the action this week, with some discussion about the sinister nature of old school photographs when displayed in the homes of adults.</p>
<p>Chris says &#8220;literally&#8221; a bit too much, and Superman somehow gets involved again. We&#8217;re always talking about Superman, us.</p>
<p>This takes us onto serial killers, and we hang around there for a while. Both Chris and Dave have ideas for a serial killer movie. Let us know which one you would rather go to see at your local cinema, or movie theater if you live in America, as many of you do.</p>
<p>Not many comedy podcasts will tackle serial killers for you, but we will. The more we listen to our movie ideas, the more we wish that we had easy access to rich movie producers. If YOU are a rich movie executive with decision-making powers, get in touch with us and we might let you make <em>The Pizza Wheel Murders</em> or <em>I&#8217;ve Got Legs</em>.</p>
<p>The Emperor Ming from Flash Gordon gets a long overdue telling-off for his misdeeds and general flaws in character. Other movie villains are also admonished for their low-quality execution of executions.</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 370px"><img title="The Pizza Wheel Murders - if youre not dead in 30 minutes, hell kill you for free." src="http://www.blueprintpodcast.com/blog-images/pizza-wheel-murders.jpg" alt="The Pizza Wheel Murders - if youre not dead in 30 minutes, hell kill you for free." width="360" height="600" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Pizza Wheel Murders - if youre not dead in 30 minutes, he&#39;ll kill you for free.</p></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 56 is a veritable smorgasbord of worldwide interest and competitive chat. Not only do we make a further attempt to speak to Xavier Laurent in France, but we have received an audio greeting all the way from the Netherlands.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also got a brand new game to play on the subject of quotations, which those of you who are fond of guessing things will adore.</p>
<p>We also chat about Indiana Jones&#8217; CV (that&#8217;s his résumé if you&#8217;re in the US), and some talk of hydrotherapy leads to an idea for criminal swimmers.</p>

<p>We&#8217;d also like to take this opportunity to point you in the direction of some other great podcasts which are floating around the interwaves.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.comedy.org.uk/podcasts/collingsherrin/" target="_blank">Collins and Herring&#8217;s podcast</a> is two famous guys enjoying a bit of chat and banter, and there are plenty of laughs in it, as well as lots of swearing. They&#8217;re nice and long, at over an hour each, so if you&#8217;re at the gym or on a long journey, make sure you take these two with you, as well as The Blueprint, of course.</p>
<p>Stephen Fry, possibly one of the world&#8217;s busiest and most widely-talented living creatures, has some podcast episodes, or <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/media/" target="_blank">Podgrams</a> as he prefers to call them.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, it&#8217;s episode 55 of The Blueprint, the British talk radio podcast that brings you the fun behind the mysteries of language and truth, whilst transcending boundaries of distance, speed and endurance. Or something like that.</p>
<p>In this episode, we have another go at contacting our French friend, Xavier, using some cutting edge technology. It goes reasonably well, we think.</p>
<p>The big news this week is another exciting new feature called Real Or Phoney, in which we throw truth and lies around like confetti at the marriage of Mr Veracity to Miss Duplicity.</p>
<p>We hope you&#8217;re enjoying the show, please drop us a line if you&#8217;ve got anything to say, ask, or complain to us about.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Yes, it&#8217;s episode 55 of The Blueprint, the British talk radio podcast that brings you the fun behind the mysteries of language and truth, whilst transcending boundaries of distance, speed and endurance. Or something like that.
In this episode, we have another go at contacting our French friend, Xavier, using some cutting edge technology. It goes reasonably well, we think.
The big news this week is another exciting new feature called Real Or Phoney, in which we throw truth and lies around like confetti at the marriage of Mr Veracity to Miss Duplicity.
We hope you&#8217;re enjoying the show, please drop us a line if you&#8217;ve got anything to say, ask, or complain to us about.
This lady is either demonstrating a sneeze for us, or this photo has something to do with one of Dave&#39;s other topics about the speed of bodily functions.
Join us for more Blueprint fun and laughter next week.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to episode 53, in which Chris and Dave once again tackle the mighty issues of the day.</p>
<p>This week, after some parenting advice from Chris regarding <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, we&#8217;re keen to settle once and for all the question of who&#8217;s the greatest &#8211; Batman, Spiderman or Superman? As laymen in the superhero knowledge world, we don&#8217;t use the usual set of criteria for judging such things, though. We&#8217;ve got our own ideas.</p>
<p>For example, with which of the three would you feel most uncomfortable if you were trapped with them, naked in a lift (elevator, American listeners). Which would make the best rabbi? You get the picture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Proof positive of the fairness of this week's debate" src="http://www.blueprintpodcast.com/blog-images/whogreat1.jpg" alt="If you dont want to know the result, look away now." width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>This week&#8217;s visual aid constitutes proof of the result of the first &#8220;Who&#8217;s The Greatest&#8221; contest.</p>
<p>Please take the time to fill in our <a title="Listener Survey" href="http://www.podtrac.com/audience/start-survey.aspx?ver=1&amp;pid=Xtdh_eZMtpk$" target="_blank">Listener Survey</a> &#8211; it only takes a minute or two, and it helps us to find out, broadly speaking, what sort of people we&#8217;ve got listening to the podcast. That in turn helps us to improve what we do.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, hope you had a good week. We&#8217;re back once again with episode 51 of The Blueprint Podcast, right here in the UK with Chris and Dave.</p>
<p>This week, we get to the heart of the Dave Russell phenomenon by discovering a couple of things that really grind his gears.</p>
<p>We warm up first with some talk of spherical stimulating toys for babies, and an astonishing Chris Fact is revealed, closely followed by a Chris Lie.</p>
<p>Astrology is described by Wikipedia as &#8220;a group of systems, traditions, and beliefs in which knowledge of the apparent relative positions of celestial bodies and related details is held to be useful in understanding, interpreting, and organizing information about personality, human affairs, and other terrestrial matters&#8221;. It&#8217;s described by Dave as &#8220;nonsense&#8221;, and he pulls no punches with a scathing attack on the whole idea.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a firm believer in newspaper horoscopes, please have a quiet word with yourself.</p>
<p>Binoculars, or more specifically their misrepresentation in the cinema, are Dave&#8217;s second target, although Chris disagrees, and hilarity ensues.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all happening.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.blueprintpodcast.com/blog-images/astrology-binoculars.jpg" alt="Some astrology as seen through binoculars yesterday" /></p>
<p>This week&#8217;s image is the visual representation of Dave&#8217;s hate.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be back with Episode 52 at 5pm (UK Time) on Friday, 31st October. See you then.</p>
