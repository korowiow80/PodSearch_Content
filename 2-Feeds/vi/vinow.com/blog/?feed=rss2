<p>Going going, gone. Sold to the high bidder. On St Croix the Lieutenant Governor ‘s office is auctioning property.  Delinquent tax bills and long gone owners are a common story. The government has about 12.7 million dollars in outstanding tax bills that are ten years or more overdue. 900 of them will be sold at auction this year.  And the first 25 were auctioned on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governor de Jongh departed the territory this morning for meetings in Washington and New York over the next two days. He has meetings in Washington on both capital and economic development projects for St. Croix. Later, he travels to New York for additional meetings on capital projects for St. Croix and a discussion Environmental Protection Agency officials.</p>

<p>Daily News is talking about the new track and field at Ivanna Eudora Kean High School.  They say the field is making progress after 10 years of inaction. For the first time in ages, you can actually see saomethign coming to the Kean School track. Commissioner of Public Works Darryl Smalls says they are laying a special all-weather rubber surface for the ten lane track –same stuff being used at the Olympics in London.

<p>Our Department of Tourism is stepping up its marketing efforts and cultivating relations with airlines to raise visitor arrivals in the Territory.  There are always seasonal flight reductions. This year the closure of HOVENSA has led to additional reductions for St. Croix. American Airlines is suspending one of its two Miami-St. Croix flights this August. American is also reducing American Eagle service from San Juan to St. Croix from 19 flights a week down to just SEVEN weekly round-trip flights. Delta will discontinue its weekly Atlanta-St. Croix service at the end of July. Tourism Commissioner Beverly Nicholson-Doty and Port Authority Acting Executive Director, Don Mills, are meeting with airline executives at the JumpStart airline conference in California to discuss airlift and solidify partnerships. They are asking Seaborne Airlines and Cape Air to fill anticipated seat reductions, to St. Croix.  Meanwhile, airline seat capacity to St. Thomas is expected to remain relatively robust this summer and beyond.

<p>The Governor and Lieutenant Governor joined the top brass of Water and Power Authority to sign a power purchase agreement between WAPA and three companies &#8211; Toshiba International, Sun Edison and ANCO for the purchase of solar electricity.  This is the beginning to WAPA diversifying its source of energy. This is also the largest solar project in the region.  Water and Power Authority Executive Director Hugo Hodge said “The 18 megawatts of solar power represents approximately 14 to 15 percent of the territory’s peak load demand and will help to reduce customer rates once fully installed,”  This means lower energy bills with less reliance on fuel oil to power our generators. On St. Thomas the new sola arrays will be located on the roof of Tutu Park Mall and on a canopy over part of the Parking Lot.  There will also be an array near Home Depot on St. Thomas.  No solar array on St John or Water Island. Construction is scheduled to start early in 2013 and end by December 2013. WAPA anticipates getting solar electricity by January of 2014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Senate Committee on Housing approved a bill to transfer the Bournefield housing from the Port Authority to the Housing Finance Authority. If the bill becomes law, it requires the Housing Finance Authority to sell the 43 housing units for $1 each to their occupants, if they qualify for affordable housing benefits..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Senators also approved the apprenticeship programs. Labor Commissioner Albert Bryan said of the bill, “It will provide for a credentialed path toward certification in the trades, where currently we have no established path.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Virgin Islands Democratic Party selected their delegates to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina coming up in September.   The Democratic Superdelegates are:  Governor John DeJongh, Delegate Dr. Christensen; State Chairman Emmett Hansen; Vice-Chair Delores Thomas; National Committeewoman Carol Burke and; National Committeeman Glen Smith.   St. Croix elected four delegates : Carolyn M. Burke; Florine Audain Hassell; Robert Rios and; Dean Andrews. St. Thomas elected:  Pamela Richards-Samuel; Colette Conroy Monroe and; Edgar “Baker” Phillips. </p>

<p>Transit of Venus is this evening. Starting about 6 PM.  The planet Venus will slide in front of the Sun – you can see it here until sunset but do NOT look directly at the sun, You can observe this with eclipse-viewing glasses or a sun viewing pin hole camera. Binoculars that direct the image to a piece of paper is also safe. DO not look through binoculars at the sun. Sunglasses do not offer enough protection and looking directly at the sun will harm your vision.  Use a proper viewing instrument to look at the transit of Venus. This evening – baring clouds. When does it happen again 2117 – long after all of us are dead and gone. The best way to see the Transit of Venus is on the NASA web site sunearthday.nasa.gov. Long after the sunsets Nasa will continue to show the transit of Venus.  sunearthday.nasa.gov.</p>

<p><strong><em>At the top of the news on Monday June 4</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governor John DeJongh and Lieutenant Governor Gregory Francis along with the Top brass of Water and Power Authority Announced have a special event today – they will be signing a power purchase agreement between WAPA and three companies &#8211; Toshiba International, Sun Edison and ANCO for the purchase of solar electricity.  This is the beginning to our WAPA diversifying its source of energy and the largest solar project in the region. Meanwhile WAPA says they have had problems over the weekend with power generation on St. Thomas and they are working to avoid a rotation schedule. Please use energy sparingly today.  Lighten up on Air conditioning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was graduation weekend. Five schools held graduation; Antilles School, Good Hope School, Wheatley Skills Center, Adult Education and St Joseph Catholic School.  At Antilles School, 33 seniors earned their High School diplomas. The Valedictorian was Julia Hogroian and the Salutatorian was Francie Lenahan. 32 going to college. One taking a gap year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Good Hope School 24 seniors graduated. All of them are going to college and one headed to Annapolis.  The Valedictorian was Amaal Id-heil-eh and the Salutatorian was Raphael Lopez. At the Wheatley Skills Center, 93 students took home their certificates and diplomas. They are now EKG technicians, Phelebotimists, Computer techs and Auto mechanics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>St. Thomas Adult Education had diplomas for 60 students. 13 took home GED certificates and 47 earned their High School diplomas. St Joseph High School had 18 graduates. The Valedictorian was Roxane Grey and the Salutatorian was Jonique George – all 18 going to college in the fall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you missed it, the place to be on the first Saturday of the month is Home depot.  They have an activity for children allowing the kids to make projects out of wood while their parents shop for the home.  My kids love to go to the project day and always come home with a cool project they made by themselves.  My daughter calls the project day at Home depot her favorite day of the month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our virtue of the week  is <strong>Helpfulness</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are practicing <strong>helpfulness </strong>when you …Notice when someone needs help, Do a service without being asked, Give people what they need, not always what they want, Listen to someone who needs to talk, Care for your own needs, Ask for help when you need it</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Your affirmation is <em>I am helpful.  I look for ways to be of service.  I care for others and myself.  I look for helpful ways to make a difference. </em></p>

<p>Full Senate met yesterday – they approved funds for the School busses on St Croix. They also approved funds for the Department of Health to hire a consultant to write a five-year strategic plan for the division of mental health and the two hospitals. They added amendments. Neville James added an amendment to require the School year to begin no later than the second Tuesday after the first Monday in August and end no later than the first Friday in June.  If the bill becomes law, the first semester must end by December 23. The Senators approved a plan to adjust the salaries of JROTC instructors. Unless we rescind the 8% reductions we would lose the Junior ROTC programs at the High Schools.  At risk are the careers of 297 students at CAHS, 277 and Kean High, 236 at St Croix Central. Delegate Dr. Donna Christiansen chimed in congratulating the senate for saving ROTC – how much did that cost about $77,000. Senators paid tribute to the Student Rocket Club at Elena Christian Junior High School and to the athletes in the Special Olympics and Efrain Fleiciano for his work with St. Thomas rescue.  They approved a plan to rename the road around Schneider Hospital and past Lockhart Elementary School for Ariel Melchior. And the Senators approved the transfer of Lindquist Beach and Smith Bay Park to the Magen&#8217;s Bay Beach Authority.  Senators also approved amendments to correct language in the Agriculture in the School act, the rules on Tax Incremental Funding for solar energy projects and updating when the new pre-kindergarten program will begin to 2013-2014 school year. They approved two zoning change requests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Senators over rode three of th Governor’s vetoes.  They approved changes to the timing of primary elections starting in 2014. That bill also includes 1.2 million dollars to buy new voting machines.  They overrode the Governor and established a Commission on Youth with no funding. And the overrode the Governor and approved a plan to require homeowners and banks in a foreclosure to seek mediation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should the trees go or not?  How many? Some of the trees along the Havensight road opposite the shopping center are scheduled to be removed this week.  Dept. Public Works painted red X’s on most of them. Protestors lined up to defend the trees. The official word is not all the marked trees are coming down, just some that are sick and dying.  But it really is all about the construction of the 4 lane road through Havensight.  Daryl Smalls says they are going to keep most of the trees –no more than 5 are being removed. Some will be cut back but most are staying on a median strip between the car lanes.  Smalls also says after the highway is complete there will be more landscaping like the row of palms near Yacht Haven Grande and no more flooding….  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hearty Congratulations to the seniors students at Sts Peter and Paul School who earned their diplomas  - 13 seniors got their diplomas The Valedictorian was Sarah Ann Charles and the Salutatorian was Dahlia Daniel Everyone is going to college.</p>

<p>He didn’t win the National Spelling Bee, but he did well. Yad Bass of Ricardo Richards Elementary School is in Washington DC for the spelling bee – touring the capitor and the WH and other sights of the city. He passed the written test that winnows the hundreds down to a few.  He got through Round two and three but his score did not allow him into the semi finals.  How about waterzooi, genre or tokamak… He got those right… and Unciferous? Even my word processor spelling checker can’t spell that word.  Yad Bass can. The winner He is making Good News.</p>

<p>Yesterday the senate committee on Health and Hospital debated the &#8220;Therapeutic Pharmaceutical Agent  and Certified Optometrist Act&#8221;  The plan would allow physicians&#8217; assistants with the proper training to write prescriptions. The bill would also allow optometrists to apply therapeutic and diagnostic eye drops and ointments, treating pinkeye and other problems. Senator Usie Richards sponsored the bills. He says they are designed to get the most benefit and patient care for the public from the territory&#8217;s existing medical resources. Medical doctors like Dr Byron Biscoe, who treat eyes are opposed to allowing Optometrists to perform this work saying their training is not in medical conditions but in fitting glasses and correcting vision. On the other hand, doctors were generally in favor of increasing the powers of physicians assistants. There are risks but we need more people working on medical care. The senators approved both bills and sent them to the rules committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Senate Committee of the Whole heard from developers who want to turn the empty lot next to Buccaneer Mall into a movie theater. They want to cater to tourists with Cultural movies during the day.  The plan would clean up an unused building and Parking Lot. They also heard from Haresh Udhwani about plans for his three story building to allow a residence upstairs and a mail order business downstairs. A third request would turn vacant residential buildings east of Price Smart into office space. No action was taken but now senators can sponsor the zoning changes at the next session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A month to go as Governor John DeJongh is under the gun to produce the budget for next fiscal year. Due Date is May 30… That was yesterday.  Governor John DeJongh sent a letter to Senate President Ronald Russell and explained the budget would be late.  The fiscal year begins October 1. Budget hearings are coming up in June and July  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department of Planning and Natural Resources reminds everyone that the queen conch season will close in Virgin Islands territorial waters – tomorrow, June 1, through October 31. Possession of queen conch is prohibited.  The season will reopen on November 1 and stay open until next June or until the 50,000 pound quota is reached in each district. For queen conch info call Environmental Enforcement at 773-5774 in St. Croix and 774-3320 in St. Thomas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hearty Congratulations to four local high school athletes who have signed letters of intent to play college sports. Karri Harry and Shaniqua Wheatley are both headed to Virginia to play basketball at the Patrick Henry Community College. Kelsy Tress is headed to Illinois to play basketball at Kashlaslia College and Merrissa Murphy is going to Bethune Cookman in Florida on a volleyball scholarship. All four played basketball at CAHS under head coach/athletic director Myron Corbett, who has been instrumental in helping local kids get athletic scholarships across the country. Hearty Congratulations to the women athletes.</p>
