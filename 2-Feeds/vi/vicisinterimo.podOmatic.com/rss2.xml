      <title> Episode 114: Gingerdead Man 1 and 2, Vicis Interimo </title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_6532273.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome to episode 114! It's been four weeks since we released an episode, but we're back to pick up where we left off. :) This week's review is on the Full Moon pictures 'Gingerdead Man' and Gingerdead Man 2: Passion of the Crust'. There are a lot of short topics this week as we discuss the movies 'The Avengers', 'Iron Man 2', 'Watchmen' (motion comic), 'Kinsey', 'Waterboy', 'From Paris With love', 'Transformers 3', 'Star Trek Generations', 'Star Trek First Contact', and tv shows 'Missing' and 'Alkatraz' ..... whew! We run a bit long this week, as well as battle madsaxxon's dying computer, so Lori's Crawling Chaos segment is skipped... but it returns this next week, so listen for it then! Thanks for joining us this week...

Gingerdead Man: NR (2005)
An evil yet adorable Gingerbread man comes to life with the soul of a convicted killer - this real life cookie monster wreaks havoc on the girl who sent the killer to the electric chair. 

Gingerdead Man 2: Passion of the Crust: NR (2008)
The horrifying yet delicious and chewy Gingerdead Man causes murder and mayhem on the set of a horrible low budget movie set. It will take the determination of the studio's young new owner to save both his company and well as the lives of his young new friends. Including a terminally ill young boy whose final wish it was to meet the studios stars - The Tiny Terrors.

      <title>Episode 113: Tamara, Vicis Interimo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_6307698.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Welcome to episode 113. This week's review is on the 2005 movie 'Tamara'. A second short review is on the new movie 'The Cabin in the Woods' (with no spoilers). We'll be reviewing it again later with full spoilers. It's just too hard to talk about this movie while not giving anything away! Other short topics include 'Bandidas', the actress Katie Stuart, and the Wii Fit Plus.... Ok, so this week's crawling chaos segment is a bit lame. :)


Tamara (2005) R, 94 minutes
In a high school prank gone horribly wrong, an outcast named Tamara (Jenna Dewan) is murdered, but her tormenters get off scot-free. Now, as a sexy siren returned from the grave with an arsenal of superpowers, Tamara dedicates her afterlife to exacting revenge. Katie Stuart, Chad Faust and Matthew Marsden co-star in this teen horror romp from screenwriter Jeffrey Reddick, the mind behind Final Destination.

Welcome to episode 112! This week's movie review is on the 2010 film 'Husk'. Short topics include the movie 'X-Men: First Class', the animated 'Green Lantern' series, and more about 'Silent Hill: Shattered Memories' for the Wii. 'Bernie' finds his way into this week's Laid to Rest segment, as we discuss the origin of the dance and the scene that started it all! The Titanic is mentioned as well, as it is this week's Crawling Chaos topic. Thanks for joining us! :)


Husk: 2010 (R) 83 minutes
Based on director Brett Simmons's 2004 short film, this chilling horror movie finds five friends stranded in deserted farm country after crows mysteriously attack their car. Terror mounts as undead human scarecrows begin to stalk them. The friends, including an egghead, a jock and a blue-collar worker, must work together to avoid being turned into zombies. Wes Chatham, Devon Graye, C. J. Thomason, Tammin Sursok and Ben Easter co-star.

      <title>Episode 111: Godsend, Vicis Interimo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_6188545.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 111! This week we discuss the movie 'Godsend', which we agree is more of a sci-fi thriller than anything else. This movie has quality performances, but maybe falls short in other areas. Our Garbage in/Garbage out segment features 'The Green Lantern', 'A Woman, a Gun, and a Noodle Shop', and the family movies 'Nanny McPhee Returns; and 'Gnomeo and Juliet'. Madsaxxon has started playing 'Silent Hill:Shattered Memories' for the Wii, so we have some things to say about it... and the Crawling Chaos segment returns with a reference to the 1980's movie 'Weekend at Bernie's'. We'd like to thank Slug again for joining us last week, and look forward to him joining us again soon! You can find a link to his podcast below, as well as a link to the Dolls of Despair's podcast, where they interview Bill Oberst Jr. Thanks for joining us this week, and please join us next time for the movie 'Husk'! 

Godsend: (2004) PG-13
When their son Adam (Cameron Bright) dies in a terrible accident the day after his birthday, married couple Paul (Greg Kinnear) and Jessie (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) are contacted by a genetic research whiz (Robert De Niro) who wants to clone the boy. Caught up in grief, the couple agrees, hoping he can make things right. After the process is complete, things seem blissful until they realize that the &quot;new&quot; Adam has a dark side.

Welcome to episode 110! This week we have a very special guest join us... Slug from the 

Slugcast! It was great having him on the show and discussing the Vincent Price classic 'The 

Abominable Dr. Phibes'. We look forward to his return in a few weeks when we discuss the 

sequel 'Dr Phibes Rises Again'. Short mentions in this episode includes the movies 'Blade 

Runner', 'Team America: World Police', and the classic 1970's TV show 'Ark 2'. Our Garbage 

In/Garbage Out segment includes 'Splice', 'The Wizard of Oz', and 'The Big Bang Theory'. 

Lori's Crawling Chaos returns this week as well... thanks for the inspiration, Slug! ;)

The Abominable Dr. Phibes: (NR) A doctor, scientist, organist, and biblical scholar, Dr. 

Anton Phibes, seeks revenge on the nine doctors he considers responsible for his wife's 

death. 

Enjoy the Slug Cast ... http://www.slugcast.com/

      <title>Episode 109: Silent House, Vicis Interimo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_5994661.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 109! This week we review the new 2011/2012 movie 'Silent House', which is in theatres now. This movie had some unique qualities, as well as an excellent performance by Elizabeth Olsen. We also can't help but discuss how rude people are in movie theatres, and how it's almost not even worth going! Other short topics include the TV shows 'Face-Off' (season 2), 'Monster Man', 'Missing', 'Alcatraz', and 'Person of Interest'... are these worth a watch, or no? One thing we agree on is the Stephen King story 'N.' which can be seen and heard on You tube (find the link below). Thanks for joining us this week! We hope that our sound quality issues are behind us, and that this episode is enjoyable. Please join us next week for a special episode featuring Slug from the Slugcast podcast. We look forward to having him join us! :)

Silent House (2011, 2012) R
Trapped inside her family's lakeside retreat, a young woman finds she is unable to contact the outside world as events become increasingly ominous in and around the house.

      <title>Episode 108: Marebito, Vicis Interimo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_5950084.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 108! This week we review the 2004 Japanese film 'Marebito', by director Takashi Shimizu (Ju-On, The Grudge). We also watched Diary of a Wimpy Kid this week, since last week we mentioned the sequel. Other short topics include the TV show 'Ink Master', and the quirky movie 'Adaptation' starring Nicolas Cage and Meryl Streep. These generate some discussion on reality TV shows and whether or not Nicolas Cage is a good actor (he really is!). In the next couple weeks we'll be having Slug (from the Slugcast) join us for a review of Vincent Price's 'Abominable Dr. Phibes'. We're looking forward to it! ... Thanks for joining us this week!

Marebito: (2004) R
Masuoka (Shinya Tsukamoto), a fragile cameraman who's afraid of the unknown that he's certain lurks around every corner, is the last person one would expect to rise to the occasion when courage is needed. But that he does when he winds up with an assignment that has him looking into an urban myth about specters that supposedly haunt Tokyo's subterranean travel system in this fantastical film directed by Takashi Shimizu.

We have a HUGE 'garbage in, garbage out' segment this week which includes the movies 'Rocky Balboa', 'Michael Moore Hates America', 'Say Anything', 'A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon', 'The Fearless Vampire Killers', 'Megamind', and 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2'. We also enjoyed watching the 2000 mini series 'Dune' this week, so talk a little bit about that, as well as the anime 'Black Butler'. We look forward to having a special guest in the next couple weeks (Slug from the Slugcast), so please watch for that special episode! Thanks for joining us this week. :)

My Soul to Take(2010) R: Some 15 years after the presumed death of a vicious serial killer, children whose birthdays match his supposed &quot;deathday&quot; start to disappear. But whether the killer -- or his tortured soul -- is responsible remains to be seen.

      <title>Episode 106: Rabid, Vicis Interimo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_5781906.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 106! This week's movie is the 1977 film 'Rabid' by David Cronenberg. Other movies 

discussed include 'Lost in Translation', 'Underworld: Awakening', and 'Rio'. Animes are also a short topic this 

week as we mention 'Darker Than Black', 'Megazone 23', and how 'Fullmetal Alchemist' and 'Cowboy Beebop' 

raised the bar. The TV show 'Alcatraz' is another topic of discussion, as we try to decide how we feel about it. 

What makes a tv show or movie really good? We agree on one thing for sure... characters that you care about. 

Thanks for joining us this week! We appreciate it. :)

Rabid(1977) R
After a horrific motorcycle crash, an injured woman (Marilyn Chambers) receives experimental surgery that 

saves her life, but side effects leave her thirsty for blood -- and give her a ghastly capability to extract it. 

Worse, her victims become just as bloodthirsty! Soon, the entire city is thrown into chaos. Bleak, disturbing and 

gloriously low-budget, this gruesome chiller from writer-director David Cronenberg is not for the squeamish.

saves her life, but side effects leave her thirsty for blood -- and give her a ghastly capability to extract it. 

Worse, her victims become just as bloodthirsty! Soon, the entire city is thrown into chaos. Bleak, disturbing and 

gloriously low-budget, this gruesome chiller from writer-director David Cronenberg is not for the squeamish.

Welcome to episode 104! This week we discuss the 2007 movie 'The Messengers'. Other movies this episode include 'I, Robot', Wallace and Gromit's 'A Matter of Loaf and Death', HBO's 'Superheroes', and the HBO series 'Big love'. Short topics include 'Wall-E', 'A.I.', '28 Days Later', and Cillian Murphy (Lori had to squeeze in some comments). :) We also have a short discussion this week on setting the mood for movie viewing (or at least cutting down on distractions beforehand) and Lori mentions three of her favorite TV shows of all time. We apologize for missing last week's episode and appreciate you joining us for this one! 

The Messengers (Rated R): An ominous darkness invades a seemingly serene sunflower farm in North Dakota, and the Solomon family is torn apart by suspicion, mayhem and murder.

      <title>Episode 103: Dead Alive/ Brain Dead, Vicis Interimo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_5635617.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 103, where we discuss the 1992 Peter Jackson movie 'Dead Alive'. Other movies this week include 'Paul', 'The Fourth Kind', and 'The Social Network'. Our Laid to Rest segment reflects back on the Anthony Hopkins excorcism movie 'The Rite'... what went wrong with this one? Opinions are welcome! We also make quick mentions of the Fox series Fringe and the HBO series 'Big love'. Thanks for joining us this week...

Dead Alive: UR, 1992
Although it's easy to admire the maniacal glee of director Peter Jackson's bloodfest, Dead Alive is nonetheless intense and profoundly disturbing. When a Sumatran rat-monkey bites Lionel Cosgrove's mother, she's transformed into a zombie. She begins killing (and transforming) the entire town while Lionel races to keep things under control. Events culminate at a house party that turns into a blood-drenched zombie buffet.

      <title>Episode 102: Paranormal Activity 2 and Mirrors 2, Vicis Interimo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_5596264.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 102! This week we talk about two movies... Paranormal Activity 2 and Mirrors 2. We also go back and discuss Gulliver's Travels (finally!), since we forgot it the last couple episodes. We thank Horrorphilia Jason again for recommending 'Sunshine' and share comments from Ken Calloway, leader of the super awesome band 'Cockfight Club'.  Our Garbage In/Garbage out segment is longer than usual this week as we discuss Machete, Bag of Bones, Red Riding Hood, Repo Men, Sucker Punch, Source Code, and The Adjustment Bureau. Whew! ... we meant to talk about 'The Fourth Kind' as well, but will save it for next week. All music in this week's episode is performed by Cockfight Club. Please feel free to check out their website at www.cockfightclub.net. Thanks for joining us!

Paranormal Activity 2: (2010) R
Doors slamming shut, shadows moving across the floor -- the unexplained, terrifyingly real supernatural forces are back, and this time, Dan (Brian Boland), Kristi (Sprague Grayden), Ali (Molly Ephraim), baby Hunter and dog Abby become part of the nightmare as the cameras roll. Tod Williams (The Door in the Floor) directs and Michael R. Perry (&quot;Persons Unknown&quot;) writes this spine-chilling sequel to the wildly popular 2009 flick.

Mirrors 2: (2010) NR/R
In this sequel to the horror-thriller Mirrors, a security guard (Nick Stahl) working the night shift unwittingly discovers a portal to another dimension and starts having visions of a young woman who was murdered long ago. At first, he assumes what he's seeing is a figment of his own imagination. But when the vengeful girl's spirit begins claiming innocent victims, he's got concrete reasons to fear for his life.

      <title>Episode 101:The Rite, Vicis Intreimo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_5531173.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 101! This week we discuss the 2011 movie 'The Rite', starring Anthony Hopkins. Since this show was recorded on Christmas Eve, and we had a chaotic week leading up to it, we had only a few topics to discuss... The terrific science fiction movie 'Sunshine' (starring Lori's favorite Cillian Murphy), the season finale of 'American Horror Story', and our Christmas Eve trip to Knott's Berry Farm. Thanks for joining us... and Happy Holidays to everyone! :)

The Rite
201, PG-13, 112 minutes
Despite his conviction that demonic possession is just so much supersitious mumbo jumbo, Catholic priest-in-training Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue) journeys to Rome to attend a special exorcism school being taught at the Vatican. Before long, true-believer Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins) introduces the young cleric to the devil's power firsthand. Director Mikael H&#229;fstr&#246;m helms this graphic supernatural thriller inspired by a true story.

Thanks for joining us... and Happy Holidays to everyone! :)

The Rite
201, PG-13, 112 minutes
Despite his conviction that demonic possession is just so much supersitious mumbo jumbo, Catholic priest-in-training Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue) journeys to Rome to attend a special exorcism school being taught at the Vatican. Before long, true-believer Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins) introduces the young cleric to the devil's power firsthand. Director Mikael H&#229;fstr&#246;m helms this graphic supernatural thriller inspired by a true story.

      <title>Episode 100, Splice and our top 5 movie picks of the past 99 shows.</title>

Welcome to episode 100! This week we both pick our top 5 favorite 'new' movies from our first 99 podcasts. We each give our top 5 and then name our 5 runners up. It wasn't easy picking favorites. :) We begin with a discussion of the movie 'Splice' and then go right in to our top picks. Other topics this week include the movies 'Devil' and 'Predators', and the TV show 'Grimm'. 

Splice (2009) R:
Ignoring instructions from the pharmaceutical company that funds their research, groundbreaking genetic scientists Elsa (Sarah Polley) and Clive (Adrien Brody) continue with an unorthodox experiment to create a human-animal hybrid, a new life form they dub &quot;Dren&quot; (Delphine Chan&#233;ac). When they see their fantastical creation, Clive warns that it should be destroyed, but Elsa refuses -- a decision she'll regret when Dren makes deadly plans of her own.

      <title>Episode 99: Wake Wood, Vicis Interimo Time to KILL! </title>

This week we discuss the Irish film 'Wake Wood'. Our opinions differed this week.. and so did the ratings we gave the movie. We also go back and discuss more about last week's movie 'Let the Right One In'... ***spoiler alert!!*** Other movies we watched this week include 'Thor', 'The Book of Eli', and 'Gulliver's Travels' (which we forgot to talk about.. oops! Listen for it next week). :) 

Wake Wood (2010) R:
After losing their only child, Alice, in a vicious dog attack, two grieving parents relocate to a small town where -- to their horror and fascination -- they discover a pagan ritual that will grant them three more days with their deceased daughter. Hoping to allay their sorrow, at least temporarily, the couple decides to go through with the rite, but the larger question remains, what happens after the three days have passed?

Hope you all had a Happy Thanksgiving! :) This week we discuss the Swedish film 'Let the Right One In'. We enjoyed the American version so much that we wanted to experience the original. It didn't fail to deliver! Other movies we watched this week include 'Captain America', Star Trek', 'Dinner for Schmuks', and the last 'Shrek' movie. This week we also talk a little bit about what we'll be doing for our special 100th episode. Don't miss it! :) ... and thanks for joining us...

Let the Right One In (L&#229;t den R&#228;tte Komma In) (2008) R:
Twelve-year-old Oskar (K&#229;re Hedebrant), the constant target of bullies, spends his time plotting revenge and collecting news items about the grisly murders plaguing his town. But things change when he meets a new girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson), a misfit vampire who steals his heart. As a serial killer continues to prey on teen boys in their small Swedish village, Eli helps Oskar find the courage to stand up to his tormenters.

      <title>Episode 97: Insidious, Vicis Interimo Time to KILL!</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_5354483.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 97! This week's movie is 'Insidious', the 2011 movie from the makers of Paranormal Activity and Saw. This movie was a nice surprise for both of us! Short topics include discussion of the movies 'Temple Grandin', 'How to Train Your Dragon', 'Bean', and the new Science Channel series 'Prophets of Science Fiction'. Other short bits include 'Fringe' character Lincoln Lee, and actor Cillian Murphy (that's pronounced 'Killian'!). :)

Insidious: Josh and Renai confront terrifying tribulations when their son falls into a coma and his body starts to attract malevolent forces. But when the family moves, hoping to leave the evil spirits behind, they realize their problems are only beginning.

This week we discuss Alexandre Aja's 'Mirrors', starring Kiefer Sutherland. We also talk a bit about 'The Terminal', 'Clash of the Titans', and the documentary titled 'Return to Africa's Witch Children'. We watched an awesome 'Bully Beatdown' this week, so had to mention it and post a link to the fight. It's awesome, so check it out! :) Our Laid to Rest segment was a bit short this week, but we look forward to sharing some of Slug's opinions of last week's movie 'The Last Exorcism' ... listen for it next week! Thanks for joining us. Mirrors (R) 2008- This creepy supernatural thriller from director Alexandre Aja stars Kiefer Sutherland as troubled security guard Ben Carson, a man who discovers malevolent spirits living within the mirrors of a fire-ravaged department store. When their murderous nature comes to light, Ben turns to his estranged wife (Paula Patton) to help him save their family -- and himself. The supporting cast includes Amy Smart and Jason Flemyng.

      <itunes:summary>Welcome to episode 96! This week we discuss Alexandre Aja's 'Mirrors', starring Kiefer Sutherland. We also talk a bit about 'The Terminal', 'Clash of the Titans', and the documentary titled 'Return to Africa's Witch Children'. We watched an awesome 'Bully Beatdown' this week, so had to mention it and post a link to the fight. It's awesome, so check it out! :) Our Laid to Rest segment was a bit short this week, but we look forward to sharing some of Slug's opinions of last week's movie 'The Last Exorcism' ... listen for it next week! Thanks for joining us. Mirrors (R) 2008- This creepy supernatural thriller from director Alexandre Aja stars Kiefer Sutherland as troubled security guard Ben Carson, a man who discovers malevolent spirits living within the mirrors of a fire-ravaged department store. When their murderous nature comes to light, Ben turns to his estranged wife (Paula Patton) to help him save their family -- and himself. The supporting cast includes Amy Smart and Jason Flemyng.

      <title>Episode 94: Pontypool, Tower or Terror, Vicis Interimo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_5246921.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Halloween and welcome to episode 94! :) This week we discuss the 2008 movie 'Pontypool', as well as Disney's 'Tower of Terror'. We really are enjoying the new FX series 'American Horror Story', so talk about it quite a bit. Short topics include 'The Addams Family', the 'Xena Effect', and whether or not Nicholas Cage is a vampire. Madsaxxon also quotes from Tolstoy and gets on the soap box this week and has a thing or two to say about those who judge other people's relationships. This leads to a short discussion of the new 'Ballandchain' podcast, which looks at marriage and relationships (run by Jay from Pennycult). The link to this new podcast can be found below. This week madsaxxon and Lori celebrate their 8th wedding anniversary (yay us!). :) .... thanks for tuning in! 

Pontypool(2008) NR-
Valentine's Day is anything but ordinary for radio shock-jock Grant Mazzy after he runs into a crazed woman on the way to work -- and that's just the beginning as scores of other people in the small Ontario town of Pontypool start acting awfully odd.

Tower of Terror(1997) NR-
Steve Guttenberg stars as a tabloid reporter who wants to return to mainstream journalism; all he needs is a big story. He gets one when he happens upon the mystery surrounding the disappearance of five people at an old luxury hotel in the 1930s. The locals believe that the ghosts of those five people now haunt the hotel. Kirsten Dunst co-stars in this spine-tingling Disney mystery thriller.

      <title>Episode 93: The Devils Backbone, Vicis Interimo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_5209593.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 93! This week we discuss 'The Devil's Backbone', a 2001 Spanish horror/thriller directed by Guillermo del Toro. Stay tuned to the end of the show after the final music, as we make some additional comments regarding the title of the movie. Our 'laid to rest' segment didn't have much... just a confirmation that we didn't care for last week's movie! Lori (that's me) mentions once again the totally awesome Harry Potter fanfiction 'Rise of the Phoenix'. Our 'Garbage In- Garbage Out' segment is short, as we haven't had the time this week to watch many movies or shows. Short mentions include the TV shows 'Person of Interest' and 'Terra Nova', as well as Tim Burton's 'Alice in Wonderland'. 

The Devil's Backbone: El Espinazo del Diablo (2001) R: 
Twelve-year-old Carlos (Fernando Tielve) is the latest arrival at Santa Lucia School, an imposing stone building that shelters orphans of the Republican militia and politicians during the last days of the Spanish Civil War. Carlos gradually uncovers the dark ties that bind the inhabitants of the school: hidden riches, sexual intrigue and the restless ghost of a murdered student, who may be the only one to provide resolution.

We take a look at a crappy movie, but fist we hear from AL about last weeks show and from Brian about the new 'the THING' movie. We talk about Crazy as Hell and then move on to GIGO and talk about Morning Glory and Avatar: the last air bender.

Crazy as Hell(2002) R 
Ty Adams (Mike Beach) is an outlaw psychiatrist whose nontraditional approach has made him a hero in some circles and a kook in others. He meets his intellectual match in a male patient (Eriq La Salle) claiming to be Satan, and it may just be the doctor, not the patient, who unravels right before the watchful gaze of filmmakers recording Adams's exploits for a documentary. Eriq La Salle also directed the film.

      <title>Episode 91: Altitude, Vicis Interimo </title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_5110743.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 91! This week we discuss the 2010 movie 'Altitude'. Opinions are split on this one! We also talk a little bit about the 2010 Nightmare on Elm Street and the documentary 'The Most Hated Family in America'. Thanks for joining us! 

Altitude (2010) R

Kaare Andrews makes his feature-film debut with this supernatural tale about a brash, young pilot (Jessica Lowndes) who takes her friends (Julianna Guill, Ryan Donowho, Landon Liboiron and Jake Weary) for a small-plane joyride, only to get lost in a deadly storm. But things get worse when they hit some unexpected turbulence. Turns out some people's fears when it comes to flying aren't entirely unfounded.

      <title>Episode 90: Saint Sinner, Vicis Interimo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_5049278.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 90! This week we discuss the made-for-SciFi movie 'Saint Sinner'. This was a 2002 movie and the story was written by Clive Barker. Sounds promising, doesn't it? Sadly, it was not good. This week we tried to keep the show as close to 30 minutes as we could... as a result, we have very few short topics. Madsaxxon suggests watching Demon Knight or Warlock and Lori makes a quick mention of the new season of Survivor. We usually find movie trailers on Youtube, but were unable to do so this week. Instead, we've posted a 'Saint Sinner' fan video. Thanks for joining us!

This week we talk about the 1984 film, 'The Company of Wolves'. Horror or Fairy Tale? We disagree on this one. Lori thinks it's merely an adult fairy tale. Madsaxxon sees the horror. We welcome comments from anyone who has seen this film! Short topics this week include the title of last week's movie 'Let Me In' and the cancelled TV show 'Chaos'.

This week we do a sort of 'vampire double feature', as we discuss both '30 Days of Night: Dark Days' and 'Let Me In'. Our Garbage in, Garbage out segment features the Disney movie's 'Tangled' and 'Old Dogs', and Sofia Coppola's 'Marie Antoinette'. Short topics include a suggestion from special effects artist Mike Regan for us to check out the movie 'Mr. Brooks', and a reminder to the Harry Potter fans to check out 'Rise of the Phoenix', which is an outstanding fanfiction that offers an amazing alternate ending to the book series.

      <title>Episode 87: The Stepfather (Remake? Reboot?)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_4955893.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 87! This week we discuss the 2009 remake of The Stepfather. Sadly, this version is missing the magic found in the original. Jason from the Horrorphilia podcast sent in his review of this movie, so you can hear that here as well. We also get to talk about the dark and gritty movie 'The Proposition', starring Guy Pearce and Emily Watson, which we really enjoyed. For our listeners who are Harry Potter fans, we share an awesome fanfiction which picks up at the end of Deathly Hallows. It begins as an alternate ending, with Voldemort winning the battle and Harry pronounced dead. This is a darker, more mature story... it's a must read. We want to thank all of our new listeners for tuning in... and a big hello and thank you to our two new listeners in Belguim! We'd also like to thank those of you who joined our Vicis Interimo fan page on Facebook this week! :)

Sorry Mike I missed reading this on air...

Mike R.
realized I should recommend the movie Mr. Brooks (w/ Kevin Costner, Demi Moore and William Hurt)... It's listed as a thriller, but has some great moments and stuff that could be borderline horror (Costner is a serial killer!).

Welcome to the show, and thanks so much for listening! We've had to upgrade our account with Podomatic due to the high volume of listeners lately... so thanks! We certainly appreciate it. :)

After discussing this week's movie, we go on to talk about other movies we've seen this week, including Easy A, The Wrestler, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the series 'Torchwood: Miracle Day'. Other short topics include the 'Slugcast' and Lori's encounters with celebrities (Bill Goldberg and David Arquette). We also decide that we've rated this week's movie too low as we discuss it... by the end of the review, we both bump up our rating. Thanks again to everyone for listening... and a very warm greeting and thank you to our new listeners in France and Colombia! :D

We also decide that we've rated this week's movie too low as we discuss it... by the end of the review, we both bump up our rating. Thanks again to everyone for listening... and a very warm greeting and thank you to our new listeners in France and Colombia! :D

      <title>Episode 85: The Stepfather, Vicis Interimo </title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_4898914.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 85. This week we cover the original 'The Stepfather', starring Terry O'Quin. Once again, we go way over our goal of 30 minutes... and we've decided it is because Lori talks WAY too much. :) Short topics include the very good (true story) movie 'Secretariat', Lori's love of John Malkovich, The Oblongs, and the artwork of Sebastian Munster (1488-1552).

The Stepfather(1986) R

In this acclaimed thriller classic, Jerry Blake (Terry O'Quinn) expects only one thing from his family -- perfection -- and when he doesn't get it, he doesn't just get angry, he goes mad: completely, psychopathically, homicidally mad. After brutally dispatching one clan, Jerry sets up shop with a single mom (Shelley Hack) and her brooding teen daughter (Jill Schoelen), who immediately suspects there's something not quite right about her dear old stepdad.

This week we review Sam Raimi's 'Army of Darkness', starring Bruce Campbell. We have a special guest this week, Mike Regan, who discusses this classic film with Madsaxxon. Lori's Crawling Chaos this week features a short discussion about new additions to the family, and short topics include out-dated video game systems, future episodes, and the movie 'Eat, Pray, Love'.


Army Of Darkness: Bound in human flesh and inked in blood, the ancient Necronomicon, or &quot;Book of the Dead,&quot; transports department store clerk Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his 1973 Oldsmobile into England's Dark Ages. There, he faces legions of undead beasts in a battle for his life. One of the most memorable early works from director Sam Raimi (Spider-Man), this cult favorite is the third in a trilogy of hilarious sci-fi horror epics.

What happened to episode 82, you ask? We have no idea.... but, it may surface next week! This week we have a bonus double episode, featuring two movie reviews rather than only one. We cover the classic 'Re-Animator' and also 'The Hole', a British thriller from 2001. Short topics this week include the movies 'Burlesque', 'Taken', 'The Philidelphia Experiment', and the Twilight series. Lori also manages to mention Radu this week, as the Subspecies movie has just been re-mastered and released on blu-ray. Yay. :) .... other short topics include upcoming episodes, the 'real' Philidelphia Experiment', and Radu. Oops.. did I already mention Radu? :)

It's been a couple weeks since we've done a podcast... but here it is! It's a little odd, but it is what it is. :) This weeks movie is the classic 'Evil Dead' starring one of our favorites... Bruce Campbell. Short topics include the movies 'Trick r Treat', Ghost World and 'Watchmen', Lori's addictive 'crack in a dish', basements, the planet Vulcan and the dangers of car keys. Madsaxxon is also very mean to Lori this week... enjoy! :)

      <title>Episode 79: How to be a Serial Killer, Vicis Interimo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_4654696.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode -- . This week we discuss the dark comedy 'How to be a Serial Killer'. One of us liked it a lot... the other one not so much! :P Short topics include the writing (and hopefully filming) of Subspecies 5, a brief mention of next weeks episode, the movies 'True Grit', 'Sorceror's Apprentice' and 'Maid in Manhattan'... and the phenomenon of so-called angel hair. Thanks for joining us!

Meet Mike Wilson (Dameon Clarke). He's charming. He's smart. He's a serial killer -- and a very happy one, too. Determined to share the secrets of his satisfying career, Mike enlists sad-sack video store clerk Bart (Matthew Gray Gubler) as his star pupil. Mike enlightens Bart on the finer points of body disposal and other tricks of the trade, but it's not long before Mike's girlfriend catches on to his very odd job in this hilarious dark comedy.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_4618451.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy the show. We talk a lot about the 'crap' movie &quot;The Haunting of Molly Hartley&quot;. Spoiler alert! This movie is crap and we talk about almost all of it. We also found out who Lori&#8217;s new sexy man is. The Haunting of Molly Hartley (2008) PG-13 
Troubled by her mother's recent psychotic breakdown, Molly (Haley Bennett) hopes to start fresh at a new school by befriending a fellow senior (Chace Crawford) and trying her hand at being a regular kid. But the horrifying truth about her mother is destined to catch up with her. When Molly turns 18, she'll be held accountable for a supernatural bargain made long ago &#8230; one that she can't escape. Jake Weber co-stars in this sinister yarn.

LOL &#8220;The Ivy League nude posture photos&#8221;. We go long but the last five mins are music. This weeks movie is Vampire Journals.
 Vampire Journals(1997) R

     Vengeful vampire Zachary (David Gunn) hunts down the night creature responsible for his girlfriend's death in this dark tale. After Ash kills Zachary's girlfriend, Zachary must come up with an airtight plan to murder Ash, but it won't be easy; Ash is a vampire with powers stronger than the &quot;average Joe&quot; vampire. When Zachary learns of Ash's infatuation with Sofia (Kirsten Cerre), he must decide whether to use the femme fatale in his risky plan.

The Ivy League nude posture photos were taken in the 1940s through the 1970s of all incoming freshmen at certain Ivy League and Seven Sisters colleges, ostensibly to gauge the rate and severity of rickets, scoliosis, and lordosis in the population.

I mean that in the worst possible way. LOL the show is way over our 30 min limit and it sounds bad! You know how they say caveat emptor, buyer beware well that&#8217;s this show, you are getting it &#8216;as is&#8217;. We will try to do better next week, but as you will hear in the show I have tons of schoolwork to do. The segment of the show we recorded last week should be good. I did try to clean up some of the audio, but I can&#8217;t get to it all today. Hope you will forgive us and come on back next week to listen again. This week we talk more about the Subspecies series. This time number 4 Bloodstorm. Other movies we talk about are, Salt, (Disney&#8217;s) A Christmas Carol, the new Pirates movie. Ice disc is what we talk about this how in the crawling chaos segment. That is all this and more if you can put up with the poor audio.

http://www.cockfightclub.net/

Well, we love our Full Moon Movies, and we are back to talk about Subspecies II. Other things we talk about are Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and the book &#8216;The Ruins&#8217; by Scott Smith. We talk more about how I don&#8217;t find most comedy funny these days (&#8230;and its not because I am offended by it &#8230;its just not that funny).

We also talk about some other podcasts that you should be listening to.

 

Subspecies II: Bloodstone (1993) R: When Transylvanian vampire Radu (Anders Hove) settles a dynastic rivalry by killing his brother, American student Michelle (Denice Duff) escapes the castle with a bite on the neck -- and the bloodstone, a mysterious relic crucial to Radu's survival. Radu chases the girl to Bucharest, where she seeks help &#8230; and begins to sense her own emerging thirst for blood. Ted Nicolaou directs this horror flick filmed on location in Romania.

      <title>Episode 72: Alone in the Dark, Vicis Interimo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_4384248.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 72! This week&#8217;s movie is Alone in the Dark. Oh man, does this movie suck! Three good actors stuck in a bad movie or was it bad direction? It&#8217;s a Uwe Boll movie so that may tell you what to expect right there. We cover these topics and more in this weeks show. There is some small talk about how awesome Mad Max was as well as my childhood love of Star Blazers this and more in our fun filled episode. (&#8230;ok, that may be overstating the truth a little, but I hope you will still listen ;-)

Alone in the Dark; Private sleuth Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) specializes in weird supernatural phenomena, and he'll be forced to work with his archaeologist ex-girlfriend (Tara Reid) to defeat the demonic ancient Abskani tribe, which is set to wreak havoc on Earth. But Carnby already has experience with the evil beings, which also attempt to infiltrate his mind. Stephen Dorff co-stars in this sci-fi thriller based on the popular video game series.

      <itunes:summary>Welcome to episode 72! This week&#8217;s movie is Alone in the Dark. Oh man, does this movie suck! Three good actors stuck in a bad movie or was it bad direction? It&#8217;s a Uwe Boll movie so that may tell you what to expect right there. We cover these topics and more in this weeks show. There is some small talk about how awesome Mad Max was as well as my childhood love of Star Blazers this and more in our fun filled episode. (&#8230;ok, that may be overstating the truth a little, but I hope you will still listen ;-)

Alone in the Dark; Private sleuth Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) specializes in weird supernatural phenomena, and he'll be forced to work with his archaeologist ex-girlfriend (Tara Reid) to defeat the demonic ancient Abskani tribe, which is set to wreak havoc on Earth. But Carnby already has experience with the evil beings, which also attempt to infiltrate his mind. Stephen Dorff co-stars in this sci-fi thriller based on the popular video game series.

      <title>Episode 71: The Watcher, Vicis Interimo</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_4348654.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to episode 71! This week&#8217;s movie is the 2000 thriller 'The Watcher'. It's not really a horror movie, but we figured we'd give it a try anyway. The movie stars Keanu Reeves and James Spader, along with Marisa Tomei. Short topics this week include 'Toy Story 3', '2 Fast, 2 Furious', a better James Spader movie to watch (rather than this one!), and we also find out how Madsaxxon is 'into' watching Keanu dance. :O Music from 'The Watcher' is featured in this week&#8217;s episode, as we really enjoyed it... Rob Zombie and Portishead... thanks for joining us!

The Watcher (2000) R 
Burned out after failing to bust a sadistic serial killer in Los Angeles, FBI agent Joel Campbell (James Spader) retires to Chicago. But the killer (Keanu Reeves) refuses to leave the lawman alone, and begins furnishing new clues designed to drive him mad. To motivate Campbell to rejoin the cat-and-mouse chase, the killer sends photos of his next victims. But it's up to Campbell to try to save them first.

      <title>Episode 44: Vicis Interimo Dark Water</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1255629/600x600_3434071.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week we talk about the movie 'Dark Water'. This is a remake of the original Japanese film, and stars Jennifer Connelly. While we agreed this was more of a psychological thriller, it was still an interesting enough ghost story with light horror elements. Short topics this week include the movies 'Contact' and 'The Secret of N.I.M.H', and we also talk more about the movies we found influential in past decades.
 

Dark Water: With her young daughter in tow, Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) is starting a new life away from her estranged husband. But as a custody battle brews, her already fragile emotional state starts deteriorating when she begins to hear eerie sounds in her dilapidated apartment. Are the weird noises, inexplicable leaks and haunting visions all in Dahlia's head -- or is the building harboring dark secrets from the past?
