        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[This podcast explores the many facets of the 9-11 attacks which contradict the governments official story, the massive cover-up which is currently underway, the failure of the mainstream media in America to ask real questions, and the aftermath of 9-11 including the un-Constitutional wars and the taking of liberty here at home.  This broadcast examines the big picture of what is taking place in America today and how September 11th fits into the scheme of things.  Forget "conspiracy theory"!  The governments own story about what happened is itself a "conspiracy theory"!  We want 9-11 Truth.]]></itunes:summary>

			<title>9/11 WTC Debate:  Collapse by fire or explosive controlled demolition?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://visibility911.libsyn.com/9-11-wtc-debate-collapse-by-fire-or-explosive-controlled-demolition-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/COdebate-ae911truth.png" style="float: left; margin: 8px;" height="409" width="264" />On Sunday afternoon, March 6th, at the Boulder campus of the University of Colorado, Colorado 9/11 Visibility hosted a debate between Richard Gage, AIA (American Institute of Architects), and Chris Mohr, Denver investigative journalist and nondenominational minister.&nbsp; This is the audo of that historic debate.</p>
<p>The question: What brought down the <em>three </em>World Trade Center skyscrapers?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Richard Gage, AIA,</strong></span> is a San Francisco Bay Area architect and a member of the American Institute of Architects. He has been an architect for over 23 years and has worked on most types of building construction, including numerous fire-proofed, steel-framed buildings. His quest for the truth about 9/11 began in 2006, and he subsequently founded <a class="ext" href="http://www.ae911truth.org/" target="_blank">Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Chris Mohr,</strong></span> investigative journalist and advocate of the &ldquo;natural collapse&rdquo; theory, is a sincere seeker of the truth who has extensively researched the collapses of the World Trade Center (WTC) buildings, consulted with independent physicists and engineers, and passionately argues that the buildings collapsed due to the plane impacts and fires.</p>
<p>In November 2010 at Denver&rsquo;s Mercury Caf&eacute;, Mohr debated attorney Earl Staelin on the collapse of the twin towers. This debate was unprecedented in its civility and professionalism.</p>
<p>During this debate between Chris Mohr and Richard Gage, the discussion explored not only the collapse of the twin towers, but also that of 47-story World Trade Center Building 7, which collapsed completely at 5:21 pm on 9/11/01. For those of you not familiar with the collapse of WTC7, this is a riveting, don&rsquo;t-miss controversy. We look forward to a dynamic, respectful, and thoroughly informative exploration of these topics.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Colorado 9-11 Visibility and all the volunteers and donors that made this event possible.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Red Flag - Saudi Government Suspects Protected at Every Turn</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://visibility911.libsyn.com/red-flag-saudi-government-suspects-protected-at-every-turn]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/SaudiArabia911commission.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 8px;" height="276" width="316" />Soon after the September 11th attacks, the US government actively tried to minimize and oppress information relating to a possible role in the attacks by Saudi Arabia. Ultimately, the 9-11 Commission <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3815179.stm" target="_blank"><strong>cleared Saudi Arabia</strong></a> of any role in the terrorist attacks despite many anomalies including the fact that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2002/02/06/saudi.htm" target="_blank"><strong>15 of the 19 high jackers</strong></a> were actually from Saudi Arabia.<br /><br /><br />In December 2002 Congress released its&rsquo; Joint Intelligence Committee Inquiry into the 9-11 terrorist attacks. When released, this document contained 28 pages of redacted information that allegedly pointed to foreign state-sponsorship of the attacks, specifically Saudi Arabia. The 9/11 Commission Report failed to ascertain the contents of the censored 28-pages of the report.<br /><br />Victims family members asked President Bush why he refused to release this information and got no answer.<br /><br />Years earlier, in August 2002, victim family members publically announced a $1 trillion lawsuit against alleged Saudi bank rollers of Osama Bin Laden. This lawsuit has been stalled and defeated at every turn. In <a href="http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-11-23/news/17573117_1_transfers-from-wealthy-saudis-numerous-foreign-banks-dozens-defendant-prince-turki-al" target="_blank"><strong>November 2002</strong></a>, the lawsuit became even bigger and costlier at $15 trillion dollars as more than three-dozen new defendants were added, including members of the Saudi Royal Family.&nbsp; Interestingly, three members of the Saudi royal family have since been <a href="http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=70526&amp;d=23&amp;m=9&amp;y=2005" target="_blank"><strong>given legal immunity from prosecution</strong></a>.&nbsp; Attorneys for the victims' families told the Staten Island Advance in 2006, that it could be "another several years before the lawsuit goes to trial. "<br /><br />In July of 2003 9/11 Commissioner Max Cleland was interviewed by <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/transcript/transcript_cleland.html" target="_blank"><strong>Frank Sesno of PBS</strong></a>. In that interview, he stated: "You can read between the lines and see that there were foreign governments that were much more involved in the 9/11 attack than just supporting Islamic fundamentalist teachings and schools. Now, that has been redacted. A whole 28 page section." <br /><br />The 2008 book &ldquo;The Commission&rdquo;, by New York Times reporter Philip Shennon revealed that 9/11 Commission Executive Director, Phillip Zelikow <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a0403zelikowblocksredacted#a0403zelikowblocksredacted" target="_blank"><strong>blocked other 9/11 commissioners</strong></a> who were working on the Saudi connections from accessing the 28-page redacted section.</p>
<p><br />In August 2003, an anonymous official told <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a080103secretchapter#a080103secretchapter" target="_blank"><strong>New Republic magazine</strong></a> that the 28-page redacted section outlines &ldquo;connections between the hijacking plot and the very top levels of the Saudi royal family.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />In September of 2004, a month after the official close of the 9/11 Commission, Senator Bob Graham <a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2004/09/08/graham/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>accused the White House</strong></a> of covering-up the involvement of Saudi government officials in the 9/11 plot. <br /><br />Despite <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/world/middleeast/24saudi.html?_r=1" target="_blank"><strong>attempts by family members</strong></a> to get this information made public and promises from the Obama administration to do so, the redacted 28 pages of the Joint Intelligence Committee Inquiry into 9-11 remain secret and are likely to remain so. In May of 2010, Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2010/05/11/kagan-helped-shield-saudis-911-lawsuits/" target="_blank"><strong>refused to give the victims' families&rsquo; lawsuit a hearing</strong></a>. Her argument was that US foreign policy would be interfered with if the lawsuit was allowed to go ahead.</p>
<p><br />Secrecy continues to cloud the possible role of Saudi Arabia in the events of September 11th. Despite calls from members of Congress, victims family members, and even one of the 9-11 Commissioners to dig deeper into the role of Saudi Arabia, no such inquiry has yet to take place. Why would the US government and the 9-11 Commission protect Saudi Arabia?</p>]]></description>

			<title>Dr Frank Legge on Visibility 9-11: Mounting Evidence Shows Boeing 757-200 Impact with Pentagon Probable</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/frank_legge.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 8px;" height="322" width="242" />In this podcast, Dr Frank Legge discusses his new paper which was co-authored with Warren Stutt and has been published at the <a href="http://www.jounnalof911studies.com" target="_blank"><strong>The Journal of 9/11 Studies</strong></a>, titled <em><strong>Flight AA77 on 9/11: New FDR Analysis Supports the Official Flight Path Leading to Impact with the Pentagon</strong></em> ( http://www.journalof911studies.com/volume/2010/Calibration%20of%20altimeter_92.pdf ).<br />&nbsp;<br />In this lengthy and detailed discussion, Dr Legge is careful to lay out his way of thinking on the Pentagon issue and why it is so important to the 9/11 Truth Movement to not make unsupported claims about the events there. Legge looks at this issue from a purely scientific perspective and is only interested in what he can prove to be true based on hard evidence. It is clear to Legge and to the vast majority of scientists who have studied the issue, that while the Pentagon is a mystery to a degree, it is most likely that AA Flight 77, a Boeing 757-200 did hit the building based on the physical evidence available.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />We now have the correctly decoded digital flight data from Flight 77 and it's time for more people to get behind the call to reason on the Pentagon issue leading up to the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 Attacks!&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with supporting the parts of the "official story" of&nbsp; 9/11 that are most likely true. &nbsp; The team at Visibility 9-11 believe, as does Dr legge that it actually helps the interested public and especially the scientific community to see us as reasoned and balanced truth advocates when we do exactly that. <br />&nbsp;<br />Lets stop being what we are labeled as "conspiracy theorist's" and become "conspiracy factulist's"! <br />&nbsp;<br />For other instructive reading on the Pentagon please see related items below-<br />&nbsp;<br /><a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/volume/2009/WhatHitPentagonDrLeggeAug.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>What Hit the Pentagon?

			<title>David Chandler Talks About His New DVD &quot;9/11 Analysis&quot; and Rationalizes the Pentagon Debate on Visibility 9-11</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://visibility911.libsyn.com/talks-about-his-new-dvd-9-11-analysis-and-rationalizes-the-pentagon-debate-on-visibility-9-11]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/david-chandler.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 8px;" height="182" width="320" />Show notes and interview by: John Bursill<br /><br />This timely and important Podcast is a MUST listen!<br /><br />David who describes himself as a "pacifist" talks in great depth about his journey on the campaign for 9/11 Truth and Justice which he is passionately dedicated. Many of you may be aware it was David who is credited with getting NIST to admit&nbsp; WTC Building 7 fell at a an acceleration consistent with free-fall due to gravity; which I and many others view as the single most powerful debating tool for us as 9/11 Truth advocates! David disputes he is solely responsible for this and says that Jones, Ryan and others were central to this achievement but it was his question that drew the answer in the end so it seems.&nbsp; David also talks about the highly political timing and nature of the NIST Building 7 report.<br /><br />We then move on to talk about David's his new DVD "<strong>9/11 Analysis</strong>" which is comprised of a compilation of his powerful work to date and some new material into one concise resource. This DVD is available for sale now and can be purchased <strong><a href="http://www.911speakout.org" target="_blank">here</a></strong>.<br /><br />From the site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The 9/11 Analysis DVD project is a compilation of the many short analysis videos David Chandler has produced and uploaded to the internet over the last few years, woven together with an interpretive narrative. The current release is in English, but the plan is to follow this with a multilingual release. We need to raise funds to cover the production costs to make Phase II a reality. Please order your copy now and/or help out with a donation."<br /><br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the second part of this frank and informative interview David talks about his strong stance on the Pentagon fiasco that is now threatening the whole credible body of 9-11 research.&nbsp; The aggressive nature of the advocates of "no plane hit the Pentagon" has lead to a situation that is already out of control as has been seen by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ventura's terrible error of judgement</strong></span> with his episode of "Conspiracy Theory" for True TV on this subject. The case made by David for us not to be seen as a "Pentagon Movement" for it could mean our destruction is the best I've heard to date!<br /><br />For David's analysis of the Pentagon Debate please see his and Jon Cole's web page dedicated to the issue:<br />http://911speakout.org/?page_id=219<br /><br />Here is an exert: "The Honey Pot - On the other hand the mystery that surrounds the Pentagon makes it an attractive target of speculation and the subject of truly wild conspiracy theories.&nbsp; (This kind of attractive diversion is sometimes called a &ldquo;honey pot,&rdquo; a &ldquo;setup&rdquo; to be discredited at a later time.)&nbsp; This is not the only instance of theories that seem designed to be easily discredited.&nbsp; There are groups that insist the towers at the World Trade Center were taken down by space lasers.&nbsp; Others claim no planes hit the Twin Towers at<br />all: they were just holograms.&nbsp; What better way to tar the movement than to seed it with absurdly false theories that fuel a media circus, while making the Movement look ridiculous?"<br /><br />NOTE: You may have seen or heard on the net that CIT has said that I John Bursill made a commitment to them to leave this issue alone in a discussion had with Craig Ranke, this is true. I changed my mind many months back after the work Dr Frank Legge was doing around the Digital Flight Data Recorder data re-analysis of which I was involved. This and the aggressive moves by CIT and Pilots for 9/11 Truth to convince the 9/11 Truth Movement that the "fly over" was a proven fact has forced me back to this issue. I apologise for my back flip but I feel it is that important that I speak out and support those that do the same for the survival of the 9/11 Truth Movements credibility.</p>]]></description>

			<title>An In Depth Interview with Bob McIlvaine - Visibility 9-11</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://visibility911.libsyn.com/an-in-depth-interview-with-bob-mc-ilvaine-visibility-9-11]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>An In Depth Interview with Bob McIlvaine - Visibility 9-11</strong><br />Notes by John Bursill<br /><br /><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bob1.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 8px;" height="179" width="244" />In this in depth interview with tireless 9/11 Truth campaigner Bob McIlvaine, we look at 9/11 in its historical context.&nbsp; We also hear about Bob's detailed research into what happened to his son Bobby on 9/11 and the evidence an explosion other than the planes killed his son.<br /><br />As a long term 9/11 Truth researcher (2001) , an ex-history teacher and someone who has worked in mental health, Bob has a unique perspective on society and it's drives.&nbsp; In this interview Bob gives us a insight into how he sees the world and it's working's and why 9/11 Truth should be seen as possibly the best chance we've had at bringing peace to our world. Bob believes that we may have already been successful at preventing other wars with our exposure of the 9/11 fraud; I totally agree. <br /><br />Bob says he is "always ready to go!" when he is called to speak about the 9/11 tragedy and uses every opportunity to educate the population about the lies they have been told and to celebrate his sons short but exceptional life.&nbsp; Thank you Bob for your tenacity, drive and absolute commitment to expose the criminal's responsible for your sons death and all those that perished on that terrible day.&nbsp; You are a great inspiration for us all!<br /><br />About Bob: Bob Mcilvaine is the father of Bobby McIlvaine, a victim from the 9/11 attacks.&nbsp; Bobby graduated from Princeton University, and managed to get a job at Merrill Lynch as &ldquo;Assistant Vice President For Media Relations.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was also engaged to be married for a 2002 wedding.&nbsp; On 9/11/2001, he was on his way to banking conference on the 106th floor of the World Trade Center North Tower, and was killed as a result of what happened that day.&nbsp; From the evidence Bob has gathered it is apparent he was killed by an explosion, likely in the lobby.&nbsp; Bob has been one of the most outspoken 9/11 Family Members with regards to seeking truth, accountability, and justice for what happened that day. He is one of the family members that attended every 9/11 Commission hearing and has attended numerous 9/11 truth conferences around the world.&nbsp; He has appeared in several TV, radio, and newspaper interviews, as well as the documentary, <a href="http://www.911pressfortruth.com" target="_blank"><strong>9/11: Press For Truth</strong></a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;"><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Mahmud_Ahmed.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 8px;" height="353" width="283" />Despite the 9-11 Commission's <a href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/about/faq.htm#q1" target="_blank"><strong>mandate</strong></a> to provide a &ldquo;full and complete accounting&rdquo; of the attacks of September 11, many key points were omitted from the final report. One of these important omissions attempted to cover up the role of Pakistan and whether or not Pakistani intelligence helped to fund the 9-11 attacks.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Ties between Washington DC and the Pakistani intelligence agency, the ISI have been documented in media reports before and after the September 11th attacks. In March 2001, Pakistani regional expert and member of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, Selig Harrisson, said &ldquo;the CIA still has close links with the Pakistani intelligence service ISI.&rdquo; Just one day before the attacks, a Pakistani newspaper in Islamabad <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a090401mahmoodvisit#a090401mahmoodvisit" target="_blank"><strong>reported</strong></a> that the <a href="http://www.karachipage.com/news/Sep_01/091001.html" target="_blank"><strong>head of the ISI was meeting</strong></a> with unspecified members of the Pentagon, National Security Council, and CIA Director George Tenet.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">On May 18th, 2002 the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A36091-2002May17" target="_blank"><strong>Washington Post reported</strong></a> that:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">"On the morning of Sept. 11, Porter Goss and Bob Graham were having breakfast with a Pakistani general named Mahmud Ahmed -- the soon-to-be-sacked head of Pakistan's intelligence service. Ahmed ran a spy agency notoriously close to Osama bin Laden and the Taliban." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Specific details of that meeting have still not been released and may never have been recorded.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">In 2001, various media outlets (<a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/01/inv.pakistan.funds/" target="_blank"><strong>CNN</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,35540,00.html" target="_blank"><strong>Fox News</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/attacked/transcripts/abctext_093001.html" target="_blank"><strong>ABC</strong></a>, and <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/attack/41025_probe02.shtml" target="_blank"><strong>AP</strong></a>) reported that $100,000 was wired from Pakistan to Mohammed Atta, the 9-11 lead hijacker. A "senior law enforcement source" <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0110/07/sm.13.html" target="_blank"><strong>told CNN</strong></a> that the paymaster was believed to be Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who was working for the Pakistani ISI at the time.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Several media outlets <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a010100saeedreleased#a010100saeedreleased" target="_blank"><strong>reported</strong></a> in 2002 that the US government believed Saeed Sheikh to be an asset of the ISI, and that senior ISI officers knew him well.&nbsp; Also reported was the <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~gold9472/timesofindia1.gif" target="_blank"><strong>allegation by Indian intelligence</strong></a> that General Mahmud Ahmed ordered the wire transfer and that Indian intelligence claimed they had assisted the FBI during the investigation. Various mainstream Indian papers reported this in 2001 along with a mainstream Pakistani newspaper.&nbsp; In the West - the Wall Street Journal and <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/911timeline/2001/afp101001.html" target="_blank"><strong>Agence France Press</strong></a> picked up on the story in October. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">On October 7th 2001, Mahmood Ahmed <a href="http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/FD08Aa01.html" target="_blank"><strong>was fired</strong></a> from his role at the ISI. The <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/09/pakistan.afghanistan3" target="_blank"><strong>official explanation</strong></a> was because he was too close to the Taliban. This claim has been met with criticism by some analysts given the fact that there were several pro-Taliban officers that kept their jobs.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">During the 9/11 Commission hearings, the Family Steering Committee <a href="http://www.911independentcommission.org/questions.html" target="_blank"><strong>asked the Commissioners</strong></a> to investigate the ISI connection. However, the commission did little to "follow the money" and the 9/11 Commission Report made no mention of these allegations. Furthermore, the commission made the <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch5.htm" target="_blank"><strong>absurd statement</strong></a> that the question of who financed the terrorist attacks was "of little practical significance" [and that it had] "seen no evidence that any foreign government--or foreign government official--supplied any funding."</span></p>]]></description>

			<title>Red Flag -Transponders Not Required to Track Errant Aircraft</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://visibility911.com/redflags/2010/11/transponders-not-required-to-track-errant-aircraft/]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://visibility911.com/redflags/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/radar.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 8px;" height="246" width="348" />Most people don&rsquo;t realize that on September 11th, planes were known to be high jacked and flying around the Eastern US for over 70 minutes.&nbsp; After September 11th, many wondered why our air force was unable to stop the high jacked aircraft, especially American Airlines Flight 77 which struck the Pentagon.&nbsp; American Airlines Flight 11 was high jacked at 8:14. By 8:25 Boston <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a825bostonrealizes#a825bostonrealizes" target="_blank"><strong>air traffic controllers confirmed</strong></a> that the flight was indeed high jacked and the aircraft <a href="http://www.archives.gov/legislative/research/9-11/staff-report-sept2005.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>struck the North Tower</strong></a> of the World Trade Center at 8:46. &nbsp; At 9:03, United Airlines Flight 175 struck the South Tower and at that time, the whole world knew that America was under attack.&nbsp; It was not until 9:37 that <a href="http://www.archives.gov/legislative/research/9-11/staff-report-sept2005.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>American Airlines Flight 77</strong></a> hit the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was a full hour and 10 minutes between the time the FAA knew that Flight 11 was high jacked and the time Flight 77 hit the Pentagon.&nbsp; How could this happen?&nbsp; The area around the Pentagon and Washington D.C. is some of the most heavily defended airspace in the World.&nbsp; This fact led many to believe there had to be a stand down order issued which would have prevented <a href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/archive/hearing1/9-11Commission_Hearing_2003-03-31.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Standard Operating Procedures</strong></a> from allowing these aircraft to be intercepted.&nbsp; A <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/stand-down" target="_blank"><strong>stand-down</strong></a> is defined as &ldquo;a relaxation from a state of readiness or alert&rdquo;.&nbsp; This certainly took place regarding air defenses on 9/11.</p>
<p>One explanation offered was that the terrorists turned off the electronic device known as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transponder_%28aviation%29" target="_blank"><strong>transponder</strong></a>, which helps identify aircraft on radar.&nbsp; As stated by the 9/11 Commission, it is possible, though more difficult, to track an aircraft by its <a href="http://www.airwaysmuseum.com/Surveillance.htm" target="_blank"><strong>primary radar returns</strong></a> without the transponder.&nbsp; However, unlike transponder data, primary radar returns do not show the <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch1.htm" target="_blank"><strong>aircraft&rsquo;s identity and altitude</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The 9-11 commission failed to consider the fact that the US military has more than just ground radar at their disposal.&nbsp; In 2006 a golf ball was hit off the International Space Station.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10606" target="_blank"><strong>New Scientist</strong></a> magazine reported that the ball was too small to be tracked by ground radar, but noted that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;US military radar can track space debris as small as 10 centimeters across, and can sometimes see things as small as 5 cm wide if it is in just the right orbit.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.miprox.de/USA_speziell/Military_bases-0911_Flights.jpg" target="_blank"><strong>35 USAF bases</strong></a> within range of the 9/11 flights, which included the restricted airspace surrounding the Pentagon, Capitol Hill and the White House.&nbsp; It is hard to believe that a military which possesses such a highly-sophisticated radar system would not have been able to track the high jacked aircraft without a transponder signal.</p>
<p>Commercial airliners do not need their transponders on in order to be tracked by the FAA and NORAD.&nbsp; If America was being attacked by aircraft belonging to a foreign power, it is ridiculous to think these enemy aircraft would have transponders installed to help the US Air Force shoot them down.&nbsp; It is equally ridiculous to believe the FAA and NORAD lack the technology to track aircraft without a transponder signal.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Red Flag - Young Man to Cheney, Do the Orders Still Stand?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://visibility911.com/redflags/2010/11/do-the-orders-still-stand/]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://visibility911.com/redflags/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/norman-mineta.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 8px;" height="260" width="347" />On the morning of September 11th, 2001, <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a910tobunker#a910tobunker" target="_blank"><strong>Vice President Dick Cheney was in charge</strong></a> of the military response to the attacks while the President flew around the country in Air Force One.&nbsp; The 9-11 Commission failed to follow up on the nature of and order the Vice President had given which related to American Airlines Flight 77 which hit the Pentagon at 9:36.&nbsp; Many have wondered if these orders were NOT to shoot down Flight 77 as it approached the Pentagon.</p>
<p>We know about this order because on May 23, 2003, then Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta <a href="http://www.9-11commission.gov/archive/hearing2/9-11Commission_Hearing_2003-05-23.htm" target="_blank"><strong>testified</strong></a> before the 9-11 Commission.&nbsp; Secretary Mineta testified that he was present at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Emergency_Operations_Center" target="_blank"><strong>Presidential Emergency Operating Center </strong></a>(PEOC) in a bunker below the White House on the morning of September 11th under the direction of Vice President Dick Cheney.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDfdOwt2v3Y" target="_blank"><strong>During questioning</strong></a> by Co-Chairman Lee Hamilton, Mineta was asked if he was in the PEOC when the Presidential order was given to shoot down suspected hijacked commercial airliners.</p>
<p>During the time that Secretary Mineta testified about, Flight 77 had already been severely off course for over an hour and it was thought that the flight was being controlled by terrorists.&nbsp; Flight 77 was also being tracked by the FAA and NORAD and according to Secretary Mineta&rsquo;s testimony it was even being tracked for at least 50 miles from the PEOC.</p>
<p>Secretary Mineta&rsquo;s testimony has raised many questions.&nbsp; The most obvious question is, what were the orders that Vice-President Cheney had issued to the young man?&nbsp; When asked by Mr. Hamilton during testimony if the order was a shoot down order, Secretary Mineta could not confirm that it was. &nbsp; Is it reasonable to assume that this was a shoot down order?</p>
<p>During this same hearing, Secretary Mineta also testified that aircraft had been scrambled from nearby Langley Air Force Base and were only 10 miles away from the Washington D.C. area.&nbsp; If the orders Secretary Mineta spoke of was a shoot down order, then why was this plane not shot down before it hit the Pentagon?&nbsp; Our modern fighters are the most sophisticated in the world and can shoot down multiple targets from many miles away.&nbsp; The question begs to be asked,&nbsp; were these orders the young man spoke of orders NOT to shoot down Flight 77?</p>
<p>We now know that Naval Officer Douglas F. Cochrane is the young man Mineta was referring to in his testimony.&nbsp; When questioned about the day, Mr. Cochrane has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O0TP_7UWok" target="_blank"><strong>refused to answer questions</strong></a> about what happened and repeatedly refers to the 9-11 Commission as the definitive report on the terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>It is another failure of the 9-11 Commission that this testimony by Secretary Mineta was not followed up on.&nbsp; Today, important questions still persist about what these orders were and why the 9-11 Commission failed to dig deeper and ask questions of how Flight 77 could have possibly been allowed to strike the heart of the US Military.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Red Flag - The Bush Administration Opposed a 9/11 Commission</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://visibility911.com/redflags/2010/11/the-bush-administration-opposed-a-911-commission/]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://visibility911.com/redflags/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bush_kissinger.gif" style="float: right; margin: 8px;" height="180" width="300" />The Bush administration fought hard against the creation of an independent commission to investigate 9/11.&nbsp; The families who fought for the creation of such a commission, wanted full accountability concerning the event that led to the deaths of their loved ones.&nbsp; Yet, the administration resisted this. Why?</p>
<p>On the 29th of January 2002 &ndash; CNN reported that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;President Bush personally asked Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle Tuesday to limit the congressional investigation into the events of September 11&Prime;. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daschle <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/01/29/inv.terror.probe/" target="_blank"><strong>told reporters</strong></a> that an investigation,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;&hellip;would take resources and personnel away from the effort in the war on terrorism&rdquo;.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On May 23rd 2002, CBS News reported that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;President Bush took a few minutes during his trip to Europe Thursday to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/05/15/attack/main509096.shtml" target="_blank"><strong>voice his opposition</strong></a> to establishing a special commission to probe how the government dealt with terror warnings before Sept. 11.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The excuses for the opposition to the Commission often given were alleged fears of national security compromises and claims that those involved in the &ldquo;war on terrorism&rdquo; would have their jobs hampered.&nbsp; Yet, clearly national security had been compromised as a result of the attacks. If there were such failings and if people did not do their jobs, then they needed to be held accountable.</p>
<p>In September 2002, under pressure from victims&rsquo; family members, CBS reported that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;President Bush told Congress <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/24/attack/main523156.shtml" target="_blank"><strong>he now supports</strong></a> creation of an independent commission to probe the September eleventh attacks.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The victims&rsquo; families &ldquo;<a href="http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/04/10/int04053.html" target="_blank"><strong>fought the Bush administration</strong></a> tooth and nail for a commission to investigate the September 11th terrorist attacks &mdash; and won&rdquo;.&nbsp; Yet, why did they even have to fight them for one in the first place?</p>
<p>In total, the Bush administration <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Commission_Report" target="_blank"><strong>fought off an investigation</strong></a> for 441 days before the mandate was finally <a href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/about/faq.htm#q2" target="_blank"><strong>passed into law</strong></a> on November 27, 2002.</p>
<p>During the 9/11 Commission hearings &ndash; the Family Steering Committee requested Commissioners to <a href="http://www.911independentcommission.org/questions.html" target="_blank"><strong>ask Bush and Cheney</strong></a> to,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;explain your 14 month opposition to the creation of an independent commission to investigate 9/11 and your request to Senator Daschle to quash such an investigation&rdquo;. Yet, no answer is forthcoming.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bush administration actively opposed any formal investigation into the attacks of September 11th.&nbsp; If it were not for the determination of victims&rsquo; family members and a budding <a href="http://www.911truth.org/" target="_blank"><strong>9-11 Truth Movement</strong></a>, there would have never been any inquiry beyond the heavily redacted <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/911.html" target="_blank"><strong>Joint Intelligence Committee Inquiry</strong></a> from 2002. &nbsp; Why did President Bush not want the American public to know exactly what happened before, during, and after September 11th?</p>]]></description>

			<title>Red Flag - 9/11 Commission, Set Up to Fail</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://visibility911.com/redflags/2010/06/9-11-red-flag-9-11-commission-set-up-to-fail/]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><img src="http://visibility911.com/redflags/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/WithoutPrecedent.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 8px;" height="231" width="156" />Thomas Kean</strong> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_H._Hamilton" target="_blank"><strong>Lee Hamilton</strong></a> , the Chair and Vice-Chair of the 9/11 Commission, made an astonishing admission in their book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Without-Precedent-Inside-Story-Commission/dp/0307263770" target="_blank"><em><strong>Without Precedent &ndash; The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission</strong></em></a>.&nbsp; They said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It appeared to both of us that the [9-11] commission was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnANe7w8pmY" target="_blank"><strong>set up to fail</strong></a>&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an interview with the CBC, Lee Hamilton said he thought they were &ldquo;reasonably successful in telling the story,&rdquo; although he also acknowledged, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe for a minute that we got everything right.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, that the Commission was set up to fail at all is a big Red Flag.&nbsp; Why was the Commission set up to fail, and who did it?</p>
<p>Kean and Hamilton, in the first chapter of the book titled, &ldquo;Set Up to Fail,&rdquo; explain their reason for thinking this.</p>
<p>1) The <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/11/15/congress.commission/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>late establishment</strong></a> and start of the commission itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, it took 441 days after the attacks and a Congressional mandate to force the Bush administration into a formal investigation.<br /> 2) There were numerous complications in <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a032703clearances#a032703clearances" target="_blank"><strong>obtaining security clearances</strong></a> for Commissioners and staff.<br /> 3) There was a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzrv-e37Es8" target="_blank"><strong>deadline for completion</strong></a> which did not allow the proper time to fulfill their mandate.<br /> 4) The commission was <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,437267,00.html" target="_blank"><strong>severely underfunded</strong></a>.&nbsp; Only $3 million dollars was initially allocated, though two months later the Bush Administration reluctantly increased the total to $12 million.<br /> 5) The commission had <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=alate0103zelikowgonzales#alate0103zelikowgonzales" target="_blank"><strong>restricted access</strong></a> to important documents and witnesses.&nbsp; <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070108233707/http://www.cbc.ca/sunday/911hamilton.html" target="_blank"><strong>According to Hamilton</strong></a>, &ldquo;&hellip; we were fighting the question of access right up to the end of the Commission&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;<br /> 6) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/01/AR2006080101300.html" target="_blank"><strong>False testimony</strong></a> was given by NORAD officials, and<br /> 7) The commission encountered <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02kean.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion" target="_blank"><strong>obstruction by the CIA</strong></a>, and possibly the White House, over access to prisoners accused of having a role in the 9/11 plot.</p>
<p>One might reasonably ask; if they&rsquo;ve got nothing to hide, why are they acting as if they do?&nbsp; When Hamilton was asked by the CBC interviewer about why he thought they were set up to fail, he laughed, and said, &ldquo;I think basically it&rsquo;s because they were afraid we were going to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnANe7w8pmY" target="_blank"><strong>hang somebody</strong></a>, that we would point the finger, right in the middle of a presidential campaign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 9-11 Commission was <a href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/about/faq.htm#q1" target="_blank"><strong>mandated by law</strong></a> to &ldquo;provide a full and complete accounting&rdquo; of the tragic events of September 11th.&nbsp; How on earth were they able to carry out this mandate if they were &ldquo;set up to fail&rdquo;?&nbsp; The answer is, they couldn&rsquo;t.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Visibility911 Welcomes Australian Union President, Kevin Bracken - A True Working Class Hero!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://visibility911.libsyn.com/visibility911-welcomes-australian-union-president-kevin-bracken-a-true-working-class-hero-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;"><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/kevin-bracken.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 8px;" height="373" width="280" />To many the name Kevin Bracken is a new one in regards 9/11 Truth. The reality is that Kevin has been a champion of the 9/11 Truth cause since 2006 by disseminating information throughout the Victorian Union Movement and the <a href="http://www.mua.org.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Maritime Workers Union of Australia</strong></a>. He has distributed DVD's, shown films and shared information regularly with his associates and the people of Melbourne and he achieved motions calling for a new investigation from both the Victorian Trades Hall Council where he is the President and the Victorian branch of the Maritime Union of Australia of which he heads as Secretary. Kevin has also attended numerous conferences on 9/11 and has been the facilitator of such in Melbourne, Australia. Over the years Kevin and I have developed a close working relationship, both striving for the truth 9/11 to come out to bring end to the wars and to get our rights back that have been eroded since 9/11!</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">This is the motion passed on the 28th of March of 2008 at the VTHC;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">"That this meeting of VTHC Executive Council calls for a thorough, independent enquiry into the tragic terrorist attacks of September 11.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">The events of that day have been used to start pre-emptive wars "that will not end in our lifetime". They have been used to attack civil liberties and legal principles that have been the cornerstone of civilized communities. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">There is an urgent need to reassess the way we view the world after September 11 and we call for proper investigation into the events around that day.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">On the 20th of October 2010 Kevin was asked to ring into ABC 774 <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/melbourne/programs/melbourne_mornings/" target="_blank"><strong>Mornings with John Faine</strong></a> although Faine disputes this. This was following an email that was sent to Faine by Kevin questioning 9/11 in the context of Australia's ongoing support of the Afghanistan occupation. After the recent Australian Election it was demanded by the Australian Greens in a "balance of power" deal that the Australian involvement in the Afghan War be debated in parliament in it's first sitting. This debate had been going on this week and it was the first time any such debate had happened since 9/11, which is simply outrageous.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">This interview by Faine was possibly the most biased ever heard in Australia on radio broadcast by the tax payer funded Australian Broadcasting Corporation. This attack by Faine of Bracken's questioning the 9/11 events included a torrent of ad hominem slurs and an absolute refusal to discuss any evidence that the events were anything but what we have been told by our governments. A reasonable explanation of what happened and also with attached audio can be found <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/trades-hall-president-kevin-bracken-calls-911-conspiracy/story-e6frf7kx-1225941158523" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>.&nbsp; This story titled <strong>"Trades Hall president Kevin Bracken Stands by his 9/11 Conspiracy"</strong> has been reported all around the world and included a poll which started off running at around 50/50 asking if Kevin's questions about 9/11 were "reasonable" but has continued to move in his favour ending up at the time of writing these notes at 75% in favour of Bracken.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Kevin has received literally thousands of thank you's from around the world for his brave stance for 9/11 Truth! Standing his ground even after being directly verbally bashed by the Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard saying he was "<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/20/3043612.htm?section=world" target="_blank"><strong>stupid and wrong</strong></a>" and having his own leadership comrades buckle at the knees if the face of unfounded ridicule. Rather than running for cover Kevin with his chin in the air has reiterated his position defying any to debate him on the issue! As usual all media presstitutes have refused, as there is obviously "no debate to have".&nbsp; It seems that the vast majority of the public disagree and would like to see such a debate but none of the so called "journalists" dare to tread such a path.&nbsp; </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Interesting to note that John Faine is now complaining that the ABC has been <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/local/videos/2010/10/22/3046082.htm?site=melbourne" target="_blank"><strong>swamped</strong></a> by 9/11 activists and it may take the ABC many weeks to deal with the massive amount of complaints and comments they have received. Many of these I know to be formal as I have received many courtesy copies of the complaints to the ABC accusing them of breeching their charter and broadcast policy.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">The battle for 9/11 Truth is far from over and as long as the fools in power maintain their policy of occupation of Afghanistan they will remain exposed and at risk of criminal prosecution due to the lies of 9/11. Lets hope it comes soon or they realize and stop the bloodshed. </span></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: times new roman; font-size: small;">Interview by John Bursill<br /><br /><a href="http://www.visibility911.com"><strong><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/bobBowman.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 8px;" height="314" width="230" />Visibility 9-11</strong></a> welcomes for the first time a tireless campaigner for peace, justice and liberty for the American People, hero and patriot <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Bowman"><strong>Bob Bowman</strong></a>. In my opinion and from what Bob has achieved on shoe string budget over the last six years, it is fair to say he would have in all likelihood become the current President of the USA in a different and truthful world.&nbsp; That is a world where we had a free and honest press in the US and had the truth of the 9/11 attacks exposed to all.&nbsp; Bob is the man that best represents the phrase speaking truth to power and was the man that brought that term to the 9/11 Truth Movement through speeches throughout America and the world! <br /><br />In this interview Bob talks about issues and ideas never before raised with him on air. This interview is a must listen! <br /><br />Dr Robert M. Bowman is a former Director of Advanced Space Programs Development for the U.S. Air Force in the Ford and Carter administrations, and a former United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel with 101 combat missions in Vietnam.&nbsp; He holds a PhD in Aeronautics and Nuclear Engineering from Cal Tech.&nbsp; He has been a long time peace activist (30+ years) and was directly involved in preventing nuclear war by exposing the crazies in the White House and in the Military Industrial Complex for the idiocy they represent.&nbsp; Bob has found himself fighting those same people today as part of the 9/11 Truth Movement. <br /><br />In this interview we cover a lot of new ground and new approaches to 9/11 Truth.&nbsp; Bob talks to us about infiltrating the halls of power with our message within the existing two party structure and the ways we&nbsp; can achieve our goals.&nbsp; He also gives a look into past meetings and attempts to encourage the Peace Movement to realize the power of questioning 9/11.<br />&nbsp;<br />As has been a theme since I stepped in for Michael as the show host, I ask Bob about some controversial issues that plague the 9/11 Truth Movement.&nbsp; Including the recent unsupported accusations blaming Israel as the mastermind of the 9/11 Attacks. Bowman has a strong view that US policy towards Israel needs to change and is acutely aware of the situation as a half Jewish man who wants peace in the Middle East.<br /><br />Bob is calling for support of his massive <a href="http://www.thepatriots.us/"><strong>Westcoast Tour</strong></a> this summer so please get involved and support this outstanding man on a mission to educate, stimulate and encourage the people to speak truth to power! <br />Contact: bob (at) thepatriots.us<br />Web Site: <a href="http://www.thepatriots.us/"><strong>www.thepatriots.us</strong></a> <br /><br />Some of the insights that a man of Bowman&rsquo;s caliber can give us are simply so motivating and stimulating it can&rsquo;t be overstated.&nbsp; We wish Bob all the best and we hope the American People get behind a man of such great wisdom and light in a dark, dark world!<br /><br />Music by <a href="http://visibility911.com/blog/?p=882"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Jesse Goplen.</span></a><br /><br /></span></p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/visibility911/visibility911_bursill_ryan.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span class="apple-style-span"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif';"><span style="font-family: arial;">Interview by John Bursill</span><br style="font-family: arial;" /><br style="font-family: arial;" /><span style="font-family: arial;"><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/kevin-ryan.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 8px;" height="296" width="219" />It is a great pleasure to welcome back our regular guest Kevin Ryan to the <a href="http://www.visibility911.com"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Visibility 9-11</span></a> Podcast. Kevin is arguably the hardest working and most prolific scientific author within the 9/11 Truth Community!</span><br style="font-family: arial;" /><br style="font-family: arial;" /><span style="font-family: arial;">In this show we ask Kevin to look back at the investigative work he and his peers have carried out for the <a href="www.Journalof911Studies.com"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Journal of 9/11 Studies</span></a> of which he is a Co-Editor and leading author. There are simply too many topics covered in this interview to mention them all here in the notes. Highlights include Kevin's work on discovering who had access to the Towers, his recent correspondence with 9/11 Commission Co-Chairman Lee Hamilton and we also ask Kevin, "who did 9/11?" </span><br style="font-family: arial;" /><br style="font-family: arial;" /><span style="font-family: arial;">Kevin Ryan lost his job due to the pursuit of truth and justice for the victims of the 9/11 attacks and has dedicated his life to discovering what happened on that dreadful day and will not be stopped until justice is done. </span><br style="font-family: arial;" /><br style="font-family: arial;" /><span style="font-family: arial;">Any that wish to be educated on all matters 9/11 listen closely to what this man is saying!</span><br style="font-family: arial;" /><br /></span></span></p>]]></description>

			<title>Staying Reasonable with 9/11 Truth - A Powerful Path to Success!  An Interview with Ken Jenkins</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/visibility911/visibility911_bursill_jenkins.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Interview and notes by John Bursill<br /><br /><a href="http://www.visibility911.com" target="_blank"><strong><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/ken-jenkins.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 8px;" height="272" width="319" />Visibility 9-11</strong></a> is excited to welcome for the first time long-term activist/organiser, film maker, writer, engineer and psychologist <a href="http://www.911tv.org" target="_blank"><strong>Ken Jenkins</strong></a>. Ken's qualities of patience, fairness, optimism and clear logical thinking are well displayed in this interview! I consider Ken a cornerstone of this movement pursuing 9/11 Truth, which he has devoted nearly 9 years of his life to. Ken's work is primarily as a film maker.&nbsp; He has produced and directed documentaries for the likes of Richard Gage, David Ray Griffin and Dr Steven Jones, just to name a few. Ken's skills have been invaluable to the 9-11 movement and given us all valuable tools to help us all take many scientific and academic presentations to the the general public.&nbsp; Ken is a professional videographer and consistently provides these films at a high level of production value and offers them at a tenth of the cost to us to use in our activsm. It is true to say that without the efforts of Ken Jenkins and his right-hand man <strong>hummux</strong> our movement would be less successful! Visibility 9-11 sincerely thanks Ken and hummux for this very important and tedious work. <br /><br />Ken is also a very popular speaker and generally talks about the psychological barriers to 9/11 Truth. He recently published an excellent article <a href="http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20090506155958670" target="_blank"><em><strong>The Truth is Not Enough: How to Overcome Emotional Barriers to 9/11 Truth</strong></em></a> which was requested by the magazine editors of Global Outlook for the 13th edition.<br /><br />In this episode of Visibility 9-11 we discuss what's reasonable and what works for 9/11 Truth. Some of topics we consider include;<br /><br />&gt; Are we to quick to label people or ideas as influenced, owned or controlled by our opposition?<br />&gt; The destructive nature of exotic theories and wild claims, including the recent claim of Pilots for 9/11 Truth that flight 11 and 175 obtained "impossible speed" approaching the Twin Towers.<br />&gt; The question of who did 9/11 in the light of claims recently made by Dr Alan Sabrosky. <br />&gt; Symbiosis, is it the best way of thinking about the possible perpetrators of the 9/11 Attacks?<br />&gt; Why can't we get support from the peace movement and is it important anyway? <br /><br />Towards the end of the interview we talk about the upcoming events on May 7th and 8th in California, where a new DVD will be produced combing Firefighters and Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth. Gage and Erik Lawyer on one DVD will be possibly the most powerful presentation for activism to date! <br /><br />Films made and distributed by Ken and his partner hummux can be found at <a href="http://www.911tv.org" target="_blank"><strong>www.911TV.org</strong></a></p>

			<title>Visibility 9-11 welcomes back Erik Lawyer the founder of Firefighters for 9-11 Truth</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://visibility911.libsyn.com/visibility_9_11_welcomes_back_erik_lawyer_the_founder_of_firefighters_for_9_11_truth]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/V911-firefight.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 8px;" height="201" width="317" />343 brave New York City&nbsp;Firefighters&nbsp;died on 9/11, this episode of<a href="http://www.visibility911.com" target="_blank"> Visibility 9/11</a> is dedicated to them!&nbsp;</strong> <br />&nbsp;If you have not heard the name Erik Lawyer&nbsp;it is one to remember. Erik is a full time Firefighter and is a new shinning light in the 9/11 Truth Movement. He has been impressing all he meets with his simple message demanding a thorough criminal forensic investigation of the 9/11 World Trade Center catastrophe. He and his&nbsp;fire-fighting&nbsp;comrades&nbsp;want the authorities to do their job and carry out an investigation&nbsp;in accordance with fire scene&nbsp;investigation protocols, that he and all US fire fighters adhere to religiously.<br /> <br /> &nbsp;On 9/11 so many&nbsp;things happened for the first time and the one that is of greatest concern&nbsp;to Erik and his group, <a href="http://firefightersfor911truth.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Firefighters for 9/11 Truth</strong></a><a href="http://firefightersfor911truth.org/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #074d8f;">&nbsp;</span></a> is the near&nbsp;complete destruction of evidence at this fire&nbsp;crime scene and the subsequent monumental&nbsp;cover up&nbsp;and&nbsp;obfuscation of the little remaining evidence.&nbsp; Independently gathered evidence clearly&nbsp;demonstrates that incendiaries and explosives were used to facilitate the three WTC buildings destruction.&nbsp; For more information, see the <a href="http://www.visibility911.com" target="_blank"><strong>Visibility 9-11</strong></a> Special Report, <a href="http://www.visibility911.com/reports-thermite01.php" target="_blank"><strong>Thermite Fingerprint- The Loaded Gun of 9-11</strong></a>. <br /> &nbsp;In this latest interview John and Erik talk about the future plans for Firefighters for 9/11 Truth&nbsp;and their achievements so far and we also talk about the strong bond being formed&nbsp;between&nbsp;"Firefighters&nbsp;for 9/11 Truth" and the highly&nbsp;successful&nbsp;"Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth". Soon&nbsp;an exciting new video is&nbsp;to be produced by both groups&nbsp;providing an even better and&nbsp;broader video resource for public education than the current "9/11 - Blue Print for Truth"; while still sticking to a careful non-conspiratorial fact based approach. <br /> &nbsp;Visibility 9/11 congratulates Erik and Firefighters for 9/11 Truth for&nbsp;their&nbsp;commitment to truth and justice&nbsp;in the face of personal attack and ridicule. As Erik has demonstrated in his Seattle Fire Station, ignorance is no match for hard evidence.&nbsp;It is a simple truth that&nbsp;all&nbsp;who dare to look at that evidence&nbsp;will concede there is a clear and present danger to the American&nbsp;public and the world&nbsp;if we do not&nbsp;find&nbsp;the&nbsp;real reasons for&nbsp;the three building collapses on 9/11. It is also very reassuring to see another group of professional 9/11 Truth Advocates being careful with what they say and do in the name of 9/11 Truth. Firefighters for 9/11 Truth will always put the victims and the first responders concerns and welfare&nbsp;first!&nbsp;</p>

			<title>A True &quot;All-American&quot; Betsy Metz Exposes &quot;Treason in America&quot;!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/visibility911/visibility911_bursill_metz.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/betsy-metz.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 8px;" height="454" width="260" />A True "All-American" Betsy Metz Exposes "Treason in America"!</strong><br /><strong>A Visibility 9-11 Podcast&nbsp; </strong><br />Interview by John Bursill<br /><br />In this motivating interview I talk to organiser, activist and philanthropist <strong>Betsy Metz</strong>. We ask Betsy about the highly successful conference she organised and facilitated this month. The March 2010 <a href="http://www.treasoninamericaconference.com/" target="_blank"><strong>"Treason in America: 9/11, the Wars &amp; Our Broken Constitution"</strong></a> Conference was a milestone in the history of the 9/11 Truth Movement. For the first time in America Peace Activist, Government Whistle Blowers, Journalists and 9/11 Truthers explored recent American History together with open minds and hearts, searching for the shocking truth. See: www.treasoninamericaconference.com <br /><br />So who is Betsy Metz?<br /><br />Betsy Metz is the quintessential All-American gal! She is a well educated and fiercely patriotic mother of four and a devoted and loving wife of her husband for 26 happy years. Her husband is also the All-American, being a college quarterback and an ex Marine Corps Officer. Together as a family they want for nothing and by any standard they have had an excellent and prosperous life. This life would be impossible in nearly any other country in the world and it is fair to say they are living the "American Dream"!<br /><br />So why does Betsy Metz matter to me and to you in this age of the awakening?<br /><br />Well Betsy is a little different to the average American successful middle-class mum; "she cares" and "she acts" in the interest of her country,her family and the world. Betsy honours Truth, Justice and what she thought was the American way. The way of freedom, liberty and most importantly the way courage, that is the courage to face treasonous tyranny in her America!&nbsp; <br /><br />When Betsy started to see in 2003 that we had been lied to about the war in Iraq, she cared. When she found out through self education 9/11 was a lie in 2006 she really cared a lot and was compelled to act! Betsy began one of the most important individual efforts to raise awareness of the crimes of 9/11 we have seen in the world, period. <br /><br />With a smile and a determination to her use her affluence for good and not for the greedy pursuit of materialism she has single handedly done more to preserve the American Dream she lives, than any in her local community. She joins a very small group of men and women in America that can look themselves in the mirror and say I did my duty to preserve what gave me the blessed life I have had and I want for future generations.<br /><br />Any one you ask about Betsy within the 9/11 Truth Movement says the same things, they love her and they know she can be counted on to produce the goods, time and time again! <br /><br />This month of March 2010 Betsy took us to another level with our quest for the pursuit of 9/11 Truth. I on behalf of us all around the world, thank you Betsy, and the great American family that supports you, bravo!&nbsp; <br /><br />If the "American Dream" is still alive, it lives in Betsy Metz! <br /><br />Let our dearest Betsy be an example to the many of us that have benefited from freedom and wealth America gave to our world. Lets do as she does and act now with all our means and with all our hearts to fight to expose the treason living large in America and within it's empire.<br /><br />Betsy would like to thank all the attendees, speakers and helpers at the "Treason in America" Event, and she says that she couldn't of done it as well without the assistance and advice of event MC Jon Gold.</p>
<p>We at Visibility 9-11 wish to extend a special thanks to Betsy, who has been an ardent supporter of our website and podcast.&nbsp; Thanks Betsy!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Visibility 9-11 Welcomes Jon Gold</strong><br />Interview by John Bursill<br /><br /><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/john-gold.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 8px;" height="312" width="273" />This week on <a href="http://www.visibility911.com" target="_blank"><strong>Visibility 9-11</strong></a> we have <a href="http://www.yourbbsucks.com" target="_blank"><strong>Jon Gold</strong></a>, a long-time 9/11 truth activist who is currently building bridges between the 9/11 truth movement and the peace movement. Jon talks about two very important and groundbreaking events that he is participating in March. The details are below.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.treasoninamericaconference.com" target="_blank"><strong>Treason in America: 9/11, The Wars &amp; Our Broken Constitution Conference</strong></a><br />Valley Forge Convention Center<br />March 6 &amp; 7th<br /><br />This event brings together peace activists, whistleblowers, alternative media and 9/11 truth advocates to a conference discussing the issues and problems produced by the 9/11 attacks and cover-up. Jon will be the MC at this event and the speakers include Richard Gage AIA, Cindy Sheehan, Lt. Colonel Anthony Shaffer, Bob McIlvaine, Daniel Sunjata and Luke Rudkowski just to name a few! Neither left nor right, this gathering is truly groundbreaking.<br /><br />Please support this event, see details here: <strong><a href="http://www.treasoninamericaconference.com" target="_blank">www.treasoninamericaconference.com</a></strong><br /><br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peaceoftheaction.org&amp;h=a161180895eb99971426b96620087f59" target="_blank"><strong>Peace of the Action</strong></a><br />Washington DC<br />Washington Memorial March 13th of March <br />Direct Acts of Resistance Begin on March 22nd<br /><br />The bold plan to stop the Masters of War by bringing their system to its knees by peaceful resistance might just work! If Gandhi could do it so can Sheehan with our help and determination. Why not get a peace of this action yourself?<br /><br />See details here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peaceoftheaction.org&amp;h=a161180895eb99971426b96620087f59" target="_blank"><strong>http://peaceoftheaction.org</strong></a><br />Cindy Sheehan on 9/11 truth: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzxG-phm8Iw" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzxG-phm8Iw</strong></a><br /><br />Jon will speaking about 9/11 at the Peace of the Action events.&nbsp; <br /><br />At the end of the show we discuss good methods for reaching out to people who ordinarily wouldn't be open to 9/11 truth. It should be noted that Jon is considered controversial by some in the 9/11 truth movement because of his very critical approach to the evidence of the crimes of 9/11. Jon prefers to stick to the facts that "speak for themselves" and Jon is not a promoter of the controlled demolition hypothesis. I and a great many others would agree that being careful with evidence is a must, although we would strongly argue that the destruction of WTC 7 does "speak for itself"; screaming out "Controlled Demolition!". But as Jon likes to remind us, the advocacy of any particular hypothesis is not a prerequisite for being a 9/11 truth activist.</p>]]></description>

			<title>An Honest Skeptic's View of the Great American Conspiracies: Lincoln to 9/11 - Visibility 9-11 Welcomes Dr Stephen Juan</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/visibility911/visibility911_bursill_juan.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/stephen-juan.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 8px;" height="216" width="198" />An Honest Skeptic's View of the Great American Conspiracies: Lincoln to 9/11 - Interview with Dr Stephen Juan</strong></p>
<p>Interview by John Bursill</p>
<p>It is a great pleasure to welcome bestselling author, media personality and lecturer <a href="http://www.drstephenjuan.com.au" target="_blank"><strong>Dr Stephen Juan</strong></a> to <a href="http://www.visibility911.com" target="_blank"><strong>Visibility 9-11</strong></a> to talk about "honest" skepticism of the great American conspiracies. This is a very interesting interview as we touch on many common themes in historical events setting the climate for the 9/11 Attacks. We explore the Lincoln assassination, the sinking of the Maine and Lusitania, Pearl Harbor and the JFK assassination. It is also a little special in my view as this skepticism is being presented in a balanced and conservative way by an intellectual who is not connected to the 9/11 Truth Movement, but rather to the mainstream. The views expressed and questions asked by Dr Juan are really what we should be hearing from the broader academically based media communities, publications and personalities, but we most certainly and unfortunately are not.&nbsp; As far as I know, with this broadcast, he is the first Australian media science personality to honestly question the official story of 9/11. Please may there be more to follow soon! Dr Juan makes it clear that he is not an expert in these matters but he follows the principles of scientific research when reviewing events like 9/11. In the last part of the interview, Dr Juan says he has many questions around the building collapses appearing to him to be "controlled demolitions...hello" and he thinks that the supporting evidence for the government's account is often simply ridiculous in nature. Dr Juan believes it is very important for us all be skeptical of our government's excuses to go to war based on his experience and that "conspiracy theorists" should be taken seriously when serious questions remain unanswered. Dr Juan says the truth about 9/11 is coming out much quicker than it did with the JFK assassination; so we the truth seekers should remain optimistic that the truth will out and he encourages us that many in what he calls the "underground corporate media" are trying to raise awareness of these issues when possible, sometimes indirectly. He also explains from his experience in the media that these opportunities for the truth of 9/11 are very difficult to come across.&nbsp;&nbsp; To find more about Dr Juan please visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Juan" target="_blank"><strong>his Wiki page</strong></a> or <a href="http://www.drstephenjuan.com.au" target="_blank"><strong>his website</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the show I mention the shock illness of Janette MacKinlay and that our best wishes are with her at this worrying time. For more info see www.911blogger.com/node/22568.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/visibility911/visibility911_bursill_gage.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/gage-truck.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 8px;" height="282" width="376" />In this episode of Visibility 9-11, John Bursill welcomes Richard Gage AIA back to the program. This interview was inspired by the recent news that Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth had reach the milestone of 1,000 qualified and licensed members. Gage who is an experienced San Francisco Architect, member of the American Institute of Architects and the founder of Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth describes some of the groups recent success's world wide and talks about his recent tour of Australia, New Zealand and Japan. We hear about the up coming Press Conference planned next month to announce the 1,000 A &amp; E members to the world, which includes approximately 40 Structural Engineers. Richard also mentions some celebrations that are planned for the A &amp; E members, please see the site for more details www.AE911Truth.org<br /><br /> Later in the show Bursill and Gage discuss the recent debate between him and explosives expert Ron Craig and what was learned by the encounter. See www.ae911truth.org/info/151 . They also touch on the issue of the CIT "flyover" and "what hit the Pentagon". Gage makes it clear that he does not think that the "flyover" is proven and that he does not support CIT. Gage says he does not know what did or did not hit the Pentagon. <br /><br /> Towards the end of this interview Gage joins Bursill in a call for support of www.911Truth.org and Janice Matthews and they also call for direct financial support for the ongoing work that the Architects and Engineers Group continue to do, day in and day out until justice.</p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/visibility911/visibility911_bursill_mathews.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>As part of a new series of interviews from Visibility 9-11 with Michael Wolsey, Guest Host John Bursill talks to 911Truth.org Executive Director, Janice Matthews.<br /><br /><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Janice_with_Mama_Kangaroo.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 8px;" height="225" width="300" />In the first part of this wide ranging interview Janice talks about "The Hard Evidence Tour Down Under" in Australia and New Zealand in which she participated. She also touches on conversations she had with other speakers in Sydney about what's working for 9/11 Truth and what 911Truth.org means to them now and what role it should play in the future. See <a href="www.TheHardEvidence.com"><span style="font-weight: bold;">www.TheHardEvidence.com</span></a> for more on the tour, and also Janice's brief report at <a href="http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20091124044913656"><span style="font-weight: bold;">http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20091124044913656</span></a>.<br /><br />John in the second half puts Janice on the spot with questions about our direction as a movement and the problems we continue to face with disinformation, like the continually reoccurring theme "the Jews did 9/11". John expresses strongly his view that we as a movement must try to be "reasonable" with our approach to evidence and when considering what is worthy of public consumption. <br /><br />Janice wraps up the interview talking about her belief that structural system change comes about only through personal resistance and how 9/11 truth as a specific issue helps build the broad understanding and participation needed to bring about this larger change.<br /><br />To comment on this interview John Bursill can be contacted at johnbursill [at] gmail.com and Janice Matthews can be contacted at janice [at] 911truth.org.&nbsp; <br /><br />Intermission music by <a href="http://www.indymedia.ie/article/38083?comment_order=asc&amp;condense_comments=true&amp;userlanguage=ga&amp;save_prefs=true">Judith</a>.<br />Ending music by <a href="http://www.acdc.com">AC/DC</a>.<br /><br /></p>]]></description>

			<title>Visibility 9-11 Welcomes Dr. Frank Legge, PhD</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/visibility911/visibility911_dr_legge.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/whathitpentagon.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 8px;" height="222" width="350" />This episode of <a href="http://www.visibility911.com"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Visibility 9-11</span></a> welcomes Dr. Frank Legge, PhD to the program.&nbsp; Dr. Legge is a chemist and serves as a co-editor at the <a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Journal of 9-11 Studies</span></a>.&nbsp; He has contributed many essays and papers on the topic of September 11th, including his role in the peer reviewed article titled <a href="http://www.visibility911.com/reports-thermite01.php"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9-11 World Trade Center Catastrophe</span></a>. &nbsp;<br /><br />This interview focuses on Dr. Legge's new essay is titled <a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/volume/2009/WhatHitPentagonDrLeggeAug.pdf"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">What Hit the Pentagon?</span></a> and is published in it's latest version (v.5) at the Journal of 9-11 Studies.&nbsp; This essay's leading hypothesis states that:<br /><br /></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-style: italic;">The major hypothesis is that various groups within the 9/11 truth movement are strongly asserting contradictory views and hence weakening the credibility of the movement as a whole.&nbsp; The damage is exacerbated if the supporters of these views not only disagree but also attack one another.</div>
<p><br />Dr. Legge also includes a minor hypothesis which says:<br /><br /></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px; font-style: italic;">The minor hypothesis of the paper is that there is no scientific proof that a Boeing 757 did not hit the Pentagon.</div>
<p><br />Both hypotheses are examined as well as the idea that the "no plane at the Pentagon" theory is a booby trap for the entire movement.&nbsp; This idea states that if members of the 9-11 movement continue to promote this "no&nbsp; plane" theory as fact, that as our efforts become increasingly mainstream, we run the risk of the government producing a video of AA 77 actually hitting the Pentagon.&nbsp; We know the government has many videos which they have deliberately withheld from the public.&nbsp; What little information we have been given through official channels has only fueled the "no plane" argument.&nbsp; If a video were released tomorrow, it is suggested that this would thrust the entire movement into disarray as well as be used in the media to discredit us and irrevocably damage our credibility.<br /><br />Also of importance in Dr. Legge's essay is the section on The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Precautionary Principle</span>.&nbsp; We at Visibility 9-11 endorse this approach and caution listeners and visitors to do your homework and only present to the public that information which is solidly documented or backed up by scientific research.<br /><br />Lastly, is a brief mention of the fine work of John Bursill in hosting 4 events in Australia and New Zealand during the month of November.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.thehardevidence.com/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Hard Evidence Tour Down Under 2009</span></a> will feature my guest Dr. Legge as well as other solid and reputable members of the movement, and providing to the public only the best evidence we have.&nbsp; Thanks to John Bursill for pulling together such a fine line-up and for setting a great example for everyone to follow when it comes to bringing to the public only that information which can be solidly proven.&nbsp; If you want to help with the costs associated with these conferences, which are largely being funded by John himself, please send an email to <a href="mailto:johnbursill@gmail.com">johnbursill@gmail.com</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/visibility911/visibility911_hoffman_cit.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/channel-0.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 8px;" height="234" width="368" />This episode of&nbsp;<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.visibility911.com">Visibility 9-11</a> welcomes back to the program long time 9-11 researcher <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://911research.wtc7.net/re911/hoffman.html">Jim Hoffman</a>.&nbsp; Jim is a software engineer who has specialized in developing new algorithms, applications is computational geometry, and scientific visualization.&nbsp;&nbsp; His work has been instrumental in significant new scientific discoveries and has been featured in articles in <em>Nature</em>, <em>Scientific American</em>, <em>Science Digest</em> and <em>Science News</em>.</p>
<p>Jim's work on 9-11 has laid an early foundations for the 9-11 truth movement and his work is often cited by important figures in the 9-11 movement such as Dr. David Ray Griffin, Richard Gage and Dr. Steven Jones.&nbsp; Focusing on what happened at the World Trade Center, Jim was one of the first people to point out facts surrounding the 3 building "collapses" on 9-11 including an extensive analysis of the Twin Towers and Building 7.&nbsp; His excellent website, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.wtc7.net/">wtc7.net</a>, was one of the first websites to seriously ask if explosives were used at the World Trade Center on 9-11.&nbsp; wtc7.net has proved to be a timeless and valuable resource and, to this day, is waking up visitors to the site for the first time.&nbsp; Jim also currently maintains and regularly updates <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.911review.com">911review.com</a> and <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.91research.com">911research.com</a>.</p>
<p>Jim has also co-authored a book called <a href="http://www.wtc7.net/store/index.html">Waking Up from Our Nightmare: The 9/11 Crimes in New York City</a> with fellow 9-11 truth activist <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.wireonfire.com/donpaul/wit.html">Don Paul</a>.&nbsp; These two gentlemen also produced a video together called <a href="http://www.wtc7.net/store/index.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">9/11 Guilt: The Proof is in Your Hands</span></a>. Both of these works focus on the mountain of evidence that all three high rises on 9-11 were brought down with the aid of pre-planted explosives.</p>
<p>Jim's work is ongoing and he continues to publish valuable essays on the destruction of the Twin Towers and Building 7.&nbsp; His latest articles include <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/thermite/thermitics_made_simple.html">Thermitic Pyrotechnics in the WTC Made Simple: Three Points of Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe that Anyone Can Understand</a>, and <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/thermite/explosive_residues.html">Explosives Found in World Trade Center Dust: Scientists Discover Both Residues And Un-ignited Fragments Of Nano-Engineered Thermitic Pyrotechnics In Debris From the Twin Towers</a>.</p>
<p>Jim Hoffman has also had a great impact on the 9-11 truth movement as a whole with his well-reasoned and documented critiques of popularly held myths within the movement itself.&nbsp; Through extensive fact checking and analysis, Jim has been able to identify the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://911review.com/infowars.html">weakest claims in the 9-11 movement</a> and expose them as likely <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation">misinformation</a>. Misinformation takes many forms but is generally information which has not been substantially proven and can be patently ridiculous on its surface, which is spread by well meaning people who don't take the time to do the research.&nbsp; Over the years, a pattern has emerged by personalities who insist on promoting some of the worst information about 9-11 that one can find.&nbsp; "No Planes" were used on 9-11, beams from space brought down the World Trade Center, or holograms and/or "TV fakery" was used instead of real planes at the WTC have all in one way or another been promoted by "<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://911review.com/denial/bigtent.html">Big Tent</a>" advocates like Kevin Barrett, Jim Fetzer, Morgan Reynolds and others.&nbsp; Interestingly enough, these weakest of links in the pool of 9-11 information have been the same "straw man" arguments that <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://http//911review.com/disinfo/press/index.html">have been used time and again by the mainstream media to attack our movement and discredit us</a>.&nbsp; We at Visibility 9-11 think there are valuable clues to be found in these established patterns that would indicate a possible coordinated effort between <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation">disinformation</a> specialists and the media to discredit our legitimate arguments and evidence.</p>
<p>This episode begins with an audio clip from <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://vodpod.com/watch/235733-dr-william-f-pepper-911-revealing-the-truth-reclaiming-our-future">a speech by Dr. William Pepper</a> from June 2006.&nbsp; At the conference in Chicago, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.911truth.org/911rtt/">9/11 Revealing the Truth, Reclaiming our Future</a>, Dr. Pepper clearly warns the 9-11 truth movement about infiltration by specialists in disinformation and even gives an example of how he was duped during his research into the assassination of MLK.&nbsp; I was present during this speech and Dr. Pepper's words had a great impact on me, which inspired the production of my <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.visibility911.com/reports-cointelpro01.php">Visibility 9-11 COINTELPRO Special Report</a> in early 2007, where I interviewed both Jim Hoffman and Dr. Pepper on this topic.&nbsp; Visibility 9-11 also produced a <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://visibility911.com/newsletter/2007-10/index.html">newsletter</a> entirely devoted to this topic, it's history and manifestations in October of that same year.&nbsp; This is must reading if you are to understand how <strong>disinformation</strong> is being used to discredit YOU.</p>
<p>One of the main goals we have at Visibility 9-11 is to educate our listeners and ourselves about all aspects of the September 11th tragedy.&nbsp; To this end, we are taking on a more active role in addressing this important issue.&nbsp; <strong>In fact, we believe the issue of disinformation to be the most important issue that each of us face as 9-11 activists.</strong>&nbsp; <em> </em>As blogger Arabesque has pointed out many times, the &ldquo;Official Story&rdquo; is itself disinformation and must be regarded as such.&nbsp; Ultimately, we are the ones in the street and on the blogs and forums who will have to face the ridicule if our facts are not straight and if we are to be successful, we must learn to identify the disinformation and insert caution into your activism.</p>
<p>As pointed out by my guest on this program, it is agreed that central to the various themes of disinformation are the "no jetliner" claims, especially the "no 757" claims for the attack on the Pentagon.&nbsp; In spite of substantial resources being poured into books and videos which claim that there was no airliner crash at the Pentagon on 9-11, Jim Hoffman has <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://http//911review.com/errors/pentagon/index.html">published extensive work which would bring these claims into question</a>.&nbsp; Careful examination of Jim's work reveals a different picture of the Pentagon attack than the "no jetliner" advocates.&nbsp; We at Visibility 9-11 acknowledge that there are <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://911research.wtc7.net/pentagon/analysis/theories/index.html">many valid reasons</a> for us to believe the "no jetliner" claims.&nbsp; However, a closer look reveals the real possibility that the event at the Pentagon has been manipulated from the start through the use of "official" and un-offical sources.</p>
<p>This program takes a closer look at "Citizen Investigation Team" (CIT) and it's biggest promoter Pilots for 9-11 Truth and their latest effort to advance the "no jetliner" theory. Their new video, <strong><em>National Security Alert</em></strong>, which is being aggressively promoted on the internet and at public events, alleges that not only did the Boeing jet not strike the Pentagon, but flew over it at the last minute in an elaborate deception that <em style="font-weight: bold;">not a single witness has claimed to see</em>, and, contradicts the testimony of hundreds of eyewitnesses in the area.</p>
<p>Extensive research has been done to expose this hoax and is highly recommended reading by Visibility 9-11.<br /><br /><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://911research.wtc7.net/pentagon/analysis/index.html">The Pentagon Strike: Mysteries Persist in Pentagon Attack</a> by Jim Hoffman<br /><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://visibility911.com/blog/?p=1342">To Con a Movement: Exposing CIT's PentaCon 'Magic Show'</a> by Victoria Ashley<br /><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/pentacon/index.html">Google Earth Exposes Pentagon Flyover Farce</a> by Jim Hoffman<br /><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://arabesque911.blogspot.com/2007/11/cit-craig-ranke-aldo-marquis-and.html">CIT, Craig Ranke, Aldo Marquis, and the PentaCon Flyover Theory: Origin, Debate, and the &lsquo;Smoking-Gun&rsquo; Anti-Controversy</a> by Arabesque<br /><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://911research.wtc7.net/talks/pentacon/index.html">Breaking Down CIT's Bill of Goods</a> by Jim Hoffman<br /><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://visibility911.com/blog/?p=1328">CIT Virus</a> by John Michael Talboo and ScootleRoyale<br /><br />Related- <br /><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.visibility911.com/reports-cointelpro01.php">Visibility 9-11 COINTELPRO Special Report</a><br /><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://visibility911.com/newsletter/2007-10/index.html">Visibility 9-11 October 2007 Newsletter</a><br /><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://visibility911.com/?p=1253">Twenty-Five Ways To Suppress Truth: The Rules of Disinformation</a> by H.

Footnote #44 details an instance where a CIA desk officer intentionally withheld vital information from the FBI about two of the 9/11 hijackers who were inside the United States. This footnote further states that the CIA desk officer covered-up the decision to withhold said vital information from the FBI. Finally, footnote #44 states that the CIA desk officer could not recall who told her to carry out such acts."</span><br /><br />Also included in this discussion are the circumstances surrounding the <a href="http://visibility911.com/blog/?p=1112">historic national premier</a> of 9-11 Press for Truth on a major market PBS station.&nbsp; On June 3, 2009 at 7:00pm, 9-11 Press for Truth will be shown on <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.kbdi.org">KBDI, Channel 12</a> in Denver Colorado.&nbsp; This historic broadcast will feature in studio interviews during the broadcast of Kyle Hence, <a href="http://visibility911.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=282162">Bob McIlvaine</a>, and a representative of <a href="http://www.colorado911visibility.org">Colorado 9-11 Visibility</a>.&nbsp; As has been the case for the past couple of years, Colorado 9-11 Visibility will also be manning the phone banks during the broadcast which is also part of their periodic fund drives at KBDI.&nbsp; A great list of 9-11 books and DVD's will be offered as premium gifts to viewers who pledge during this broadcast.&nbsp; Please contact KBDI and let them know how much you appreciate this historic broadcast and if you can, give them a donation which best fits your budget. <br /><br />Music by <a href="undefined/"></a><a href="http://www.myspace.com/thelastditchstand">The Last Ditch Stand</a><br /><br /><br /></p>]]></description>

He has been a 9/11 activist since late 2004, and is a <a href="http://911truth.org/page.php?page=grassroots_contacts">grassroots organizer</a> listed on <a href="http://911truth.org/">911truth.org</a> for the state of Indiana, is a member of the Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/"><span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">AE</span>911Truth.org</a> video team, and <a href="http://911debunkers.blogspot.com/2008/09/tommorrow-comes-today.html">a founding member of the central Indiana chapter</a> of the activist organization We Are Change.<br /><br />Stewart Bradley is an artist, documentary journalist, and political activist living in Lancaster Pennsylvania who runs an independent <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">mulit</span>-media studio.

Mentioned is a declassified CIA memo from April 1967 entitled, <a href="http://www.namebase.org/foia/jfk01.html">Countering Criticism of the Warren Report</a>, which states that one way to achieve this goal is to...<br /><br /><em>"<strong>Employ propaganda assets to answer and refute the attacks of the critics</strong>. Book reviews and feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose. The unclassified attachments to this guidance should provide useful background material for passage to assets. Our play should point out, as applicable, that the critics are (i) wedded to theories adopted before the evidence was in, (ii) politically interested, (iii) financially interested, (iv) hasty and inaccurate in their research, or (v) infatuated with their own theories."</em><br /><br />Direct download: <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/visibility911/visibility911_debunkers.mp3">visibility911_<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_8" class="blsp-spelling-error">debunkers</span>.mp3</a></p>]]></description>

<p class="style1">Although <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Cowboy</span> is Jesse&rsquo;s first official full-fledged release, he received great notoriety for <span style="font-style: italic;">September Eleven Blues</span>, his 2007 EP of 9/11 &ldquo;truth songs&rdquo; which featured the powerful title track and another called <span style="font-style: italic;">Controlled Demolition</span>. Both tracks received air and podcast play and were popular within the 9/11 truth movement as well as on stations like KRCB; they also received prominent mention on sites like <a href="http://www.911blogger.com/">www.911blogger.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">This episode features many of Jesse's greatest hits from the new CD as well as his 9-11 anthems <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">September 11 Blues</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Controlled Demolition</span>.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/whistleburden.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 8px;" height="318" width="312" />This week Visibility 9-11 welcomes former diplomat from the State Department's Foreign Service J. Michael Springmann. Mr. Springmann served postings in Germany, India, Saudi Arabia, and the Bureau of Intelligence and Research in Washington D.C. He is a published author of several articles on national security themes, and is an attorney in private practice in Washington D.C. <br /><br />Michael has attended several 9/11 Conferences over the years, most notably, the 9/11 Omission hearings on 9/9/2004 chaired by former Representative and current Green Party candidate for President, Cynthia McKinney, as well as the recent conference in Keene, NH.<span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><br /></span></span>Included in this important interview is a discussion regarding a new article by Mr. Springmann titled, <a href="http://www.opednews.com/articles/The-Mistake-Department-by-Michael-Springmann-080725-269.html">THE MISTAKE DEPARTMENT: One Example of Why American Foreign Policy is a Disaster</a> that discusses the American Consulate General at Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and it's relationship to 15 of the 19 September 11th hijackers. In it, he says that "the Jeddah Consulate was not a State Department post but an intelligence services operation", "the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) routinely demanded (and got) visas for sleazy characters with no ties to either their home country or Saudi Arabia," and "these vile people were terrorists recruited by U.S. intelligence officers along with Osama bin Laden, then a CIA asset."<br /><br /></p>]]></description>

			<title>Visibility 9-11 Welcomes Producer Jarek Kupsc, The Reflecting Pool</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/visibility911/visibility911_reflectingpool.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.visibility911.com"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><img src="http://visibility911.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/the-reflecting-pool.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 8px;" height="256" width="362" />Visibility 9-11</span></a> Welcomes <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jarek Kuspc</span>, Actor, Director, and Producer of the new film, <a href="http://www.reflectingpoolfilm.com"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Reflecting Pool</span></a>.&nbsp; This is the first film of its kind which openly questions the official version of the events of September 11th in a dramatic story of discovery, sorrow, and the inevitable contempt for the media in America and their role in keeping the 9-11 cover-up intact.&nbsp; <br /><br />From the DVD cover:<br /><br />An investigation of the 9/11 events by a Russian-American journalist and a father of a 9/11 victim implicates the US government in the attacks.<br /><br />ALEX PROKOP (Jarek Kupsc), a successful journalist, receives a rare 9/11 video tape revealing new information about the attack. The footage was sent by PAUL COOPER (Joseph Culp), a driven researcher, whose daughter died on 9/11. Sensing a good story, Prokop travels with Cooper to New York and Washington, DC, where they uncover suppressed information implicating the US Government in the attacks. As Cooper introduces Prokop to key eye-witnesses, the fa&ccedil;ade of the "official story" begins to crumble. Prokop hears accounts of underground explosions in the Twin Towers moments before their collapse and discovers that the firm providing WTC security was run by the President's brother.<br /><br />We follow Alex and Cooper as they investigate the inexplicable collapse of the 47-story WTC Building Seven, disprove the implausible airliner "attack" on the Pentagon, and uncover the illegal destruction of physical evidence from Ground Zero.</p>
<p class="gray">The pressure builds as the FBI intimidates Alex's editor, McGUIRE, (Lisa Black) to reveal key sources &ndash; while the magazine's corporate investors threaten to kill the entire story. Plagued by the ghosts of his Communist childhood and trying to uphold the independence of American journalism, Alex's search for the truth leads to a dangerous and shocking realization!</p>
<p class="gray">THE REFLECTING POOL is an intense, sobering investigation into the most controversial tragedy of our time. Drawn from established sources and based on verifiable facts, THE REFLECTING POOL is a thought-provoking study of a search for truth and the profound consequences of not looking for it any further than the nightly news.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>On this, the 13th anniversary of the tragic events of the <a href="http://www.okcbombing.net"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Oklahoma City Bombing</span></a>, <a href="http://www.visibility911.com"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Visibility 9-11</span></a> welcomes researcher, activist, and documentary film producer <span style="font-weight: bold;">Chris Emery</span>.&nbsp; On April 19, 1995 multiple bombs virtually destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in downtown Oklahoma City killing 169 men, women and children and wounded scores of others.&nbsp; Just as with the events of September 11th, 2001, the official story of what really happened in OKC has been proven to be a falsehood by Chris and his colleagues at the Oklahoma City Bombing Investigation Committee.<br /><br />For more information, visit www.okcbombing.net and listen to the prior interviews on this topic from the <a href="http://www.visibility911.com/archives.php"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Visibility 9-11 archives</span></a>.<br /><br /><a class="item_title" style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://visibility911.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=269264">Visibility 9-11 Welcomes Oklahoma State Rep.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The 2008 Spring Membership Drive at <a href="http://www.krfcfm.org"><span style="font-weight: bold;">KRFC 88.9 FM</span></a> presented a great opportunity for the launch of the first <a href="http://www.weekoftruth.org"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Week of Truth</span></a> campaign, <strong style="font-style: italic;">The National <em>The Shell Game</em> Buy In Week of Truth, April 16th &ndash; 22nd, 2008.&nbsp; </strong><br /><br />As I have pledged, <a href="http://www.visibility911.com"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Visibility 9-11</span></a> will be purchasing 10 copies of <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.theshellgame.net"><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Shell Game</span></a>, </span>by Steve Alten during the Week of Truth.&nbsp; As I considered what I would do with these 10 books, it occurred to me that KRFC was right in the middle of their bi-annual fund raising drive and that it might be possible to get on as co-host of Words of Freedom for a special episode of the show.&nbsp; My plan was to donate the 10 books to the station, offer them as a premium gift to contributors, and have Steve Alten on as a guest to kick off the Week of Truth buy in for <a href="http://www.theshellgame.net"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The Shell Game</span></a>.&nbsp; Long story short, David Peterson at KRFC gladly found me a 30 minute spot during the fund drive.&nbsp; This interview is a result of that collaboration.<br /><br />I urge all my listeners and supporters to go to <a href="http://www.weekoftruth.org">www.weekoftruth.org</a> and get involved in <strong style="font-style: italic;">The National <em>The Shell Game</em> Buy In Week of Truth. </strong>This is a way everyone, for a small expense, can get involved and make a difference.&nbsp; <br /><br />Special thanks to <span style="font-weight: bold;">David Peterson</span>, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.wordsoffreedom.com">George Flynn</a>, and everyone at <a href="http://www.krfcfm.org">KRFC 88.9 FM</a> in Fort Collins Colorado.&nbsp; Please take a moment to let them know how much you appreciate their support of 9-11 Truth.<br /><br /></p>

			<title>Visibility 9-11 Welcomes Author Mike Palecek</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/visibility911/visibility911_palecek.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.visibility911.com">Visibility 9-11</a> welcomes author and activist Mike Palecek.&nbsp; Mike's new book, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Iowa Terror</span> is a great satirical read and comes highly recommended by Michael and Visibility 9-11.&nbsp; From <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.mikepalecek.com">Mike's website</a>:<br /><br /></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mike Palecek was a peace prisoner, having served time in county jails and federal prisons for civil disobedience at Offutt Air Force Base during the 1980s.</span></div>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;">During the 1990s he was a reporter for small-town newspapers in Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota. The small newspaper Ruth and Mike owned in southeast Minnesota was named the Newspaper of the Year for 1994 by the Minnesota Newspaper Association.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px;">In 2000 he was the Iowa Democratic Party nominee for the U.S. House of Representatives, Fifth District, receiving 67,500 votes (29%). Mr. Palecek Lives in Sheldon, Iowa with wife, Ruth, and two children. Works at group home for disabled adults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Iowa Terror</span> is a gripping and disturbing tale of small town America in the post September 11th world. Palecek skillfully weaves elements of the official lie of 9-11 into a dark story of murder, mystery, propaganda, and the American 'homeland.' <em><strong>Iowa Terror</strong></em> is both entertaining and thought provoking; a must read.  You won&rsquo;t be able to put it down!"</p>

For a minority elite that clings to power by the manipulation of the masses using an omnipresent cocktail of lies, deception, mass-produced ignorance and ingrained propaganda, the destruction of truth is an essential method of control. It is a formula that has worked to unmitigated success for the elite throughout history, whether the shadows of power stretch from ancient pyramids, marble temples, castles, mansions or halls of governance. Those holding the levers of power and control understand, better than most, that the dissemination of truths to a blind majority could spell the end of their reign, for truth brings sight to the blind.<br /><br /><a href="http://valenzuelasveritas.blogspot.com/2007/04/unearthing-awakening-has-arrived.html"><span style="font-style: italic;">Read more...</span></a><br /><br /></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week <a href="http://www.visibility911.com">Visibility 9-11</a> welcomes retired Air Force <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.patriotsquestion911.com/#Razer">Lt. Colonel Guy Razer</a>.&nbsp; Col. Razer has publicly stated:<br /><br />"After 4+ years of research since retirement in 2002, I am 100% convinced that the attacks of September 11, 2001 were planned, organized, and committed by treasonous perpetrators that have infiltrated the highest levels of our government.&nbsp; It is now time to take our country back. <span style="font-size: 5pt;"><br /> <br /> </span> The <a href="http://www.knowordie.co.uk/WTC7.avi">"collapse" of WTC Building 7</a> [570 feet tall, 47 stories, and not hit by an airplane] shows beyond any doubt that the demolitions were pre-planned.&nbsp; There is simply no way to demolish a 47-story building (on fire) over a coffee break.&nbsp; It is also impossible to report the building&rsquo;s collapse before it happened, <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/february2007/280207timestamp.htm">as BBC  News did</a>, unless it was pre-planned.&nbsp; Further damning evidence is <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/january2006/050106silversteinanswers.htm">Larry Silverstein's video taped confession</a> in which he states "they made that decision to pull [WTC 7] and         we watched the building collapse." <span style="font-size: 5pt;"><br /> <br /> </span> We cannot let the pursuit of justice fail.&nbsp; Those of us in the military took an oath to "support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic".&nbsp; Just because we have retired does not make that oath invalid, so it is not just our responsibility, it is our duty to expose the real perpetrators of 9/11 and bring them to justice, no matter how hard it is, how long it takes, or how much we have to suffer to do it. <span style="font-size: 5pt;"><br /> <br /> </span> We owe it to those who have gone before us who executed that same oath, and who are doing the same thing in Iraq and Afghanistan right now.&nbsp; Those of us who joined the military and faithfully executed orders that were given us had to trust our leaders.&nbsp; The violation and abuse of that trust is not only heinous, but ultimately the most accurate definition of treason!"<br /><br />Today, after years of researching 9-11, Col. Razer speaks out publicly for the first time about his doubts in the official story of what happened on September 11th, 2001.&nbsp; You can reach Col. Razer through his MySpace page&nbsp; <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.myspace.com/supereagle69">here</a>.&nbsp; <br /><br />Intermission music by John <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://johnmckay.net/">McKay</a>.<br /><br /><br /></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<div><strong>The 9-11 Dust (Part III)</strong> - In this the 3rd&nbsp;of our&nbsp;series on  the 9-11 Dust, <a href="http://www.visibility911.com/" target="_blank">Visibility 9-11</a> welcomes to the program <span style="font-weight: bold;">John Feal</span>, president of the <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.fealgoodfoundation.com/">Feal Good Foundation</a><span style="font-style: italic;">.&nbsp; </span>One week after September 11th, Christie  Todd Whitman stated that, "<em>Given the scope of the tragedy from last week, I  am glad to reassure the people of New York and Washington D.C., that their air  is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink</em>.", even as the EPA had  information to the contrary. In fact, the 9-11 dust was extremely caustic and in  August of 2003, the EPA issued a <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oigearth/reports/2003/WTC_report_20030821.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">report</span></a> showing the changes the  Bush administration made to the initial cautionary statements which were  originally meant to warn the public of the dangers in the dust. These warnings  were changed to reassurances and the public never heard the truth. These lies  have resulted in thousands of people getting sick from breathing the toxic dust,  and now, over 5 years later, they are dying. If you think our own government  isn't capable of deliberately killing its' own citizens, think again.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Soon after  9/11, our guest John Feal (a US Army veteran) started experiencing serious  respiratory problems, a condition they now call "The World Trade Center Cough."  He spent two months in the hospital while he battled with a host of health  problems. Because of an arbitrary exclusion in the law, Feal, like many search  and rescue workers who were injured during a two-week window at Ground Zero did  not qualify for the 9/11 relief fund. Like thousands of others, John risked his  own life to save others, but when he became sick and injured, he was abandoned  and forgotten.</span> </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Since 2003, John has acted as a leading advocate for 9/11  heroes who where denied both the benefits promised by the federal, state, local  governmental and the charitable aid collected on their behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp; John is also a  former board member of <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.unsunghhh.com/">Unsung Heroes Helping  Heroes</a>, a not-for-profit raising awareness of the plight of 9/11 responders.  In addition to assisting 9/11 workers as a whole, John has been active helping  Ground Zero workers on an individual basis with administrative issues and by  helping first responders get media coverage.<br /><br />Click<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.911blogger.com/node/4895">here</a> to donate to the fund set up by Jon Gold mentioned in the interview.</span></span></span></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In the first of a 3 or 4 part series on the 9-11 Dust, <strong><a href="http://www.visibility911.com" target="_blank">Visibility 9-11</a></strong> welcomes to the program <strong>Jenna Orkin</strong> of the <strong><a href="http://wtceo.org/" target="_blank">World Trade Center Environmental Organization</a></strong>.  One week after September 11th, Christie Todd Whitman stated that, "<strong><em>Given the scope of the tragedy from last week, I am glad to reassure the people of New York and Washington D.C., that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink</em></strong>.", even as the EPA had information to the contrary. In fact, the 9-11 dust was extremely caustic and in August of 2003, the EPA issued a <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oigearth/reports/2003/WTC_report_20030821.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">report</span></span></a> showing the changes the Bush administration made to the intial cautionary statements which were originally meant to warn the public of the dangers in the dust. These warnings were changed to reasurances and the public never heard the truth. These lies have resulted in thousands of people getting sick from breathing the toxic dust, and now, over 5 years later, they are dying. If you think our own government isn't capable of deliberately killing its' own citizens, think again.</p>
<p><br />Here is yet another shameful example of the dastardly deeds committed by the criminals in charge of the U.S. government and yet one more reason to doubt the official story about what happened on September 11th, 2001.</p>

			<title>Visibility 9-11 Debut Episode</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/visibility911/podcast_1-8-06.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This podcast explores the many facets of the 9-11 attacks which contradict the governments official story, the massive cover-up which is currently underway, the failure of the mainstream media in America to ask real questions, and the aftermath of 9-11 including the un-Constitutional wars and the taking of liberty here at home.  This broadcast examines the big picture of what is taking place in America today and how September 11th fits into the scheme of things.  Forget &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;!  The governments own story about what happened is itself a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;!  Learn for yourself why people are talking about what is becoming known as the &quot;alternative conspiracy theory&quot;.  ]]></description>
