		<itunes:summary>Hi, and welcome to the Wolf Creek Academy Podcast.  My name is Dr. Patricia Jones, founder and co-director of Wolf Creek Academy, a college preparatory and emotional growth school for young men and women, ages 13 to 17.  



Our school is located in the beautiful mountains of Western North Carolina and is a private, non-profit organization that offers education programs for students with a history of behavior difficulties, poor academic performance, strained family relationships, and other related problems. 



Our goal at Wolf Creek Academy is to help create individual education plans for students, with the ultimate goal of reunification with families or graduation with a high school diploma.



With certified faculty members on staff, Wolf Creek Academy offers students the same opportunities afforded to other students enrolled in their local public or private schools.  We enroll students from all across the United States and even internationally as well.



Wolf Creek Academy offers 24-hour supervision of students, which includes full-time house parents, teachers, and program directors -- all of which have years of experience working with troubled teens and those with a history of poor academic performance.



We are a small school with excellent student-teacher ratios and all of our instructors work in small classrooms and provide ongoing tutoring and academic support for our students.



We created this Podcast as a resource for teachers, students, and prospective families to learn more about our school and facility.  We will provide updates, including interviews with parents, school announcements and success stories from past students and graduates.
