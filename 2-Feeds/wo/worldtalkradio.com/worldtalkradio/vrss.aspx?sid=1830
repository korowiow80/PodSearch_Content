			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Mar 28 00:00:00 PDT 2012 Show - If you have a child with autism, then you've probably gone through times where you've felt completely overwhelmed and powerless to help.  It happens to the best of us.  We read, we research, and we ask questions.  We try our very best to do everything we can to help our children succeed.  But our kids often seem unbalanced and disconnected with the world around them.  We may feel like we've tried everything, but what do we do when it's just not enough?  We go to the experts.  In this week's episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Robert Melillo, author of Disconnected Kids, Reconnected Kids, and cofounder of Brain Balance Centers.  Dr. Melillo will offer his advice on how to help our kids reconnect with the world around them and, more importantly, how to empower our families to come together instead of falling apart.  Don't miss this important episode of The Mother Cub Show on Wednesday, December 21st, at 8am Pacific/ 10am Central.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Mar 21 00:00:00 PDT 2012 Show - In the current economy, it's getting harder and harder for many parents to afford the expensive biomedical treatments that can be crucial for the health of a child with autism. Skyrocketing insurance premiums, higher deductible amounts, higher cost of living and lower annual pay raises can all add up to fewer resources available for a family to fund an autism recovery plan.  On this week's episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview a doctor who specializes in treating children with autism, even if the families cannot afford it.  Her name is Dr. Janet Lintala, founder of The Autism Recovery Resource Center in Beckley, West Virginia, and she'll be here this Wednesday to share her story and her inspiration with all of us.  Tune in Wednesday at 8am Pacific for an incredible interview that will hopefully leave you ready to pay it forward too!  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Mar 14 00:00:00 PDT 2012 Show - On this week's episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry interviews biomedical expert, Dr. Kurt Woeller, about the mysteries surrounding the gut-brain connection and autism.  Some doctors feel strongly that the brain should be healed first and the gut will follow.  They may want to approach the child with treatments ranging from hyperbaric oxygen to heavy metal chelation or behavioral intervention.  Others believe it should be the gut first with dietary changes, nutritional supplements, and anti-fungal medications at the top of the treatment list.  If you're confused about the best way to begin helping your child to heal, tune in to The Mother Cub Show on Wednesday, November 16, to learn why it's critical that you treat both the gut and the brain.  Dr. Woeller will answer questions to clear up some of the confusion and perhaps you will learn the keys to unlocking your child's future.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Mar 7 00:00:00 PST 2012 Show - The human brain is made up of two hemispheres; the left and the right.  Each hemisphere is responsible for the opposite side of the body, receiving sensory and motor input from many different sources and processing accordingly.  Integration between the two sides of the brain is crucial in order for the body to function correctly, but with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, that important link is often missing or very weak.  This can affect all higher-level brain processes, including language, reading, writing, social interaction, motor skills and more.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Larry Polnicky, owner of the Brain Balance Center in Tampa, Florida.  They will discuss the exciting possibilities for children with autism to rehabilitate and form new neural connections through the use of a specific therapy that not only balances the brain, but the overall health and wellbeing of the child.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Feb 15 00:00:00 PST 2012 Show - Dr. Andrew Wakefield, author of "Callous Disregard", will join host Susan Lynn Perry on The Mother Cub Show, All About Autism.  This world-renowned and controversial physician, speaker, autism researcher, and academic gastroenterologist will speak about the events leading up to his discovery of a possible causal link between vaccines, intestinal inflammation, and childhood neurological damage, along with the resulting loss of his medical license, and continued pursuit of his revolutionary research.  Although often misrepresented in this complicated debate and resulting biased media frenzy, what has become crystal clear is that unlike his opponents, Wakefield has always kept the most important thing at the forefront of his research; that is, the safety and overall health of our children.  Love him or hate him, this is one show you don't want to miss....]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Feb 8 00:00:00 PST 2012 Show - There is no mistaking the food sensitivities many of our kids on the spectrum have, and why going on the Gluten-Free, Casein-Free diet can have tremendous benefits for them.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview two experts who can help shed light on why "going GFCF" may be the best thing you can do for your family.  The first half of the show will feature Dr. Kurt Woeller, who will explain why so many kids with autism have an allergy or sensitivity to gluten and casein.  The second half of the show will highlight Dr. Lisa Lewis, who has recently published a revised and expanded edition of her wildly popular cookbook, called Special Diets for Special Kids.  Join us for this educational discussion about how and why the gluten-free, casein-free diet may be the best "first-line defense" in our fight for our children with autism.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Feb 1 00:00:00 PST 2012 Show - There's no denying the connection between imbalances in the gut and brain causing a host of problems for our kids with autism.  With over 70% of the immune system located in the gut, it just makes sense that when the gut is inflamed or unbalanced, the brain will be affected too.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Michael Goldberg about his research and how the autism epidemic cannot be due to a developmental or genetic disorder, but rather a disease process of the immune system.  The good news is...a disease process can be treated.  He believes that most children with autism are fighting a complex immune/ complex viral disorder and that once treated, the kids stand a good chance of recovering.  The second half of the show will feature two additional guests who are strong autism advocates; one with a theme park designed specifically for our special kids and the other with a game that will help your child get involved with family mealtimes.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Jan 25 00:00:00 PST 2012 Show - The cause of autism has been hotly debated for years with fingers pointing at everything from pesticides and vaccinations, to genetics and the biological age of the parents involved.  It seems that every theory that comes along, however, brings with it a host of opposition poking holes through its validity.  In this breakthrough episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Michael Stelzer on the causes of autism, the keys to effective treatment, and the role that epigenetics may play in the very near future, both in terms of diagnostic and clinical applications.  The power-packed episode will continue with a rousing interview with Jennifer McIlwee Myers, author of How to Teach Life Skills to Kids with Autism or Asperger's.  This groundbreaking book is bursting at the seams with practical and humorous advice on the realities of training your child to function in the real world - beyond the formative years and well into adulthood.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Jan 18 00:00:00 PST 2012 Show - When a parent decides to change the diet of their child with autism, it can be a very challenging and daunting intervention. But, it can also be one of the most effective ways to help them. It's challenging because many of our kids already have extremely limited diets. In addition, they may have texture or other sensory issues that can make introducing new foods even more complicated. Dietary intervention can be very effective, though, because if done correctly, it can help reduce inflammation, allergies, and bowel issues, while helping the child's digestive system to be able to absorb nutrients more efficiently from their food. On this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Ms. Donna Gates, the founder and creator of The Body Ecology Diet. This diet was created initially to eradicate yeast and other fungal infections from an adult's body, but has had the unexpected benefit of helping many children with autism become healthier as well.]]></description>

That is, after all, one of the diagnostic criteria used to diagnose the condition of autism - delayed or inappropriate social interaction.  In this important episode of The Mother Cub Show, Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Jed Baker, award-winning author of the Social Skills Picture Book series for his guidance and advice on this valuable subject.  As a bonus, Dr. Baker will also discuss his book, No More Meltdowns, an informative guide brimming with positive strategies for managing and preventing out-of-control behavior.

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Jan 4 00:00:00 PST 2012 Show - Autism is such a complex disorder, often affecting several different systems within the child's body.  When dealing with something that complex and often convoluted, one must look at solutions from many different angles, both internal and external.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview return guest and biomedical expert, Dr. Kurt Woeller, to discuss one of the newer therapies showing promise for our children with autism, especially in the areas of language and socialization.  The second half of the show will focus on external stimuli and sensory processing disorders with our featured guest Dr. Lucy Jane Miller. Her award-winning book, Sensational Kids, is our autism book pick of the week, and is a wonderful introduction to how a child's external environment can have a huge impact on their internal processing.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Dec 21 00:00:00 PST 2011 Show - If you have a child with autism, then you've probably gone through times where you've felt completely overwhelmed and powerless to help.  It happens to the best of us.  We read, we research, and we ask questions.  We try our very best to do everything we can to help our children succeed.  But our kids often seem unbalanced and disconnected with the world around them.  We may feel like we've tried everything, but what do we do when it's just not enough?  We go to the experts.  In this week's episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Robert Melillo, author of Disconnected Kids, Reconnected Kids, and cofounder of Brain Balance Centers.  Dr. Melillo will offer his advice on how to help our kids reconnect with the world around them and, more importantly, how to empower our families to come together instead of falling apart.  Don't miss this important episode of The Mother Cub Show on Wednesday, December 21st, at 8am Pacific/ 10am Central.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Dec 7 00:00:00 PST 2011 Show - In the current economy, it's getting harder and harder for many parents to afford the expensive biomedical treatments that can be crucial for the health of a child with autism. Skyrocketing insurance premiums, higher deductible amounts, higher cost of living and lower annual pay raises can all add up to fewer resources available for a family to fund an autism recovery plan.  On this week's episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview a doctor who specializes in treating children with autism, even if the families cannot afford it.  Her name is Dr. Janet Lintala, founder of The Autism Recovery Resource Center in Beckley, West Virginia, and she'll be here this Wednesday to share her story and her inspiration with all of us.  Tune in Wednesday at 8am Pacific for an incredible interview that will hopefully leave you ready to pay it forward too!  ]]></description>

Some doctors feel strongly that the brain should be healed first and the gut will follow.  They may want to approach the child with treatments ranging from hyperbaric oxygen to heavy metal chelation or behavioral intervention.  Others believe it should be the gut first with dietary changes, nutritional supplements, and anti-fungal medications at the top of the treatment list.  If you're confused about the best way to begin helping your child to heal, tune in to The Mother Cub Show on Wednesday, November 16, to learn why it's critical that you treat both the gut and the brain.  Dr. Woeller will answer questions to clear up some of the confusion and perhaps you will learn the keys to unlocking your child's future.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Oct 26 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - The human brain is made up of two hemispheres; the left and the right.  Each hemisphere is responsible for the opposite side of the body, receiving sensory and motor input from many different sources and processing accordingly.  Integration between the two sides of the brain is crucial in order for the body to function correctly, but with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, that important link is often missing or very weak.  This can affect all higher-level brain processes, including language, reading, writing, social interaction, motor skills and more.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Larry Polnicky, owner of the Brain Balance Center in Tampa, Florida.  They will discuss the exciting possibilities for children with autism to rehabilitate and form new neural connections through the use of a specific therapy that not only balances the brain, but the overall health and wellbeing of the child.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Oct 19 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - Is autism independence possible?  Many parents wonder what the future holds for their child with autism.  Will my son ever drive a car, or live on his own, or be able to hold down a job?  It used to be that parent's expectations were set very low for these possibilities with the future looking bleak at best.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry turns this notion upside down as she interviews autism expert, Brian R. King, about the most important areas you can focus on now in order to help your child grow into having an independent future.  The second half of the show will feature Ann Millan, author of Autism: Believe In The Future.  Ann is the mother of three children.  The third has autism....and is now happily living her life as an independent adult.  Tune in Wednesday, August 17th, at 8am PST/10am CST for this informative and educational episode of The Mother Cub Show.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Oct 5 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - When parents receive the autism diagnosis, many wonder if there is any hope for their child to ever have a chance at leading a healthy, happy and independent life.  The parents often become bogged down with diets, supplements, therapies, doctor visits and more as they search for answers to a condition that has no clear-cut answers.  Once thought of as a purely psychological disorder, more and more experts are agreeing that most cases of autism are more likely a complex condition of biological, environmental, and genetic factors that manifest in behavioral and physical symptoms, unique to each child.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Kurt Woeller about the biomedical side of autism and the rays of hope that are shining through in the latest treatments for these children.  The show will conclude with an informative and educational chat with autism nutrition specialist, Julie Matthews - author of Nourishing Hope for Autism.  ]]></description>

But do you really understand what they are?  Biofilms have been researched and studied for quite some time and yet it seems like there's still very little understood about them.  Many doctors are beginning to believe that biofilms may be playing a large role in children with autism who show persistent and unresolved pathogenic infections.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Kurt Woeller for a full hour on Biofilms: what they are, how to treat for them and the potential for recovery.  Don't miss this one-of-a-kind episode of The Mother Cub Show on Wednesday, June 29th, at 8am Pacific/ 10am Central on WorldTalk Radio and syndicated the following day on VoiceAmerica and iTunes.  This may end up being the missing piece of the autism puzzle for your child and many more children currently suffering from the symptoms of autism.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Sep 7 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - There is no mistaking the food sensitivities many of our kids on the spectrum have, and why going on the Gluten-Free, Casein-Free diet can have tremendous benefits for them.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview two experts who can help shed light on why "going GFCF" may be the best thing you can do for your family.  The first half of the show will feature Dr. Kurt Woeller, who will explain why so many kids with autism have an allergy or sensitivity to gluten and casein.  The second half of the show will highlight Dr. Lisa Lewis, who has recently published a revised and expanded edition of her wildly popular cookbook, called Special Diets for Special Kids.  Join us for this educational discussion about how and why the gluten-free, casein-free diet may be the best "first-line defense" in our fight for our children with autism.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Aug 31 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - As many of our kids head back to school, it's more important than ever to help them connect with their environment and those around them.  This time of year can bring new demands in the form of new teachers, new students, new routines and even new schools for some; and that can create an environment filled with anxiety and sensory overload for our special kids.  In this week's episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will talk to Anna Johnson of Project Injini, who has just launched a brand new application for the Apple iPad, called Injini.  This special app is a suite of child development games that has shown tremendous potential for children with autism and cognitive delays to connect with other children and their teachers/therapists while also building strong early literacy and numeracy skills.  Join us for an informative discussion about this innovative new product and how it might help your kids to connect the dots too.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Aug 24 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - The well-known "be all you can be" slogan has been around for decades, thanks to the U.S. Army.  I've decided to take it a step further and suggest that parenting a child with autism is more about "becoming all that you can be", for both you and your child.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview David Riklan, founder of SelfGrowth.com - the #1 Self-Help Website on the Internet.  We will talk about his business, his books, his websites, and how helping yourself can - in the long run - help your child on the spectrum too.  The second half of the show will feature Pam Dennen, a veteran teacher, who has committed herself to helping parents by providing video modeling and other resources to help their children reach their full potential.  She is the founder of Spectrum Keys, a website where members can access images, short video-modeling clips and social stories that address many of our children's social and academic needs.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Aug 17 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - Is autism independence possible?  Many parents wonder what the future holds for their child with autism.  Will my son ever drive a car, or live on his own, or be able to hold down a job?  It used to be that parent's expectations were set very low for these possibilities with the future looking bleak at best.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry turns this notion upside down as she interviews autism expert, Brian R. King, about the most important areas you can focus on now in order to help your child grow into having an independent future.  The second half of the show will feature Ann Millan, author of Autism: Believe In The Future.  Ann is the mother of three children.  The third has autism....and is now happily living her life as an independent adult.  Tune in Wednesday, August 17th, at 8am PST/10am CST for this informative and educational episode of The Mother Cub Show.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Aug 10 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - Integrated Listening Systems (ILs) is a therapy originally developed for children and adults with attention issues, but was quickly found to provide substantial benefits for children with autism as well. In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Ron Minson, one of the driving forces behind the creation of ILS. Dr. Minson will discuss how this unique multi-sensory program was the first of its kind, building upon the groundbreaking research of listening therapy pioneer - Dr. Alfred Tomatis. By combining movement, listening and visual stimulation all within one therapy, the ILS program helps to integrate all sensory systems within the body. In the second half of the show, a very special lady, named Rebecca Goniwich, will discuss how this particular therapy provided dramatic results for her entire family. Tune in Wednesday, May 11th, at 8am Pacific on WorldTalk Radio to hear more about this amazing music and movement program.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Aug 3 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - Optimal functioning, whether at school, work or in the home depends on healthy behavioral and emotional function.  When the brain is not operating at an optimal level, as in the case of autism, the neurons are often rigid and inflexible.  This does not allow the ability for neurons to communicate with one another quickly and efficiently.  A healthy balance in this area optimized through Neurofeedback therapy can often alleviate many symptoms of autism, improve overall performance, and in some cases reduce or eliminate the need for medications.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry interviews Dr. Melinda Down about the many benefits that Neurofeedback therapy can offer a child with autism. The episode will continue with the autism book pick of the week.  This week will feature Michele Griffin, author of Picky, Picky Pete, the creative children's story of a boy with sensory issues and how he and his mother are able to cope with his daily challenges.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Jul 27 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - When a child has autism, there are often areas of the brain with  faulty connections which can cause the neurons to mis-fire or mis-process incoming information.  The child may get easily overwhelmed or be sensitive to some kinds of food; He might not be able to catch a ball or feel when his body needs to go to the bathroom.  These are all signs of impaired connections in the brain, but also things that can show great improvement with the right therapy.  This week on The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will talk to Dr. Kurt Woeller about how resilient the autism brain can be due to neuroplasticity, which is the ability of the brain to reorganize and form new connections for completing a particular task.  The second half of the show will feature author, Lynette Louise, who wrote about the possibilities of neurofeedback, neuroplasticity, and autism recovery in her book, Miracles Are Made: A Real-Life Guide to Autism.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Jul 20 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - When parents receive the autism diagnosis, many wonder if there is any hope for their child to ever have a chance at leading a healthy, happy and independent life.  The parents often become bogged down with diets, supplements, therapies, doctor visits and more as they search for answers to a condition that has no clear-cut answers.  Once thought of as a purely psychological disorder, more and more experts are agreeing that most cases of autism are more likely a complex condition of biological, environmental, and genetic factors that manifest in behavioral and physical symptoms, unique to each child.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Kurt Woeller about the biomedical side of autism and the rays of hope that are shining through in the latest treatments for these children.  The show will conclude with an informative and educational chat with autism nutrition specialist, Julie Matthews - author of Nourishing Hope for Autism.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Jun 29 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - You may have heard about these strange, almost science-fiction-sounding things called biofilms.  But do you really understand what they are?  Biofilms have been researched and studied for quite some time and yet it seems like there's still very little understood about them.  Many doctors are beginning to believe that biofilms may be playing a large role in children with autism who show persistent and unresolved pathogenic infections.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Kurt Woeller for a full hour on Biofilms: what they are, how to treat for them and the potential for recovery.  Don't miss this one-of-a-kind episode of The Mother Cub Show on Wednesday, June 29th, at 8am Pacific/ 10am Central on WorldTalk Radio and syndicated the following day on VoiceAmerica and iTunes.  This may end up being the missing piece of the autism puzzle for your child and many more children currently suffering from the symptoms of autism.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed May 25 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - When it comes to autism, there are many professionals trying to make a difference in the lives of the affected children and their families.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will speak with two such professionals who offer hope and help, but in very different ways.  The first half of the show will be devoted to biomedical expert, Dr. Kurt Woeller, who will continue his discussion from last month about heavy metal toxicity, chelation and the various testing methods available.  The second half of the show will be devoted to Brandon Hall, the Chief Marketing Officer of a unique label of wine called OneHope.  Brandon is one of the eight dedicated founders who share a common ideal of creating autism awareness by helping families affected by autism.  OneHope Wine donates 50% of their profits to various charities close to their hearts.  That's not just a brand; it's a symbol of hope for the future.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed May 18 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - Many parents want to know if there's anything they can do to help prevent autism in their infants or even in their unborn child.  There are definitely steps that can be taken to increase the odds of a healthy child, and in this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Donna Gates to answer this and many other questions.  Donna Gates is the founder and creator of The Body Ecology Diet, and will be discussing the link between yeast and autism, whether autism is preventable, how to have a healthy pregnancy, and the three most important things you can do for your child right now, whether your child has autism or not.  The second half of the show will feature Marla Roth Fisch, author of the award-winning children's book, Sensitive Sam, and Vice President of the board of directors for The Sensory Processing Disorder Foundation.  She will discuss her book, her foundation, and an upcoming sensory conference in Austin, Texas.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed May 11 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - Integrated Listening Systems (ILs) is a therapy originally developed for children and adults with attention issues, but was quickly found to provide substantial benefits for children with autism as well.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Ron Minson, one of the driving forces behind the creation of ILS.  Dr. Minson will discuss how this unique multi-sensory program was the first of its kind, building upon the groundbreaking research of listening therapy pioneer - Dr. Alfred Tomatis.   By combining movement, listening and visual stimulation all within one therapy, the ILS program helps to integrate all sensory systems within the body.  In the second half of the show, a very special lady, named Rebecca Goniwich, will discuss how this particular therapy provided dramatic results for her entire family.  Tune in Wednesday, May 11th, at 8am Pacific on WorldTalk Radio to hear more about this amazing music and movement program.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Apr 27 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - As a parent or teacher of a child with autism, you are probably always looking for answers to various questions regarding your child's care.  What caused my child's condition?  What is the best approach to take?  Which issue should I focus on first?  Where do I find the resources I need?  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will provide you with some much-needed answers to these daunting questions.  The first half of the show will be an interview with our biomedical expert, Dr. Kurt Woeller, who will help us tackle some of the most pressing questions for our kids, including the role of heavy metal toxicity and chelation.  In the second half, we will talk with the founders of TheAutSpot.com, an online autism community whose mission is to connect families with local resources all over the country, as well as raising funds to help some families pay for the expensive interventions often necessary for children on the autism spectrum.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Apr 20 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - There's no denying the connection between imbalances in the gut and brain causing a host of problems for our kids with autism.  With over 70% of the immune system located in the gut, it just makes sense that when the gut is inflamed or unbalanced, the brain will be affected too.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Michael Goldberg about his research and how the autism epidemic cannot be due to a developmental or genetic disorder, but rather a disease process of the immune system.  The good news is...a disease process can be treated.  He believes that most children with autism are fighting a complex immune/ complex viral disorder and that once treated, the kids stand a good chance of recovering.  The second half of the show will feature two additional guests who are strong autism advocates; one with a theme park designed specifically for our special kids and the other with a game that will help your child get involved with family mealtimes.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Apr 13 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - Many children with autism are in sensory overload most of the time.   Their systems are so overwhelmed that they seem to over-react or under-respond to everything coming their way.  As a parent or teacher, you want to help, but you just don't know what to do.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview the coauthors of Sensory Parenting: From Newborns to Toddlers to talk about how we can make parenting easier and more fun, simply by taking our child's senses into consideration.  The second half of the show will feature Jean Genet, a man who recovered from autism many years ago and has since devoted his life to helping children across the world with his innovative technology called Byonetics.    ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Apr 6 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - The well-known "be all you can be" slogan has been around for decades, thanks to the U.S. Army.  I've decided to take it a step further and suggest that parenting a child with autism is more about "becoming all that you can be", for both you and your child.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview David Riklan, founder of SelfGrowth.com - the #1 Self-Help Website on the Internet.  We will talk about his business, his books, his websites, and how helping yourself can - in the long run - help your child on the spectrum too.  The second half of the show will feature Pam Dennen, a veteran teacher, who has committed herself to helping parents by providing video modeling and other resources to help their children reach their full potential.  She is the founder of Spectrum Keys, a website where members can access images, short video-modeling clips and social stories that address many of our children's social and academic needs.  ]]></description>

This world-renowned and controversial physician, speaker, autism researcher, and academic gastroenterologist will speak about the events leading up to his discovery of a possible causal link between vaccines, intestinal inflammation, and childhood neurological damage, along with the resulting loss of his medical license, and continued pursuit of his revolutionary research.  Although often misrepresented in this complicated debate and resulting biased media frenzy, what has become crystal clear is that unlike his opponents, Wakefield has always kept the most important thing at the forefront of his research; that is, the safety and overall health of our children.  Love him or hate him, this is one show you don't want to miss....]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Feb 16 00:00:00 PST 2011 Show - Many children with autism tend to have sensory processing issues where information coming into the brain from one of the five senses may slow down and have difficulty getting processed.  You see this when a child covers his ears or refuses eye contact or shies away from being touched.  The child may not be able to filter out the overwhelming array of stimulus from seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling and touching all at once.  One of the many therapies that can help with this issue is called Auditory Integration Therapy (or AIT).  In this fascinating episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Sarah Gewanter, a licensed AIT therapist, about how this particular treatment is helping many children with autism.  Rounding out the second half of the show will be Dr. Jed Baker talking about his groundbreaking book, The Social Skills Picture Book.  This innovative resource shows children on the spectrum over 30 different ways to interact appropriately with their peers.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Jan 26 00:00:00 PST 2011 Show - When parents receive the autism diagnosis, many wonder if there is any hope for their child to ever have a chance at leading a healthy, happy and independent life.  The parents often become bogged down with diets, supplements, therapies, doctor visits and more as they search for answers to a condition that has no clear-cut answers.  Once thought of as a purely psychological disorder, more and more experts are agreeing that most cases of autism are more likely a complex condition of biological, environmental, and genetic factors that manifest in behavioral and physical symptoms, unique to each child.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Kurt Woeller about the biomedical side of autism and the rays of hope that are shining through in the latest treatments for these children.  The show will conclude with an informative and educational chat with autism nutrition specialist, Julie Matthews - author of Nourishing Hope for Autism.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Jan 19 00:00:00 PST 2011 Show - The digestive system can certainly be a confusing and intimidating place if it's not working properly - especially in our children with autism.  We see this when our kids have a limited diet, when they are bloated and pale, having random skin rashes and even more random bowel movements.  One of the solutions to some of these problems may come in the form of digestive enzymes.  Certain enzymes have been shown to support digestion by helping the body to more adequately break down foods, thereby allowing the body to absorb more of the nutrients.  In this week's episode of The Mother Cub Show, All About Autism, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Houston of Houston Nutraceuticals, Inc. about the importance of using digestive enzymes for our children on the autism spectrum.

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Jan 12 00:00:00 PST 2011 Show - Dr. Andrew Wakefield, author of "Callous Disregard", will join host Susan Lynn Perry on The Mother Cub Show, All About Autism.  This world-renowned and controversial physician, speaker, autism researcher, and academic gastroenterologist will speak about the events leading up to his discovery of a possible causal link between vaccines, intestinal inflammation, and childhood neurological damage, along with the resulting loss of his medical license, and continued pursuit of his revolutionary research.  Although often misrepresented in this complicated debate and resulting biased media frenzy, what has become crystal clear is that unlike his opponents, Wakefield has always kept the most important thing at the forefront of his research; that is, the safety and overall health of our children.  Love him or hate him, this is one show you don't want to miss....]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Jan 5 00:00:00 PST 2011 Show - Optimal functioning, whether at school, work or in the home depends on healthy behavioral and emotional function.  When the brain is not operating at an optimal level, as in the case of autism, the neurons are often rigid and inflexible.  This does not allow the ability for neurons to communicate with one another quickly and efficiently.  A healthy balance in this area optimized through Neurofeedback therapy can often alleviate many symptoms of autism, improve overall performance, and in some cases reduce or eliminate the need for medications.  In this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry interviews Dr. Melinda Down about the many benefits that Neurofeedback therapy can offer a child with autism. The episode will continue with the autism book pick of the week.  This week will feature Michele Griffin, author of Picky, Picky Pete, the creative children's story of a boy with sensory issues and how he and his mother are able to cope with his daily challenges.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Wed Dec 22 00:00:00 PST 2010 Show - When a parent decides to change the diet of their child with autism, it can be a very challenging and daunting intervention.  But, it can also be one of the most effective ways to help them.  It's challenging because many of our kids already have extremely limited diets.  In addition, they may have texture or other sensory issues that can make introducing new foods even more complicated.  Dietary intervention can be very effective, though, because if done correctly, it can help reduce inflammation, allergies, and bowel issues, while helping the child's digestive system to be able to absorb nutrients more efficiently from their food.  On this episode of The Mother Cub Show, host Susan Lynn Perry will interview Ms. Donna Gates, the founder and creator of The Body Ecology Diet.  This diet was created initially to eradicate yeast and other fungal infections from an adult's body, but has had the unexpected benefit of helping many children with autism become healthier as well.]]></description>

That is, after all, one of the diagnostic criteria used to diagnose the condition of autism - delayed or inappropriate social interaction.  In this important episode of The Mother Cub Show, Susan Lynn Perry will interview Dr. Jed Baker, award-winning author of the Social Skills Picture Book series for his guidance and advice on this valuable subject.  As a bonus, Dr. Baker will also discuss his book, No More Meltdowns, an informative guide brimming with positive strategies for managing and preventing out-of-control behavior.  If you're the parent or teacher of a child on the autism spectrum, this is one episode you don't want to miss!]]></description>
