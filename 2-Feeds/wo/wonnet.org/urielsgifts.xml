        <description>Videocasts of a special sort, including spiritual calisthenics for people who are willing to think.  &lt;br&gt;

Mass For The Shut-out is an omni-denominational celebration of The Divine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study&quot; looks at issues, especially issues that folks like you and I face in our daily lives.  It replaces &quot;The Sabbat School Class for a number of reasons including that it needed to be more often than at Sabbats, and we wanted to present highly serious material beyond what would be associated with a class which might be held as an alternative to the main ritual.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 This is not to teach you any one particular path, but to help you open your own path to The Divine.</description>

            <description>
                <![CDATA[February 20th is Tempest Smith Day, and she deserves a day to mark her short life.  On February 20, 2001, Tempest Smith died as a result of the relentless bullying she received from her classmates.  She was shy, she liked to wear black "Gothic" clothing and, she was studying and following Wicca.<br />
<br />
She was also highly intelligent and talented.  She wrote poetry, played the flute, and in general showd more depth to herself that most folks would expect in a middle-school girl.  Had she lived, she would be entering her mid-twenties today.  One can only imagine the young woman she might have become!<br />
<br />
Many of us have endured bullying, and perhaps most of us who would find interest in a podcast such as this.  It could be said that Tempest Smith was one of so many, but she is also one who represents ever-so-many.  A look at the Tempest Smith Foundation web site reveals photographs of many more.<br />
<br />
And so, perhaps let us see her as a patron for those who are the victims of bullying.  And if we keep Tempest in mind, we might be able to put an end to bullying.  <br />
<br />
And this is a special ritual done in her honor to celebrate her life and mark her day.<br />

Blessed Be!<br />

            <title>Thinking about Tempest Smith Day February 20th - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, February 12, 2012</title>
            <description>Tempest Smith Day is February 20th.  Tempest Kayne Smith died on February 20, 2001.  She was twelve years old.  She was shy, she liked to wear black &quot;Gothic&quot; clothing and she was studying Wicca.  Because of that, she was the subject of years of daily bullying in school until the time when she could not take any more.  She died by her own hand.  When her classmates realized what their bullying had resulted in doing, many of them expressed apologies.  And, of course, the faculty and administration at her school &quot;expressed regret&quot; and &quot;extended condolences.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not only is bulling wrong, religious bullying is one of the most spiritually dangerous deeds a person might do!  I would expect Christians to be especially wary, since their Bible gives so many reasons not to!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On Febraury 20th, I will be exercising what authority I have to try and make some sort of permanent honoring of Tempest Smith.  To begin with, she will be officially declared a martyr and her day will be permanently a part of a calendar.&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be!&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Mass For The Shut-Out: Imbolc, February 2, 2012</title>
            <description>Imbolc in some places is a Sabbat greeted with a feeling of relief.  We&apos;ve had winter with us for a while, the brightness and merriness of Yule is in the past, and what&apos;s been left to many of us is simply cold and perhaps a bunch of snow, too!  At Imbolc, we celebrate the first stirrings of spring, with the first shoots of the heartier crops pushing their heads through the snow to be seen!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We were made a promise at Samhain when we celebrated the life of the old year.  That promise was re-stated at Yule, as the sun began its return to us.  And Imbolc gives us the first tangible evidence that it is actually happening.  We have the first actual evidence that spring is actually going to be!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Other paths, including the Christian, have flattered us by adopting our Sabbats, and this one is no exception.  However, you sometimes might feel forced to dig deep if you want to learn about more than &quot;Ground Hog Day&quot;.  But that&apos;s OK, there is something very significant - and it gives an extra perspective to help us see the full importance of what Imbolc means!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, let&apos;s celebrate!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Mass For The Shut-Out: Yule December 21, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[It's Yuletide, and here's our Yuletide celebration, in our special chapel where all join in, no matter where you are!<br />
<br />
Yule is a special time, for so many reasons, not the least of which is its prominence in the Wheel Of The Year.  After all, it is the first visible fulfillment of the promise made at Samhain.  There was a death then, but also a promise of a new birth.  And that's what we have here, and we celebrate it.<br />
<br />
In fact, most paths at the time of their Winter Solstice celebrate it, and for good reason.  It was the beginning of the sun's return.  There were wintry days ahead, but a promise had been made, and this is its first sign of fulfillment, no matter if it's December in the Northern Hemisphere or June in the Southern Hemisphere.  And since I'm in the Nothern Hemisphere, we have this now.<br />
<br />
And if you look at it, there's something special.  And perhaps we can look at it here.  <br />
<br />
But above all, it's Yule and a good time to celebrate and enjoy fellowship!<br />
<br />
Blessed Be!<br />]]>

            <title>Universal, Universalism And All Of Us - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, November 28, 2011</title>
            <description>The words &quot;universal&quot;, &quot;unity&quot;, and &quot;universalism&quot; get batted around a lot, as if they were something major and profound.  And, of course, there are a number of people who use those words with the definition which they have come up with for themselves.  How often have we heard someone speak of &quot;unity&quot; or &quot;The Universal Church&quot;, and find that they are actually talking about an ostensibly grown-up version of the supposedly long-abandined childhood logic that says &quot;playing with my ball in my yard equals my rules&quot;? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So then, what does it mean?  And how do we deal with the existence of more than one path, each claiming to be &quot;the&quot; path to The Divine&quot;?  And how do we deal with the fact that so many of us are not on the path we started on?  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&apos;s something here that most of us will need to explore.&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Mass For The Shut-Out: Veterans&apos; Day, November 11, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[In the United States, November 11th is set aside as Veterans' Day, a day to honor those who have served in the armed forces of the United States.  Most countries have such a celebration, and well they should.  Personally, I honor all veterans, including those who would have once been my enemies.<br />
<br />
It was originally called Armistice Day, the anniversary of the end of hostilities in the First World War.  And even then, there were honors to those who had served in that war.  In in the early 1950's, we had been through one other (and bigger) war and we were in the Korean conflict, and so Armistice Day was re-named to Veterans' Day in honor of all veterans.<br />
<br />
All veterans began their lives as ordinary people leading ordinary lives.  For some, military service was considered a rite of passage on the way to adulthood.  Others were given no choice, they were drafted.  Some volunteered.  Others chose the way they enterd because the alternative was to be drafted.  There are no limits to the possibilities of their motivations.  One rather well-known test pilot and fighter ace became an aviation cadet to avoid the duty roster.  Another fighter ace who won the Medal of Honor joined to get off of the farm.  <br />
<br />
Once in uniform, there was yet another occasion for fate and fortune.  Some were needed to fill jobs behind desks and in supply warehouses.  Others were needed as leaders, and others needed to be led.  Some earned more rank and medals than others, but in the final analysis that is not much of a distinction.  After all, would the heroic fighter pilot or the decorated hero of the battle have accomplished what they did without support from the supply clerks, the cooks, the medics, and ever-so-many others?  The Army once estimated that it takes fifty people in other jobs to support one soldier in the field.<br />
<br />
And so, we take this occasion to give thanks for them all!  <br />
 <br />
Blessed Be! <br />]]>

After all, would the heroic fighter pilot or the decorated hero of the battle have accomplished what they did without support from the supply clerks, the cooks, the medics, and ever-so-many others?  The Army once estimated that it takes fifty people in other jobs to support one soldier in the field.

And so, we take this occasion to give thanks for them all!

            <title>Celebrating Samhain! Mass For The Shut-Out October 31, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[It's Samhain!  The wheel of the year has completed another cycle, and so here we are.<br />
<br />
We are at the end, and we are at the beginning!  This is, after all, the Celtic New Year.  We can look back at all that we've accomplished this year, and look forward to what we want to accomplish in the new year just beginning!<br />
<br />
For some of us, just having made it through in some semblance of health can be looked upon as an achievment.  And there's more, for those who look for it.  Each Sabbat can be found in every other Sabbat until the year comes around to Samhain again, and there we find the greatest of Samhain's promises: fulfillment.<br />
<br />
And, of course, the veil between the worlds is at its thinnest, and this means that now is the best opportunity to spend some time sharing with those we've known and loved who have crossed the Rainbow Bridge.  They still love us and care about us, after all.  <br />
<br />
And for those of us new to such things, this is the perect time to become more aware.  There is much hear that we can all make use of throughout the entire year.  <br />
<br />
And, we have our celebration.<br />
<br />
Blessed Be! <br />]]>

            <title>A Mabon Celebration! Mass For The Shut-Out September 24, 2011</title>
            <description>It&apos;s Mabon, and here we are in Mabontide ready for a celebration!  Some call this the last harvest, Lammas being the first.  Some call it the second of three with the final being Samhain.  Either way, this is Mabon and we do celebrate the harvest at this time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not only do we celebrate the harvest, we give thanks.  In fact, it can be said that Thanksgiving as people in the USA celebrate it is Mabon transplanted to later in the calendar.  And yes, we give thanks.  Not just for the good things that are apparent, but also for those that might not be apparent.  There are those things we&apos;ve been too busy to notice.  There are some things which we might have come to take for granted.  And yes, there probably are some blessings which we simply haven&apos;t realized.  And this is the time for that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is another one of those Sabbats where the emphasis is on fulfillment.  Those who feel as if they are in exile from other paths can take comfort in that.  The Wheel Of The Year is about a promise and its fulfillment.  There&apos;s no talk of &quot;God&apos;s will&quot; here because the will of The Divine is our fulfillment, happiness and well-being.  There is no talk of &quot;God&apos;s time&quot; because each and every Sabbat can be marked on the calendar.  As for &quot;God&apos;s higher plan,&quot; this is indeed that &quot;higher plan&quot;, and woe be those who stand in the way!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so come, join in this celebration!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be! &lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>An Answer For So Many Issues - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, September 19, 2011</title>
            <description>&quot;Non nobis Domine, non nobis sed nomine toa da Gloriam.&quot;  And before anyone uses their pre-conceived notions to dismiss this, let it be known that virtually every spiritual path has someone (or a few someones) who might be addressed as &quot;Lord&quot; or &quot;Lady&quot; and unto whom people ascribe all honor, including the ones referred to as simply &quot;The Lord And Lady.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Not us Lord, not us but to your name give glory&quot;.  And that is a pretty good solution to just about anything which I have to criticize about religion, organized or otherwise.  It&apos;s basically a call to humility, and for some humility seems to be actually the subject of bragging rights.  As in: &quot;There isn&apos;t anyone more humble than me, and I date you to disagree with that.&quot;  And that problem is not limited to the clergy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And the problem is not limited to the level of the individual follower.  How many people and movements are there where someone believes that they are of &quot;The One And Only True Way (R)&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, let&apos;s look at this and see what we can do for ourselves with this!&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The People I worry About The Most - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, September 12, 2011</title>
            <description>Last time, I spoke about what I was going to do to accept my own challenge.  And, it made sense to do so.  I had offered a challenge to others, so am I going to also accept the challenge?  Of course!  Not only should I, but I want to!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And, I spoke about some people I want to reach out to.  This time, I want to expand that and point out three kinds of people that I am concerned about the most.  They present us with a challenge and an opportunity.  On the positive side, meeting their needs means that we will grow in numbers and strength.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, I see them as having the most need.  But I also see that once those needs are met, they will have the most to give others.  In The Havamal, Allfather Odin says that a gift deserves a gift, and this is a situation in which those who are given gifts pass on gifts, with the result being the enrichment of us all!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You see, those who have been successfully ministered to often become the most successful ministers.  And the healed become healers. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Picking Up My Own Gauntlet - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, September 6, 2011</title>
            <description>Time before last, I offered a challenge.  In essence, the challenge was to figure out what we can do for ourselves and for the betterment of our spiritual paths and the people who pursue those paths.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&apos;s not all I talk about this time, but it&apos;s the main thing.  I&apos;m answering my own challenge by investigating what I might be able to do, and coming up with something resembling a plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have a lot of people, both regular and reserve, on active duty right now, and a number of them are deployed without their families into some areas which are less than hospitable.  Add to that the number of tours over there that some have served, and you have a situation which can breed a lot of stress.  In my day (the VietNam era), someone would probably have to serve one tour and a few people in critical specialties might have to serve a second tour.  And, we knew when we left when we were coming home.  A fifth tour for us would be unthinkable, yet now fifth tours are not unusual.  Add to that for one of us the likelihood of spiritual isolation.  Even some Christians face that, but as a Pagan, Wiccan or Druid it can be all the more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, what to do?  I remember some of the ways I found comfort, such as listening to the BBC.  And so, I&apos;m looking at something that I might be able to offer that&apos;s part of what I&apos;m offering now.  What do I mean?  Tune in and see!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Celebration So We Can Celebrate! Mass For The Shut-Out August 27, 2011</title>
            <description>It occurred to me that this would be a good time to have a celebration just for the sake of having a celebration.  Just for the sake of seeing all that The Divine has done for us and giving some thanks, even if it isn&apos;t one of those marked-on-the-calendar appointed times for such a celebration.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many years ago, someone who I have come to venerate had some advice for people who were going to The Divine with prayers because of specific needs: &quot;Give thanks in advance&quot;, he was known to say.  And in at least one place, someone quoted him as saying &quot;When you do that, you have them over the barrel and they have to do something for you, because you&apos;re thanking them!&quot;  Some would question such a statement, but it works.  And, he was able to pull off some amazing stuff in his lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And, come to think of it, why not!  And why not from time to time take a step back and look at the blessings you and I have and give some thanks.  And who knows?  Like in a retail business where it seems that the happy customer seems to get better service, in life it seems that people who give thanks wind up having more to give thanks about!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And in this, I&apos;ll reveal something to you which some of you might find to be the clue to inspire a quest.  But, that is for you to see.  Just as you&apos;ll see here that this ritual and celebration was spontaneous and unrehearsed (as mine normally are).  But then again, I&apos;m not the Pope at St Peter&apos;s Square at Christmas or Easter.  I&apos;m just a priest (and a mortal) who wants to spend some time giving thanks to The Divine for some wonderful things.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>A Modest Proposal And A Challenge - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, August 23, 2011</title>
            <description>A famous (or infamous) English author once wrote an essay with a title which began &quot;A modest proposal....&quot; which raised a stir in its day and still does.  And here, I wish to offer a proposal about some of the things we can do.  In fact, some of the things we once did to survive might be the way for us to be able to thrive.  What is it?  Doing for others in ways which they cannot do for themselves, or helping in ways which those who are supposed to help them just don&apos;t seem to be able to.  Our herbs and other natural remedies offer comfort and healing where sometimes doctors just can&apos;t.  Divination offers answers to questions which people might not even know how to ask.  And so much, much more.  Isn&apos;t there!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, we have an opportunity.  And I&apos;m going to tell you about the idea that is coming together in my mind&apos;s eye about what I would like to do along those lines.  I&apos;m not an herbalist, I don&apos;t know enough about divination to offer my services beyond a small circle of friends, but I am a priest and I can do something there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And that&apos;s the challenge!  Do what you can do best, and in the best way.  And see what might come of it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be!&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <itunes:subtitle>A Modest Proposal And A Challenge - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, August 23, 2011</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>A famous (or infamous) English author once wrote an essay with a title which began &quot;A modest proposal....&quot; which raised a stir in its day and still does.  And here, I wish to offer a proposal about some of the things we can do.  In fact, some of the things we once did to survive might be the way for us to be able to thrive.  What is it?  Doing for others in ways which they cannot do for themselves, or helping in ways which those who are supposed to help them just don&apos;t seem to be able to.  Our herbs and other natural remedies offer comfort and healing where sometimes doctors just can&apos;t.  Divination offers answers to questions which people might not even know how to ask.  And so much, much more.  Isn&apos;t there!

And so, we have an opportunity.  And I&apos;m going to tell you about the idea that is coming together in my mind&apos;s eye about what I would like to do along those lines.  I&apos;m not an herbalist, I don&apos;t know enough about divination to offer my services beyond a small circle of friends, but I am a priest and I can do something there.

And that&apos;s the challenge!  Do what you can do best, and in the best way.  And see what might come of it!

            <title>Offending vs Enlightening - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, August 15, 2011</title>
            <description>Sometimes, to get a point across you might have to say something that won&apos;t be liked by everyone.  Yet, there are some people who seem to put such a high priority on not offending anyone that they also avoid accomplishing very much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My favorite example is what I so often experienced in the Air Force.  There were even some denominations who made such an effort at &quot;inclusiveness&quot; that they would overstep boundaries of their own denomination.  And then there was the denomination which worried that the traditional reading for Easter might offend another group, as if that other group were going to attend!  And, for that matter, the particular reading had been scripture for longer than that denomination had existed, so what&apos;s the deal?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Somehow, it has to be possible to reconcile enlightening and the possibility of offending.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Three Tactics To Grow! - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, August 8, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Some folks call us "marginalized", but that doesn't have to be and it can easily be said that the time for that is over!  <br />
<br />
Every religious movement has a time when it wasn't in the mainstream.  At one time, Buddhism consisted of Gauthama Sakyamuni Buddha and his followers, of whom 12 were especially close to him (does that sound familiar?).  And yes, Christianity began as Yeshua Bar-Joseph and his 12 disciples.  And Yeshua was Jewish, a movement which began with only Abraham and his wife Sarah.  The Mormons were once a small group of followers of Joseph Smith who were forced out of Nauvoo, Illinois.<br />
<br />
And what of us?  There are certainly enough people - and even corporations - who seem to be able to make a living supplying the material goods to help our spiritual needs, such as books and magickal tools.  So, it seems to me that if we all stood up and let ourselves be counted, we'd be in the mainstream - and perhaps larger than some of the groups who try to marginalize us.<br />
<br />
And what might we be able to do to bring this about?  More directly, what can each and every one of us individually do that will help bring this about?  Three things - and they are within the grasp of each and every person who sees this vidcast!<br />

            <title>Lammas! Mass For The Shut-Out July 30, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[It's Lammas!<br />
<br />
Whether you call it Lammas, Lughnassadh, Loaf-mass, or any other of the names that it is known by in various paths, this is the first of the harvest feasts.  It is especially the celebration of the harvest of grains, which makes bread and the like such an appropriate food for this celebration.<br />
<br />
It is also the first tangible fulfillment of the promises made since last Samhain.  Remember, every sabbat has remnants of every other Sabbat.  And just as when the god died at Samhain we were promised the birth at Yule, so we were promised harvests at the time of planting.<br />
<br />
And that's what so many of us seek and welcome.  There's no talk about "God's will" here.  We do our part, the Divine do their part, and we celebrate the resulting harvest.<br />
<br />
And so, then, here is a celebration at Temple of Gaia.<br />
<br />
Come and join us, as we appreciate the harvest.  This is one that even the city folk can enjoy!   <br />
<br />
Blessed Be! <br />]]>

            <title>Special Healing For Morning Glory Zell! Mass For The Shut-Out July 24, 2011</title>
            <description>Here, we take a variation from our regular schedule to do something special for someone who has been so very special to so many of us.  I am speaking of Morning Glory Zell.  We have received word that her cancer has returned.  I don&apos;t have the details, and I don&apos;t need the details to know what to offer.  We need to join in the fight with every means we have, including and especially the spiritual.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At a time when my life seemed in turmoil, it was some of her writings that guided me onto a path which brought my life into balance.  And that was when I was just one among so many virtually anonymous &quot;newbies&quot; trying to find some sense of direction in a situation in which many offer advice, but few are actually qualified to do so.  And I say that as just one of ever-so-many who can say that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;, which has been called for July 22nd thru August 13th, and I&apos;m also offering this special &quot;Mass For The Shut-Out&quot; in addition.  &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; is a Temple of Gaia tradition used in time of need.  In essence, at the date and time called for (your local time whatever it is), you do your own particular ritual the way you do it for the specific intention.  It &quot;rolls&quot; because of the way time zones work.  Here, in &quot;Mass For The Shut-Out&quot;, you join with others together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Between &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; and &quot;Mass For The Shut-Out&quot;, we can raise a whole lot of healing energy for Morning Glory!&lt;br /&gt;
   &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Got Focus? - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, July 18, 2011</title>
            <description>Got focus?  It&apos;s amazing how things can lose focus.  I recall in the Air Force, there were people who insisted upon reports being filled and meetings being attended, even at the expense of operational missions!  And please don&apos;t think that such failure-to-focus is limited to the military establishment.  Businesses, healthcare establishments and even religious bodies can sometimes get so wrapped up in procedures and rules that their basic purpose is obscured!  Does a hospital exist for the sake of healing people or for the sake of complying with state and federal regulations?  There are a few folks who would ask that question!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And where spirituality and religion are concerned, it can really happen.  I recall my main mentor (Rt Rev Jerome Birnbaum AKA Jerome Peartree) kidding that if he were put to death, in a thousand years would his followers be wearing little electric chairs around their necks?  And what about the cross, especially the version with the body on it?  Isn&apos;t the emphasis supposed to be not on that, but the fact that he overcame the most agonizing and humiliating of deaths to rise again and triumph?  When we think of stars on the red carpet for the Oscars or Emmys, do we focus on the well-dressed, well-scrubbed star on the carpet, or do we focus on the scrubbing, bathing, and perhaps some breath-holding that it took to get them into those fancy clothes?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And that&apos;s where focus comes in.  It&apos;s one of the more important parts of &quot;To Will,&quot; I would say.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Got focus?&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Got Guts? - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, July 11, 2011</title>
            <description>Once upon a time, in what some folks call a fit of my occasional cynicism, I remarked that where the spiritual is concerned, nobody forges new ground and gets away with it.  If memory serves me right, one of the people who readily agreed with that statement was the High Priest/Bishop who gave me the ordination which I consider to be my &quot;biggie&quot;.  And, of course, in some cases &quot;forging new ground&quot; might actually be reclaiming old ground which others have abandoned.  That&apos;s true in The Craft, but it is also true in some Christian paths - and all of those which cross between The Craft and Christianity.  Understand the New Testament in its actual context and in light of certain &quot;ignored&quot; verses, and you&apos;ll understand what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And there are some basic principles which need to be understood.  I consider them to be basic and elementary.  The first is that if you have a tradition, follow it!  The second principle is that if you are going to change a tradition from within, do so on a firm basis.  History gives us some good examples of when and how this was done.  Finally, sometimes the best way to make change is to build something new.  That way, you can continue to respect (and be respected by) those who are following the old tradition, and you can build something with the opportunity to examine in a full context.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are those who don&apos;t seem to understand this. One particular example in the Church of England has had so much press about variances of his opinions that he appears to waffle enough to open a breakfast shop!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, I adapt from a popular commercial from a few years ago.  Got Guts?  That might be a good thing to have in the coming days!&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be!&lt;br /&gt;

There are those who don&apos;t seem to understand this. One particular example in the Church of England has had so much press about variances of his opinions that he appears to waffle enough to open a breakfast shop!

And so, I adapt from a popular commercial from a few years ago.  Got Guts?  That might be a good thing to have in the coming days!

            <title>Now More Than Ever - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, July 4, 2011</title>
            <description>I&apos;ve noticed a similar phenomenon going on in the world of secular politics as I&apos;ve noticed going on in religion, especially in the United States.  It&apos;s known as polarization.  And, so I take the title from the political campaign slogan of Richard Nixon, the man who was President the last time I saw so much political polarization.  As I see it, the basic problem which Richard Nixon had was that he accomplished what his predecessors of the other party had not been able to do.  He opened China, he ended the war in Vietnam, and he ended the miliraty draft.  And so, the other party became almost obsessive about him - and some still are.  If he were still alive, he could probably share some things with President Obama.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And in the world of religion, there is similar polarization going on in a number of denominations - and between denominations.  Worse, some groups seem to make accusations in one direction when there is history to show that they could make those accusations into a mirror. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I think about three men I greatly admire, some of the greatest theological minds our world has seen:  Venerable Solanus Casey, Archbishop Fulton Sheen and Father Thomas Merton.  All three were Romal Catholic clergy, but all three were comfortable working with people of other faiths - and did so with no intent to convert them.  Father Solanus was a Capuchin priest simplex known, among other things, for the soup kitchens he founded.  Bishop Sheen was known for his work in radio and television.  Father Merton was a Trappist monk whose diverse circle of friends included the Dhalai Lama.  And they all spoke about unity without unification.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can you imagine what could be accomplished if we could come together to work together?        &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>What About The Devil? - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, June 26, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Given the nature of some of the stuff I've been studying and dealing with lately, it occurred to me that I really needed to say something about that being which some Christians refer to as "The Devil".<br />
<br />
I personally do not believe that such a being exists.  I have many reasons to believe that way, and in this show I'll outline to you the reasons why I do not believe that a being which is totally and absolutely evil can exist.<br />
<br />
Of course, that does not mean that I don't believe in evil.  It also does not mean that I do not know that there are indeed evil spirits and other evil entities, just as there are evil people.  Good cannot exist without evil, and evil would not exist without good.<br />
<br />
This is an issue which every one of us has to deal with in our everyday lives.  <br />
<br />
And now that you know that the fact that you see it does not make you wrong or crazy, what can you do about it?  What should you do about it? <br />
    <br />
Blessed Be!<br />]]>

            <title>A Litha Celebration! Mass For The Shut-Out June 21, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Did you ever notice that on the Wheel Of The Year, Litha is the Sabbat directly opposite Yule?  In fact, as we in the Northern Hemisphere celebrate Litha, they are having Yule in the Southern Hemisphere.  And that fact has some implications worth noticing.<br />
<br />
A baby was born at Yule.  We've seen him go through all of the stages of growing and coming of age, and the last Sabbat was Beltaine, where we celebrated his wedding.  Here at Litha, we celebrate his fulfillment!  It is too soon to harvest, that will be soon enough.  But it is a good time to look at what the baby born at Yule has grown to become!<br />
<br />
And here is Litha's gift to us, as expressed in a reading which came from a place which you might not have expected.  But the point of that reading was that someone was given something that they didn't put to use, and here at Litha we celebrate someone's fulfillment.  In other words, the baby born at Yule now has all he needs to carry out what he needs to do.<br />
<br />
So much of theology deals with stories of people who were trying to get what was already theirs.  And some of us surprise ourselves when we discover how much we have.<br />
<br />
And so let's celebrate this, and learn!<br />

            <title>A Retail Approach To Spirituality - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, June 12, 2011</title>
            <description>I grew up in a retail environment.  I couldn&apos;t help it.  My Dad was in the hardware business almost all of his adult life, and the lessons he learned he passed on to me.  He worked in the central organization of Coast-To-Coast Stores, and in the latter part of my high school years I worked in one of the stores until I left for college in another city.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, what does this have to do with spirituality?  Perhaps more than some folks want to admit.  The secret to success in being in the retail business is to not only persuade the customer to buy this time, but to come back again to buy some more.  And for the customer, the secret is to get the best possible deal consistently so that you get what you want without going broke.  Now, does that sound like it might have a parallel in the stuff we&apos;re talking about?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This episode was inspired by a recent visit to a deli which I regularly frequent.  And this time, the lady in front of me was someone whose knowledge of cheese was there was &quot;white cheese&quot; and there was &quot;yellow cheese&quot;, or so it seemed.  It reminded me of the person who asked for &quot;bolts&quot; with no appreciation of how many kinds of bolts there are, or the person who asked for &quot;a thingamabob about so long....&quot;  And after the deli clerk had served the lady her &quot;white cheese&quot;, he and I had a nice chat comparing notes.  Can you see how something there might relate to how to use prayer effectively?  I knew which kind of cheese I wanted, right down to the brand - much easier for him to get me what I really wanted.  Oh, and of course it heled to let him know that I had an appreciation of what he did.  And I come there regularly enough that he knows me.  Do you think that helps?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do you think there&apos;s a lesson here for our spiritual lives?  Watch and see!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Payback Time? - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, June 6, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA["Payback Time!"  You've probably seen a movie which makes use of that trite saying.  And unless you're going through life as everyone's favorite doormat, you've felt like wanting to say that yourself more than once.<br />
<br />
It's only natural.  At some time in your life, someone is going to get you angry enough that you will want to see something happen to the person who made you angry.  And you probably feel that you have every right to do so.<br />
<br />
And, if you're of a spiritual path which believes in such things, you have a nice array of spiritual tools available to you to help you accomplish such a goal.  I recall one time telling someone (honestly) that I found that I can do more with an altar than I ever could with a firearm.<br />
<br />
So, what do you do?  There is a joke that goes "If the Pope excommunicated like some High Priestesses banish, hell would have a housing shortage!"  And what might you accomplish by such an effort.  Do you think it would make an impression on the person whose attention you're trying to get?  Does that person even understand that he or she did anything wrong?<br />
<br />
Sometimes, with experience, you discover that something you did not consider might be the answer.  Not giving up, but giving it to someone who is better equipped to handle the whole situation.  <br />
<br />
Let's think on this one for a while.  It's an issue you've seen before and probably will see again.<br />

            <title>Memorial Day! Mass For The Shut-Out May 29, 2011</title>
            <description>This week includes Memorial Day in the United States.  If you live somewhere else, you probably have a similar celebration so that what we speak of today will apply for you at that time.  And, we memorialize the same ones.  In fact, I will be including all of those that are honored anywhere on such a memorial.  All fell for ther country, or served their country and died later.  For in the United States, we find ourselves not only honoring those who died on active duty, but all who have fought and passed on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They all share the common bond of having anseered their country&apos;s call.  Some did so voluntarily.  Some were drafted.  Others volunteered so that they could choose their form of service rather than have it chosen for them.  But they all took an oath.  I remember mine.  Part of it was to support and defend the Constitution Of The United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  Another part was to obey the orders of the President Of The United States and the officers appointed over me.  Some who criticize us who serve forget that we took such an oath.  Military service is not an occasion to debate the merits of a particular action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And on this day, we remember them.  In my case, I also honor those who might have been enemies at the time, but they would have been friends under other circumstances, and in a few cases some of those they fought alongside did become my friends when our nations became friends again.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And on this day, we honor them.&lt;br /&gt;

A boy of ten is getting ready for school when his dad suggests he "take a day off" and spend the day with some fmaily friends - and at the end of that day the boy learns that the "day off" was because his mother had died.  A man is at work when the phone rings and he's told that he's needed at home immediately because of an accident.  A couple is speaking to her dad/ his father-in-law about a forthcoming visit, and in the wee hours of the next morning there is a call from the dad/father-in-law's wife that he had died just hours after the phone call.  These are things that happen.  What to do?<br />
<br />
No amount of advice, no matter how well-intentioned or even no matter how wise, will be the "magic pill" some folks look for.  If it happened to you, then it's pretty much on you to see yourself through.<br />
<br />
And therein is the question: What do you have?  What is your most powerful weapon in dealing with the current situation.  Perhaps just as important, what is your enemy?<br />
<br />
We need to examine this, because nobody is exempt from such things happening.  So, let's look at this issue, which you probably have had to face and you certainly will face in the future!<br />

            <description>And here we go into the area known as practical theology which also means applying this stuff we talk about here in our daily lives.  And this time, inspired by that San Fransisco-area mommy who thought it was perfectly all right to inject her 8-year-old daughter with Botox &quot;to get rid of wrinkles&quot;. After hearing about it a number of times, I realized that there was a much bigger issue here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wells go down deep below the surface and bring stuff up to the surface for the benefit of those on the surface.  A bridge crosses a gap.  The bridge is firmly anchored on both sides and flexibility is designed into the middle parts of the span.  Right now, we need more bridges and wells.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mythologies, mysteries and passages.  The ancient societies had an ample supply of all three.  Our modern society barely bothers with any of that.  Some differences are painfully obvious, such as when villagers know to go to higher ground &quot;because the gods are having an argument.&quot;  Or the fact that it takes The Pope to remind us that something like The Resurrection does not contradict science, but is beyond science.  Or the cases of adults who try to force adult concepts on their children.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Wells, Bridges, But No Bunny-rabbits - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, May 8, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<br />
Anyone's spiritual life can be said to be composed of three elements: wells, bridges, and bunny-rabbits.  Some might only have one well.  Others might have a few wells and bridges.  But those who have a bunny-rabbit don't have much in the way of bridges or wells, and the bunny-rabbit keeps jumping around from place to place so that there's little chance that any will be built.<br />
<br />
So, what do we mean here?<br />
<br />
Take a look at the physical objects that are known as bridges, wells, and bunny-rabbits, and you will see what I mean.  You'll also see their function and the need for both wells and bridges.  You might recognize some of your own.<br />
<br />
The bunny-rabbit is the perplexing one.  For some, it might be a needed phase, especially if someone was cut lose from what they thought was an anchor.  But beware the fact that the bunny-rabbit bounces around and might never stop in the same place.<br />
<br />
And at the same time, it is good to cherish wells and bridges.  From these we draw much of our spiritual sustenance.<br />
 <br />

            <title>Beltaine 2011! Mass For The Shut-Out May 1, 2011</title>
            <description>Here we are at Beltaine, and here we are at the Temple, and so, let&apos;s celebrate!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beltaine is about many things, but they all add up to fulfillment.  There was a god who died, and his funeral was Samhain.  But, there was a child who was newborn at Yule.  And we&apos;ve seen him grow and go through the various stages.  At Imbolc, there was the Naming for the Norse (which translates into the Christian &quot;christening&quot;), or the Briss for the Jewish.  And then there was Ostara, which functions much as a Bar Mitzvah, indicating the first coming of age.  And now, Beltaine where we see him as a fully-grown young adult, ready to take his bride!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, we see the promise made at Samhain being fulfilled.  And here is a good time to look ahead and see what and how many fulfillments we want.  We&apos;re not waiting for any deity&apos;s time, it&apos;s on the calendar.  We aren&apos;t wondering about any deity&apos;s will, because it has been promised and it is going to be.  As for anything about any &quot;higher plan&quot;, this is of the highest plan!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, let&apos;s learn about getting fulfillment and how to deal with it when it happens.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Easter: The Divine&apos;s Spiritual Baseball Bat? - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, April 24, 2011</title>
            <description>As we come to the celebration of Beltaine, the Christians are having their Easter Sunday.  The whole point of their faith hangs on the fact of Easter and the fact that their god&apos;s son, Yeshua Bar-Joseph, died and rose from the dead.  It is an event which, as Pope Benedict XVI describes it, is not in disagreement with science, but is beyond science.  And what can a Wiccan learn from the Christians&apos; Easter?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps quite a bit, especially given that so much of what Christians believe originated with Jesus&apos; story preceded him, often by centruies if not millenia.  The Last Supper was in fact a Passover Seder, but other aspects of it call on other traditions.  Most Jews would recognize the baptisms done by John The Baptist as being the Mikvah, a ritual bath not unlike what many Wiccans and Pagans do.  The prophecy of Simeon in the Temple at Jesus&apos;s presentation (when he was nine days old) speaks of a phenomenon which was supposedly not supposed to happen until years later after the resurrection.  And &quot;justification by faith&quot; can be found in Genesis in the story of Abram.  Hey, even the resurrection wasn&apos;t the first one - rememebr the one whom Jesus resurrected?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, what&apos;s the big deal?  Well, all of them got packaged into one big &quot;bing-bangitty-boom&quot; with a mighty shock to one and all!  And if these things were not new gifts, then they were brought together so that people would pay attention to them and use them.  It meant that folks didn&apos;t have excuses not to use them anymore!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And that&apos;s what a lot of folks on many paths miss - the importance of finding out how much we already have and using it!  And maybe, just maybe, this was their god&apos;s way of hitting them on the head with a spiritual baseball bat to get them to notice!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Five Most Popular Ways Of Spiritual Suicide - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, April 18, 2011</title>
            <description>Here, we talk about some folks you and I have known, and (very importantly) how to keep from joining them.  I&apos;m talking about the spiritually dead. They may physically continue to exist and have their funerals in their 80&apos;s or 90&apos;s, but they actually died much younger, perhaps in their teens and twenties.  Some are obvious, because they are so busy being who they think that they are supposed to be that they forget who they might actually be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Others die more quietly, just sort of giving up on their spiritual life.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In either case, they may have been the victims of spiritual suicide.  Some commit spiritual suicide voluntarily, such as the people who are so intent on being who others want them to be that they forget to learn who they really are.  And then there are the victims of subtlety, whose spiritual suicide is more of a slow and gentle process to the point that it&apos;s hard to tell when they actually died.  Worse, so many of them do not know that they are dying - or dead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And of course, there is something positive that might be gleaned from this also.  If you know how some people die, it might show you some ways to be more alive.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Secrets You Might Need To Know - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, April 11, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[These are secrets which are indeed in plain sight Someone recently accused me of being too political.  Excuse me, but we are living in political times, and there are some things we need to know about in order to at least survive, and at best deal successfully with other paths, especially those who would interfere with us and our rights.<br />
<br />
And here I reveal one of the biggest secrets waiting for us in plain sight:  Their Bible is actually more Pagan-friendly than many (especially Christian fundamenalists) want to know.  There is a psalm in which their god speaks to other gods.  Actually, there's more than one psalm that mentions there being more than one god, but in this one, the "Most High" speaks to the others!<br />
<br />
Of course, we have the statement about sheep which are not of that particular fold, which does not say how many other folds there might be, or where they are.  How many paths have people waiting for a god's son to return?<br />
<br />
And, there's the matter of the only sin which cannot be forgiven.  On that yardstick, you and I are in a lot less trouble than many who might condemn us.  <br />
<br />
As if to point out something, there's the time that someone entrapped the leaders of the religious establishment in an act of desecration, and he let them off the hook - or did they realize what they had done!<br />
<br />
But finally, there is a statement which is probably the first declaration of the separation of church and state, and it's in the Christian's Bible!<br />
<br />t, and we will do well to know them and be in a position to speak on them.<br />
   <br />
Blessed Be! <br />]]>

            <itunes:subtitle>Secrets You Might Need To Know - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, April 11, 2011</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Someone recently accused me of being too political.  Excuse me, but we are living in political times, and there are some things we need to know about in order to at least survive, and at best deal successfully with other paths, especially those who would interfere with us and our rights.

And here I reveal one of the biggest secrets waiting for us in plain sight:  Their Bible is actually more Pagan-friendly than many (especially Christian fundamenalists) want to know.  There is a psalm in which their god speaks to other gods.  Actually, there&apos;s more than one psalm that mentions there being more than one god, but in this one, the &quot;Most High&quot; speaks to the others!

Of course, we have the statement about sheep which are not of that particular fold, which does not say how many other folds there might be, or where they are.  How many paths have people waiting for a god&apos;s son to return?

And, there&apos;s the matter of the only sin which cannot be forgiven.  On that yardstick, you and I are in a lot less trouble than many who might condemn us.  

As if to point out something, there&apos;s the time that someone entrapped the leaders of the religious establishment in an act of desecration, and he let them off the hook - or did they realize what they had done!

But finally, there is a statement which is probably the first declaration of the separation of church and state, and it&apos;s in the Christian&apos;s Bible!

These are secrets which are indeed in plain sight, and we will do well to know them and be in a position to speak on them.

            <title>Unity: What It Should Mean And Some Folks Who Just Don&apos;t Get It! - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, April 4, 2011</title>
            <description>I had something ready to go when the local newspaper had a couple of articles which pointed to the point I wanted to make, and illustrated its need.  One is the story of a New Hampshire politician who referred to his local Catholic bishop as a &quot;pedophile pimp.&quot;  Knowing who he was referring to, it is safe to say that if there were any basis for such an accusation, action would have been taken some time ago.  Yet, we have a broad-brush accusation made personal, and on the order of the broadbrush attacks on Islam by Rep King of New York.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then we have the story of that pastor in a mini-church in Florida.  The church has an average Sunday attendance of about 50.  If you count cyberspace, my congregation is far larger.  Anyway, here is a pastor of a small congregation who decides, after some bad publicity in the past, to go ahead and burn a Quran!  Well, the Muslims in Afghanistan and a number of other places were upset!  (note to Christians: Matthew 12:31 will tell you where that pastor should have found a warning).  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And what we really need is unity - and I offered two more examples of people in positions of responsibility who don&apos;t get it.  Unity does not mean universalism.  But unity does mean that even though your gods and goddesses might not be the same as mine, or we might see them differently, we respect each other&apos;s paths.  Yours is as valid for you as mine is for me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once we get that, there&apos;s no telling how much we&apos;ll be able to accomplish!&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Dealing With Hype - And One Person&apos;s Answer! - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, March 27, 2011</title>
            <description>If there has been anything that has been bothering each and every one of us since the moment we were able to understand what others were telling us, that one bother would be what is known as hype.  From the kindergarten know-it-all who told you how many trips to the principal&apos;s office would get you kicked out of school to the Mayan Calendar&apos;s predictions for 2012, we can name several examples.  Most of us remember the &quot;Y2K&quot; hype when measures needed to be taken to insure that systems worked once the century changed.  And everything worked because folks worked hard to make sure that it would, but not before other people were able to sell big blue water barrels and wind-up radios, and even afterward there were people who seemed to almost be hoping that something might not be working.  And then there was the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks when suggestions were made that we wrap our houses in blue plastic and watch our neighbors very carefully.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While I will not call myself a fan or follower of James Refield, of &quot;Celestine Prophecy&quot; fame, I consider him to be someone well worth my attention because of the valid points he makes.  And his description of what the Mayan calendar is really telling us about 2012 I find attractive.  Far from the hype that some are proclaiming, he offers something that makes sense in light of what else I&apos;ve seen, learned and experienced.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I think we have something to look forward to!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Ostara 2011! Mass For The Shut-Out March 21, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Ostara is the 21st of March, so this is the time to celebrate it here!<br />
<br />
I keep talking about fulfillment, and Ostara is the embodiment of fulfillment.  In terms of the Jewish tradition, it could be said that the baby born at Yule had a Briss at Ostara and now is having his Bar Mitzvah!  Winter's hold is broken, and the world is returning to life!<br />
<br />
Even the Christian celebration of Easter parallels this, as they celebrate someone returning to life after dying a painful and humiliating death.  And, since it happened at Passover, it is at the same time of year as Ostara because it happened then.  This is not like Christmas which was put on December 25th to take the place of a Pagan Roman feast.  And some would call what happened as being the ultimate act of magick.  <br />
<br />
One of their theologians says that it does not contradict science, but goes beyond science.  And that's something basic at the heart of all magick - going beyond science.  It belongs to every spiritual path which believes in The Divine (of any name or names) being able to do things for us in this life.  And it works!<br />
<br />
An so we have here a major celebration, and reason to celebrate.<br />
<br />
And we also pray for the people in Japan, that they soon can celebrate and not live in fear.<br />
<br />
Blessed Be!<br />]]>

            <title>Getting It! - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, March 14, 2011</title>
            <description>If you&apos;ve watched any of my podcasts, video or audio, or if you&apos;ve seen my posts on blogs or sites like YouTube, you know that I speak of whether or not someone &quot;gets it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And here, we have two cases, very dramatic opposites, of someone who doesn&apos;t get it and someone who does.  The one who doesn&apos;t get it misses based on something which should be common knowledge among people in his position.  And The one who does get it is someone who might surprise you - so many of us thought that he didn&apos;t!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First, there&apos;s Representative Peter King, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, and chairman of the Homeland Security Committee.  He&apos;s leading an investigation into Islamic extremists in the United States and on his way to that, he makes broad-brush statements against the whole of Islam, as if they were all radicals.  And he criticizes American Muslims for not doing enough to oppose terrorism as if there weren&apos;t an abundance of Muslims serving in the armed forces - as one example of where he&apos;s wrong.  He&apos;s burning a lot of bridges for us!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then, let&apos;s look - perhaps with amazement - at someone who seems to really get it!  Pope Benedict has written a book which shows his courage, scholarship, and espeically his willingness to open doors and build bridges.  I&apos;ll offer some quotes to show you what I mean.  One in particular sound like something a Wiccan might teach, and it is definitely something which Gnostics have been teaching for centuries!  I&apos;m not going to hold my breath until he welcomes me as a fellow clergyman, but he did extend something which few expected, and it&apos;s worth celebrating!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And when people get it, it&apos;s the stuff that miracles are made of!    &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Making And Taking Oaths - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, March 7, 2011</title>
            <description>We need to discuss oaths, because they are so much a part of our lives.  Not only religiously, magickally and spiritually, but in our mundane lives as well.  There are the oaths which we consciously take, such as when someone testifies in court, when people get married, or when someone joins a military service.  Then, there are the implied oaths, which are there even if a formal oath is not taken.  An example in my own life is when Lady Stormy and I adopted Yuengling and Veronica from our local animal shelter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, there are also those cases in which there is no oath taken or implied.  And there will be times when someone will try to hold somebody to an oath which does not really exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An oath is mutual - there is something given in both directions.  And then there is the question of when an oath is broken.  Or for that matter, if someone is told that the other party broke their oath.  And thankfully, there is some room for forgiveness there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We could cover much more and take much more time, too.  But here is a beginning on a subject that some spend a lifetime trying to figure out. &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Going To Hell - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, Feb 28, 2011</title>
            <description>We need to address the issue of hell, if for no other reason than the fact that it is just possibly the ultimate spiritual blackmail.  And please, do not think that the Christians have an exclusive on threats of hell.  Of course, for most of us it&apos;s the Christians we see, with one preacher claiming that his way is the only way, but at the church down the street from him, another preacher is proclaiming that his is the only way, and I am not sure what would happen if they ever got together and perhaps started damning each other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But what is hell?  Actually, the term is found in the ancient Norse, but it is called Hel (one &quot;L&quot;), and it&apos;s the cold place where the dead people go to rest between lives.  And there are the alternatives.  The Norse have Valhalla, Folkvangr and other halles for people who have distinguished themselves.  And there is somethign set aside for the worst of the worst - according to the Norse, those are thieves, oath-breakers and spouse stealers.  And the Greeks and others had theirs, too.  But the Christians have some reassurance for all sins and blasphemies but one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, is there a solution?  Yes!  And if you look at what we&apos;ve shown here, the answer is far more basic than you might imagine.  So much for the self-appointed rule-makers and those who would condemn other paths!&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;

And there is somethign set aside for the worst of the worst - according to the Norse, those are thieves, oath-breakers and spouse stealers.  And the Greeks and others had theirs, too.  But the Christians have some reassurance for all sins and blasphemies but one.

And so, is there a solution?  Yes!  And if you look at what we&apos;ve shown here, the answer is far more basic than you might imagine.  So much for the self-appointed rule-makers and those who would condemn other paths!

            <title>In Honor Of Tempest Smith! Mass For The Shut-Out February 20, 2011</title>
            <description>February 20, 2011 is the tenth anniversary of Tempest Smith&apos;s passing.  She died on February 20, 2001 as the direct result of religious bullying.  She was brilliant, she was talented, and her exploration of the spiritual led her to Wicca.  Unfortunately, it also made her the subject of relentless teasing and harassment by her classmates.  The diary she kept said a great deal, and it was found after she died.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She died by her own hand.  At twelve years of age, time takes forever.  Next week can seem as far away as forever, especially if there is torment in your world.  Some of us survived by having a plan, but she did not.  At her funeral, so many who should have been her friends wrote how sorry they were, and those in authority who might have known what had been happening expressed their regret.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Isn&apos;t it about time for bullying to end?  Perhaps we can ask what is being done in our own local areas to prevent this!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Drawing The Line - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, Feb 15, 2011</title>
            <description>If there is one question which anyone with knowledge (actual or purported) of a religious or spiritual path will speak about, it is the perennial question of those things which someone (read: you) should or should not do.  Or perhaps more directly, those things which folks like you and I either must or must not do.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes it is on the level of the Sunday school teacher who tells the children that Jesus wants them to brush their teeth.  In other cases, it can be round after round of debate, whether in a covenstead or in the common room of a seminary dormitory.  Among Wiccans, you will often see this &quot;colored&quot; by discussions of what might be &quot;white magick&quot;, &quot;gray magick&quot;, or &quot;black magick.&quot;  And sometimes, it is hard to draw the line.  Or, did you draw the line correctly?  Or is this a case where you can modify what you are doing so that it can be on the better side of that line.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Or is it even a line?  Or could you see it like I do, as a series of circles?  Let&apos;s explore this!    &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Looking Ahead To February 20th - Tempest Smith Day - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, Feb 7, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[In a couple of weeks, it will be February 20th, Tempest Smith Day.  This year, we are observing the tenth anniversary of her passing.  She was twelve years old, talented and intelligent.  She played the flute and wrote poetry.  She was also learning about Wicca, considered herself to be Wiccan, and because of that she was bullied by her classmates until she finally died by her own hand.  <br />
<br />
I'll say more about Tempest Smith on "Mass For The Shut-Out".  Right now, I want to talk about what we can do as a lead-up to Tempest Smith Day.  In the Christian calendar, lead-ups to major occasions are even given names, such as Advent leading up to Christmas, and the "infamous" Lent leading up to Easter.  I say infamous for Lent because I see Lent as a perfect example of form taking over for substance to the point that many people have lost sight of its actual purpose.  If you want to see what I mean, ask a Christian child about Lent and you'll be told about all of the things you can't have and can't do because of Lent - and nothing about getting yourself spiritually ready for the holiday which, in essence defines Christianity.<br />
<br />
And so, what can we do as a lead-up to Tempest Smith Day?  There has been much said in the media lately about bullying.  I recently wrote a very nice email to the superintendent of the school district where I graduated from high school, and I asked about what is being done there about bullying.  It is true that they have written policies in place for one and all to read, but what are they actually doing?  As of this writing, it has been a week and I have received no reply.<br />
<br />
And for those who wish to see people of all faiths working together, this should be a most blessed opportunity.  A Christian should not be bullied for being Christian any more than a Wiccan should be bullied for being a Wiccan, and the fate of the bully in either case should be the same.<br />
<br />
So, let's do this for Tempest Smith.<br />
    <br />
Blessed Be! <br />

            <title>Our Imbolc Celebration! Mass For The Shut-Out February 2, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Wednesday, February 2nd, is Imbolc, so let's have a celebration!  In fact, most spiritual paths which have their roots in places which have rough winters have a celebration about now.  Celebration of Brighid, Lucia, Candlemas, and so many others, some of which are downright blatant in their Pagan roots, and some more subtly disguised.  And then, of course, there is the Christian Feast of the Presentation - which just happens to also be on February 2nd.<br />
<br />
If Samhain is the death and Yule is the birth of the baby, then Imbolc could be looked upon as the Briss, naming or christening, depending on your tradition.  And isn't it amazing how the Christians chose Imbolc to be the celebration of the Presentation In The Temple.  Their tradition was that if a boy is a woman's first-born, then he should be presented in the Temple in Jerusalem.  Quite a parallel!<br />
<br />
And the celebrations all have something more in common: taking a break from the bleakness of winter to celebrate what's coming.  Notice how many of the celebrations have lore and ritual which includes the use of candles?<br />
<br />
We have a special ministry here, and it seems to me that Imbolc has special meaning to that special ministry.  And so, let's no just celebrate Imbolc, let's celebrate something even more!<br />
<br />
And when you hear my suggestion of what might be included in an Imbolc celebration, you might think it revolutionary.  But then again, you might also see the point and join in!  And you will be most welcome!<br />
<br />
Blessed Be! <br />]]>

            <title>Facing Tough Issues - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, Jan 24, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[If we are going to be dealing with tough issues here, then probably it would be wise to devote at least one episode to the very subject of dealing with tough issues.  It would appear today that some folks just don't get the concept.  At least, that is the impression I get from the daily newspaper and the TV news.<br />
<br />
A tough issue will invariably have at least two sides to it.  And, both sides will be devoted to their own side.  And many of the partisans on both sides offer many slogans to bolster themselves.  And others will make veiled threats or rumors, such as the talk of "death panels" should healthcare reform come to pass in the United States.<br />
<br />
And both sides can make some valid points.  While one side makes an argument, the other side can also make some points which should cause all of us to ponder.<br />
<br />
Might there be a possibility that a solution is not as immediate and magickal as their slogans make it seem?  Could it be that we are not going to be able to come up with a solution which satisfies all parties?  Could it be that with some civility and some mutual exchanges of respect - we might eventually be able to reach some sort of understanding?  Could civility do more for solving these issues than a million slogans?<br />
<br />
Could be!<br />

            <title>Lessons From Tucson - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, Jan 17, 2011</title>
            <description>I&apos;d feel remiss if I didn&apos;t talk about the shootings in Tucson, Arizona.  As a young child, Tucson and Albuquerque were right up there with Los Angeles as favorite vacation stops where people lived who I loved to see.  And that continued for some time, with an uncle who retired there after spending his life in Duluth.  And my Dad lived in Phoenix, not far away by the standards of folks living in that part of the country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A senseless shooting.  And we have political and other pundits pushing their &quot;magic pill&quot; solutions as if they were going to change anything.  And, someone pointed out the crosshair graphics on one of Sarah Palin&apos;s web site.  And Sarah Palin (whom I and a couple of others refer to as &quot;the Paris Hilton of American politics&quot;) is calling that &quot;blood libel&quot;.  And what&apos;s strange is that both sides of that particular argument don&apos;t recognize their own fallacies!  On the one hand, it would be a rare and exceptional case for someone to go on a shooting rampage because of one web site with crosshairs.  But I would like to point out to Sarah and anyone else willing to listen that while one web site&apos;s graphics can be called one drop in a bucket, it needs to be recognized that if you find a full bucket, the bucket is full of drops!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
President Obama went far beyond the &quot;magic pills&quot; of the various pundits and described what we need, and he did so in terms that most of us can remember understanding as children.  And if we dissect the opposite and how that can happen, and if we look at what caused times to be good in the past, then we can see what needs to be done.  Many will claim it to be difficult, but to folks like you and me, it can be much closer than people think.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, why not let&apos;s see it come to be.  And if the two parts can match and stay matching for a very, very long time.     &lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Looking At The Devil - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, Jan 10, 2011</title>
            <description>We might as well spend some time discussing the subject of &quot;The Devil&quot;, since so many other people do.  In fact, some of them think that folks like you and I who aren&apos;t marching in lock-step on a spiritual path just like theirs must be serving that devil.  What is more, there are some people who obsess so much about their devil, and attribute so much to him that I wonder whom they are actually worshipping!  No kidding!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, let&apos;s take a serious look at who or what this devil might be.  Is there a scriptural basis?  Or a theological basis?  For that matter, what about a logical basis?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And maybe some speculation as to where people are going who get so tied up into such concepts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which is not to say that there are no evil beings, evil people or (especially) evil spirits.  But the question is - who or what are they and what do average folks like you and me need to do about them?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Confronting Evil - In A (very different) Pastor&apos;s Study, Jan 2, 2011</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[For starting off a new year, and a new segment to this show, it seemed appropriate that the first episode might deal with confronting evil.  It's something we all have to face, and it's also something that some of us are sometimes accused of, if for no other reason than the fact that our spiritual path might not be in lock-step with someone else's.<br />
<br />
First off, it's necessary to get some kind of a definition to what we mean by "evil".  I recall one Supreme Court justice, when pressed to define pornography, said "I can't define it, but I know it when I see it."  That's not the only term which defies definition, but I believe that we can do better in this case.  As a beginning, and as one part of the definition, evil most often is a perversion of something which is good by its own nature.<br />
<br />
With that part of the definition, we can see why evil often uses words of righteousness, protection or even love to get its way.<br />
<br />
And then, what do we do?  You won't find the answer to that in this video, but perhaps it will open the way to your own answers.<br />
<br />
We said that this was going to be a segment which deals with issues, and there's a beginning!<br />

            <title>To Be Silent - 4th of 4 (or 5th of 5)</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[You dare - daring is what all magick is about.  You know - because you have to know what you are doing and what you are doing it about.  You will, because your will is your primary source of strength.  And so we come to being silent.  You are silent because that is another source of your strength.<br />
<br />
There can be (and there indeed are) times to speak of what you are doing, but most often, silence serves best.  It's that way with most endeavors.  In the office, at a hobby club, in a church (coven, mosque, or whatever) or most anywhere else, it is so often true that the one who speaks the most is not the one who knows the most.  In fact, often the one who actually does know the most is the quietest of all!<br />
<br />
There are many reasons for keeping silent.  If the person you are doing the magick about is someone who caused harm, their reaction is not going to be supportive of your work - to say the least.  And besides, those who need to atone need to see themselves for themselves.  <br />
<br />
And even if the person is wanting what you are offering, it can often help to not have their emotions get in the way of your work.<br />
<br />
When it works, doubters doubt their doubts.  It happened here recently, and we'll get into that in a later episode of "In A (very different) Pastor's Study", the show that's taking the place of "The sabbat School Class".   <br />

            <title>YULE!  Mass For The Shut-Out December 21, 2010</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[And here is our Yule celebration, our virtual gathering of all of our audience and friends into our virtual chapel for a celebration together!<br />
<br />
And it's as full and real as you will let it be!  We speak of magick, don't we?  So, why not!<br />
<br />
A promise was made at Samhain, and this is the first celebration of the promise's fulfillment.  In the ancient times, when there were no computers or radios, and few other distractions, people noticed nature because they depended upon it.  And they noticed that on a certain day, the sun would stop going away and would begin to return.  And that's Yule (in the Northern Hemisphere).<br />
<br />
The basic tradition is almost universal.  Many paths include the birth of a divine child in this celebration, and the child is destined to do much for us.  But above all else, it is fulfillment.  And those of us who have in the past been forced to deal with such concepts as the so-called "God's will" can celebrate the real will of The Divine - which is our well-being and happiness!<br />
<br />
A promise was made, and it is fulfilled.  There are steps along the way which will lead to the fullness of the fulfillment, but this is the first step.  And this first step in the fulfillment of the promise is what we're celebrating!<br />
<br />
And we celebrate!<br />

            <title>To Will - 4th of 5 (or 3rd of 4)</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[You dare and you know, now is the time to will.  And will you must, because it is the main source of your spiritual strength.  In "The Shootist", John Wayne (in the character of John Bernard Books) spoke about the importance of bing willing as it related to the use of firearms.  It's very similar with "To Will".<br />
<br />
Of course, mention "To Will", and someone will probably think of "God's Will", which has so often been used as a pretext to weaken prayers or to prevent blessings.  And who do those mortals think they are to make pronouncements about Divine Will?  The Will Of The Divine is your happiness and well-being, and don't ever forget that!<br />
<br />
If you don't really want it, don't ask for it.<br />
<br />
Another problem some folks have is that if they get what they want, they don't know what to do next.  Look at what has happened to so many state lottery winners.  So, if you ask for something, be sure you know what to do once you have it!<br />
<br />
And will it!<br />
  <br />
Blessed Be! <br />

            <title>To Know - 2nd of 4 (or 3rd of 5)</title>
            <description>We&apos;re dealing with a logical progression here.  First, there was &quot;To Dare&quot;.  Without that, there wouldn&apos;t even be any effort.  And now, we have &quot;To Know&quot;.  And the progression from daring to knowing should be readily apparent to one and all.  After all, one someone has decided to dare, then it&apos;s necessary to know.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is necessary to know?  Much!  Begin with knowing what you are doing, but there is much more than that which you will want to know.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Go into any Wiccan&apos;s home (or the home of anyone else whose spiritual path is really alive, for that matter, and you&apos;ll probably see a whole lot of books.  If you get a chance to meet a well-published author or a major spiritual leader, the thing that such a person is probably most excited to talk about is what they are learning!  It&apos;s a never-ending process.  There&apos;s a reason why I say that if anyone tells you that they know &quot;all about&quot; any of the subjects I discuss here, walk away very quickly.  There simply is no end to learning - especially here!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>After - Thanksgiving Thanksgiving Mass For The Shut - Out for November 2010</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Thanksgiving Day in the United States was November 25th this year, the fourth Thursday in November - as has been the custom for decades.  So, why are we offering a thanksgiving celebration after Thanksgiving?<br />
<br />
I'm offering some Norse wisdom as scripture, and it says much about this.  Basically, what Odin offers in these quotes from "Sayings Of The High One" are common sense that should be followed all of the time.  And why not the same about Thanksgiving?<br /><br />
Could it be that the lessons to be learned from this holiday deserve to be remembered and honored throughout the year?  Could it be that the very point of the holiday is one which should be celebrated all of the time?<br />
<br />
So often, we are so good about observing holidays and other occasions in their season - and don't apply them the rest of the year!  If you want proof, look at what happens in the secular world as soon as the Christmas season is over and the tree decorations are packed away.<br />
<br />
And so we offer, as with all of the Sabbats on our calendar, a celebration along with something to enjoy the whole year!<br />

            <title>To Dare - 2nd of 5 (or 1st of 4)</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[The second of five in the series, and the first in the "core".  And the very first is simply: To Dare.<br />
<br />
From the time our spiritual life gets beyond rote recital of prayers of the "Now I lay me down to sleep" variety, most of us try to find a spirituality that works.  It works, and preferably it has deities (or a deity) who do something more than keep score on us.<br />
<br />
To get there, it is necessary to try going there.  And, as we've often said, what works for someone else might not be appropriate for you.<br />
<br />
Of course, there will always be the self-appointed theologians who will try to take control of your spiritual life.  If you know the basic boundaries and you are getting to know what works for you, you will (hopefully) be able to know the difference between help and manipulation.<br />
<br />
To Dare - To Know - To Will - To Keep Silence are the four basics, but there is a reason why "To Dare" is the first of the list!<br />
      <br />
Blessed Be! <br />]]>

            <title>Finding Your (Spiritual) Strength - Lesson 27</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[This will be the first of five (at least), subject to interruption by Mass For The Shut Out.  And that's fine, we need that too.  But this is a good topic to look at betwixt Samhain and Yule.<br />
<br />
Did you ever wonder why some do so well spiritually, but for others it seems as if Jesus/The Goddess/Whoever just isn't picking up the voicemail messages?  <br />
<br />
Let's take a look at a reason why this might be.  So many people complain that, where books are concerned there are so many primers and so few advanced texts, but what is an advanced text but a re-hashing of the primers.  And here we go to some of the most basic of basics.<br />
<br />
Know what's here, and you will be more advanced than most.  It is called the "Witches' Pyramid," yet it can be found in any spiritual path where people expect the divine to actually do something in the here and now.<br />
<br />
Four basic principles:  To Dare, To Know, To Will, and To be Silent.<br />
<br />
We need to explore each one, and we will.<br />

            <title>After Samhain And Moving Forward! - Lesson 26</title>
            <description>The time after Samhain can be for us just as much of a let-down as the days following the Christians&apos; Christmas is to them.  After all, the decorations are gone, certain folks no longer feel they need to be nice, and the fstivities are over for another year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then there are the resolutions we made and the decisions made to try something.  And could there possibly be anything more disappointing than the disappointment which comes not from failure to try, but from trying too hard!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&apos;s an especial problem in this day and age with TV, movies and videos.  We saw something work the first time in a movie, so we&apos;re expecting similar results for ourselves - whether we admit it or not.  And so, we try something like scrying and discover that what we have is not quite like that &quot;spiritual TV set&quot; someone had in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, there&apos;s a way to keep the disappointment from being too heavy, and we&apos;re going to discuss that today!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Samhain - And An Opportunity! Mass For The Shut-Out October 31, 2010</title>
            <description>It&apos;s Samhain!  And this year, The Wise Ones&apos; Net (which includes this video podcast as well as the audio podcast &quot;The Secrets In Plain Sight&quot;) have something special to offer - a semi-simulcast!  We think of it as a simulcast because the same ritual is used in both the audio and the video.  But it is not entirely simulcast because each one is done to take advantage of its media&apos;s special abilities.  With audio being so great for imagery, there can be a major celebration in a major temple with people attending from all over.  Meanwhile, the video gives a more intimate ritual among special friends who may have come a long way to be here with us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Either way, it&apos;s Samhain, and we are celebrating.  Not only ends and beginnings, not only the veil between the worlds being at its thinnest, but more.  And it&apos;s what&apos;s more that you might really enjoy.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And as you get into what we&apos;re doing here, you may find yourself discovering something.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This might just be a very powerful ritual - and you&apos;ll find something in it for you - and yes, I mean you!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Approaching Samhain! - Lesson 25</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[At Samhain, the veil between the worlds is at its thinnest.  What an opportunity!<br />
<br />
That is not to say that at other times of the year, the veil is thick and impenetrable.  Quite the contrary, especially if you have some experience!  But, this is the time when the veil is at its thinnest.  Because of that, if you are learning, this is the time when you have the best chances of a positive result.<br />
<br />
And, most of us know someone on the other side of the veil, and most of us know someone there with whom there is infinished business - if only a chance to say goodbye!<br />
<br />
And so, you have a twofold opportunity.  You get to do something with better chances of it working (and gaining experience), and at the same time you can clear up unfinished business!<br />
<br />
Just part of the wonderful nature of Samhain!<br />

            <title>Yuengling: My Proof That It Can Happen - Lesson 24</title>
            <description>Follow any spiritual path, and in almost every case, you&apos;re told about what wonderful things can happen for you!  And after a while, you start to wonder when or if it&apos;s ever going to be your turn.  I was that way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember the story of Pinocchio, the puppet whose maker wanted him to be a real boy?  Imagine a story of a little boy who tried to make his toy doggy real!  And imagine how that little boy would feel to have it actually happen - even if it took until that little boy had become a man of mature years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And there are plenty of books and videos of stories of dogs who wanted a happy home.  Sew the two story lines together, and you have what you&apos;ll be seeing today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It can happen, it does happen, and Yuengling is proof that it works.  And you can make it be your turn.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Apart Or Together?  Or Does Either Matter? - Lesson 23</title>
            <description>Especially among Christians,there is so much emphasis placed on corporate worship that it is sometimes difficult to find a place for individual devotion.  And then there is the person who takes &quot;individual devotion&quot; too far by fantasizing that they are actually worshipping The Divine on a golf course or a fishing trip!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A cynic or someone opposed to religion might make allegations that the purpose of corporate worship is to collect money and perhaps also to keep everyone under observation lest someone &quot;stray.&quot;  But no, corporate worship has its place, as I state in my statement of belief in the Eucharist of Communion we use in Mass For The Shut-Out.  It has a proper place and a good purpose to fulfill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so what is the need for corporate worship?  And what is needed the most?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let&apos;s see and see them in perspective.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>On St Francis Day (no kidding) A Salute To Him And Some Of Our Best Friends - Lesson 22</title>
            <description>In the Roman Catholic and Anglican calendars, October 4th is the Feast of St Francis of Assisi.  A close review of his life can reveal why a Wiccan might have an especial appreciation of St Francis, but we&apos;re not going into that here.  He also had a special friendship with animals, referring to them as &quot;brothers&quot; and &quot;sisters&quot;, and it appears that the relationship was mutual.  And so, this is a good time to honor our special friends who wear fur coats.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&apos;s also a time to introduce Veronica, or newest adoption.  You&apos;ve known Yuengling for some time, especially if you&apos;ve been following &quot;The Secrets In Plain Sight&quot;.  Veronica is Yuengling&apos;s special friend.  Both were rescued from the same shelter, Yuengling about six years before Veronica.  And then there is Thor, the cat who jumped into our car nine years ago.  All of our &quot;fur babies&quot; are either rescued or descended from someone who was rescued.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To a Wiccan, such a four-legged friend might be called a &quot;familiar&quot;, and no wonder - they can be easy to talk to, they understand more than most people give them credit for, and they don&apos;t gossip very much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, let&apos;s take time to celebrate some of the best friends we could possibly have!  &lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be! &lt;br /&gt;</description>

He also had a special friendship with animals, referring to them as &quot;brothers&quot; and &quot;sisters&quot;, and it appears that the relationship was mutual.  And so, this is a good time to honor our special friends who wear fur coats.

It&apos;s also a time to introduce Veronica, or newest adoption.  You&apos;ve known Yuengling for some time, especially if you&apos;ve been following &quot;The Secrets In Plain Sight&quot;.  Veronica is Yuengling&apos;s special friend.  Both were rescued from the same shelter, Yuengling about six years before Veronica.  And then there is Thor, the cat who jumped into our car nine years ago.  All of our &quot;fur babies&quot; are either rescued or descended from someone who was rescued.  

To a Wiccan, such a four-legged friend might be called a &quot;familiar&quot;, and no wonder - they can be easy to talk to, they understand more than most people give them credit for, and they don&apos;t gossip very much.

And so, let&apos;s take time to celebrate some of the best friends we could possibly have!

            <title>Sabbat School Class #21 - About Healings, Thanksgivings and when it works!</title>
            <description>We might as well spend some time discussing the subject of &quot;The Devil&quot;, since so many other people do.  In fact, some of them think that folks like you and I who aren&apos;t marching in lock-step on a spiritual path just like theirs must be serving that devil.  What is more, there are some people who obsess so much about their devil, and attribute so much to him that I wonder whom they are actually worshipping!  No kidding!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, let&apos;s take a serious look at who or what this devil might be.  Is there a scriptural basis?  Or a theological basis?  For that matter, what about a logical basis?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And maybe some speculation as to where people are going who get so tied up into such concepts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which is not to say that there are no evil beings, evil people or (especially) evil spirits.  But the question is - who or what are they and what do average folks like you and me need to do about them?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>A Mabon Celebration on Mass For The Shut-Out, September 21, 2010</title>
            <description>It is time to celebrate Mabon!  The second of three harvest Sabbats, it is a good time to give thanks for all that The Divine has provided us!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, we need to understand that there are those less fortunate, and some of them will feel abandoned by The Divine.  It can happen, and it does.  It even happened to me.  Are you surprised?  I&apos;m not surprised that it could have happened to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One basic truth about the mundane world is the fact that no matter how terrible you consider your lot in life, there might well be someone whose own lot is worse than yours.  And here I will share a story I found about some people who had been through a situation much worse than any I&apos;ve experienced.  And what they discovered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And there seems to be a basic principle here: giving thanks for what you do have increases your chances for even more!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Sabbat School Class #20 - What Bread And Wine Can Do!</title>
            <description>Let&apos;s take a look at one recurring theme in the story of religion, that being the things that can be done spiritually with bread and wine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One I am sure you have heard of, but the Christian Communion/Mass has many predecessors, and predecessors by thousands of years.  Passover begins by breaking bread and finishes with a cup of wine.  But even before that there is the story of the patriarch Abram (who became Abraham) who led a military expedition to rescue his nephew Lot.  When he returned in victory, he was met by a priest named Melchizidek who brought bread and wine.  Melchizidek was a priest in the manner of many priests today, that being that he was a priest who had a &quot;day job&quot; (as King of Salem).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bread and wine can be used at many levels, including a version which many Wiccans enjoy.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And why not!&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>For this episode, let&apos;s look at the basics of designing a ritual.  In fact, let&apos;s get to the most basic of basics in how a ritual is put together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whether it is your wake-up devotions in the morning, the Lesser Banishing Ritual Of The Pentagram, or a large formal ritual with much fomality, the basic composition is the same.  And that even holds true if you&apos;re talking about a ritual which can stand on its own or be part of a larger ritual.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Sabbat School Class #18 - Healing!</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[When you or someone you love needs healing, healing becomes the most important thing to you.  So, we need to take some time to speak about healing.<br />
<br />
And if it's that important (and it is), then it would be a good idea to look at what is the most important part of healing from a spiritual viewpoint.<br />
<br />
Yes, healing might require the assistance of doctors, medicines and perhaps even surgery, but most medical professionals are coming to understand the power of the spiritual where healing is concerned.<br />
<br />
There is indeed a way that the best of modern medical science can be rendered useless, but it is also the same way that amazig healings can happen which make the most skepcial of medics take notice!  The difference is the way in which that way is employed.<br />
<br />
So, let's see where we can find that secret.  And yes, it is within your grasp when you or someone you care about has the need!<br />

And it would be wonderful if we could each have a private chapel for such a purpose, but it often doesn&apos;t work out that way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes, the most private place you have is shared with a sibling.  Or perhaps it is shared with 85 fellow soldiers, or a fellow student.  And even if you have a place of your own, figuring out a place can be a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Mass For The Shut-out Celebrating The Life Of Isaac Bonewits, August 15, 2010</title>
            <description>Where Isaac Bonewits is concerned, those who do not know who he is will come to know who he was.  Simply put, we have not seen or heard the last of that man.  Even if he crossed over on August 12, 2010, he inspired and encouraged so many people in so many ways that his presence will be here for a very long time.  Given the number of his early predictions which were initially scoffed but later earned credence, it is my estimate that his living legacy is guaranteed at least a century of active presence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He forged paths when the rest of us didn&apos;t even know that there might be new paths to forge.  And his encouragement of others is a matter of record, including how he encouraged me.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so we celebrate the life of Isaac Bonewits.  Bard, Archdruid, Priest, Teacher, Author, and so much more.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Sabbat School Class #16 - Your Prayer Life - Totally Personal</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[This is a personal and sensitive subject.  Many people will claim that it's your own business, and then add the "but" which is their fair warning to you that they are going to make it their business.  But it is indeed your business.<br />
<br />
There is a verse in the Christian Bible that sums up some of the best advice, even if some might not remember that it's there.<br />
<br />
But it is also the one assured constant in your spiritual life.  Time and circumstance might keep you from making it to gatherings or doing rituals on the schedule that you might like, but your prayer life can be tailored to whatever you need.<br />
<br />
A dear friend who is a Roman Catholic priest once told of a retreat just before his ordination where he was told to jealously guard his prayer life, because his ministry would go or grow with it.  I can cite many examples of how this has been proven over the centuries.<br />
<br />
And here are some ideas of where to look for what you need to make it grow!<br />

            <title>Sabbat School Class #15 - Pennies From Heaven?  Seeing Magick!</title>
            <description>I&apos;m using something I found written by an advice columnist, and using that as a jumping-off point.  I never was a particular fan of hers, and for a reason, but this time she found something that I actually found useful.  And, it brought to life a saying that I&apos;ve heard since I was a child.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part of reason for this lesson is to share with you something which you can try and see if it works for you as well as it does for me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The other part is to give you some ideas where and how you can look to see magick actually happening.  Yes, magick does happen.  There are some of you who know this well, and there are others who are still hoping to see something happen.  This will give you some insight into where and how to look.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be! &lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>Lammas, Celebrating Fulfillment - Mass For The Shut-out, August 1, 2010</title>
            <description>In the Havamal, there is a passage warning about harvesting a field too soon or trusting a son too early.  And, isn&apos;t that something we see today?  Wee see iussues of children not allowed to be children because of parents&apos; focus on over-achievmanet as but one example.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lesson here is that the harvest is due when it is fulfilled.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many of us have faced a cop-out line that people use when talking about &quot;God&apos;s time.&quot;  And it seems strange that the same god who supposedly created the universe in six days (and then took the seventh off) couldn&apos;t work faster on our needs!  Well, here we have a basic working definition of what is meant by &quot;in God&apos;s time&quot; (or the time of any other gods, goddesses, or other deities).  Their time is the right time for it to be.  That&apos;s all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But it&apos;s important for us to know to keep our perspective.  And it also is a perspective that your Sunday school teacher never knew about.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Sabbat School Class, Lesson 14 - Divination: Depth</title>
            <description>For this third of three, I&apos;m going to discuss depth.  You&apos;ve heard me mention depth before, and it&apos;s important in divination!  What is depth?  In the case of making food, it&apos;s the difference between the person who cooks hamburgers at a fast-food burger place and the chef at a five-star restaurant.  The fast-food burger-flipper follow instructions.  The chef knows the ingredients and their interactions well enough to be able to create something new.  In divination, depth is the abiity to go beyond what you learn from a book or a teacher to being able to see for yourself, and preferably at several levels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It can apply to any form of divination.  I&apos;ve seen it in Runes, I&apos;ve seen it in my pendulum, and it is obvious in Tarot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let&apos;s look at a couple favorites of mine and see what comes immediately to mind.  And then, you can see what else you can find!&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>This has to do with divination, and it also has to do with almost everything else you might want to do.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When you set out to learn something, one if the first things you need to do is to find out who to learn from.  Unfortunately, this is a field of endeavor in which many people will offer some opinons and many will offer to teach you, but who among them is worth learning from?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So, here we&apos;ll look at that and see what you can do to find someone worth learning from.&lt;br&gt;

            <title>July 4, 2010 - Betwixt Litha and Lammas, a lesson from all of the Sabbats</title>
            <description>Betwixt Litha and Lammas, a lesson from all of the Sabbats.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Technical issues prevented a Litha celebration, but here is a celebration to make up for that and perhaps even more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And there is a lesson to offer here which applies to all Sabbats and to life in general. Did you ever notice that in the Wheel Of The Year, there each Sabbat is opposite a counterpart Sabbat? Litha is opposite Yule, and Lammas is directly opposite Imbolc, as two examples. And this has a special meaning for us. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If the lessons of all of the Sabbats were to be summarized in one word, that word would be: &quot;Fulfillment&quot;. The Divine&apos;s promises are kept. There is no question of The Divine&apos;s will, The Divine&apos;s time, or any so-called &quot;higher plan&quot;. Simply put, The Divine&apos;s promises are kept. This offers comfort and healing to some of us, and assurance to all of us. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, let&apos;s celebrate!&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>
                <![CDATA[There is much to be said about divination and indeed much is being said, and much has been written.  And sometimes it seems so muc that it's hard to tell where to begin, especially if you are a beginner.<br /><br />

            <title>May 31, 2010 - Memorial Day On Mass For The Shut Out - Honoring Our Fallen Warriors</title>
            <description>Today in the United States is Memorial Day, the day we set aside each year to honor those who have fallen in the service of their country&apos;s armed forces.  We also add to them those veterans who returned who have now also answered the call to cross the bridge to the other side of The Veil.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every country has a time to honor such fallen heroes, and I take time to honor them all, including those of other countries and even those who fought against the United States.  After all, they were serving their country.  And what better reconciliation?  Especially if their country and mine are friends now!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But especially, I take time to honor those who fell in a uniform similar to, or a predecessor of, one which I wore.  I would have gone onto the battlefield, but somehow I got chosen for a desk in Illinois during the Vietnam conflict.  But I can name names of friends who went and did not return.  And many of you can name friends, relatives and loved ones you&apos;ll wish to honor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, we are here for that on Memorial Day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Sabbat School Class, Lesson 11: A Law Of Laws?</title>
            <description>The Law Of One is something which I find comforting.  When I show it to you and explain its comfort, you&apos;ll understand why.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I discovered it when I joined the Universal Gnostic Fellowship.  It is indeed comforting, because it gives me reasons to understand why my path can be right for me, even if it might be inappropriate for someone else.  It also clarifies some aspect which are often misunderstood by some, and outright confused about by others.  And if we understand that our understanding is limited to, at the most, one small part of one small corner of infinity, then The Law Of One helps to bring more sense to the discussion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, let&apos;s see what this has to offer.  It offers me a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Beltaine has a special meaning.  The meaning is particularly special for those of us who have spent too much time in our lives hearing about &quot;God&apos;s will&quot;, &quot;God&apos;s time,&quot; or &quot;God&apos;s higher plan.&quot;  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beltaine is not only the celebration but the actual fulfillment of the promise made at Samhain!  Remember, at Samhain, the god died, but there was a promise of his return.  He was born at Yule, and at Imbolc and Ostara we celebrated his growth, but at Beltaine we celebrate his coming of full age.  In ancient societies, June brides became soemthign special because it followed may when the deities married.  And so, if Ostara was a Bar Mitzvah, Beltaine is the wedding feast.  It is worth noting that in many traditional societies, it was at the wedding that the young man stepped forth on his own, and that is what we have here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But there is also the fulfillment.  The god&apos;s will is our happiness and health.  The god&apos;s time is when it is fulfilled.  And the higher plan is for all of us to learn, prosper and grow.&lt;br /&gt;
And that is Beltaine&apos;s gift for us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Sabbat School Class, Lesson 10: What About You?</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[There is one question which almost everyone who has any desire for the spiritual has probably asked at least once, and I asked it many times.  You hear about someone else's spiritual experience and, unless you are already having equal experiences, the natural tendency is to ask that question: "What about me?"<br />
<br />
It's only natural to want such experience, and it's to be expected that you might wonder why it can happen for someone else but not you.  But why can't it happen for you?<br />
<br />
There's a story that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart sat down at a harpsichord at age six and immediately began playing what became known as the Minuet In G.  Well, if that story is true, that was Mozart, not Aidan Odinson and not you, either.  If either of us were to sit at such a keyboard and begin to attempt music, most folks would probably suggest that we take music lessons.<br />
<br />
Music lessons are simply mentored practice sessions which occur in between series of our own practice sessions where we make music which gradually sounds more musical.  <br />
<br />
While we might not need mentored practice sessions in spirituality, there are things we can do to help ourselves, beginning with our visualizations.  And from there, much can happen.<br /><br />

Blessed Be!

            <title>March 21, 2010 - Ostara Celebration On Mass For The Shut Out</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Ostara is here!  And it's about time!<br />
<br />
If your winter was like it was here, I know you agree with me that this past winter is good to have in our past.  And that makes this Ostara seem more than some others as being shedding winter's yoke.<br />
<br />
And there is more!  Every spiritual path has a story similar to the one the Norse have of the return of Baldur to lead the world after Odin's death.  <br />
<br />
Ostara is one sabbat in the wheel of the year.  And if you were to map out the sabbats since last Samhain in terms of human rites of passsage, Yule would be the birth, Imbolc would be the Briss, and Ostara the Bar Mitzvah.  And so now the young god is ready to begin his real learning and the work of his life.<br />
<br />
And could this be a lesson for us?  <br />
<br />
You'll see - here.<br />

            <title>The Sabbat School Class, Lesson 9: Ostara and Ragnarok</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Ostara is coming soon.  And looking at Ostara, I looked at The Prophecy Of The Sybill from the Ancient Norse.  <br />
<br />
One of the special things that happens at Ragnarok is that Odin's son Baldur returns from the dead.  Not only that, but Baldur rules following his father's death at Ragnarok.  There is also mention of a great hall built, where the deserving will live happily until the end of time.  Does that sound familiar?<br />
<br />
If you've explored other spiritual paths, you'll be familiar with the story of a god's son who dies and will return when the so-called end-times have arrived.  It's especially well-known among the Christians but even if they like to think they have an exclusive on that, they don't.<br />
<br />
So, what can be said about two stories sounding so similar but they were created so long ago and so far apart that it is unlikely that the originating cultures had much awareness of each other.<br />
<br />
And this brings us to one more thing we can learn from Ostara<br />

            <title>February 20, 2010 - Mass For The Shut-Out In Honor of Tempest Smith</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Tempest Kayne Smith died on February 20, 2001.  She had been the victim of religious harassment and bullying.  It was after her diary was discovered that people learned the extent and severity of the bullying she was put through.<br />
<br />
Sticks and stones might break our bones, but those are wounds which can heal.  The wounds caused by words are not so easy to heal, and sometimes it seems that they just don't heal.<br />
<br />
I won't criticize Tempest for how she died or anything about her death.  I have enough memories of my own life at age twelve to know better than to "Monday morning quarterback".     <br />
<br />
In the United States of America, people claim that there is religious freedom.  It didn't work that way for her - and the last I heard, Lincoln Park, Michigan is within the United States.  And we've heard enough about bullying, including a recent case in Seattle in which police refused to help a young woman who knew she was in danger, and then so-called security guards stood around and watched as she was beaten.<br />
<br />
Tempest Smith's classmates, the ones who should have been her friends, wrote many apologies which were on display at her funeral.  <br />
<br />
I see her as a martyr.  I also see her as a patron for religious freedom and for victims of bullying.<br />

            <title>The Sabbat School Class, Lesson 8: Thinking about Tempest Smith Day coming</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[Tempest Smith Day is February 20th.<br />
<br />
Tempest Kayne Smith was intelligent and creative.  She played the flute, wrote poetry, and sometimes showed an intelligence and sensitivity beyond that normally associated with someone her age.  She died on February 20, 2001.<br />
<br />
She died by her own hand, after the harassment, taunts and teasing by her classmates had become such torment that she could take no more.  They harassed her because she was a Wiccan.  She was a Wiccan by her own choice.  <br />
<br />
After she passed, a diary was found in which she wrote about the daily torments.  Crowds of her classmates singing "Jesus loves you" at her were among the few that I can describe here and retain my "general audiences" rating.  <br />
<br />
And this was in a school in the United States, where schoolteachers talk about how the United States has religious freedom.  It somehow did not work that way for Tempest Smith.<br />
<br />
And so, we commemorate her.  And think of the others like her whom we might not know about.  And so that we can resolve that it not happen again.<br />

            <title>February 2, 2010 - Mass For The Shut-Out - Imbolc Celebration!</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[It's time to celebrate Imbolc!<br />
<br />
Inbolc is one of the least-known but most-worthwhile celebrations in the cycle of the year, especially because of the fact that it is a fulfillment of the promise made at Samhain.<br />
<br />
Remember Samhain?  At that time, there was a death but also the promise that an ending by definition means a new beginning, and that new beginning was promised to us!  At Yule, what we see as the sun beginning its return journey is marked appropriately in many spiritual paths by the celebration of the birth of a divine child.  <br />
<br />
For a child born at Yule, we could see Imbolc as the naming done in some paths, or the Briss in the Jewish tradition.  In the mundane world, Imbolc's coming is announced by the first plants sticking their fresh sprouts through the snow, and the animals who were cared for over the winter giving birth.<br />
<br />
Above all, it is another fulfillment of the promise made by The Divine, on the way to the complete fulfillment shared by Ostara and Beltaine.  <br />
<br />

            <description>
                <![CDATA[And this time, you'll be given sone "homework" which can begins some discovery for you!<br />
<br />
We just finished Yule, and Imbolc is about a month away.  While there are many times when it is appropriate to step back and look at the full perspective, we find ourselves at a time when it is especially appropriate.<br />
<br />
Yule is still alive in our memory, Imbolc is coming, and if you look, you can see Ostara and Beltane on your horizon.<br />
<br />
Anyone who has gone beyond even pre-dedicant training as a Wiccan or Pagan will be able to relate those Sabbats to the cycle of life, so that's a no-brainer.  But let's take it a step further.  How do those Sabbats relate to rites of passage of other spiritual paths?<br />
<br />
You'll see, and then there'll be an opportunity to see for yourself!<br />

            <itunes:subtitle>The Sabbat School Class, Lesson 7: Where We Meet!</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>And this time, you&apos;ll be given sone &quot;homework&quot; which can begins some discovery for you!

We just finished Yule, and Imbolc is about a month away.  While there are many times when it is appropriate to step back and look at the full perspective, we find ourselves at a time when it is especially appropriate.

Yule is still alive in our memory, Imbolc is coming, and if you look, you can see Ostara and Beltane on your horizon.

Anyone who has gone beyond even pre-dedicant training as a Wiccan or Pagan will be able to relate those Sabbats to the cycle of life, so that&apos;s a no-brainer.  But let&apos;s take it a step further.  How do those Sabbats relate to rites of passage of other spiritual paths?

You&apos;ll see, and then there&apos;ll be an opportunity to see for yourself!

            <title>December 21, 2009: Mass For The Shut-Out - Celebrating Yule!</title>
            <description>It is time to celebrate Yule!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yule is indeed just possibly the most primary and basic of all of the Sabbats, and almost every spiritual path has a celebration at the time of the Winter Solstice which has the basic theme of a new birth, and especially a divine birth.  Even Hannukah can be seen that way, if you understand it as the re-opening and re-consecration of the Temple at Jerusalem after the exile in Babylon.  In fact, there indeed is a re-birth after what some had thought was a death.  And that&apos;s the original idea.  Yule was when the sun stopped its rertreat away from us and began its return journey and with it the promise of another spring and summer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I see the birth at Yule as being Samhain&apos;s gift.  It&apos;s much the same was as what a seed does in order to become a tree.  And so, there is new life, and a new promise. &lt;br /&gt;
And that&apos;s what Yule is giving us.  The beginning of the fulfillment of the promise made at Samhain.&lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be!&lt;br /&gt;</description>

            <title>The Sabbat School Class, Lesson 6: A Yule Gift - Something You Can Actually Do!</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[This lesson is one that you might see as being a Yule gift.<br />
<br />
One of the most often-asked questions where spiritual matters are concerned is the basic question of what can you do.  People spend a major part of their lives searching for something to do about whatever concerns them, and here is an offering for you which might help.<br />
<br />
Between the spiritually walking wounded, those who have come to realize that what they were taught doesn't seem to work anymore, and those who simply want to see if there is anything more, there are enough people to fill many churches and keep many  clergy very busy.  The problem is helping them find the answers which they seek, and everyone's answers are unique to that person.<br />
<br />
To borrow from the jargon of systems analysts and MBA's, what's needed is to "think outside of the box".<br />
<br />
And that's what we're discussing here.<br />
<br />
Blessed Be!<br />]]>

            <description>Samhain is over, Yule is coming, and there is a special lesson which applies now&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Actually, it applies anytime but especially now.  At Samhain, there was an end, but also a beginning.  And anyone who has been a parent will remember that the time between discovering that you&apos;re going to be parents and the arrival of the child is filled with preparations for that child&apos;s arrival.  And why not now as well?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Add to that, one of the most empowering of any scriptures, the Gospel of Thomas.  No wonder it didn&apos;t make it into the list of books accepted by mainstream Christianity - it&apos;s too empowering for most of them to handle!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And look where it says to look!&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Sabbat School Class, Lesson 5: Things To Do With Bread And Wine</title>
            <description>And here, perhaps, you&apos;ll find some answers as to what I&apos;m doing in Mass For The Shut-Out, and more importantly, how you can apply them in what you do spiritually.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The roots go beyond Crowley&apos;s Gnostic Mass, The Mass, Passover Seder, or Cakes and Ale.  One of the most ancient references is in the Old Testament, in Genesis when Melchizidek, who was both a king and a priest, met Abram (not Abraham yet) and greeted him with bread and wine.  And that tells us that bread and wine must have been a well-established custom by that time, which we would know as the Bronze Age.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&apos;s also worth noting that in so many of the rites based on bread and wine, the Pagan/Wiccan aspects are there for anyone with the knowledge of where to look and the wisdom to know what to acknowledge.  Anyone want to guess why a Roman Catholic priest makes the sign of the cross over the chalice?  Might it harken back to the days when a Norse Vitki or Ghodi (or Vitka or Ghoda) would make the sign of Thor&apos;s Hammer over a similar vessel (or a drinking horn, for that matter)?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So much to explore, and so much to learn.  And you can put it all to use for your own benefit, too!  Enjoy this exploration!&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>For me, Samhain is perhaps the most significant of the Sabbats, even if it is not considered to be a &quot;minor Sabbat&quot; in that it is not one of the four solstice/equinox points.  This is the Celtic New Year, and also, according to tradition, the time when the veil between the worlds is at its thinnest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And, there is more.  Let&apos;s see how to make this Samhain special for you, personally.</description>

            <description>The Archangel Uriel is special to me, for a number of reasons.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One is that she represents the fulfillment of so much of what I was seeking when I first came here.  And hence the name of this place in cyberspace.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And today, we dedicate a statue to the Archangel Uriel.  &lt;br /&gt;

            <title>The Sabbat School Class, Lesson 3: Priesthood Is A State Of Being!</title>
            <description>If you can imagine how difficult it would be to keep a fish comfortable, healthy and happy out of water, then you can imagine the intensity of a call to priesthood.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&apos;s why I&apos;m known to say that priesthood is a state of being.  Those who think of it was a job are missing the point.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here, I re-visit an essay I published a few  years ago, and I discover that the only changes I would make if I were to write it today are updating a couple of details in light of some historical developments among those still in the path I felt forced to leave.</description>

            <title>September 5, 2009: Mass For The Shut-Out - A dedication and a celebration</title>
            <description>I was invited to join the House of Independent Bishops, and of course I accepted.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And what is a Wiccan doing among a bunch of bishops?  Quite a lot, actually!  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The title &quot;High Priest&quot; is sufficient to be considered to be the equivalent of a bishop, and it also means that I can begin to build my omni-denominational ministry in that direction.  In addition to naming The Virtual Mission Chapel Of The Archangel Uriel as a cathedral (even if the &quot;cathedra&quot; is a folding chair), there also can be The Diocese Of The Archangel Uriel, which has no borders and also has no denominations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A tavern, where the spiritually thirsty may drink.  A diner, where the spiritually starving may be fed.  A hospital, where the spiritually wounded are healed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&apos;s what this is all about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be!</description>

            <itunes:subtitle>September 5, 2009: Mass For The Shut-Out - A dedication and a celebration</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>I was invited to join the House of Independent Bishops, and of course I accepted.  

And what is a Wiccan doing among a bunch of bishops?  Quite a lot, actually!  

The title &quot;High Priest&quot; is sufficient to be considered to be the equivalent of a bishop, and it also means that I can begin to build my omni-denominational ministry in that direction.  In addition to naming The Virtual Mission Chapel Of The Archangel Uriel as a cathedral (even if the &quot;cathedra&quot; is a folding chair), there also can be The Diocese Of The Archangel Uriel, which has no borders and also has no denominations.

A tavern, where the spiritually thirsty may drink.  A diner, where the spiritually starving may be fed.  A hospital, where the spiritually wounded are healed.

That&apos;s what this is all about.

Blessed Be!</itunes:summary>

            <title>The Sabbat School Class, Lesson 2 - One Of The Most Basic Of Basics</title>
            <description>And what would be the most basic of basics that you or I would need to know?  Perhaps a step so basic that some forget to even acknowledge it.  True, it is mentioned in every primer, and even some other paths will give it some sort of recognition, but few make it a principle.  Perhaps it seems so basic.  But those things which seem so obvious are often overlooked because of the presumption that being obvious would mean that it would be recognized on a regular basis.&lt;br /&gt;
In the Universal Gnostic Fellowship, it is codified as The Law Of One, and I&apos;d like to take a moment to offer it to you as a way to keep doors open.&lt;br /&gt;
You might be surprised at how much of a help it can be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blessed Be!</description>

            <description>Taking a moment between Litha and Lammas to look at where we are, where we have been, and where we are going.  As we&apos;ve said before, a Sabbat is never really &quot;over&quot; until the Wheel of the Year turns to that Sabbat of the next year.</description>

            <description>How Much Should It Cost?  This is a question which every newcomer asks in one way or another.  Expensive tools can be attractive, but are they any more effective?  And why?</description>

            <title>February 20, 2009 - Mass For The Shut-out in honor of Tempest Smith</title>
            <description>Tempest Kayne Smith died on February 20, 2001.  She died at the age of twelve years old.  She died as a direct result of the religious harassment she received from her school-mates.  This did not happen in some third-world country, but in Lincoln Park, Michigan USA.  This Eucharist is offered in her honor in hopes of the day when freedom of religion actually includes all religions.</description>
