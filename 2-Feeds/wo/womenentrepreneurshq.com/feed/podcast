<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>What is this guest reading?</strong></span></p>
<p>During one of my meditation sessions I came up with the idea of asking my guests for the title of the latest books they were reading.</p>
<p>Most successful people keep learning &amp; growing every single day and reading success and personal development books is one of the best ways!</p>
<p>Darren Hardy, Publisher of Success Magazine, reads a book for 30 minutes each and every day.</p>
<p>Marie Diamond (Quantum Physics expert, Feng Shui Master, and star of the movie The Secret), who I interviewed recently revealed that she reads 5 books each and EVERY WEEK AND she has three kids!</p>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Here’s what today’s guest is reading now:</em></p>
<p>Doug’s latest read is:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594484430/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=luxlife-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1594484430"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=1594484430&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=luxlife-20&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" border="0" alt=" Doug Bench "  title="Doug Bench " /></a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=luxlife-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1594484430" border="0" alt=" Doug Bench " width="1" height="1" title="Doug Bench " /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594484430/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=luxlife-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1594484430">Think Smart: A Neuroscientist's Prescription for Improving Your Brain's Performance</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=luxlife-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1594484430" border="0" alt=" Doug Bench " width="1" height="1" title="Doug Bench " /> by Dr Richard Restak</p>
<p><strong>Which book has had the biggest impact on your life?</strong></p>
<p>Most successful people will tell you that at some point in their lives, they’ve read that “ONE” book that changed everything in their lives.</p>
<p>Would it not be really amazing to be able to find out which books those successful women (and men) read that had such a strong impact on the course of their lives so you could also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">read that same book</span> and experience great changes in your journey?</p>
<p>Well, I’ve asked my guests to share the book that had the biggest impact on their lives with my audience.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll make sure to add this new title to your book repertoire! If you’ve already read that title, I’d invite you to read it again!!!</p>
<p><strong><em>Here’s our guest’s answer when asked about his Big Impact Book:</em></strong></p>
<p>Doug’s Big Impact books are:</p>

<p>David is the dynamic host of one of the first business online video shows on the Internet!</p>
<p>Each week David interviews successful entrepreneurs on Rise to the Top!</p>
<p>David’s online video channel is very meaningful to me because it was the inspiration behind what I’m doing currently.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon his site in March of 2011 and realized what was possible!</p>
<p>Well, 150 later and two online videos shows under my belt (a third one launching soon), I can assure that David has been a huge influence in my life and continues to be.</p>
<p>When I made the decision to move forward with my online show, I had to spend hours on David’s site learning how he conducted his interviews, the types of questions he asked and how to engage with both the guest and the audience.</p>
<p>If you’ve wanted to add video interviews to your marketing arsenal or if you’ve been dreaming of becoming the next Piers Morgan of the smashing hit Piers Morgan Tonight, the new CNN anchor replacing Larry King and the Larry King Live Show, you’ll want to get your hands on David’s new course.</p>
<p>Create Awesome Interviews spells out everything you need to know about creating a video show that can allow you to create the kind of success David has created for his own business!</p>

David is the dynamic host of one of the first business online video shows on the Internet!

Each week David interviews successful entrepreneurs on Rise to the Top!

David’s online video channel is very meaningful to me because it was the inspiration behind what I’m doing currently.

I stumbled upon his site in March of 2011 and realized what was possible!</itunes:summary>

<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>What is this guest reading?</strong></span></p>
<p>During one of my meditation sessions I came up with the idea of asking my guests for the title of the latest books they were reading.</p>
<p>Most successful people keep learning &amp; growing every single day and reading success and personal development books is one of the best ways!</p>
<p>Darren Hardy, Publisher of Success Magazine, reads a book for 30 minutes each and every day.</p>
<p>Marie Diamond (Quantum Physics expert, Feng Shui Master, and star of the movie The Secret), who I interviewed recently revealed that she reads 5 books each and EVERY WEEK AND she has three kids!</p>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Here’s what today’s guest is reading now:</em></p>
<p>Doug’s latest read is:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594484430/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=luxlife-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1594484430"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=1594484430&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=luxlife-20&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" border="0" alt=" Doug Bench | Can brain science help boost your productivity & income?"  title="Doug Bench | Can brain science help boost your productivity & income?" /></a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=luxlife-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1594484430" border="0" alt=" Doug Bench | Can brain science help boost your productivity & income?" width="1" height="1" title="Doug Bench | Can brain science help boost your productivity & income?" /></p>

<p><strong>Which book has had the biggest impact on your life?</strong></p>
<p>Most successful people will tell you that at some point in their lives, they’ve read that “ONE” book that changed everything in their lives.</p>
<p>Would it not be really amazing to be able to find out which books those successful women (and men) read that had such a strong impact on the course of their lives so you could also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">read that same book</span> and experience great changes in your journey?</p>
<p>Well, I’ve asked my guests to share the book that had the biggest impact on their lives with my audience.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll make sure to add this new title to your book repertoire! If you’ve already read that title, I’d invite you to read it again!!!</p>
<p><strong><em>Here’s our guest’s answer when asked about his Big Impact Book:</em></strong></p>
<p>Doug’s Big Impact books are:</p>

<p>I asked her if she’d be willing to share that experience on camera and that marked the first interview with Carol and the first I saw her beautiful face.</p>
<p>In late 2011, Carol reached out again on Facebook to let me know of her health struggle – breast cancer. I was quite floored because she was the picture of health and she was a Fitness Professional. I’ve kept in touch with Carol as much I could and referred her to a people who could help.</p>
<p>Cancer is the kind of news that makes you feel powerless in helping others.</p>
<p>A few months ago Carol reached out again with the reality of dealing with breast cancer in the U.S. and the financial burden it has left on her family.</p>
<p>I suggested we take her story to the widest possible audience to see how she can get the support she needs – that’s why we decided to get on camera to share Carol’s story of courage.</p>
<p>In this short video, Carol explains how you can help.</p>
<p><strong>****PLEASE SHARE THIS POST TO AS MANY PEOPLE AS YOU CAN****</strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<strong><em>Women Entrepreneurs HQ Episode105 (WEHQ 105)</em></strong>

I first met Flow Coach, Oren Harris, in L.A. in May 2011.

A mutual friend asked Oren to come by and spend time with me.

The question I had for Oren was “how do I get rid of all negative thoughts”?

It was driving me nuts that I knew I needed to vibrate at a high level in order to take my business to where I wanted it to be and I kept fighting these negative thoughts that were creeping up and telling “there’s no way you’ll be able to do that”.]]></description>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Prefer audio? Brilliant! Click below to list to the MP3:</p>
<p>I first met Flow Coach, Oren Harris, in L.A. in May 2011.</p>
<p>A mutual friend asked Oren to come by and spend time with me.</p>
<p>The question I had for Oren was “how do I get rid of all negative thoughts”?</p>
<p>It was driving me nuts that I knew I needed to vibrate at a high level in order to take my business to where I wanted it to be and I kept fighting these negative thoughts that were creeping up and telling “there’s no way you’ll be able to do that”.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that I had attended a service at the Agape spiritual centre and Rev. Michael Beckwith explained that more and more people were afraid of their thoughts – especially if they have any negative ones.</p>
<p>So I wanted to know if it was bad to have negative thoughts?</p>
<p>My hour with Oren was such an eye-opening experience because I understood that thoughts, words and feelings are three different dimensions of manifesting the life and business of my dreams.</p>
<p>I asked Oren to come on the show and share that with others who might be fighting or resisting the fact they have negative emotions and might think it’s a bad thing.</p>
<p>The reality is that few people walk around with all positive thoughts, that’s just not being human.</p>
<p>Oren reveals the secret and correlation between our thoughts, words and feelings!</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>What women entrepreneurs will learn from this insightful interview?</em></strong></span></p>
<p>Oren has a large client base of extremely successful women and he explains why they come to him to remain in the flow in order to manifest everything they desire for their lives and businesses!</p>

<p>Oren Harris is a Life Transformation Coach and Flow Master!</p>
<p>He has helped thousands of people transform their lives. He currently mentors spiritual and personal development leaders, business visionaries, high performance athletes, and those who are ready to harness the incredible power of THE FLOW.</p>
<p>Oren helps people transform their lives by facilitating a direct flow experience for them, which they can then learn to recreate in any situation. Despite his impressive accolades and accomplishments, his greatest asset is the living of his message!</p>
<p>As a speaker, Oren has worked closely with many authors and speakers such as Neale Donald Walsh, Dr. Demartini, and Dr. Dennis Waitley, who all appeared in the ground breaking DVD, The Secret.</p>
<p>He has a way of taking universal truths that can be difficult for the mind to understand and communicating them in a way that is profoundly simply and applicable to life. Even more impactful than the words, is the space that he holds that allows individuals to have an experience that goes beyond understanding and belief into KNOWING.</p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; Connect with Oren Harris (don’t forget to mention you saw it on Women Entrepreneurs HQ!):</strong></p>
<p>The best way to connect with Oren is via his website: <span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: yellow;"><strong><a title="women-entrepreneurs-oren-harris" href="http://orenharris.com" target="_blank">Oren Harris</a></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>What is this guest reading?</strong></span></p>
<p>During one of my meditation sessions I came up with the idea of asking my guests for the title of the latest books they were reading.</p>
<p>Most successful people keep learning &amp; growing every single day and reading success and personal development books is one of the best ways!</p>
<p>Darren Hardy, Publisher of Success Magazine, reads a book for 30 minutes each and every day.</p>
<p>Marie Diamond (Quantum Physics expert, Feng Shui Master, and star of the movie The Secret), who I interviewed recently revealed that she reads 5 books each and EVERY WEEK AND she has three kids!</p>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Here’s what today’s guest is reading now:</em></p>
<p>Oren’s latest read is:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582702152/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=luxlife-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1582702152"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=1582702152&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=luxlife-20&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" border="0" alt=" Oren Harris | Getting rid of negative thoughts?"  title="Oren Harris | Getting rid of negative thoughts?" /></a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=luxlife-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1582702152" border="0" alt=" Oren Harris | Getting rid of negative thoughts?" width="1" height="1" title="Oren Harris | Getting rid of negative thoughts?" /></p>

<p><strong>Which book has had the biggest impact on your life?</strong></p>
<p>Most successful people will tell you that at some point in their lives, they’ve read that “ONE” book that changed everything in their lives.</p>
<p>Would it not be really amazing to be able to find out which books those successful women (and men) read that had such a strong impact on the course of their lives so you could also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">read that same book</span> and experience great changes in your journey?</p>
<p>Well, I’ve asked my guests to share the book that had the biggest impact on their lives with my audience.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll make sure to add this new title to your book repertoire! If you’ve already read that title, I’d invite you to read it again!!!</p>
<p><strong><em>Here’s our guest’s answer when asked about his Big Impact Book:</em></strong></p>
<p>Oren’s Big Impact books are:</p>

I first met Flow Coach, Oren Harris, in L.A. in May 2011.

A mutual friend asked Oren to come by and spend time with me.

The question I had for Oren was “how do I get rid of all negative thoughts”?

It was driving me nuts that I knew I needed to vibrate at a high level in order to take my business to where I wanted it to be and I kept fighting these negative thoughts that were creeping up and telling “there’s no way you’ll be able to do that”.</itunes:summary>

<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>What is this guest reading?</strong></span></p>
<p>During one of my meditation sessions I came up with the idea of asking my guests for the title of the latest books they were reading.</p>
<p>Most successful people keep learning &amp; growing every single day and reading success and personal development books is one of the best ways!</p>
<p>Darren Hardy, Publisher of Success Magazine, reads a book for 30 minutes each and every day.</p>
<p>Marie Diamond (Quantum Physics expert, Feng Shui Master, and star of the movie The Secret), who I interviewed recently revealed that she reads 5 books each and EVERY WEEK AND she has three kids!</p>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Here’s what today’s guest is reading now:</em></p>
<p>Dr. Lois Zachary just finished reading the following books:</p>

<p><strong>Which book has had the biggest impact on your life?</strong></p>
<p>Most successful people will tell you that at some point in their lives, they’ve read that “ONE” book that changed everything in their lives.</p>
<p>Would it not be really amazing to be able to find out which books those successful women (and men) read that had such a strong impact on the course of their lives so you could also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">read that same book</span> and experience great changes in your journey?</p>
<p>Well, I’ve asked my guests to share the book that had the biggest impact on their lives with my audience.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll make sure to add this new title to your book repertoire! If you’ve already read that title, I’d invite you to read it again!!!</p>
<p><strong><em>Here’s our guest’s answer when asked about her Big Impact Book:</em></strong></p>
<p>Lois’s Big Impact book is:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00342VGEU/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=luxlife-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00342VGEU"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=B00342VGEU&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=luxlife-20&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" border="0" alt=" Dr. Lois Zachary | Do you need a mentor for your business success?"  title="Dr. Lois Zachary | Do you need a mentor for your business success?" /></a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=luxlife-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00342VGEU" border="0" alt=" Dr. Lois Zachary | Do you need a mentor for your business success?" width="1" height="1" title="Dr. Lois Zachary | Do you need a mentor for your business success?" /></p>

<p>I must have underlined every other sentence in it! It speaks to life as an art form and web of relationships and how we, as women, women compose our lives in relationship to one another. We weave a fabric together from the threads of our relationships and what we learn from one another.</p>

Years ago, I went to Sanibel and picked up the shells that represented the different phases of life that she described. I have had these shells displayed in my home for over 25 years. They never collect dust because they are such a treasure to me.</p>

<p><strong>What is this guest reading?</strong></p>
<p>During one of my meditation sessions I came up with the idea of asking my guests for the title of the latest books they were reading.</p>
<p>Most successful people keep learning &amp; growing every single day and reading success and personal development books is one of the best ways!</p>
<p>Darren Hardy, Publisher of Success Magazine, reads a book for 30 minutes each and every day.</p>
<p>Marie Diamond (Quantum Physics expert, Feng Shui Master, and star of the movie The Secret), who I interviewed recently revealed that she reads 5 books each and EVERY WEEK AND she has three kids!</p>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Here’s what today’s guest is reading now:</em></p>
<p>Beth’s latest read is:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1781190216/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wehq-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1781190216"><img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL110_&amp;ASIN=1781190216&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=wehq-20&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" border="0" alt=" Baeth Davis | Building a multi million dollar coaching business"  title="Baeth Davis | Building a multi million dollar coaching business" /></a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wehq-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1781190216" border="0" alt=" Baeth Davis | Building a multi million dollar coaching business" width="1" height="1" title="Baeth Davis | Building a multi million dollar coaching business" /></p>

<p><strong>Which book has had the biggest impact on your life?</strong></p>
<p>Most successful people will tell you that at some point in their lives, they’ve read that “ONE” book that changed everything in their lives.</p>
<p>Would it not be really amazing to be able to find out which books those successful women (and men) read that had such a strong impact on the course of their lives so you could also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">read that same book</span> and experience great changes in your journey?</p>
<p>Well, I’ve asked my guests to share the book that had the biggest impact on their lives with my audience.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll make sure to add this new title to your book repertoire! If you’ve already read that title, I’d invite you to read it again!!!</p>

<p>Olga Pechnenko-Kopp is the CEO of McElroy Translation in Austin, Texas. Native to Kaliningrad, Russia, Olga studied marketing at the Baltic State Academy and held the marketing manager position for Kakadu, a chain of pet stores. Her marketing experience as well as her fluency in English led her to a sales position at McElroy Translation in 2005 where she was quickly promoted to Business Development Manager.</p>
<p>Olga left McElroy Translation to launch multiple startups where she managed business development and marketing. Olga also ran her own marketing firm, Results Marketing, where she created and executed marketing strategies for small businesses.</p>
<p>In 2009, upon recognizing the need for a cultural and strategic shift within McElroy Translation that would position it for growth, Olga presented a business plan to the McElroy family. On October 16, 2009, Olga became CEO of the company. In her first year, McElroy Translation’s business technologies were upgraded and streamlined to promote scalability and measure progress through operational and financial metrics. Fixed expenses were cut by more than 50% and margins were increased by more than 10%.</p>
<p>Olga has been an avid participant in multiple professional organizations including Leadership Austin, the Young Women’s Roundtable, Bootstrap Austin, and Austin American Marketing Association. After graduating from the Emerge Program at Leadership Austin in 2008, Olga has Co-chaired the recruiting committee and volunteered on the fund development committee. She is currently Chair of the sponsorships committee for Young Women’s Roundtable.</p>

<p><strong>Which book has had the biggest impact on your life?</strong></p>
<p>Most successful people will tell you that at some point in their lives, they’ve read that “ONE” book that changed everything in their lives.</p>
<p>Would it not be really amazing to be able to find out which books those successful women (and men) read that had such a strong impact on the course of their lives so you could also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">read that same book</span> and experience great changes in your journey?</p>
<p>Well, I’ve asked my guests to share the book that had the biggest impact on their lives with my audience.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll make sure to add this new title to your book repertoire! If you’ve already read that title, I’d invite you to read it again!!!</p>

You are absolutely going to want to listen to this interview!

Olga Pechnenko arrived in America in her teens from Russia. Soon after arriving to the U.S., she started working in a company and she’s now she’s become its CEO. Her company generates many millions of dollars per year in revenue and she took over the seat of top boss at the tender age of 24!

In this interview, I ask Olga how she was able to find the strength and courage to step into the role of CEO at a young age and deal with the senior employees who might have been resistant to her promotion – you’re going to love this part.</itunes:summary>
