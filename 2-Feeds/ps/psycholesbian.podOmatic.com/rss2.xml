What types of men are there that were determined within this conversation. &lt;p&gt;
 Men we dig (we not meaning all lesbians but just us) (PS I LOVE YOU CHRIS, BILL, BUTTERs (TOM), RYAN ,TONY, RON, JOHN. ) These are the guys who seemingly are just chill, whom I feel like one of the guys with/ gals they tend to be kind of fem&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;
&lt;p&gt;THEN THERE IS THIS - These are the fellows who are not intimidated or somehow over compensating for what they feel they need to fulfill in today&#8217;s manly roles.  REALLY NOT THAT IMPORTANT.&#8211; the guys who obviously need to take notes &#8211; the guys who THINK that lesbians hate men.  How they over compensate and only turn their girls off.  By being overly aggressive and turning love of their STRAIGHT women into hate.  &lt;p&gt;
LESBIANS DO NOT HATE MEN &#8211; as many things in life are multi level this is no different, to simply group men into one category, and lesbians into one category is SILLY&#8230;&#8230; I as a LESBIAN do not hate men.  And MEN do not hate me&#8230;.. I have found many men whom I love and adore&#8230;&#8230;.. And many whom I could distance myself from&#8230;. BUT  ISNT THAT THE WAY OF EVERYTHING&#8230;.

      <title>Episode 2 - Psycho Lesbian Stories, and a Discussion about U-Hauls</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1225607/600x600_2032839.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sitting at the Softball field after games, is the best time to hear all the Psycho Lesbian Stories, so I brought my digital recorder to the softball game and asked the girls on my team to tell me all about the Psycho encounters they have experienced.  Here is what they had to say.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Gum Girl&lt;/b&gt; &#8211; Hooking up in a bar, and finding that your new friend has left you a present in your shorts.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Dirty Dirty Girl&lt;/b&gt; &#8211; Is about the relationship that you thought was a good idea going into it, and once you get there you realize, things are not going to work out the way you thought.  And the other person usually has a different idea of what that is.
&lt;b&gt;I make Pads&lt;/b&gt; &#8211; Some gals, are totally granola (not that there is anything wrong with that) but they do some pretty Psycho things to maintain their greenness.  &lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;I love you, I don&#8217;t even know your name &lt;/b&gt;&#8211; Everyone fears the psycho, don&#8217;t even know your name new girlfriend, and this one takes the cake.  She finds out where you work, brings you flowers and a ring (a ring she stole at Wal-Mart, and when you tell her it isn&#8217;t going to work out, she says &#8220;what a shame, cause I got your name tattooed on my tit. PSYCHO&lt;p&gt;
Why oh Why are Lesbians associated with the second date U-haul Phenomenon.   My partner and I (who waited a year to move in together) discuss just what it is, or might be that make lesbians so eager beaver to move in after meeting one another.

      <itunes:summary>Sitting at the Softball field after games, is the best time to hear all the Psycho Lesbian Stories, so I brought my digital recorder to the softball game and asked the girls on my team to tell me all about the Psycho encounters they have experienced.  Here is what they had to say.
Gum Girl &#8211; Hooking up in a bar, and finding that your new friend has left you a present in your shorts.
Dirty Dirty Girl &#8211; Is about the relationship that you thought was a good idea going into it, and once you get there you realize, things are not going to work out the way you thought.  And the other person usually has a different idea of what that is.
I make Pads &#8211; Some gals, are totally granola (not that there is anything wrong with that) but they do some pretty Psycho things to maintain their greenness.  
I love you, I don&#8217;t even know your name &#8211; Everyone fears the psycho, don&#8217;t even know your name new girlfriend, and this one takes the cake.  She finds out where you work, brings you flowers and a ring (a ring she stole at Wal-Mart, and when you tell her it isn&#8217;t going to work out, she says &#8220;what a shame, cause I got your name tattooed on my tit. PSYCHO
Why oh Why are Lesbians associated with the second date U-haul Phenomenon.   My partner and I (who waited a year to move in together) discuss just what it is, or might be that make lesbians so eager beaver to move in after meeting one another.

      <title>Episode 1 - Crazy Neighbor In The South</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1225607/600x600_2025354.gif&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crazy neighbors &#8211; you know you have them or have had them and had to move far far away.  

This VERY FIRST episode is about the craziness of 1 neighbor in the south, and how my sister would like to shank her (I know I used the wrong word the whole episode but I found it amusing after the fact)

Also gave props to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelesbianmafia.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lesbian Mafia Podcast&lt;/a&gt; &#8211; the podcast that keeps me laughing

I apologize for the sound quality, with some practice I will get it right.
