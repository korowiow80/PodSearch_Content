<p>Cynthia asked me to interview her because her physical and mental health had been catastrophically affected by the 911 terrorist attack.  She felt a witnessing like this might help her to heal.  She hoped too that other trauma survivors who heard her story might feel less alone. This edition of Psych1on1 is that Story Corps interview with Cynthia in its entirety.  Please note that it is not a psychotherapy session.  It is a witnessing.  Some portions will be difficult to listen to.  Listener discretion is advised.</p>
<p>For more information about trauma and trauma treatment, visit the Department of Veterans Affairs PTSD website at  <a href="http://www.ncptsd.va.gov/ncmain/index.jsp">http://www.ncptsd.va.gov/ncmain/index.jsp</a> or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website at <a href="http://www.bt.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/">www.bt.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a trauma survivor, please reach out for help.  You are not alone.  Other resources include: </p>

<p>Feel free to add comments with additional resources below.</p>
<p>The next edition of Psych1on1 will focus on the Imago frame for relationship counseling.  I will be talking with Dr. Valerie Frankfeldt, a teacher, psychoanalyst and Imago practitioner in New York City.</p>
