	<itunes:summary>Most businesses wonder why customers are so unpredictable. Why do customers get to the point of buying, and then suddenly back away? The Psychotactics Podcast shows you exactly how customers think--and why they do what they do. This information is not about persuasion. It is about understanding what goes on in your mind and my mind. And how we buy.</itunes:summary>

<p>Ronald was a good friend of mine. And Anita was his girlfriend.<br />
Well, not any longer. She was now his ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>They&#8217;d split up. And I got asked for my feedback: &#8220;So, what did you think of her, anyway?&#8221; Well, I told him what I thought about her.</p>
<p><strong>Did you ever get the feeling of putting your foot in your mouth? </strong></p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s exactly what happened. The two of them got back together again, got married, and guess who wasn&#8217;t invited to the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to the crummy side of feedback</strong></p>
<p>When people ask for feedback, you&#8217;re never really sure what they want. Do they want you to tell them the truth? Or would they just prefer to hear some sugar-coated lies instead? Because the truth is that most of us just don&#8217;t want to hear what we&#8217;re doing wrong.</p>
<p>And we know this to be true, because the moment someone starts to us give feedback and keeps at it, there&#8217;s a sort of boiling point. A point where we just want the other person to shut up.</p>
<p><strong>And yet shutting the other person up is the worst thing we can do</strong></p>
<p>Because now you&#8217;ve lost the chance to have your mistakes analysed. And that&#8217;s just fine if you don&#8217;t plan to build on your talent. Because when you think about it, talent is simply the reduction of mistakes. But now, because you have no external feedback, your progress is going to be painfully slow.</p>
<p>An outsider can spot way more mistakes than you can, simply because you&#8217;re too close to your work. To improve dramatically quickly, you need to make hundreds, even thousands of mistakes. And then of course, it&#8217;s time to fix those mistakes based on the feedback.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s interesting is that this feedback is very useful to the giver as well</strong></p>
<p>If the giver of the feedback is learning a similar skill as you, then the feedback helps the giver as well. When they criticise your work in any way, they are almost always reminding themselves to fix their own work.</p>
<p>So for instance, if I&#8217;m teaching someone how to improve their &#8216;bonuses&#8217; on the copywriting course, I will almost always be thinking of what I&#8217;ve done, where I&#8217;ve gone wrong, and put a marker to make sure I get it right in future. When I give feedback, invariably I&#8217;m learning as well.</p>
<p><strong>But what if you don&#8217;t react well to feedback?</strong></p>
<p>Feedback is never, ever, ever, ever, ever nice. That&#8217;s because feedback is about exposing your flaws and then rubbing some salt in it for good measure. Feedback always feels crummy, no matter who you are, or what you&#8217;ve done in your life.</p>
<p>And if you let feedback tilt you into a whirlpool of depression, then you&#8217;re in a lot of trouble. Feel bad, mumble, grumble, even curse if you like. But then take the feedback and fix the issues.</p>
<p><strong>And it&#8217;s not like you have to fix every issue</strong></p>
<p>There are times when you may not agree with the feedback. Or you may want to fix things but it&#8217;s impossible to fix—for whatever reason. And that&#8217;s fine too. Fix whatever you can, and move on.</p>
<p><strong>You have to ask yourself: Am I ready to move on? </strong></p>
<p>If you are truly ready to improve yourself, then ask for feedback and take it without mumbling. In fact, beg for more, because it will help you fix those mistakes a lot quicker than if you plodded your own path.</p>
<p>And please don&#8217;t drop hints for the giver to tone down the feedback. Because all you&#8217;re really doing is forcing the given to clam up.</p>
<p>And remember that while we&#8217;re all reluctant to give feedback at first, we do so happily once given the permission. And this is because when we give feedback, we learn as well.</p>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;s your next step?</strong></p>
<p>Do you want to get some genuine feedback? Well, if that&#8217;s true, get yourself prepared, because the crummy side of feedback is coming your way. Brace yourself. It&#8217;s the best—and worst— thing that&#8217;s ever happened to you!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4225" title="29May_juggler_juggling" src="http://www.psychotactics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/29May_juggler_juggling.jpg" alt="The Concept of the Star and the Supporting Cast When Creating Uniqueness" width="250" height="300" /></p>
<p>Every movie you&#8217;ve ever watched has a common factor.</p>
<p>You have a star. And you have the supporting cast.</p>
<p>The star gets all the lines. The star gets to do most of the work. The star is the focus. So what does the supporting cast do? The supporting cast comes in from time to time. They have smaller roles, fewer lines. And they have to do less work.</p>
<p><strong>Your sales page is a lot like that</strong></p>
<p>On your sales page, you&#8217;ll have the features and benefits of a product or service. And you&#8217;ll have bullets. And this is your supporting cast. They highlight the things that the customer needs to know about the product or service. But then there&#8217;s the star. That star is the uniqueness of the product or service. That star gets a lot more space. A lot more explanation. And in fact, the script writer (that&#8217;s you) may re-write the entire story to make that star shine.</p>
<p><strong>When you understand the concept of the star and the supporting cast, you don&#8217;t go nuts with your uniqueness.</strong></p>
<p>You realise that each of them have a role to play. And that while getting to uniqueness does involve a ton of slaughter and sacrifice, it&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re getting rid of all the benefits and features. It&#8217;s not that your bullets are totally worthless. It&#8217;s just that they cannot occupy the lead role. That lead role has been taken.</p>
<p>You can go right ahead and give every bullet, feature and benefit a small role to play, and they&#8217;ll play it well. But leave the big chunk to the uniqueness.</p>
<p><strong>But let&#8217;s take an example (even if it&#8217;s slightly flawed)</strong></p>
<p>If you ask anyone why they&#8217;re buying the Apple 4s, the answer is compressed down to one word: Siri. Siri on iPhone 4S lets you use your voice to send messages, schedule meetings, place phone calls, and more.</p>
<p>Ask Siri to do things just by talking the way you talk. Siri understands what you say, knows what you mean, and even talks back. So ask someone why they&#8217;re buying a 4s and they know the star; they know the uniqueness factor that&#8217;s causing them to upgrade.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4217" title="iphone4s" src="http://www.psychotactics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/iphone4s-300x172.png" alt="The Concept of the Star and the Supporting Cast When Creating Uniqueness" width="300" height="172" /></p>
<p><em>Can you spot the flaw? Of course you can. The client knows the uniqueness, but Apple is trying to stuff it all in one graphic. And worse, the real star is being booted to the bottom of the page</em></p>
<p><strong>But waitasec&#8230;there are all those other features</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s the  8-megapixel resolution and a custom lens with a larger f/2.4 aperture. There&#8217;s the Dual-core A5 chip. Let&#8217;s not forget Video recording in 1080p HD. And other such features. And yes, blah, blah, blah dee blah. They&#8217;re all playing their roles. But it&#8217;s a supporting cast, not the lead role.</p>
<p>Siri takes the lead role. Siri is the reason that the 4s stands out like it does. And so it will be with every single iPhone that ever comes out from Apple. There will be a star that will drive home the uniqueness. And there will be the supporting cast.</p>
<p><strong>And the twain shall meet</strong></p>
<p>But the star should get the most lines. The most drama.  The most ad time. Nothing should eclipse the uniqueness of the product. Because once the client knows why they want to buy a product, they&#8217;re no longer comparing phones. They&#8217;re now comparing iPhones. They&#8217;re actually rejecting the iPhone 4, even though it&#8217;s half the price or even less. And they&#8217;re choosing the iPhone 4s for that one reason only.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s your one reason?</strong></p>
<p>Every product or service has several great features and benefits. And you&#8217;ve always been afraid to choose your uniqueness, because it would mean that you&#8217;d have to slaughter and sacrifice the rest. Technically yes, the slaughter and sacrifice is needed, but only while you&#8217;re making sure the uniqueness gets the star role.</p>
<p>Once that role has been established, you can bring back the rest of the features and benefits to play their role as supporting crew. And that makes a good movie. And a good sales page. And they&#8217;ll all live happily ever after.</p>
<p>The End. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4218" title="wink" src="http://www.psychotactics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/wink.gif" alt="The Concept of the Star and the Supporting Cast When Creating Uniqueness" width="20" height="20" /></p>

<p><strong></strong><strong>&#8220;I&#8217;m one of those people who has a lot of trouble spending money on training and education, so paying a fee to join a forum was a big step for me.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve found, though, is that people are serious and they contribute. That makes a big difference.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also enjoying the general discussions. As a solo entrepreneur, most of my days are spent in isolation. And because of where I live, I&#8217;m not around other similarly-minded folks. The forum is<br />
inspiring; it&#8217;s great to be in contact with other people who are working hard on their businesses and facing so many of the same challenges I am.</p>
<p>Thanks for your work to keep this forum going.</p>

<p>When you think about it, why would you get your audience to introduce themselves? When you think of pet hates, introducing oneself at a workshop is easily one of the most hated of all activities. So why bother getting the audience members to introduce themselves?</p>
<p>Or you could take a totally different route, and avoid the frustration of everyone introducing themselves. You could make the person sitting next to them do the introduction.</p>
<p><strong>So how does this system work?</strong></p>
<p>In effect, no one does their own introduction. All they do is talk to the person next to them. So if X and Y are sitting next to each other, X introduces Y. And in turn, Y introduces X.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>
<p>The reason why we hate introducing ourselves, is because we have to talk about ourselves. That alone is kinda boring for at least half the audience. But the second biggest reason is that the spotlight is on us.</p>
<p>We have to talk about ourselves and make ourselves look good. We&#8217;re doing a tightrope act where we can&#8217;t undersell ourselves—or boast too much. This is all too much to bear, and we often end up goofing it up. This makes us even more nervous the next time we have to introduce ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>But the nervousness gets reduced when someone else is introducing us</strong></p>
<p>This is because that &#8216;someone&#8217; can not only boost us a bit, but they don&#8217;t need to have to remember anything. You see, when they spoke to you, and asked you questions about yourself, they would have made little notes. When they are called upon to introduce you, they simply refer to those notes. So they don&#8217;t have to remember anything and hence the nervousness goes away as well.</p>
<p><strong>But confusion still abounds if you don&#8217;t have structure to the introduction</strong></p>
<p>Just asking X to introduce Y is not a good idea. When we conduct live Psychotactics workshops, we make sure that there&#8217;s a clear structure to follow. e.g. The questions that X needs to ask Y would be something like:</p>
<p>- Your name</p>
<p>- Your profession</p>
<p>- Your favourite food</p>
<p>That gives the participants a clear structure to work with. They&#8217;re not randomly asking each other questions.</p>
<p><strong>But can&#8217;t we just skip the introduction session if it&#8217;s so hated?</strong></p>
<p>Yes you can, but you&#8217;ll find that your audience gets very disoriented. The introduction is a very vital part of who we are as humans. We like to know about each other, even if we don&#8217;t particularly like to introduce ourselves to a crowd.</p>
<p>But create a bit of excitement around the introduction and it&#8217;s not hated at all. Be sure, however, not to do silly things like making the person stand when doing the introduction. Let them be relaxed and they&#8217;ll thank you for it.</p>
<p><strong>Introductions are hateful because of the way they&#8217;re conducted</strong></p>
<p>If you turn it around and make Y introduce X, and X introduce Y, you get a much better result. It takes the nervousness out of the situation, allows us to refer to notes—and best of all it gets X and Y to know each other a lot better. Plus it enables the entire group to get to know everyone else, so don&#8217;t be surprised if you get a ton of laughs and a relaxed atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>And this sets the tone for the rest of the workshop</strong></p>
<p>Your group is now introduced to each other, have had a few good laughs and are now ready to learn. What was once a pet hate is now a wonderful experience. And all it took was a few tweaks and voilà, your workshop is well on its way to rocking and rolling!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4201" title="15May_jigsaw" src="http://www.psychotactics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/15May_jigsaw.jpg" alt="Uniqueness: The Importance of the Mundane and the Seemingly Uninteresting" width="250" height="269" /></p>
<p>Most of us struggle with the uniqueness of our products or services. And the reason we struggle is because we look for something exciting to showcase in our products and services. And all we seem to come up with, is the mundane and uninteresting.</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;ve probably heard of the &#8216;Twelve Apostles&#8217; in Australia</strong></p>
<p>Australia has close to six million tourists every year. About 1.7 million of these visit the site of the &#8216;Twelve Apostles&#8217;. Now before you get all reverential here, recognise the fact that there&#8217;s nothing very holy about this place. The Twelve Apostles are just a collection of limestone stacks off the shore, as you drive down the Great Ocean road.</p>
<p>And it wasn&#8217;t even known as the Twelve Apostles to begin with. The site was known as &#8216;the Sow and Piglets&#8217; until 1922— after which it was renamed to The Apostles for tourism purposes. This formation eventually became known as the Twelve Apostles.</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s ironical is that there aren&#8217;t twelve limestone stacks</strong></p>
<p>There are just nine. And one of those nine is eroding, so there will soon be eight. But do those 1.7 million visitors care? No, they don&#8217;t. Because to them, that venue is unique. Someone decided that in a continent full of wonders, they could isolate one attraction and draw millions of tourists to see these rocks. Yup, just rocks.</p>
<p>In effect, Australia took the mundane and made it extremely exciting.</p>
<p><strong>The Mona Lisa at the Louvre in Paris, is no less mundane</strong></p>
<p>There are over 35,000 pieces of art at the Louvre. While the Mona Lisa is certainly not mundane by itself, it&#8217;s just one of the many splendid art pieces in the Louvre. And in that respect, it&#8217;s pretty mundane. So why does everyone rush to see the Mona Lisa? You know the answer already, don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>At some point, someone decided to highlight the Mona Lisa. And to play down 34,999 other works of art. That&#8217;s akin to having a product with 35,000 features and playing down all but one feature. And that&#8217;s what gets the attention.</p>
<p><strong>Your product or service has the same problem</strong></p>
<p>For instance if you look at a membership site—any membership site, there are a ton of reasons why you should join and continue to be a member. Let&#8217;s list a few, shall we?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">1. Reliable answers to business problems</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">2. Timely responses, 24/7</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">3. Access to the owner</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">4. Accountability</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">5. Access to practical &#8220;how to&#8221; resources</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">6. Access to a community of like minded business people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">7. Access to helpful members</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">8. A safe environment</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">9. A getting things done environment</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">10. Privileged access to courses and products</span></p>
<p><strong>So what&#8217;s so interesting about that list?</strong></p>
<p>There may well be some interesting aspects to that list, but equally there may be something really mundane. For example: Access to practical &#8220;how to&#8221; resources. Now surely that is very mundane. Every membership site on the planet promises the very same thing. You sign up and you get access to all of these wonderful tutorials and goodies.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s kinda interesting, yet boring, eh? And yet it could very easily be made the uniqueness factor by describing why these &#8216;how to&#8217; resources are better than anything that you may possibly find elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>So let&#8217;s take a crack at it, shall we?</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;How To&#8221; Resources at XYZ Memberships Site: If you join a membership site, you&#8217;re sure to run into hundreds of articles and tutorials. The difference between what you see in XYZ Membership site and elsewhere, is that the articles don&#8217;t just tell you &#8216;how&#8217; to do something, but &#8216;why&#8217; that something works.</p>
<p>Once you understand &#8216;why&#8217; something works, you&#8217;re able to replicate that concept successfully across all your products or services—and know why it&#8217;s failing and how to fix it and make it work for to your benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s take another example</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Let&#8217;s say you own a tea company. And there are half a dozen, probably two dozen reasons why someone should buy your tea. Well, what are you going to choose? You&#8217;re more than likely to go for something that seems dramatic. But for the purposes of this exercise, let&#8217;s just choose the mundane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">1. Tea must be pesticide and chemical-free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">2. Tea must be this year&#8217;s crop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">3. Dry leaf should look fresh and shiny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">4. Aroma must be fragrant and lively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">5. Liquor must never be cloudy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">6. Mouth feel must have the right umami.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">7. Teas must be priced appropriately.</span></p>
<p>Now there are some exceptionally interesting and some terribly mundane points as well. But they&#8221;re only mundane because of a lack of explanation. If we were to choose the concept of &#8216;cloudiness&#8217; of tea, for instance, we could go on an don about how the tea liquor needs to be clear. How a pure leaf will create a translucent, almost shimmering cup of tea. Why a cloudy liquor is often a sign of low quality—and hence, not so tasty teas.</p>
<p><strong>You see what&#8217;s happening here?</strong></p>
<p>The key factor isn&#8217;t the feature. You could take a mundane feature, give it oomph and it forces your audience to take notice. And the beauty is that you can do it with any feature. Yes, you&#8217;re more likely to be tempted to use the best possible feature, but in reality there is no &#8216;best&#8217; feature.</p>
<p>Any feature, no matter how mundane, can be given the spotlight. What makes the feature stand out is the story behind the feature; the reason why that feature is so very important.</p>
<p>When choosing or creating the uniqueness factor for your products or services, you may work long and hard to find something amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Well, stop the search.</strong></p>
<p>Look for the mundane instead.</p>
<p>And elevate that &#8216;so-called&#8217; boring feature to one of great prominence by describing why that feature is so very important.</p>
<p>And that will get you one step closer to uniqueness.</p>
<p>Yeah, just like that!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span style="font-size: small;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4191" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" title="8May_radar" src="http://www.psychotactics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/8May_radar.jpg" alt="How To Know If You Have A Viable Niche" width="250" height="280" /></span></p>
<p>When companies from the West first visited a de-regulated India, they were licking their fingers in anticipation. For India was a country of almost one billion people (well, it is over one billion now) and these companies could just see dollar signs no matter where they went. But sheer numbers doesn&#8217;t make for sales.</p>
<p>And many companies burned themselves trying to get off the ground, because the vast majority of people simply couldn&#8217;t or wouldn&#8217;t buy their products. They learned, after a lot of trial and error that sheer numbers don&#8217;t mean a thing.</p>
<p><strong>The same applies to determining if you have a viable niche</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to know at first if what you&#8217;re doing is going to be successful. So you look for one big factor: competition.</p>
<p><strong>Huh? Competition? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, competition. If you can find a ton of competition, then you know it&#8217;s extremely viable. Why? Because a whole truckload of people have been there before you and have found it viable to keep running their businesses. But just having that truckload still isn&#8217;t the best denominator, so you go even further.</p>
<p>You subscribe to their list. You see what they&#8217;re doing. Are they selling higher priced product and services? Or is it all discount priced? If you sniff some higher prices, then you know for sure that there is a market, and a high price market too. If that high price continues over the years, then you know for sure that it&#8217;s sustainable.</p>
<p><strong>This isn&#8217;t a foolproof method</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;re looking in from the outside, so it&#8217;s hard to know for sure what profits etc, exist in the business. But at least you know it&#8217;s viable.</p>
<p>This is how I got into marketing</p>
<p>You see I was indeed fascinated with marketing, but fascination isn&#8217;t enough. The book that nudged my life in a different direction was &#8216;Good to Great&#8217; by Jim Collins. And in this book, there was a concept called &#8216;The Hedgehog Principle&#8217;. And the principle consisted of three questions.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>1) What can you be the best in the world at?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>2) What drives your economic engine?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><em>3) What are you deeply passionate about?</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><a href="http://www.psychotactics.com/blog/viable-niche/1_hedge/" rel="attachment wp-att-4190"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4190" title="1_hedge" src="http://www.psychotactics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/1_hedge-300x285.jpg" alt="How To Know If You Have A Viable Niche" width="300" height="285" /></a></span></p>
<p>So I was passionate about marketing, and could easily be the best in the world at it (if I started, which I did). But the third question is the one that the companies that came to India never answered. And that is: What drives your engine? How viable is this niche?</p>
<p><strong>And the answer must come from the market </strong></p>
<p>The more competition that exists, the more viable the product or service. Which means that if the market is saturated with fad diets, you have more of a chance of writing a bestseller with a fad diet, than with a rigourous lifelong diet. If TV is swamped with reality shows, then you&#8217;re better off making yet another—yes, another—reality show.</p>
<p>And back to my story: At the time, people like Jay Abraham were selling single seats at workshops for $5000. I went to workshops that were priced at $10,000. All around me I could see clearly that people were selling product both offline, and shortly after, online too. And for pricey sums too.</p>
<p><strong>And price is a good benchmark</strong></p>
<p>That high price factor shows that not only does the market exist, but it&#8217;s a mature market allowing for pricier amounts as well. And there&#8217;s another thing about the high prices. It allows smaller players to co-exist.</p>
<p>If everyone is discounting each other in a tiny market, then you struggle to get off the ground. But if there are several layers of pricing, it&#8217;s a lot easier for you to not just get into the niche, but slowly power your way up as well, if you wish.</p>
<p><strong>But what if you don&#8217;t want to follow the crowd?</strong></p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s noble, but the pioneers always get the arrows. This means you have to educate the market and that takes a lot of time and effort. And of course, money. It&#8217;s a lot better to follow the crowd (read: competition) and start off there, and then later, once you&#8217;ve got enough of a following, branch off where you will.</p>
<p><strong>Big companies can burn through tens of millions of dollars, and not feel so much as a twinge. </strong></p>
<p>You can lose a lot less and run into serious trouble. It&#8217;s better to start with the competition.</p>
<p>It sure saves having to stock up on all the anti-burn lotion.</p>

<p>After reading (and re-reading!) the Brain Audit I felt like a blindfold had been lifted off my eyes. It made so much sense and I kept thinking how it seems so obvious but no one has ever put all the pieces together like this before.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4180" title="1May_time_stopwatch" src="http://www.psychotactics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/1May_time_stopwatch.jpg" alt="How To Generate Article Topics When You're Half Asleep" width="250" height="296" /></span></p>
<p>If you keep writing every day, you&#8217;ll have a problem. You&#8217;ll have more article ideas than you can write. Every day will sprout thirty-fifty new ideas that you can never turn into articles. But when you&#8217;re starting out, this problem is quite the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>You may wake up and can&#8217;t think of a thing</strong></p>
<p>Or you may be so tired that your brain refuses to co-operate.</p>
<p><strong>So here&#8217;s what you do next: You find a few books</strong></p>
<p>You can do this offline, or online. But allocate a fixed amount of time. And here&#8217;s how you go about it. Let&#8217;s say I want to write about PHP. I know diddly squat about PHP. So that&#8217;s the same as waking up and not being able to think of a thing to write.</p>
<p><strong>So since the library is closed at this hour, I go online and look for a Dummies book</strong></p>
<p>And I look at the contents page and voilà—there are a ton of topics just waiting for me. Not just topics, but subtopics. Yipeee-yahooey! Now I have my topics and my sub-topics.</p>
<p><strong>But waitasec, isn&#8217;t that cheating?</strong></p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that plagiarism? Yes it is, if you copy the answers. Not if you copy the questions. The questions are simply the titles on the contents page. So let&#8217;s say the titles were the following:</p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Understanding PHP Data Types </span></em><br />
<em>Building SQL Queries<span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;"><br />
Troubleshooting a PHP Script<br />
Setting Up Your Computer for PHP and MySQL Web Site Development<br />
Considering the Various Uses for the PHP Scripting Language<br />
Keeping Up with PHP and MySQL Changes<br />
Use PHP Statements to Create Programs<br />
Communicate with a Database through PHP MySQL Functions<br />
Access and Adapt a Database with MySQL Queries<br />
Knowing the MySQL WHERE Clause Format<br />
Make MySQL Database Changes with the ALTER Query<br />
Special Characters to Use in PHP Expression Test Patterns</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">Now fifteen thousand writers can take the very same topics and no two articles may be the same. Why? Because you&#8217;re going to approach the same questions from your level, your experience, your stories, your objections, your style. It simply cannot be the same.</span></p>
<p><strong>And I found these points in fifteen seconds</strong></p>
<p>You could spend hours trying to dream up the perfect topics and sub-topics, but they&#8217;re all ready and formatted for you on the Internet—if you just look. So look. Set a timer, and then go for the topics. Cut and paste the topics and then it&#8217;s time for outlining.</p>
<p><strong>And by this time the expert in you can still be asleep</strong></p>
<p>Because you&#8217;re still not writing yet, and are in outlining mode, you&#8217;re just having a party, by coming up with questions. So let me give it a shot with PHP (not that I know anything about it).</p>
<p><em><span style="font-family: Georgia,serif;">Building SQL Queries<br />
What are SQL Queries?<br />
What are the steps to building an SQL Query?<br />
Where do SQL Queries mostly go wrong?<br />
What are the practical applications for SQL Queries?<br />
But surely we can do without SQL Queries&#8230;<br />
Summary<br />
Next step</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">Now if you&#8217;re a PHP programmer, I&#8217;m betting that you&#8217;ll be at least slightly interested in my questions. Some may be slightly off base, but most of them, when answered form a pretty good article.</span></p>
<p>But some answers may be too big. For example: Where do SQL Queries go wrong? So no problem. Just list the places where it can go wrong—yes, just a list. Then start up a new article called: Where SQL Queries go wrong and outline it—and phew—you have another outline!</p>
<p><strong>Your topics and sub-topics don&#8217;t need to be in your head</strong></p>
<p>They can be on the Internet, in the library or in the contents page of every book on your topic (hey, there&#8217;s this site called Amazon.com). If you want to write topics on starting a business, it&#8217;s there. If you want to write on WordPress, it&#8217;s there too. If you fancy gardening, kite building, even getting a divorce—it&#8217;s all there on the book stores. And not just one book, but forty or fifty books.</p>
<p><strong>Which is why you need a timer</strong></p>
<p>Because you can get stuck there all night trying to decide which topics and subtopics to choose. One thing is for sure, though: You can be half asleep forever, and never have a problem when coming up with topics and sub-topics.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just for starters. Once you start writing you&#8217;ll have the opposite problem. Too many ideas and not enough time to write!</p>

<p>If there are two lovers over a candlelit dinner and they&#8217;re saying: &#8221;I love you&#8221; then the scene is showing you what the scene is showing you.</p>
<p>So in effect it&#8217;s treating you like an idiot. You already know that the candlelit, soft scene is about love. That&#8217;s already been clearly shown to you. Now if the actors repeat it, then it&#8217;s a complete waste of space. And a waste of your time.</p>
<p><strong>Love can be shown in different ways</strong></p>
<p>So in an episode of Frasier, Daphne and Niles are chopping vegetables and singing a song. And they chop to a rhythm. There&#8217;s love written all over the scene. Unabashed love on Niles&#8217; face. Unknown love on Daphne&#8217;s face. But they never say I love you. They chop veggies.</p>
<p><strong>The same applies to anything whether it goes from cartoons to </strong><strong>magazine layouts to presentations</strong></p>
<p>The graphic needs to accompany the text. Not be a replica of the text. If the graphics are a replica of the text, it&#8217;s boring for the reader/listener/viewer.</p>
<p>So when you read off the points in your slides, you&#8217;re causing the listener/viewer a ton of grief. For one, you&#8217;re breaking Hollywood&#8217;s rule&#8211;that&#8217;s never good. And secondly you&#8217;re boring me, because here&#8217;s what happens in my brain.</p>
<p><strong>When I see text, I read it</strong></p>
<p>When I read it, it may appear to be a silent reading but in fact my ear is processing the information before sending it to my brain.</p>
<p>You see this more evidently in older folk and young children. They read aloud so that their ear processes the information before sending it to their brain. The same applies to you and me&#8211;except that we don&#8217;t read aloud. But we&#8217;ve still &#8220;read aloud&#8221; and then along comes the presenter and reads it aloud again.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s like saying something twice. That&#8217;s like saying something </strong><strong>twice</strong></p>
<p>It irritates the reader/viewer. It irritates the reader/viewer. And in a few minutes it turns the reader/viewer off completely. And in a few minutes it turns the reader/viewer off completely.</p>
<p>Get the point?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><a href="http://www.psychotactics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/undecided.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4264" title="undecided" src="http://www.psychotactics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/undecided.jpg" alt="How To Beat Inertia" width="250" height="268" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine you had two loans to pay back. Loan A was $100,000 at 19% interest per annum. Loan B was $200 at 1% interest. Which loan would you pay back first? Loan A or Loan B? If you chose Loan A, then almost every financial consultant on the planet would agree with you.</p>
<p><strong>Except Dave Ramsey</strong></p>
<p>To everyone, but Dave, the logic is clear. Loan A has a much higher rate of interest. Logically you should pay back the higher rate of interest first. But as you&#8217;d expect, Dave disagrees.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s because Dave understands inertia better than most other financial consultants</strong></p>
<p>So what is inertia? I learned a funny definition in physics class at school. It went like this: A body in the state of rest or motion is inertia.</p>
<p>Hah, that made me laugh. How can you be stuck and moving, and still be in the same state? But apparently that&#8217;s how inertia works. And this is Dave&#8217;s advice to people who are struggling with debt.</p>
<p><strong>First list all the debts on a piece of paper</strong></p>
<p>All debts need to go down. Student loans, credit card, mortgage, blah, blah. Then you need to rearrange the loans based on the size of the loan. So the smallest loan goes right at the top and the biggest one right at the bottom.</p>
<p>And everything else in between (depending on the size of the loan). And then he instructs you to pay only the minimum payment on every debt&#8211;with one exception. After the minimum payments were made, every available dollar needs to be put towards the first debt on the list.</p>
<p>Incredible as it may sound, Dave is telling you to wipe out that tiny, itty-bitty $200 debt with the pathetic interest, instead of taking on the painful big amount/big interest debt.</p>
<p><strong>Logically it makes no sense</strong></p>
<p>But your brain doesn&#8217;t always work logically when it comes to inertia. While you&#8217;re lounging on the sofa, watching endless and pointless political debates on TV, your logic is telling to get off your butt. It&#8217;s telling you that the debates are endless (and did we say, pointless?).</p>
<p>Your logic is also telling you that you should be doing some work or exercise instead of engaging in mindless drivel. So logic doesn&#8217;t work. And the same applies to the debt. When Dave&#8217;s clients wipe out the first debt it&#8217;s not necessarily logical, but it creates a factor of momentum. First the $200 is wiped out. Then the $350. Then the $800. And so on, right up to the &#8216;monsta&#8217; $100,000.</p>
<p><strong>The motion is what matters</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A body in a state of rest or motion is inertia. And going from rest to a state of motion is impossible if you decide to take on the biggest task first.</p>
<p>Logic tells you that you should fix your website right now. Logic tells you that you should write that 300 page book. But Dave would say, &#8220;Go brush your teeth first.&#8221; That simple act of doing something&#8211;anything at all&#8211;gets you off your caboose and into another state of inertia: a state of motion.</p>
<p><strong>So if you need to get something done, fool yourself</strong></p>
<p>-Don&#8217;t go for a 60 minute walk. Instead put on your shoes and decide to walk for just 7 minutes.</p>
<p>-Don&#8217;t try to write a complete article. Just write for 14 minutes. Then stop.</p>
<p>-Avoid trying to clean the entire bathroom. Just attack the sink.</p>
<p>These tiny bits help you get to the bigger bits. Because even as you go for the 7 minute walk, you know very well that you&#8217;re not going to turn around in 7 minutes.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll go longer and further. But the goal always needs to be 7 minutes or 14 minutes or the $200 debt. The itty-bitty bits are important, more important in fact, than the bigger goals.</p>
<p><strong>When people say they feel inertia, they mostly refer to a state of laziness</strong></p>
<p>Of not wanting to do anything at all. But as my physics teacher would tell you: &#8220;There&#8217;s inertia and there&#8217;s inertia.&#8221; And to get from one stage to another, you need to make the list in descending order of importance. Then attack the list.</p>
<p>And as Dave would say: Start small.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p>
<p>Dave Ramsey&#8217;s &#8216;Snowball Debt&#8217; and &#8216;Switch&#8217; by Chip and Dan Heath. P.S. Yes I know. You&#8217;re headed to Google these names, aren&#8217;t you? You think you&#8217;ll find out more about this book and this method of reducing debt, aren&#8217;t you? But you already have the tools.</p>
<p>You have a piece of paper. You have a pencil or pen. And you have the methodology. So don&#8217;t muck around. Get to work. You need to change that state of inertia right now.</p>

<p><strong>Have you ever been to a primary school play?</strong></p>
<p>There they are, all the kids, all keen to play their part.</p>
<p><strong>And then one kid forgets his part</strong></p>
<p>He stands there dumbfounded. Unable to speak. Frozen in fear. The words seemingly circulating in his brain somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>I was that kid! </strong></p>
<p>Except I wasn’t five years old. I was thirty-three years old and I was giving my first presentation ever on The Brain Audit. Except at that point, it wasn’t even called The Brain Audit. I was, at least in my mind, just giving a one hour seminar.</p>
<p><strong>And about twenty minutes into that one hour, I froze</strong></p>
<p>Nothing. I couldn’t remember a thing. There were twenty five people in the room looking right at me, and my mind was blankety-blank. And time doesn’t just slow down in these moments. It shuts down. You feel suffocated, unable to move or even twitch an eyebrow.</p>
<p><strong>My wife, Renuka saved me that night</strong></p>
<p>She told the audience we were going to take a 10-minute break. Imagine that. A 10-minute break in the middle of a presentation. But there I was ten minutes later, my brain all rebooted. And I gave my first presentation on The Brain Audit ever. But that was my first ever event. Sure I goofed up. But then I was fine.</p>
<p><strong>Fine until Wellington, that is</strong></p>
<p>I had to speak to this group of insurance agents. One hundred and fifty of them. And I was being paid the grand sum of $1500 plus airfare + expenses. And though it was at least three-four years later and forty presentations later, I did it again.</p>
<p><strong>I became that five-year old on the stage again</strong></p>
<p>My 45-minute speech was done in twenty. And I fled the stage. I was mortified because I forgot what I was supposed to say. And I knew in that moment, that I really should stop trying to be a speaker. Heck I might as well go and hide behind my computer and never show my face again.</p>
<p><strong>Moments of doubt creep up in everyone’s mind</strong></p>
<p>But this isn’t a moment. This is a crisis. You’re being mangled, pulverised and every bone in your body is telling you to eject, eject and eject.</p>
<p>And yet you stay on course. You feel the anguish, the shame, the utter doubt. And then when you’ve done enough of your self-pity, you wake up the next day (or several days later) and you get back to doing what you need to do.</p>
<p><strong>What I needed to do was go back to Wellington</strong></p>
<p>Back to that same hotel. Back to that same stage. Back to face a fear so strong that even though I wasn’t going to be speaking to the same audience; or even speaking on the same topic; or the fact that several years had elapsed. I was still petrified of—get this—the very room!</p>
<p><strong>But that’s what you have to do</strong></p>
<p>The only way to face the fear is to face it. You pick yourself, dust yourself off and start all over again. That’s what marks out the people who succeed vs. the people who don’t.</p>
<p>The people who don’t make excuses. They say: I tried this stuff. It didn’t work. Well hello there, try it again. And again. At least so that you get over the fear. If for no one else, then at least for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Because the moment of doubt doesn’t care</strong></p>
<p>As you get better at what you do, you have more challenges. Some challenges you breeze through. Some make you feel five again. Fearful. Blank. Unable to go on. But you must go on, because if you do there is that so-called pot of gold waiting at the end of the rainbow.</p>
<p><strong>Remember The Brain Audit presentation I was telling you about?</strong></p>
<p>Well, at that point I hadn’t written The Brain Audit. But after that event, someone came up to me and asked me for notes. Of course I didn’t have any notes. But she persisted. So I wrote out the notes a few days later and sent it to her in a PDF. Those notes became the basis for The Brain Audit as it is today.</p>
<p>And today that one book alone has sold over $500,000 worth of copies to date.</p>
<p><strong>One book. Half a million dollars!</strong></p>
<p>In my wildest dreams I could not have envisioned a turnaround like that. But it could have gone the other way as well. I could have given up. Decided to go into early ‘retirement’. And that would be the end.</p>
<p><strong>Doubt shakes our very core</strong></p>
<p>When you’re doing a course. Learning a new skill. Doing something different or scary. And the longer you wallow in self-pity, the more stupid excuses you make, the more that doubt is going to chew you up and spit you out.</p>
<p><strong>Be that five year old</strong></p>
<p>Freeze in fear if you have to. Take your ’10-minute break.’</p>
<p>Then come back to fight.</p>
<p>And win!</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;I first bought the Brain Audit in 2002. It was 32 pages long.<br />
And I thought it was the best damn book on copywriting I had read</strong>&#8221;</p>
<h3><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1975" title="brainaudit_book1" src="http://www.psychotactics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/brainaudit_book1.png" alt="brainaudit_book1" width="127" height="130" /></h3>
<p title="Successful Salesletters">It laid down the entire sequence of <a title="Successful Salesletters" href="http://www.psychotactics.com/the-brain-audit-marketing-strategy-and-structure">elements that any successful salesletter</a> or presentation needs to cover to make the prospect say &#8220;yes!?&#8221;</p>
<p>I really thought that Brain Audit could not be improved upon.</p>
<p>But year after year, Sean has been proving me wrong. He has improved upon it. And improved upon it. And improved upon it.</p>
<p>Sean&#8217;s added more details to the Brain Audit. More stories and analogies. Better graphics (and fun cartoons!). He has used every teaching trick possible to make sure that you not only <a title="The Brain Audit" href="http://www.psychotactics.com/the-brain-audit-marketing-strategy-and-structure">understand the sequence of elements needed to make people buy</a>&#8230; but the sequence soaks into your thinking pattern too.</p>

<p>Imagine this. Imagine you move into a neighbourhood and a neighbour brings across a big cake.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to you instantly?</strong></p>
<p>There you are, with all your unpacked boxes, a to-do list so long it stretches all the way to Geneva and all that you can think of, is how to pay that person back. How you can thank that person in return.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Tracy did me such a favour</strong></p>
<p>Brian Tracy is a speaker/trainer and famous for sales-training worldwide. I stumbled upon his work early in the year 2002, when the first ebooks were trickling out onto the Internet. I bought an ebook and with it came some audio from Brian Tracy. And I was hooked. Imagine my surprise when I found half a dozen books in the library as well as audio cassettes (yup, cassettes). For me, a rookie in marketing and sales, those books and audio were heaven-sent. I&#8217;d listen to the tapes twenty, even fifty times over.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell I was thankful beyond words?</strong></p>
<p>But how do you thank someone like that? Well actually in today&#8217;s world it&#8217;s dead easy. But this wasn&#8217;t today. This was 2002.</p>
<p>Anyway, since I was now officially stalking Brian&#8217;s every move, I learned he was coming to Auckland. So I did what any good stalker would do. I emailed his secretary. Back and forth we communicated. I found out stuff he liked, the type of wine he preferred etc. And of course, when Brian was coming to Auckland. Yup, down to the flight number.</p>
<p><strong>And the day he landed, I was there to say hello</strong></p>
<p>Weird, I know, but that&#8217;s how stalkers are. Brian was amused, but a little taken aback as well. I told him about the exchanges with his secretary and he decided I was slightly bananas, but kinda bearable. What he didn&#8217;t expect was a superb bottle of wine (I think it cost about $50) and a note thanking him for all he&#8217;d done.</p>
<p><strong>That opened my door to Brian&#8217;s world</strong></p>
<p>I was able to meet him for breakfast. I got to go to his event. He shared some &#8216;secrets&#8217; with me that over the years saved us thousands of dollars (and made us thousands too). And I got to go backstage and see how things were done. There&#8217;s more of a story, but the point is simple.</p>
<p><strong>Most people never say thank you in a meaningful way</strong></p>
<p>And when you go out of your way to say thank you, you are remembered. People remember you because most people never say thanks. They may just send an email over. Or may not even bother to do that. But to really say thanks means that you stand out like crazy. I can, for instance remember a chocolate cake that showed up on my doorstep one November. I can remember the dinner at my favourite restaurant. I can remember a simple iTunes voucher I got from someone. I can remember that audio series on the &#8216;Talent Code&#8217; that came in the mail. I remember, because thanks is so rare.</p>
<p><strong>So is this about me getting gifts?</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a nice thought, so hold it, but that&#8217;s not the point at all. The point is just to say thanks to people who make a difference in your life. Renuka and I will often give the waiters and waitresses at the cafe a small bar of chocolate. When we travel, we often take little gifts for people. We will send t-shirts (after checking the size etc) or a little tree, for instance. The point is that you need to learn to say thanks often and consistently.</p>
<p><strong>The problem with thanks is that you can&#8217;t wait</strong></p>
<p>You have to say thanks quickly. And in a way that works. So for instance, a bar of chocolate may be appropriate for one person and not for another. A bottle of wine may be great for someone and not for another. And this can&#8217;t wait. You can procrastinate too long and forget about things. And a thank you opportunity lost is a thank you opportunity lost.</p>
<p><strong>Be aware that it&#8217;s not always a gift as well</strong></p>
<p>A book. A little card. A crayon drawing. A special video. There are a million ways to say thanks without spending a dime. But first you have to learn to say thanks as often as possible. And there are reasons. The first being that it makes you happy. That&#8217;s the most important reason. The second is that it makes the other person happy. And finally, the concept of &#8216;give and you shall receive&#8217; comes into play.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t give because you want to receive, but you get stuff back anyway. That one conversation with Brian made a difference to my life forever. And it changed my perception of things and added to my bank balance. One measly bottle of wine makes a massive difference.</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;I first bought the Brain Audit in 2002. It was 32 pages long.<br />
And I thought it was the best damn book on copywriting I had read</strong>&#8221;</p>
<h3><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1975" title="brainaudit_book1" src="http://www.psychotactics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/brainaudit_book1.png" alt="brainaudit_book1" width="127" height="130" /></h3>
<p title="Successful Salesletters">It laid down the entire sequence of <a title="Successful Salesletters" href="http://www.psychotactics.com/the-brain-audit-marketing-strategy-and-structure">elements that any successful salesletter</a> or presentation needs to cover to make the prospect say &#8220;yes!?&#8221;</p>
<p>I really thought that Brain Audit could not be improved upon.</p>
<p>But year after year, Sean has been proving me wrong. He has improved upon it. And improved upon it. And improved upon it.</p>
<p>Sean&#8217;s added more details to the Brain Audit. More stories and analogies. Better graphics (and fun cartoons!). He has used every teaching trick possible to make sure that you not only <a title="The Brain Audit" href="http://www.psychotactics.com/the-brain-audit-marketing-strategy-and-structure">understand the sequence of elements needed to make people buy</a>&#8230; but the sequence soaks into your thinking pattern too.</p>
<p>Today, the Brain Audit 3.2 is 157 pages long! And its the best* book on persuasion you will ever read!</p>
<p>* Until Sean comes out with version 4.0 a year or 2 down the line. But you really can&#8217;t afford to wait a year or 2 to take advantage of the Brain Audit, can you?</p>
