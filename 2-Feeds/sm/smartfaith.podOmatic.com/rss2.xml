      <title>SFP 142: Securing the Heart</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1075567/600x600_547848.bmp&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome. Today we are going to be talking about how the young person can secure their hearts for God as they face the world they live in. While these steps might be meant for the young, I find that they would likely work for anyone at any age. The basis of this question of &#8216;how can the young secure their hearts?&#8217; originates from (Psa 119:9)  BETH. Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word. We&#8217;re going to be spending this episode explaining how one can take heed to God&#8217;s word.</description>

Today I want to talk about the way we live here in America in this day and age. There are so many things that we do that just completely flies in the face of God and His commands as presented in the Bible. The thing is that some 78% of Americans claim to be Christians! If this was truly the case, the majority of us should be living the Word of God and the things that so many of us find shameful should only represent a very small minority. </description>

      <title>SFP 140 Parables 2: The Sower</title>
      <description>Welcome. Today I want to talk a little Jesus, as in His parables, and the meaning they have for us in our modern day lives. This time I want to take on the Parable of the Sower, or the Parable of the Four Soils. This parable teaches us about how we take the Word in our lives, it pretty much classifies everyone&#8217;s four main basic responses to God&#8217;s Word. If we are anything besides the &#8216;good&#8217; soil, this is a call to repentance and a change of heart as well. </description>

      <title>SFP 139: Occult Practices</title>
      <description>Welcome. Today&#8217;s topic was inspired by a television show that I saw about a woman that is a practicing psychic. This made me think about how in our society we don&#8217;t blink twice when it comes to the supernatural or the occult. This in turn sent me to my Bible to find what God has to say about topic. The results of that search are what I want to talk about today. </description>

      <title>SFP 138: Persecution and Death</title>
      <description>Welcome. Today we have a grim topic, the one of death and persecution. To be more specific, we&#8217;re going to be talking about being persecuted and even executed for our religious beliefs, and just how common this is even in our modern world. We are also going to discuss how we should handle this persecution in our lives when it comes to us. And make no mistake, if we live in Christ as we should, it will come to us in one form or another. </description>

      <title>SFP 137: Why Jesus Suffered</title>
      <description>Welcome. The gospel message is that Jesus died for our sins according to the Scriptures as we see in Isaiah 53 and 1st Corinthians 15. We know that without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sin. We find this in the Scriptures in Hebrews 15 and Ephesians 1. But the question could be asked why couldn&#8217;t Jesus have had a quick, less torturous death? Why all the suffering? Is there a reason for it all? </description>

      <title>SFP 135: Be Not Conformed</title>
      <description>Welcome. Today we are going to be talking about the world and how the Christian should relate to the world. Should Christians be conformed to this world? How should a Christian conduct themselves in the world? Where should a Christian put their affections? What about their values? Should the world shape our morals? Should we look to the world for entertainment? What about how we dress? Should we speak as the world speaks? Should we have worldly aspirations? How should the Christian use his spare time? These are the questions we are going to be answering today, as the Bible gives us a great deal of guidance in this very issue. </description>

      <title>SFP 133: Friends</title>
      <description>Welcome. Today I want to talk about something that is big in all of our lives and that is friendship. Like that old song says, no man is an island. We all affect each other, and we tend to naturally form bonds and connections with those around us. In God&#8217;s Word, we are given much insight and information on how and who we should form friendly connections with, and how we can do so in a godly manner. With this, we can form good relationships, and avoid the difficult pitfalls that destroy so many friendships. </description>

In God&#8217;s Word, we are given much insight and information on how and who we should form friendly connections with, and how we can do so in a godly manner. With this, we can form good relationships, and avoid the difficult pitfalls that destroy so many friendships. </itunes:summary>

      <title>SFP 132: Truth Really Does Save Part 2</title>
      <description>Welcome. Today we&#8217;re going to return to our website exploration and we will be continuing our efforts to counter the anti-Christian material we have found. Today our focus is going to be on Godlessness, and the supposed examples that our dear friend have provided for us via this website. We&#8217;re going to be covering God&#8217;s existence, what defines God, how life was designed, if God was created by man, and various odds-and-ends claims as we come across them. </description>

      <title>SFP 131: Truth Really Does Save Part 1</title>
      <description>Welcome. Today we&#8217;re going to be talking about some claims made by a website that denies Christianity. The first point I want to make about our subject today is that I will not be covering every single word or even every single section of this website in our discussion. Firstly because much of it is atheistic conjecture and opinions, and I can only say &#8216;nu-uh&#8217; so many times before we all get tired of it, and secondly because I&#8217;m not willing to devote 8-12 episodes purely to this one subject. I don&#8217;t have the attention span for it, and I don&#8217;t think you guys want us to dwell on this single subject for that long. We&#8217;re going to be looking at the claims they make, and will be addressing the ones that stick out to me, the ones that inspired me to speak out. The reason we&#8217;re taking on this exercise today is because the world is full of false information attacking the truth that God has presented the world, and I feel it&#8217;s important to occasionally stop and defend the faith so that people that hear these falsehoods can have a chance to hear the truth.</description>

      <title>SFP 129: Worldliness</title>
      <description>Welcome. Today I want to talk to you about worldliness. This is something that is consuming many Christians whole, and that&#8217;s a serious problem because we are told to stay away from worldliness by the Word of God. Yet the world is continually capturing our brethren, and stealing away the word from some before they even have a chance to believe! Our goal today is to identify the world, how the world presents itself today, and how we can overcome the world. </description>

      <title>SFP 126: God's Love for Man</title>
      <description>Welcome. Today we&#8217;re going to be talking about something very important, and something that everyone should be interested in: the love God has for mankind. Without God&#8217;s love where would we be? The value of this love cannot be overstated, and I think it&#8217;s clear why God&#8217;s love is so important. If He didn&#8217;t love us, we would be in a world of trouble! So today we are going to be talking about how God has shown His mighty love for mankind, so that we might all come to a deeper understanding about His love, along with the realization of the fact that God&#8217;s love is not something based purely on emotionalism. Instead God shows us His solid and real love through creation, through the Word, through the establishment of morality, through His plan for our salvation, and through the promise of eternal life. These are the points we&#8217;re going to be discussing today.</description>

      <description>Welcome. Today we are going to start a series called &#8220;God and You&#8221;. In this series we&#8217;re going to be talking about the different things we need to do to grow our relationship with God, and how we can improve our spiritual standing. We&#8217;re going to be talking about things like prayer, discernment, and God&#8217;s will for our lives. Let&#8217;s kick off the series with an episode on the subject of prayer. The Bible tells us in (1Th 5:17)  Pray without ceasing. There are some questions associated with this verse, such as &#8216;is this really what God wants us to do?&#8217;, &#8216;why is prayer so important?&#8217; and finally, &#8216;how can we possibly pray without ceasing?&#8217;. Today we&#8217;re going to answer these questions and more!</description>

      <description>Welcome. Today we&#8217;re going to be digging into the book of 2 Timothy and look at the way people are going to act as the end comes towards us. The book tells us that perilous times are coming, and I think they are starting to arrive even now. When this time of troubles comes, people are going to stop caring about the things of God, and will start loving the corruptible things of the carnal world. We can see this happening all around us today, and so we&#8217;re going to break down the kinds of things the wayward people will love so that we can be smart and turn away, preventing ourselves from becoming bogged down in worldliness. </description>

      <title>SFP 122: For Those That Don't Believe</title>
      <description>Welcome. Today we&#8217;re going to be talking about atheism, or well, in a more general sense, non-belief. We need to be prepared to counter the points made by non-believers because the Bible tells us (1Pe 3:15)  But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: so today we&#8217;re going to work on being prepared against the arguments made by those that would seek to deny God.</description>

      <itunes:summary>Welcome. Today we&#8217;re going to be talking about atheism, or well, in a more general sense, non-belief. We need to be prepared to counter the points made by non-believers because the Bible tells us (1Pe 3:15)  But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: so today we&#8217;re going to work on being prepared against the arguments made by those that would seek to deny God.</itunes:summary>

      <title>SFP 120: Inner Demons</title>
      <description>Welcome. Today we&#8217;re going to be talking about inner demons, an issue we all have to face in our lives. We are going to be specifically speaking to the inner demons of selfishness, greediness, pride and lust. Our goal today is to be aware of these feelings, these demons if you will, and learn how to deal with them appropriately so that they do not overcome us and destroy our attempts at living a Christian life.</description>

      <title>SFP 119: Ethic of Love</title>
      <description>Welcome. Today we are going to be talking about love, and God&#8217;s ethical standard. If you look through the Bible, you will find that love is a constant ethical standard presented by God. We can see this ethical standard perfected in the person of Jesus Christ. There is no other system that can come close to the perfection of God&#8217;s ethic of love, though there are many systems in the world that try. Our goal today is to learn of God&#8217;s ethical system and apply it to our lives so that we might improve our walk with Christ.</description>

      <description>Welcome. Today we are going to be talking about Jesus Christ, and the value that Christ has to us in this world. I want to specifically ask you if you would rather have Christ, or things such as wealth, popularity, or indulgences of the flesh. Now personally I&#8217;d rather have Christ than all these things, and I want to spend this episode telling you why. </description>

This is important because indifference is running rampant throughout our world today. You find so many in the world that are just fence sitters and who will not commit to anything or anyone. They want to play the middle of the street on all the issues. Well let me tell you something; when you play the middle of the street, you&#8217;re bound to be hit by a truck. </description>

      <title>SFP 116: Truth About Sex</title>
      <description>(Warning: Mature Subject Matter) Welcome. When I first started the Smart Faith Podcast back a handful of years ago, the main purpose in my mind was to counter this whole secular-humanism movement, this atheistic intellectualism line of thought that wants to claim that Christians are not intelligent, that faith preempts one&#8217;s ability to think, and that only the small minded or mentally weak would fall for a trap as ludicrous as Christianity. I wanted to argue that faith does not hinder knowledge in any way, and that intelligence and faith was not mutually exclusive.</description>

      <title>SFP 113: Big Questions</title>
      <description>Welcome. Today I want to talk about a few important questions. Firstly, who is God? And then secondly, who are we? These are probably two of the most relevant questions in our lives, alongside &#8216;why are we here&#8217; and/or &#8216;what is our purpose?&#8217; I want to answer those questions of identity today, so that maybe we can come to understand our place and role in this life. By knowing who God is, and who we are, we can come much closer to answering that third question of purpose. </description>

      <description>Welcome. In this world we struggle against many things. We struggle against the daily issues of life, things like health, money, and relationships. Christians also struggle against sin, and finally we struggle with the supernatural. (Eph 6:12)  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Today we&#8217;re going to be talking about what the Devil wishes to accomplish as he struggles against Christians and even God Himself. More specifically we&#8217;re going to be talking about the things Satan does to reach his true goal of destroying lives and souls.</description>

We&#8217;re going to be looking at Jonah, his life, and the lessons we can learn from his story. </description>

We are going to see that these people are just the scum of the Earth. Sadly, people flock to these false teachers even when the Bible has warned us this would happen. </description>
