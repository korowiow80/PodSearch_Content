	<itunes:summary>Learn about cutting edge tools and web-services that can turn any small business into an automated business. Ask yourself, If I left on vacation for 2 months, would my business grow larger and be more profitable when I got back?. If the answer is no, you&#039;ve come to the right place. Automate My Small Business has combed the world for the latest technologies, techniques, and services that make owning a small business fun again. Regain the entrepreneurial spirit with small business automation tools and techniques that allow a solopreneur to compete with the big guys, by leveraging the same technologies and services they use, but for a fraction of the cost.

If you are just getting started, we&#039;ll show you how to test new product ideas or business ideas for less than $200, instead of doing it the old fashion way: spend thousands getting it made and raising millions with investors, just to learn the idea didn&#039;t cut it. Our motto is fail small, and fail fast. Entrepreneurship is risky business, but you can change the odds by quickly failing with small capital investments so that you can find the successful ones earlier. Then ride the wave of success.

Once you&#039;ve found that business, we talk about the methods to automate that business to run on its own. The goal here is to reduce the time you spend to near zero, so that you will have more time to spend doing the things you love (speding time with family, traveling, or even starting other businesses). The key is building systems that run themselves, and Automate My Small Business is the place to find the building blocks to do just that.</itunes:summary>
