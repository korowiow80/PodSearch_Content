        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[ There are many avenues to truth. The truth for one may not be the truth for another. Then of course, once you think you have found it, that it is finally in your grasp and everything makes sense- BAM! Something comes along to make you question more, doubt what you have all ready discovered. And so you continue your quest.

"The important thing is not to stop questioning." -- Albert Einstein

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Well, we hope. One thing we are finding out at these roundtable discussions is even though we have great discussions of the details, we don't really disagree on the bottom line. I'm going to try harder for future discussions to get more opposing views. We don't bite- I promise! We just want to truly understand where others are coming from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This episode was originally recorded in February. Yes, February. Shut up, I know. However, the topic continues to be relative as dieseases such as measles and pertussis are slowing making comebacks. In Washington state they have to tap into emergency funds and practically have an epidemic of whopping cough on their hands. Which could all be prevented if everyone were up to date and vaccinated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see my bias- I believe in vaccinations. I believe in the science behind them, and proof is everywhere that they work, and do more good than harm. The link between vaccines and autism has been debunked. As much as I try to understand what the fear is in those who do not vaccinate their children, I can't. Reasons I've read and heard do not match up with the science.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I gathered the roundtable crew of&nbsp;<span style="color: #333333;">&nbsp;</span><a href="http://spellwight.com/" title="Telling It Like I See It" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: #010101;">Debbie</a><span style="color: #333333;">,&nbsp;</span><a href="http://about.me/danshaurette" title="Dan Shaurette" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: #010101;">Dan</a><span style="color: #333333;">, and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://twitter.com/imkilo" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: #010101;">Miles</a>, and we had a pretty good discussion. I apologize for the background noise- there was a gathering in the other room, and they were quite chatty.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm offline today- and leaving all of you browsing by information on the SOPA and PIPA bills currently in Congress. They are anti-piracy laws.

            <link><![CDATA[http://audioaddict.libsyn.com/ts106-truth-seekers-in-hd]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>On a post-PodcampAZ high.. I am always so inspired after these weekends! Have some great ideas for putting some life back into the show. That means, of course, getting more than one episode a month out!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will also put audio up from the session I presented at Podcamp this year- on podcasting your politics and still have people take you seriously. It went really well, and ended up being more of a discussion than a speaking presentation. But hey- that's what I'm all about!&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, here is a show that I recorded with the guest you all have come to know and even like a little here on the show, Scott Josephson! We watched the compelling documentary "<a href="http://www.history.com/shows/vietnam-in-hd" title="Vietnam In HD" target="_blank">Vietnam in HD</a>" on the History Channel, and after a little PodcampAZ banter we get into our thoughts about that. The show runs a little longer than the last couple of episodes, at about an hour. Don't go into cardiac arrest at the change. ;)</p>
<p>We also end with a question for our viewers- so enjoy! Be warned, as is usually the case when Scott is on the show, the explicit tag was earned. Within the first 2 minutes, even!&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It only took 5 years, but I have finally made it to episode 100. Of the regular episodes, that is. I've done a bit more than that over the half-decade. And I have a special guest, who made me wait until his BIRTHDAY to post it (nevermind that I didn't get around to editing it until this week).</p>
<p>Anyway, without further ado, let's get to it. It's a long one (that's what she said), an hour and 20 minutes. But you know what? It's my hundreth episode, so screw it! Listen over two days. ;-)</p>
<p>*Recorded on April 21st, 2011*</p>

<p>- Will reading be less authentic if it goes digital</p>
<p>-How will it change as technology advances</p>
<p>-Scott envies the AZ Podcasting Community</p>
<p>-Amy Donahue update</p>
<p>-Social Media FTW!</p>
<p>-FOOD! We ate so much of it</p>
<p>-And now the drunk cast begins</p>
<p>-In other news, Jesus is on his way</p>
<p>-The End is all in the numbers- the numbers you can just make up.</p>
<p>-Cu-Sack?</p>
<p>-The End is Neigh. What are you going to do?</p>
<p>-Dani doesn't have big dreams</p>
<p>-The end of the world is the chaos we create</p>
<p>-We're writing a book</p>
<p>-Looking back at 100 episodes.</p>
<p>-Start off strong then taper. You can tell I'm a runner.</p>
<p>-The one topic I've not discussed on the show yet.</p>
<p>-Dani doesn't care about life on other planets.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[It only took 5 years, but I have finally made it to episode 100. Of the regular episodes, that is. I've done a bit more than that over the half-decade. And I have a special guest, who made me wait until his BIRTHDAY to post it (nevermind that I didn't get around to editing it until this week).
Anyway, without further ado, let's get to it. It's a long one (that's what she said), an hour and 20 minutes. But you know what? It's my hundreth episode, so screw it! Listen over two days. ;-)
*Recorded on April 21st, 2011*
- Dani sounds a lot like ScottyJ
-100 Regular episodes!
- 7th Annual Pat's Run: our second time running.
-It's a family thing
-Get over your negativity
-Liberal who tolerates Obama
-The Kennedys miniseries
-Not as inaccurate as you might think
-Well, other than that Oswald story...
-Scott's JFK Conspiracy theory
-Printed books. Becoming irrelevant?
-What about libraries?
-Libraries are much more than books
- Will reading be less authentic if it goes digital
-How will it change as technology advances
-Scott envies the AZ Podcasting Community
-Amy Donahue update
-Social Media FTW!
-FOOD! We ate so much of it
-And now the drunk cast begins
-In other news, Jesus is on his way
-The End is all in the numbers- the numbers you can just make up.
-Cu-Sack?
-The End is Neigh. What are you going to do?
-Dani doesn't have big dreams
-The end of the world is the chaos we create
-We're writing a book
-Looking back at 100 episodes.
-Start off strong then taper. You can tell I'm a runner.
-The one topic I've not discussed on the show yet.
-Dani doesn't care about life on other planets.
-Scott loves Mexicans, but also hates everyone equally.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Back when I was new to this whole audio thing, I put radio segments in the podcast feed. I no longer do it daily (it's really a lot of work to cut/paste 4-6 segments a day!), but every now and then I want to share some of what I'm doing over on <a title="KWSS" href="http://kwss.org" target="_blank">KWSS Radio</a>. This past Friday I had my friend Amy Donohue on the show as a co-host, and we had a blast! She also told her story of becoming a kidney doner, and the good and sometimes bad associated with the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took all the tracks and put them together minus music- about an hour. We talk everything from her kidney and the awesome lady getting it, to the 80's and why we love the decade so much. Even a bit of politics sneaks its way in! Enjoy!</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://audioaddict.libsyn.com/ts-headlines-week-of-1-24-2011]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Have been working on a podcasting presentation, as well as a little freelance writing (I know, right?), so a slight delay on headlines. They are still pretty relevant to hear however. Especially since a few were hardly talked about at all in the media.</p>
<p>Show Length: 14 minutes.</p>
<p>*Oh that President Bush. <a title="Politico" href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0111/48072.html#ixzz1C17yLvCu" target="_blank">They are still finding illegal skeletons in his illegal closet</a>. Again, a call for accountability? Yeah, right.</p>
<p>*Mexico begins<a title="Telegraph UK" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/mexico/8275086/Mexico-to-become-first-country-to-use-iris-scans-on-ID-cards.html" target="_blank"> iris scans for identification</a>.</p>
<p>*Those corporations, <a title="Democracy Now" href="http://www.democracynow.org/2011/1/25/headlines" target="_blank">they sure like Republicans</a>.</p>
<p>*Vermont wants to <a title="Democracy Now" href="http://www.democracynow.org/2011/1/25/headlines" target="_blank">revoke the right of personhood to corporations</a>. I can't believe you need to revoke something that is so obvious.</p>
<p>*The US vs. The UN. Or should I say, <a title="Fox News" href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/01/25/gop-puts-reform-agenda-urgent-problem/#ixzz1C4KtQq8o" target="_blank">conservative US vs. the UN</a>.</p>
<p>*Russia <a title="Yahoo News" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20110125/ts_nm/us_russia_blast" target="_blank">wants revenge for bombing</a>.</p>
<p>*People are still able to buy guns at a gun show, even when the seller knows that the<a title="Yahoo News" href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110131/ap_on_re_us/us_bloomberg_gun_control" target="_blank"> buyer might not pass a background check. </a></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's been two weeks now since the shooting in Tucson.&nbsp; I give my take on the reactions from the conservative and liberal worlds. Then I tell you what *I* think. ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Jon Stewart has a somber moment during <a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-january-10-2011/arizona-shootings-reaction" target="_blank">the Daily Show</a>.</p>
<p>*Can't we just talk about Huck Finn?</p>
<p>*Media FAIL.</p>
<p>*The blame game begins.</p>
<p>*This is not the first time I've covered this topic.</p>
<p>*Tennessee Church <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,392081,00.html" target="_blank">shooting in 2008</a></p>
<p>*<a href="http://audioaddict.libsyn.com/ts59_ignore_the_pull_of_your_prejudice_" target="_blank">TS 59: Ignore the Pull of your Prejudice</a>.</p>
<p>*Totally unrelated, but that show was 59 and this one is 95. Odd.</p>
<p>*One of my favorite writers, Tim Wise, makes a great point <a href="http://www.timwise.org/2011/01/paranoia-as-prelude-conspiracism-and-the-cost-of-political-rage/" target="_blank">about the environment you live in</a>.</p>
<p>*The Espresso Pundit also makes a point, <a href="http://www.espressopundit.com/2011/01/on-saturday-night-after-a-day-of-wall-to-wall-giffords-coverage-i-wanted-to-relax-a-bit-and-watch-other-news-fortunately.html" target="_blank">but not quite as eloquently</a>.</p>
<p>*Rhetoric is just making stuff up.</p>
<p>*Some conservatives actually say liberals are happy about the shooting.</p>

<p>*Guess it's ok when HE does it.</p>
<p>*The left really handled it wrong.</p>
<p>*It's not polite to point!</p>
<p>*Sheriff Dupnik of Pima County <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/09/clarence-dupnik-arizona-sheriff_n_806440.html" target="_blank">should be listened to</a>.</p>
<p>*There is a point, I swear!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Was going to take a break until the new year, but then came across <a title="Want To Leave The State? Then Go." href="http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/opinions/articles/2010/12/14/20101214tuelets145.html" target="_blank">a little letter to the editor of the Arizona Republic </a>that made me want to say a few words. So consider this an "audio holiday card" for all of you.</p>
<p>Oh, and in the holiday spirit, I drop one F-bomb. Be warned, younger listeners! (really, I have them!)</p>
<p>I'm also slowly downsizing my holiday, and becoming less stressed because of it- it's a wonderful feeling! I talk about it a bit in the episode, but I also just came across <a title="The Case Against Buying Christmas Presents" href="http://zenhabits.net/bah/" target="_blank">a great blog post from Zen Habits</a> that seemed to help explain how I've been feeling. It was very, well, zen. :-)</p>
<p>Have an excellent holiday, or, if you do not celebrate the holiday, have a great couple of weeks. I'll be back after the New Year with headlines and more seeking!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>No more Ms. Nice Girl! A lousy mid-term election gets me thinking about how I've been running things over the past several months. I've been too quiet, too complacent. This will change, and I will tell you why. With a little help from my friends Jon and Bill. :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Opening: Jon Stewart Speech at the Rally To Restore Sanity (it runs about 12 minutes if you'd like to skip forward. But I recommend you listen- or listen again!)</p>
<p>*Half-assed apology</p>
<p>*Tunnel vision could kill us all!!</p>
<p>*If you really need to blame someone, go ahead and blame me.</p>
<p>*Arizona makes a good example of the ignorance seen across the country.</p>
<p>*Do you want your country back? Or do you want it to simply move backwards?</p>
<p>*Taking power to push a personal agenda: Russell Pearce.</p>
<p>*Less government really has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>*Let's Rock!</p>
<p>*A minority of voters are controlling what happens in this country- and half of them are age 65 and older. No one sees this as a problem?</p>
<p>*Overall, people want a progressive, government-loving country. Oh yeah, I went there.</p>
<p>*Take us out, Mr. Maher.</p>
<p>Links:</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[No more Ms. Nice Girl! A lousy mid-term election gets me thinking about how I've been running things over the past several months. I've been too quiet, too complacent. This will change, and I will tell you why. With a little help from my friends Jon and Bill. :-)
&nbsp;
*Opening: Jon Stewart Speech at the Rally To Restore Sanity (it runs about 12 minutes if you'd like to skip forward. But I recommend you listen- or listen again!)
*Half-assed apology
*Tunnel vision could kill us all!!
*If you really need to blame someone, go ahead and blame me.
*Arizona makes a good example of the ignorance seen across the country.
*Do you want your country back? Or do you want it to simply move backwards?
*Taking power to push a personal agenda: Russell Pearce.
*Less government really has nothing to do with it.
*Let's Rock!
*A minority of voters are controlling what happens in this country- and half of them are age 65 and older. No one sees this as a problem?
*Overall, people want a progressive, government-loving country. Oh yeah, I went there.
*Take us out, Mr. Maher.
Links:
*Non Sequitur
*AOL News (voting percentages)
*Russell Pearce elected AZ state president
*Will Pearce focus on immigration or economy?
*touristband.com (great music!)

			<title>On Hiatus until August!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://audioaddict.libsyn.com/on_hiatus_until_august_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Well, after some serious thought and many summertime blockers, I've decided to hold off on regular shows again until after the kids head back to school. Focus is one of those things I'm trying to work on, and when I'm juggling too many things, everything tends to crash to the ground. That isn't fair to you listeners, and I want to make sure I'm giving 100% in the news/issues I bring to the table.</p>
<p>No, this is not podfading, this is preparing for a new year of Seeking. Complete with new theme, promos, and a cleaned-up webpage!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll still of course be lurking around as always on Twitter and Facebook. The Ning site will be shutting down, so I would love it if you'd head over the the <a title="Truth Seekers Podcast On Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Truth-Seekers-Podcast/107469955961219?ref=ts" target="_blank">Truth Seekers Facebook</a> page and become a fan!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kids are back in school August 9. <strong>New show will be up Friday, August 13th!</strong> My favorite day/number! (I'm not kidding)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjoy the rest of your summers, and you'll hear me again soon. :-)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Dani is script-less! Watch out!</p>
<p>-why is it always a month in-between shows?</p>

<p>-The hellhole known as the office/studio/guestroom</p>
<p>-Pat's Run April 17th</p>
<p>-Training takes time!</p>
<p>-Apologies to my wonderful listeners</p>
<p>-Colbert explains why global warming is a hoax</p>
<p>-For the 536,478th time- snow does not mean global warming is a myth!</p>
<p>-Deniers can't look beyond their nose.</p>
<p>-Just take care of the planet dammit!</p>
<p>-Feedback: Tempe doesn't like headlines.</p>
<p>-Ha! Doing some headlines anyway.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[This episode is all about me and a couple of personal journeys I'm taking right now. Trying to improve my life a bit, get a bit more organized. This way I can bring you shows more often! Also a tribute to a really great man who changed the way I look at the world- for the better. The details:
&nbsp;
-Dani is script-less! Watch out!
-why is it always a month in-between shows?
-Agile Lifestyle
-The hellhole known as the office/studio/guestroom
-Pat's Run April 17th
-Training takes time!
-Apologies to my wonderful listeners
-Colbert explains why global warming is a hoax
-For the 536,478th time- snow does not mean global warming is a myth!
-Deniers can't look beyond their nose.
-Just take care of the planet dammit!
-Feedback: Tempe doesn't like headlines.
-Ha! Doing some headlines anyway.
-CIA employees can work for private corporations.
-Free speech barred by court.
-Tennessee nuclear plant hates black people.
-Iraq wants Blackwater out
-Rest of show: Tribute to Howard Zinn via Democracy Now. Thank you Howard for making me think and question what I was taught!

We cover the presidential candidates, and several of Arizona's propositions that are going to be decided on. Today, even!<br/><br/>Keep watching the feed because I will be recording from the polling line, and getting an 11-yr-old perspective on the voting process. No, not Scotty- my daughter is coming to the polls with us!<br/><br/>Then tonight- starting at 7pm eastern, head to the <a href="http://truthseekerscast.ning.com/chat" target="_blank">live chat</a> on the forum, and spend the evening with us as we watch all the results trickle in!<br/><br/>It's more fun than any sporting event I've ever seen!!!<br/><br/>Call in with your post-voting and election thoughts: 206-337-1026<br/><br/>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://audioaddict.libsyn.com/live_from_podcamp_az_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[So if you've been watching the <a target="_blank" href="http://">Twitter</a> feed, you know I am
participating in Podcamp AZ this weekend. What an awesome day it was-
and I get to do it all again tomorrow!<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I haven't had a chance to see what's going on around here,
I will catch up after the weekend I promise. Until then, I wanted you
all to know that tomorrow afternoon I will be doing a 30 minute live
show from Podcamp! I will probably talk more about local issues, like
our ballot propositions, but I'd love it if you all could tune in and
check it out!<br/>
<br/>
It's a video cast too- though I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow (Sunday) at 3:30 mtn time (5:30 eastern- remember to put those
clocks back everyone else (AZ doesn't do that daylight saving thing!))<br/>
<br/>
Link: <a href="http://podcampaz.org/podcast-az/">http://podcampaz.org/podcast-az/</a><br/>
<br/>
Hope you'll tune in!<br/>

            <description><![CDATA[I tried to get a show together. Really, I did. The day job takes precedent however (the day job being mom), and on top of drowning in Girl Scout adventures, I'm also drowning in teeny, tiny, extremely annoying little lice bugs. I mean- ew. The bug problem is under control, but that doesn't stop all the upkeep that needs to happen until it's completely wiped out. So it's been another week of catching up with- well, I don't even know what I'm trying to catch up with. All I know is by the end of the day, the last thing I find myself wanting to do, is get a show together. <br/><br/>So, not this week. I am happy to say that there is the beginning of a show in the works. I've been thinking a lot about recent discussions in the forum about race and white privilege, and that's what the topic will be. <br/><br/>I would like to get it out before next Thursday.<br/><br/>I'd like a lot of things. <br/><br/>However, the realistic side of me knows better. I do promise that you will be the first to know when the new show is up!<br/><br/>Thanks as always for listening, and you'll hear me again soon!<br/><br/>~D<br/>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[I tried to get a show together. Really, I did. The day job takes precedent however (the day job being mom), and on top of drowning in Girl Scout adventures, I'm also drowning in teeny, tiny, extremely annoying little lice bugs. I mean- ew. The bug problem is under control, but that doesn't stop all the upkeep that needs to happen until it's completely wiped out. So it's been another week of catching up with- well, I don't even know what I'm trying to catch up with. All I know is by the end of the day, the last thing I find myself wanting to do, is get a show together. So, not this week. I am happy to say that there is the beginning of a show in the works. I've been thinking a lot about recent discussions in the forum about race and white privilege, and that's what the topic will be. I would like to get it out before next Thursday.I'd like a lot of things. However, the realistic side of me knows better. I do promise that you will be the first to know when the new show is up!Thanks as always for listening, and you'll hear me again soon!~D]]></itunes:subtitle>

It's been a great summer, but I am ready to get back to seeking that truth, and bring you my version of it. <br/><br/>I've been thinking a lot about how to improve on the show, and I think one way to help keep the news I bring listeners current is to attempt a weekly show.

We'll see what happens...<br/><br/>At any rate, episode #52, and a whole new &quot;season&quot; of Truth Seekers begins<span style="font-weight: bold;"> August 6th</span>! <br/><br/>See you soon!<br/><br/>~Dani<br/><br/>PS- Podcasters!

            <description><![CDATA[In honor of Martin Luther King's birthday 79 years ago today, a speech originally given in 1967.&nbsp; Also one I personally think encompasses what he was about even more than his &quot;I Have A Dream&quot; speech.<br/><br/>&quot;I Have A Dream&quot;, made popular by the media, I feel because it was the easiest for white America. This speech is much more telling of the times and the viewpoints of Dr. King. A perspective that can still ring hauntingly true today in many instances. Yes, we've come far, but we as a country still have far to go when it comes to race relations.<br/><br/>Enjoy, and peace.<br/><br/>*Biography of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr." target="_blank">MLK</a><br/>*Respectfully swiped from <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/wordsatlarge/blog/2007/10/the_lost_massey_lectures.html" target="_blank">The Lost Massey Lectures Podcast</a><br/>*The TS Theme song: &quot;Camp Walk&quot;- <a href="http://podcast.penmachine.com/audio/audio.html" target="_blank">Derek K.

November 1st the quest is to podcast everyday (including weekends) for
30 Days. Feel free to be as creative as you want. Any audio format is
acceptable. From Jott to Utterz to BlogTalkRadio etc... Use a phone, an
iRiver (or comparable) or a good old fashioned microphone. It can last
from 1 minute to 1 hour or more. It's entirely up to you. Use whatever
tools you have at your disposal. The whole point is to just get your
podcast out each and every day for 30 days starting on November 1st.&quot;<br/><br/>I figured since I record daily for <a target="_blank" href="http://kwss1067.com">KWSS</a> anyway, all I really need to do is fill the weekends, and I'm set! So, first post for the month will be Episode #39!<br/><br/>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[A little holiday present for everyone- three weeks ago a thread began on the Podcast Pickle forums.&nbsp; Two amazing podcasters wanted to show some love to a great podcast directory and community. It turns out that many other podcasters wanted to show some love as well. This was the result.&nbsp; Enjoy!The Update Before Christmas by Wesley Clifford and Will RossAdapted from the Poem &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; By Clement Clark MooreTwas the night before Christmas, and all 'cross the net, (Wintersheart)No RSS updates, and so no shows to get. (Mr. Bob)The iPods were docked to the computers with care, (Barely Podcasting)In hopes that P Dilly soon would be there. (TVindy)All the Casters were nestled all snug in their beds, (Brother Osric)While visions of Microphones danced in their heads. (mrsb)And mamma in her ipod, 80 gigs vast (Rubberhead)We had just settled in to finish our casts. (Laurence Simon)When on my computer the hard drive did clatter, (Blissfully Unfulfilled)I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter. (Juliann)Fingers on my keyboard they flew like a flash, (Laieanna)It'd just be my luck if Windows did crash. (Eclectic Mix)But the moon through the window on my computer below, (Twilight)showed an empty podcatcher, with not a one show. (comedy4cast)But then, what to my wondering eyes should appear, (DiggersStory)But a great giant pickle, and eight tiny reindeer! (Dani)With a little old driver, so lively and quick, (Philosophy Guy)I knew in a moment it must be St Pick! (Zedcaster)More rapid than broadband his casters they came, (Geek Acres)And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name! (Tony -FanboySmackdown)Now Rob Walsh! Now Ely! Now Hutchins and Sigler! (Mostly News)On Clinton, On Ellis! On Leo and Digger! (Brother Osric)And down through the modem, through the firewall! (Lynnette from SCRAPcast)Now download 'em! Download 'em! Download 'em all!&quot; (Jen and Corey)As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, (KevinLeeC)When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky. (Planet Retcon)So up to the rooftop the casters they flew, (SysTris)With the jar full of Casts, and P Dilly too. (KC Weather)I heard on the rooftop, the shows I loved most! (Mostly News)The talking and laughing of each beloved host! (Dani)As I drew in my head, and was turning around, (Thats good to know)Down the chimney P Dilly came with a bound. (Brother Osric)He was dressed all in green, from his head to his foot, (Shelly)And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot. (Zedcaster)A bundle of Feeds he had flung on his back, (Slusy)And he looked like a pickle, like a podcasting snack. (PNR Mikey)His eyes-how they twinkled! Green pimples how merry! (The Right Rev Chumley)His cheeks were like roses, his nose a green cherry! (Dry Shave, Karen)He held a wide smile, from his nose to his chin. (RL Burt)And the beard that he wore, was green as a gherkin. (the Keeme)The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, (Allie)And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.

            <description><![CDATA[Pat Tillman's brother Kevin's amazing letter to the public- and is worth putting the entire text of here.&nbsp; Also, third party candidates are not allowed to participate in congressional debates.&nbsp; Bad form Hillary, really bad form.<br/><br/>After Pat's Birthday<br/><br/>Posted on Oct 19, 2006<br/>Pat and Kevin Tillman<br/>Courtesy the Tillman Family<br/><br/>By Kevin Tillman<br/><br/><br/>It
is Pat's birthday on November 6, and elections are the day after. It
gets me thinking about a conversation I had with Pat before we joined
the military. He spoke about the risks with signing the papers. How
once we committed, we were at the mercy of the American leadership and
the American people. How we could be thrown in a direction not of our
volition. How fighting as a soldier would leave us without a voiceï¿½
until we get out. <br/><br/>Much has happened since we handed over our voice:<br/><br/>Somehow
we were sent to invade a nation because it was a direct threat to the
American people, or to the world, or harbored terrorists, or was
involved in the September 11 attacks, or received weapons-grade uranium
from Niger, or had mobile weapons labs, or WMD, or had a need to be
liberated, or we needed to establish a democracy, or stop an
insurgency, or stop a civil war we created that can't be called a
civil war even though it is. Something like that.<br/><br/>Somehow America has become a country that projects everything that it is not and condemns everything that it is.<br/><br/>Somehow
our elected leaders were subverting international law and humanity by
setting up secret prisons around the world, secretly kidnapping people,
secretly holding them indefinitely, secretly not charging them with
anything, secretly torturing them. Somehow that overt policy of torture
became the fault of a few bad apples in the military.<br/><br/>Somehow
back at home, support for the soldiers meant having a five-year-old
kindergartener scribble a picture with crayons and send it overseas, or
slapping stickers on cars, or lobbying Congress for an extra pad in a
helmet. It's interesting that a soldier on his third or fourth tour
should care about a drawing from a five-year-old; or a faded sticker on
a car as his friends die around him; or an extra pad in a helmet, as if
it will protect him when an IED throws his vehicle 50 feet into the air
as his body comes apart and his skin melts to the seat.<br/><br/>Somehow the more soldiers that die, the more legitimate the illegal invasion becomes. <br/><br/>Somehow
American leadership, whose only credit is lying to its people and
illegally invading a nation, has been allowed to steal the courage,
virtue and honor of its soldiers on the ground. <br/><br/>Somehow those
afraid to fight an illegal invasion decades ago are allowed to send
soldiers to die for an illegal invasion they started.<br/><br/>Somehow faking character, virtue and strength is tolerated.<br/><br/>Somehow profiting from tragedy and horror is tolerated.<br/><br/>Somehow the death of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of people is tolerated.<br/><br/>Somehow subversion of the Bill of Rights and The Constitution is tolerated.<br/><br/>Somehow suspension of Habeas Corpus is supposed to keep this country safe.<br/><br/>Somehow torture is tolerated.<br/><br/>Somehow lying is tolerated. <br/><br/>Somehow reason is being discarded for faith, dogma, and nonsense. <br/><br/>Somehow American leadership managed to create a more dangerous world.<br/><br/>Somehow a narrative is more important than reality.<br/><br/>Somehow America has become a country that projects everything that it is not and condemns everything that it is.<br/><br/>Somehow
the most reasonable, trusted and respected country in the world has
become one of the most irrational, belligerent, feared, and distrusted
countries in the world.<br/><br/>Somehow being politically informed, diligent, and skeptical has been replaced by apathy through active ignorance.<br/><br/>Somehow the same incompetent, narcissistic, virtueless, vacuous, malicious criminals are still in charge of this country.<br/><br/>Somehow this is tolerated.<br/><br/>Somehow nobody is accountable for this.<br/><br/>In
a democracy, the policy of the leaders is the policy of the people. So
don't be shocked when our grandkids bury much of this generation as
traitors to the nation, to the world and to humanity. Most likely, they
will come to know that somehow was nurtured by fear, insecurity
and indifference, leaving the country vulnerable to unchecked,
unchallenged parasites. <br/><br/>Luckily this country is still a
democracy. People still have a voice. People still can take action. It
can start after Pat's birthday. <br/><br/>Brother and Friend of Pat Tillman,<br/><br/>Kevin Tillman<br/><br/>*<a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/200601019_after_pats_birthday" target="_blank">Truthdig.org</a><br/>*<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-tbVDd217E" target="_blank">Howie Hawkins Protest Video</a><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Oh what a show!&nbsp; First I hear an amazing episode of a podcast at the gym that nearly causes me to fall off my stairmaster. What listening DID do is get me to race home, and change my entire intro and promo to this podcast. (which I will definitely use for the next episode- but this podcast was great and it was one of those instant inspiration things!)<br/><br/>Then, the first of my two-part interview with my first conservative guest.&nbsp; It was such a great interview, I had to split it because we chatted so long!&nbsp; This is also my first time stepping out of my normal comfy zone of network friends.... and ya know I didn't do half bad. ;-)<br/><br/>Enjoy- and please tell me what you think any of the topics discussed, or my charming interview skills... <br/><br/>Headlines: <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/" target="_blank">CBC News</a><br/>Interview with <a href="http://www.rightwingnews.com/" target="_blank">John Hawkins</a><br/><a href="http://www.rightwingnews.com/category.php?ent=5455" target="_blank">13 FAQ About Immigration</a><br/><a href="http://humaneventsonline.com/" target="_blank">Human Events Online</a><br/>Promo: <a href="http://allaxisradio.com/Welcome.html" target="_blank">All Axis Radio</a><br/>Wesley Willis: <a href="http://www.alternativetentacles.com/bandinfo.php?band=wesleywillis" target="_blank">Rock -n- Roll McDonald's</a><br/>]]></description>
