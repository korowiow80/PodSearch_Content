            <title>Autoline This Week #1623: American Icon(Repeat of #1613)</title>
            <description>Ford Motor Company was in trouble even before that breathless September four years ago that sent the world economy searching for financial oxygen. But armed with a bold strategy and solid leadership, Ford survived the crisis, steering clear of both bankruptcy and government loans. And then as it released some of the new products it had in the pipeline, suddenly the company started making money and the blue oval was back in the black in a big way. That’s the story of how Alan Mulally and his team brought Ford back from the brink as told in the new book “American Icon.” Bryce Hoffman of The Detroit News spent two years engrossed in the culture that Henry Ford built and Alan Mulally arguably saved. On Autoline This Week, John McElroy talks to Mr. Hoffman about “American Icon” and is joined in the discussion by Keith Naughton from Bloomberg News and Jim Hall from 2953 Analytics.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1622: Highly Charged</title>
            <description>As more and more of those alternatively-powered vehicles hit the streets around America, the potential legal issues grow. We’ve already seen batteries burst into flames so who knows what lies ahead with hybrids, pure electrics, hydrogen or natural gas vehicles? Manufacturers are keeping a close eye on the situation within not only their research and development departments, but legal ones as well. Joining John McElroy to talk about these potentially explosive issues is an expert panel including, Fred Fresard from the suburban Detroit law firm Dykema, automotive consultant Thomas Livernois and Mike Ramsey from the Wall Street Journal.</description>

            <description>Running a car company in Europe is decidedly different than in America. Especially if you’re on the Board which makes all the big decisions. Join John McElroy and his guest Dr. Walther Kiep, the longest serving member of Volkswagen’s Supervisory Board, for an inside look at his years helping run this mega-automaker as he promotes his recollections of a life in politics and business in his new book “Bridge Builder.” Joining John on his panel are Christina Rogers of Automotive News and Mike Ramsey from the Wall Street Journal.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1620: Excellent Interiors</title>
            <description>Both boardrooms and government agencies are guiding design teams to create the vehicles of tomorrow. But how you achieve cost-savings and meet standards all in a slick package remains the (insert outrageous cost projection amount here) question. On Autoline This Week John McElroy brings together a cutting-edge panel of auto experts who are doing just that on the inside with interiors. Klaus Busse sees it from the OEM side as Head of Chrysler Group Interior Design. Meanwhile, representing the supplier community are Fiona Doskocz with Benecke-Kaliko and Gerald Winslow, VP of Sales and Marketing for InfiChem Polymers LLC.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1619: Turning to TrueCar</title>
            <description>Just a few short decades ago, the only way to get information on a new car was to go to a newsstand or go to a dealership. Since then, as consumers have learned how to use the maturing internet, the number of car-buying options have exploded. One of the newest on the web is TrueCar out of California. Joining John McElroy on Autoline This Week is Larry Dominique, former Vice President with Nissan, who signed on with TrueCar to help challenge the competition like Edmunds. Included on this week’s panel are Craig Trudell from Bloomberg News and Steve Finlay of WardsAuto Dealer Business.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1618: Innovation for All</title>
            <description>How to break the ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) ceiling? Some manufacturers don’t think we need to and continue to upgrade their current crop of engines. But then there are companies like Nissan-Renault, whose leader Carlos Ghosn, gave the world the all-electric Leaf and is continuing down that path. As Senior VP in charge of Research and Development for Nissan Americas, Carla Bailo has to walk a delicate line -- continue to provide the company with ICE vehicles all while working with Japan to develop those ground-breaking high mileage electric cars. Joining host John McElroy and Ms. Bailo on this week’s Autoline are Brent Snavley from the Detroit Free Press and Lindsay Brooke with Automotive Engineering International.</description>

            <description>We all know Manhattan for its Wall Street institutions, Broadway musicals and idyllic Central Park, however, let’s not forget about transportation. Even though the city has perhaps the best public subway and bus systems, cars are very important in New York’s daily routine. And we don’t mean just those yellow ones with the meters. Joining John McElroy from the shadow of Times Square to talk about the Big Apple and its unique relationship with the auto industry is Jamie Lincoln Kitman from GQ, Bank of America analyst John Murphy and Joe Phillipi with AutoTrends Consulting.</description>

            <description>It won nearly every serious automotive award and had a huge carbon-free footprint of positive reviews from critics and consumers alike. So if that’s the case, why is the Volt GM’s slowest selling product? More than that, why does there seem to be such a negative charge to the car? People across the country who have never even seen a Volt let alone driven this engineering marvel have nothing good to say about it, confounding both auto analysts and company executives. On Autoline This Week John McElroy and his panel look at the strange state of GM’s engineering masterpiece the Volt. Joining John on the panel are Joe White of the Wall Street Journal, Manny Lopez from the Michigan Capitol Confidential and Gary Witzenburg an auto journalist and former engineer on GM’s original electric project, the EV1.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1615: Where's Retail?</title>
            <description>The word on the street is the economy is getting better. And we mean “on the street” literally with new car sales leading the way. But how is this happening in the middle of a slow recovery? Are the manufacturers doing something special to move metal or is it simply that the 2008 recession caused such a large pent up demand for new vehicles that consumers couldn’t wait any longer? The man with answers to these questions and more joins John McElroy on Autoline This Week. Jeremy Anwyl is the Vice Chairman of Edmunds.com, the automotive do-all website. He joins John and his panelists, Edward Lapham of Automotive News and Steve Finlay from WardsAuto.com to talk about the state of automotive retail and more.</description>

The man with answers to these questions and more joins John McElroy on Autoline This Week. Jeremy Anwyl is the Vice Chairman of Edmunds.com, the automotive do-all website. He joins John and his panelists, Edward Lapham of Automotive News and Steve Finlay from WardsAuto.com to talk about the state of automotive retail and more.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1614: Capitol Car Talk</title>
            <description>Washington, D.C. has been leading a double life of late. Not only is it the American Capitol but it seems to have usurped the title of the Motor City from Detroit as well. With federal loans to automakers, Car Czars and CAFE requirements, there’s been an extraordinary amount of auto activity in the District the last few years. That’s one of the reasons that Autoline visited our nation’s capitol earlier this year to talk autos with a variety of influencers. Join John McElroy on this week’s show as he speaks with Phil Murtaugh from CODA Automotive, Roland Hwang of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Dave Zukchowski from Hyundai Motor America and Margo Oge of the Environmental Protection Agency.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1613: American Icon</title>
            <description>Ford Motor Company was in trouble even before that breathless September four years ago that sent the world economy searching for financial oxygen. But armed with a bold strategy and solid leadership, Ford survived the crisis, steering clear of both bankruptcy and government loans. And then as it released some of the new products it had in the pipeline, suddenly the company started making money and the blue oval was back in the black in a big way. That’s the story of how Alan Mulally and his team brought Ford back from the brink as told in the new book “American Icon.” Bryce Hoffman of The Detroit News spent two years engrossed in the culture that Henry Ford built and Alan Mulally arguably saved. On Autoline This Week, John McElroy talks to Mr. Hoffman about “American Icon” and is joined in the discussion by Keith Naughton from Bloomberg News and Jim Hall from 2953 Analytics.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1612: Outraged(Repeat of #1605)</title>
            <description>National Rifle Association members are famous for their passionate slogan “I’ll give you my gun when you take it from my cold, dead hands.” Well, slogans are great but in the end they’re only words. Just ask those American car dealers who, over the last few years, had their franchises unceremoniously ripped from their very live hands and were powerless to stop it. On Autoline This Week John McElroy talks to mega dealer and author Tammy Darvish about her book “Outraged – How Detroit and the Wall Street Car Czars Killed the American Dream” as well as two of her fellow dealers – one former and one still fighting – as they discuss what it’s like to have corporate America try to deal independent business owners a death blow.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1611: Accelerating East(Repeat of #1604)</title>
            <description>China is a communist country with capitalist tastes and the money in the bank to prove it. That’s why nearly all Western automotive manufacturers are now in the country importing, building and selling cars. But despite all this economic attention, Chinese consumers are still a mystery to many in the auto industry. Thank goodness for men like Michael Dunne who packed up and moved to China some 25 years ago. Over that quarter century this automotive consultant has learned plenty about China, its people and manufacturers like General Motors who brought its products east early on. This week on Autoline Michael Dunne joins John McElroy, Sharon Terlep of the Wall Street Journal and David Welch of Bloomberg BusinessWeek to talk about his book “American Wheels, Chinese Roads” and the exploding Chinese automotive market.</description>

            <description>Cadillac has long been known as the Standard of the World when it comes to luxury, but especially cars. However, no matter how good the product, even standards can hit on hard times which is what happened to the brand when it nearly closed its doors in the 1930s. Luckily it was saved by a group of men who, at that time, couldn’t even officially buy the car. On Autoline This Week join host John McElroy, Economic Historian John Steele Gordon, Photographer Bill Gaskins and Blues musician Johnnie Basset for a provocative discussion on how African-American men saved the Cadillac brand.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1609: Mr. Secretary</title>
            <description>Four years ago he was a one of 435, just a seven-term Congressman from a sleepy section of western Illinois. But since then life has been a bit harried to say the least. When Representative Ray LaHood joined the Obama Administration as the 16th Secretary of the Transportation in January 2009 little did he know that he would be presiding over the most dramatic time in the American auto industry since Henry Ford drove his first car around Detroit. From bankruptcies to bailouts to batteries driving green vehicles, his department oversees everything we drive or ride in on the ground or on the water, as well as divisions like the FAA, the FHA and NHSTA to name three. This week on Autoline from the floor of the Washington Auto Show, John McElroy welcomes Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood for an exclusive one-on-one interview on everything automotive and more.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1608: Holding Their Breath</title>
            <description>Children do it out of spite when they don't get their way. They may turn a different color for a bit but the good news is it usually doesn't last very long. However, when economists hold their collective breath that's a bit more mysterious. Being an inexact science, the answer is open for interpretation -- a conservative economist sees it one way while a liberal economist sees it another. There is no agreed avenue to prosperity which is unfortunate especially for those whose business it is to watch the auto industry. Unemployment spikes to near record levels and lo and behold auto sales rise. Huh? It's not supposed to happen that way. Maybe it's time to break out the emergency tea leaves. So as Autoline prepares to examine the automotive outlook in 2012, instead of those tea leaves, John McElroy turns to three top professionals in the auto industry to take a look at what they believe is going to happen around the globe. Joining his panel this week are the Chief Economists from Ford, Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, and her counterpart at General Motors Mustafa Mohatarem along with Charles Chesbrough, IHS Automotive's Senior Principal Economist.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1607: Smile - Part 2</title>
            <description>It was a masterwork in the making that suddenly became the Rip Van Winkle of records. That project was Beach Boy Brian Wilson's 1967 composition "Smile" which was finally released just a few years ago. Given the global economy of late, It's not surprising that car shows have endeared a similar soporific stage. With the auto industry riding a strong wave of creativity and sales throughout the decade, suddenly the 2008 economic meltdown shook the industry to the core -- something that not even auto shows could avoid. Iconic showcases like the North American International Auto Show became mere shadows of what they were just a few years earlier. While some manufacturers offered striped down exhibits, others didn't show up at all. But fast forward three years to the 2012 show where the NAIAS is once again at the top of its game and "Smile" is what manufacturers and the world press were doing as they viewed all the new product. Joining John McElroy on Autoline This Week from the floor of the 2012 Detroit Auto Show are five auto executives who are all smiles indeed. John Maloney is the CEO of Volvo of North America, Klaus Busse the Head of Interior Design at Chrysler, Fred Diaz is the president and CEO of RAM Brand, Ludwig Willisch is the new president of BMW North America, and Max Wolff the Director of Design at Lincoln.</description>

            <itunes:subtitle>Autoline This Week #1606: Smile - Part 1</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>It was a masterwork in the making that suddenly became the Rip Van Winkle of records. That project was Beach Boy Brian Wilson's 1967 composition "Smile" which was finally released just a few years ago. Given the global economy of late, It's not surprising that car shows have endeared a similar soporific stage. With the auto industry riding a strong wave of creativity and sales throughout the decade, suddenly the 2008 economic meltdown shook the industry to the core -- something that not even auto shows could avoid. Iconic showcases like the North American International Auto Show became mere shadows of what they were just a few years earlier. While some manufacturers offered striped down exhibits, others didn't show up at all. But fast forward three years to the 2012 show where the NAIAS is once again at the top of its game and "Smile" is what manufacturers and the world press were doing as they viewed all the new product. Joining John McElroy on Autoline This Week from the floor of the 2012 Detroit Auto Show are three auto executives who are all smiles indeed. Jim Farley is the Group Vice President of Global Marketing for Ford which has been on a roll with its EcoBoost technology, Reid Bigland is the president and CEO of the Dodge Brand which unveiled its hot new Dodge Dart at the show and Mary Barra, GM's Senior VP of Global Product Development whose products have helped the company regain the title as the world's number 1 automaker.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1605: Outraged</title>
            <description>National Rifle Association members are famous for their passionate slogan “I’ll give you my gun when you take it from my cold, dead hands.” Well, slogans are great but in the end they’re only words. Just ask those American car dealers who, over the last few years, had their franchises unceremoniously ripped from their very live hands and were powerless to stop it. On Autoline This Week John McElroy talks to mega dealer and author Tammy Darvish about her book “Outraged – How Detroit and the Wall Street Car Czars Killed the American Dream” as well as two of her fellow dealers – one former and one still fighting – as they discuss what it’s like to have corporate America try to deal independent business owners a death blow.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1604: Accelerating East</title>
            <description>China is a communist country with capitalist tastes and the money in the bank to prove it. That’s why nearly all Western automotive manufacturers are now in the country importing, building and selling cars. But despite all this economic attention, Chinese consumers are still a mystery to many in the auto industry. Thank goodness for men like Michael Dunne who packed up and moved to China some 25 years ago. Over that quarter century this automotive consultant has learned plenty about China, its people and manufacturers like General Motors who brought its products east early on. This week on Autoline Michael Dunne joins John McElroy, Sharon Terlep of the Wall Street Journal and David Welch of Bloomberg BusinessWeek to talk about his book “American Wheels, Chinese Roads” and the exploding Chinese automotive market.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1603: The Cadillac Chronicles</title>
            <description>Cadillac has long been known as the Standard of the World when it comes to luxury, but especially cars. However, no matter how good the product, even standards can hit on hard times which is what happened to the brand when it nearly closed its doors in the 1930s. Luckily it was saved by a group of men who, at that time, couldn’t even officially buy the car. On Autoline This Week join host John McElroy, Economic Historian John Steele Gordon, Photographer Bill Gaskins and Blues musician Johnnie Basset for a provocative discussion on how African-American men saved the Cadillac brand.</description>

            <description>About the same time the great Tina Turner made the phrase “Simply the Best” household words, a group known as NACTOY was creating its own “best.” But this one – built by 50 veteran automotive journalists -- was a list of the top cars and trucks released in North America that year. Since then, every December that jury narrows its list to three candidates and prepares to crown the winner of the North American Car and Truck of the Year at Detroit’s International Auto Show in January. On this week’s Autoline, founding member John McElroy is joined by two of his NACTOY colleagues to talk about the top trucks, SUVs and Crossovers of the year and to predict the winner of this year’s North American Truck of the Year.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1551: Ford's Future?</title>
            <description>In the middle of some of our bleakest economic times, the Blue Oval has strung together a few impressive years. Not only with sales and solid product, but with stability. Something that hasn't been seen in the auto industry for quite a while. And much of the credit has gone to the leadership of its CEO Alan Mulally. But as Mr. Mulally nears retirement people are beginning to ask who will take his place at the helm of the Ford Motor Company. Experts point to the extraordinary bench strength in its boardroom and believe the next leader will come from there, with one the top candidates the company's Executive Vice President and President of the Americas, Mark Fields. And this week Mr. Fields joins John McElroy on Autoline to talk about Ford, its future and the health of the auto industry as a whole. Joining John on his panel are Jean Jennings of Automobile and Jason Stein from Automotive News.</description>

They seemed cut from the same cloth. Single syllable names engaged in undercover work that was linked to exotic cars. The difference is one man, James Bond, is of course a fictional character while Jim Dunne, the original Car Spy, is a real photo journalist with stories that could have been crafted by Ian Fleming himself. But Dunne’s exploits are factual and his pictures were ground breaking as he revealed prototype after prototype much to the chagrin of the OEMs. Long since retired, he now shares these juicy stories in a new book on his career called &quot;Car Spy.&quot; And this week he joins John McElroy on Autoline to discuss those great &quot;gets&quot; from his career. Michelle Krebs from Edmunds.com and Jim Hall from 2953 Analytics join in on the discussion.</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
What sounds like a lawsuit working its way through the U.S. court system is in reality the epic struggle that plagued the American auto industry the last four decades.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And Bob Lutz is the auto executive who has seen it all. Over his nearly 50 years on the inside, he ran BMW, Ford, Chrysler and GM. Now that he’s retired and on the outside he’s pointing out problems with the industry. In his latest book &quot;Car Guys Versus Bean Counters&quot; he spotlights those, he believes, who have hurt the industry the most. And you don’t need an MBA to figure out who he means.&lt;br /&gt;

            <description>Clearing the Haze&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For more than 40 years, one inconspicuous building outside of Ann Arbor, Michigan has been making the air we breathe cleaner. It’s the home of The Environmental Protection Agency’s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory. No engine can be sold in America without its stamp of approval.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week John McElroy gets an exclusive look behind the walls of the Lab as he talks with the EPA’s Chris Grundler about the work they do there, how it impacts the auto industry and the motorized products that we all buy.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1547: Pact It In</title>
            <description>The heavy lifting is finally done, at least for a couple more years. A few weeks ago the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) and Chrysler, Ford and General Motors each reached agreement to continue making cars uninterrupted. In fact, as these things go, the 2011 process was pretty painless. But then it was the first time that -- thanks to the government bailout of Chrysler and GM -- the union's hands were tied on two of the three contracts. No walkouts and no strikes equaled little leverage. And then toss in the weak economy and membership had few options but to approve. Or did they? Was the latest contract in the best interest of the UAW and its members? Did the automakers win big or given the circumstances was it just window dressing? For the answers and analysis on the latest UAW contract John McElroy assembled his Labor Panel to evaluate the winners, losers and whatever. Joining him are Sean McAlinden from the Center for Automotive Research, Joe Szczesny of the Oakland Press (MI) and labor analyst Robert Chiaravalli.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1546: Bigger than the Book</title>
            <description>Most of us have read it at one time or another. The small yellow reference guide that tells you what a used car is worth. Well the National Auto Dealers Association has been publishing that book since 1933 but it’s really the only NADA effort that consumers touch. Most times the group is serving the needs of the more than 17,000 new car and truck dealers in the United States. And each year those members elect one of their own to run the organization. In 2011 Stephen Wade, a multiple brand franchisee from Utah has been leading the U.S. dealer body as they fight to survive our fickle economy. This week John McElroy welcomes Mr. Wade to the Autoline studios to hear what’s going on with the retail end of the business. Joining them on the panel are Steve Finlay of Wardsauto.com and Jeff Bennett from the Wall Street Journal.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1545: 10-Carat Bowtie</title>
            <description>Anniversaries are special. That’s one of the reasons they’re celebrated with a particular metal, element or stone. But rarely do they break out the 10-carat diamond because that denotes 100 years, 10 decades or nearly 37,000 days if you wish. Well, besides making cars, that’s just what the Chevrolet brand has been celebrating throughout 2011. From its namesake founder to its iconic product (Corvette) to its darkest day (GM’s bankruptcy), the bowtie has not only seen it all, but survived it as well. So what better time to take a look at this brand that, in its heyday, separated from General Motors, would’ve been one of the largest companies in the world on its own. That’s why John McElroy and Autoline This Week come to you from GM’s World Headquarters in downtown Detroit, Michigan with special guest Chris Perry, the brand’s global marketing chief. Joining John and Chris as they talk about the first century of Chevrolet and beyond are Mark Phelan of the Detroit Free Press and Frank Markus from Motor Trend.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1544: Design on a Dime</title>
            <description>Auto shows are about the outlandish. Huge displays, science fiction technology and cars, cars, cars. The most eye-catching being those stunning, figments from a Designer’s imagination: The Concepts. Recently in Frankfurt, Germany, John McElroy caught up with three of the more elusive European-based designers for an Autoline exclusive walk-around of their significant reveals at the September show. Joining John at Walkaround Central is Ford’s VP of Global Design J Mays who explains the significance of the Evos and its design language; meanwhile Maserati’s Marco Tencone gives a close-up look John at his high-end Kubang SUV Concept based on the Jeep Grand Cherokee; and finally we get a look at the stunning rear-drive GT Concept from Kia’s Peter Schreyer. All that this week on Autoline.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1543: Once Upon a Car</title>
            <description>Stephen King may have frightened readers all over the world with his twisted tales but he can’t scare Detroit. His imagination pales in comparison to the daily coverage on the travails of the Big Three that greeted readers each and every day just a few years ago. For a city, a state, a country so dependent on the production of the automobile, we all watched in horror as these great institutions nearly ceased to exist. A man with a front row seat to all the inside action has now committed it to paper; a heavier grade than where his normal work resides. Bill Vlasic, Detroit Bureau Chief for the New York Times captures the tumult of the years and the behind-the-scenes intrigue that nearly brought down the Big Three and clearly changed the automotive landscape forever. He joins John McElroy for an exclusive one-on-one talking about his book, "Once Upon a Car” on Autoline this week. </description>

            <description>Every two years the massive Messa in Frankfurt, Germany plays host to one of the largest, if not the largest auto show in the world. Twelve huge buildings with another constructed just for that event alone, it’s the center of the automotive universe for those days in September. This backyard advantage provides the hometown German automakers with the opportunity to impress the auto world with displays the size of zeppelins filled with cutting edge concepts. John McElroy anchors Autoline this week from the site of this biennial show getting the latest from executives for three important German brands, including Jonathan Browning of Volkswagen of America, Ian Robertson from BMW AG and Johan de Nysschen of Audi America.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1541: The End of the Line</title>
            <description>Since that epic day when Henry Ford turned the switch on the assembly line some 85 years ago, manufacturing has been pretty straight. Oh maybe a turn was added here and there as the years went on, and robots, too, but essentially, ever since 1913 automobiles have been made one way and Thomas Crumm says it’s time to blow it up. Literally! John McElroy’s guest on Autoline this week is a former General Motors engineer who writes in his provocative new book “What is Good for General Motors” that the only way for GM to survive into the 21st Century is to destroy the assembly line. And replace it with what. Tune into Autoline and discover how. Joining John in questioning this manufacturing revolutionary is Drew Winter of WardsAuto.com and Gary Vasilash from Automotive Design and Production. </description>

            <description>The Pill box hat, the Mini skirt and the Little Black Dress along with hood ornaments, mood lighting and tail fins. What all six of these obviously different elements have in common are fashion. They just happen to be from two divergent universes: Women’s clothing and automobile design. However, there are times that they cross paths and have done so for 50, 60 some 70 years. And that place is the auto show. The same environment that author Margery Krevsky captures in her book “Sirens of Chrome.” On this week’s Autoline John McElroy talks to Ms. Krevsky and fashion consultant Karen Buscemi about the intersection of automotive and fashion. And don’t miss Autoline’s own Fashion Show where four professional product specialists, as they’re called, model some of the great historic dresses from auto shows past.</description>

            <title>Autoline This Week #1539: Shell Game</title>
            <description>You know the game. It’s been played for years. All it takes are three shells, one pea and a gullible audience to bet money on what is know as a short-con. Well these days there’s another shell game going on, this time with cars; most of them damaged in one way or another. Titles are being washed, VINs cloned and Salvage Pools decimated as used cars disappear into the wild blue yonder. It’s a big problem that not many consumers know exist which is why it’s the topic for this week’s Autoline. John McElroy looks into this “new shell game” with Michael Wilson from the Automotive Recyclers Association and Eric Widmer of Alliance Inspection Management also know as AIM.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1538: Stuck in Time (Repeat of 1530)</title>
            <description>Stuck in Time&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many agree that the auction house Barrett-Jackson has its grips on some of the greatest collector cars in America. But there’s a large group of classic cars just 90 miles off the Florida coast that no collector - try as they might -- has been able to buy-because they reside in the communist country of Cuba.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since the U.S. embargo was enacted in the early ‘60s, no American products have been allowed either into the country, or out. And experts agree, sitting on that small island is a treasure trove of pre-1960 vehicles that many collectors would love to own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During a trip to Cuba John McElroy captured the story of these incredible vehicles and their owners in a short Autoline documentary called &quot;Stuck in Time&quot; which begins this week’s broadcast. John then follows that story with a trip to our studio with two men well steeped in the car collecting culture. McKeel Hagerty knows the value of cars like these since insuring vintage vehicles is part of his business at Hagerty Insurance. And Ken Lingenfelter of Lingenfelter Performance Engineering has been collecting classic cars for years. This week on Autoline they join John to share their thoughts on Cuba, these unique cars and whether or not they’ll ever make it off the island.</description>

            <description>Car Spy&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They seemed cut from the same cloth. Single syllable names engaged in undercover work that was linked to exotic cars. The difference is one man, James Bond, is of course a fictional character while Jim Dunne, the original Car Spy, is a real photo journalist with stories that could have been crafted by Ian Fleming himself. But Dunne’s exploits are factual and his pictures were ground breaking as he revealed prototype after prototype much to the chagrin of the OEMs. Long since retired, he now shares these juicy stories in a new book on his career called &quot;Car Spy.&quot; And this week he joins John McElroy on Autoline to discuss those great &quot;gets&quot; from his career. Michelle Krebs from Edmunds.com and Jim Hall from 2953 Analytics join in on the discussion.</description>

            <description>My 409&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No one seemed to capture the culture of cars better than the Beach Boys. When they weren’t singing about California girls in the early ‘60s they were worshiping hot rods and muscle cars. And those cars, like the songs, seem to get better with age. That’s why those 40 to 50 year old classic cars evolved from a weekend hobby for some, to a collector’s heaven for others. In fact the entire market has been exploding of late. Just ask McKeel Hagerty &amp; Ken Lingenfelter. These successful business owners - Hagerty in insurance, Lingenfelter in engineering - have extensive collections that go far beyond just hot rods. Both men join John McElroy this week on Autoline to discuss the rocketing vintage car market.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1535: Reach Out</title>
            <description>Reach Out&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most would say the soundtrack of U.S. labor union movement is closer to the edgy guitar of Woody Guthrie than the smooth sounds of Burt Bacharach. But it’s a new day at beleaguered unions like the United Auto Workers as they, like the Bacharach song says, &quot;reach out&quot; to not only stay relevant but rebuild a membership that has been collapsing. And that &quot;reaching out&quot; for the UAW is the job of union Vice President Cindy Estrada who joins John McElroy this week on Autoline. Ms. Estrada talks to John and panelists Alisa Priddle of the Detroit News &amp; Joe Szczesny of the Oakland Press about her rise through the UAW and her plans to replenish those dwindling membership ranks.</description>

            <description>Eyes of Silva&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
About the time that the Doobie Brothers burst onto the ‘70s music scene with songs like &quot;China Grove&quot; and &quot;Eyes of Silver,&quot; the design eyes of Walter de’Silva were just coming into focus across the Atlantic at FIAT.  Over the next 40 years his influence could be seen on not only European cars but eventually in global brands like Audi, Bentley and Bugatti as well.  And now in 2011, as the current head of Volkswagen Group Design he is responsible for the look of every model that is created by the eight brands in the group.  This week in a very special edition of Autoline, Walter de’Silva joins John McElroy, Todd Lassa from Motor Trend and Jim Hall of 2953 Analytics for a look inside the fascinating world of automotive design.</description>

With the auto industry as volatile as ever, it pays to have a good analyst to keep an eye where it might be heading. Well, this week Autoline has invited three of the best in the business to discuss the issues driving the industry. Joining John McElroy is Jessica Caldwell from Edmunds, IHS Automotive’s Michael Robinet and Jeff Schuster of J.D. Power and Associates. The group talks about a variety of issues including, slowing car sales, the impact of alternative vehicles and Asia’s continuing affect on the global industry.</description>

            <description>The Union Label&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Change has been the theme at the United Auto Workers union for the last few years. As it fought to keep members and jobs, it met face-to-face with today’s economic reality: Bankrupt automakers, unprofitable corporations and strong non-union foreign transplants. But now, with the UAW’s new president Bob King firmly in control, a new reality is taking shape.&lt;br /&gt;

Joining John McElroy to discuss where the UAW goes from here is Sean McAlinden from the Center for Automotive Research, Robert Chiaravalli, the president of Strategic Labor &amp; Human Resources and Joe Szczesny of the Oakland Press.</description>

            <description>Vote Early and Often&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rough-and-tumble world of Chicago politics is often given credit for the mantra &quot;vote early and often.&quot; Even though not a legal option, it may not be bad advice when it comes to those car-of-the-year candidates. In fact, there are so many new vehicles being released by manufacturers each year it comes out to almost one per week. That makes it tough for auto reporters who need to drive and evaluate each one of them and then get the word out to their readers, listeners or viewers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well tough or not, John McElroy was able to convince two of his North American Car &amp; Truck of the Year judges him to join him on this week’s Autoline to talk the latest in vehicles. Car &amp; Driver’s dynamic duo of Tony Swan and Eddie Alterman sit in on this week’s broadcast to evaluate what they’ve already driven, and what may be coming before the end of the year.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1530: Stuck in Time</title>
            <description>Stuck in Time&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many agree that the auction house Barrett-Jackson has its grips on some of the greatest collector cars in America. But there’s a large group of classic cars just 90 miles off the Florida coast that no collector - try as they might -- has been able to buy-because they reside in the communist country of Cuba.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since the U.S. embargo was enacted in the early ‘60s, no American products have been allowed either into the country, or out. And experts agree, sitting on that small island is a treasure trove of pre-1960 vehicles that many collectors would love to own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During a trip to Cuba John McElroy captured the story of these incredible vehicles and their owners in a short Autoline documentary called &quot;Stuck in Time&quot; which begins this week’s broadcast. John then follows that story with a trip to our studio with two men well steeped in the car collecting culture. McKeel Hagerty knows the value of cars like these since insuring vintage vehicles is part of his business at Hagerty Insurance. And Ken Lingenfelter of Lingenfelter Performance Engineering has been collecting classic cars for years. This week on Autoline they join John to share their thoughts on Cuba, these unique cars and whether or not they’ll ever make it off the island.</description>

Many agree that the auction house Barrett-Jackson has its grips on some of the greatest collector cars in America. But there’s a large group of classic cars just 90 miles off the Florida coast that no collector - try as they might -- has been able to buy-because they reside in the communist country of Cuba.

Since the U.S. embargo was enacted in the early ‘60s, no American products have been allowed either into the country, or out. And experts agree, sitting on that small island is a treasure trove of pre-1960 vehicles that many collectors would love to own.

During a trip to Cuba John McElroy captured the story of these incredible vehicles and their owners in a short Autoline documentary called &quot;Stuck in Time&quot; which begins this week’s broadcast. John then follows that story with a trip to our studio with two men well steeped in the car collecting culture. McKeel Hagerty knows the value of cars like these since insuring vintage vehicles is part of his business at Hagerty Insurance. And Ken Lingenfelter of Lingenfelter Performance Engineering has been collecting classic cars for years. This week on Autoline they join John to share their thoughts on Cuba, these unique cars and whether or not they’ll ever make it off the island.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Autoline #1529: Chain Links</title>
            <description>Chain Links&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More than ever before, auto manufacturers rely on suppliers to produce and provide parts for today’s vehicles, especially those on the top called Tier Ones. And there are few Tier Ones bigger than Bosch’s Automotive division. Take North America as an example. Just last year it was responsible for $5.6 Billion in sales employing more than 13,000. The man in charge of the Americas for Bosch is Peter Marks where he not only oversees automotive, but the group’s entire business including healthcare, a variety of technologies and even consumer goods. This week on Autoline, John McElroy welcomes Robert Bosch North American Chairman, President and CEO Peter Marks along with our panelists Michelle Krebs fro Edmunds.com and Tom Murphy from WardsAuto.com.</description>

            <description>Eyes of Silva&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
About the time that the Doobie Brothers burst onto the ‘70s music scene with songs like &quot;China Grove&quot; and &quot;Eyes of Silver,&quot; the design eyes of Walter de’Silva were just coming into focus across the Atlantic at FIAT.  Over the next 40 years his influence could be seen on not only European cars but eventually in global brands like Audi, Bentley and Bugatti as well.  And now in 2011, as the current head of Volkswagen Group Design he is responsible for the look of every model that is created by the eight brands in the group.  This week in a very special edition of Autoline, Walter de’Silva joins John McElroy, Todd Lassa from Motor Trend and Jim Hall of 2953 Analytics for a look inside the fascinating world of automotive design.</description>

            <description>Oval Shine&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Glass House has been glistening more than usual of late. Whether it’s profits or products, Ford has been on quite a roll. Alan Mulally, the company’s president &amp; CEO receives much of the credit, but he’s quick to share the spotlight with his team. And one of those executives who has played a big part in that success is Derek Kuzak, the Group Vice President in charge of Global Product Development. This week on Autoline he joins John McElroy to discuss the Ford product trail and where it leads into the future. Joining John on the Autoline panel are Tony Swan from Car &amp; Driver and Paul Eisenstein of the Detroit Bureau.</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
What sounds like a lawsuit working its way through the U.S. court system is in reality the epic struggle that plagued the American auto industry the last four decades.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And Bob Lutz is the auto executive who has seen it all. Over his nearly 50 years on the inside, he ran BMW, Ford, Chrysler and GM. Now that he’s retired and on the outside he’s pointing out problems with the industry. In his latest book &quot;Car Guys Versus Bean Counters&quot; he spotlights those, he believes, who have hurt the industry the most. And you don’t need an MBA to figure out who he means.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week the man known as &quot;Maximum Bob&quot; joins John McElroy on Autoline along with panelists Csaba Csere and Peter De Lorenzo to discuss his book and the industry he devoted his life to.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1524: The New Guard (Repeat of 1518)</title>
            <description>The New Guard&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ad agencies tend to have a long shelf life at GM. Buick signed McCann-Erickson in 1958 while Chevy and Campbell-Ewald went all the way back to 1919. That was until the 2009 bankruptcy. And that was until Joel Ewanick.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ewanick was the Hyundai marketing guru who made actor Jeff Bridges the voice of the Korean automaker and subsequently improved sales. He joined GM in 2010 as VP of U.S. marketing and was quickly named the automaker&apos;s global chief marketing officer in only 6 months. Ewanick moves decisively and has a &quot;take no prisoners&quot; mentality. Just ask any of GM&apos;s old ad agencies. He changed each one in less than a year which was pretty historic at Chevy; that&apos;s something the brand hadn&apos;t done in nearly a century.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week John McElroy welcomes special guest Joel Ewanick for his first visit to Autoline. He is joined by Chrissie Thompson of the Detroit Free Press and Peter De Lorenzo of Autoextremist.com.</description>

            <description>Dodge &amp; Designs&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&apos;d think being in charge of design for an automaker would be a big enough job, but not for Ralph Gilles. As the designer of the iconic 2005 Chrysler 300, he was promoted to oversee design for all 5 of the company&apos;s brands. But in addition, when CEO Sergio Marchionne started handing out second assignments, Gilles was tagged to run the Dodge brand as well. On this week&apos;s Autoline he not only discusses the demands of both jobs but also Chrysler&apos;s rapid renaissance with both product and sales. Host John McElroy is joined by Natalie Neff from AutoWeek and Jeff Gilbert from CBS Radio Detroit-WWJ 950.</description>

            <description>The Union Label&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Change has been the theme at the United Auto Workers union for the last few years. As it fought to keep members and jobs, it met face-to-face with today’s economic reality: Bankrupt automakers, unprofitable corporations and strong non-union foreign transplants. But now, with the UAW’s new president Bob King firmly in control, a new reality is taking shape.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joining John McElroy to discuss where the UAW goes from here is Sean McAlinden from the Center for Automotive Research, Robert Chiaravalli, the president of Strategic Labor &amp; Human Resources and Joe Szczesny of the Oakland Press.</description>

            <description>What’s Next&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Technology has been transforming the car today more than ever. Since its beginning, the auto industry has always pushed the envelope when it comes to power, ride and design. But these days consumers are demanding more and more. Whether it’s under the hood or in the cloud, a vehicle’s technology is now a top buyer consideration.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paul Mascarenas knows that more than most. He is Ford’s chief technical officer, in other words, the man in charge of research and development. This week he joins John McElroy to discuss the company’s leading edge technology and what’s next.</description>

            <itunes:summary>What’s Next

Technology has been transforming the car today more than ever. Since its beginning, the auto industry has always pushed the envelope when it comes to power, ride and design. But these days consumers are demanding more and more. Whether it’s under the hood or in the cloud, a vehicle’s technology is now a top buyer consideration.

Paul Mascarenas knows that more than most. He is Ford’s chief technical officer, in other words, the man in charge of research and development. This week he joins John McElroy to discuss the company’s leading edge technology and what’s next.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Autoline #1520: Clearing the Haze</title>
            <description>Clearing the Haze&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For more than 40 years, one inconspicuous building outside of Ann Arbor, Michigan has been making the air we breathe cleaner. It’s the home of The Environmental Protection Agency’s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory. No engine can be sold in America without its stamp of approval.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week John McElroy gets an exclusive look behind the walls of the Lab as he talks with the EPA’s Chris Grundler about the work they do there, how it impacts the auto industry and the motorized products that we all buy.</description>

            <description>The Profit Chain&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&apos;s been a tough couple years in the automotive supply chain. Tough for everybody it seems except for BorgWarner. The century-old global giant reported record sales and profits for last year and even registered a profit for 2009 during the great collapse. Obviously the company is doing something right. And among the items this Tier One automotive supplier has checked on its list are designing new parts for 21st Century vehicles while still producing those for its bread and butter: today&apos;s combustible engines.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joining John McElroy to discuss a variety of topics including new technologies, the Chinese auto market and the interruption in the supply chain is BorgWarner Chairman and CEO Tim Manganello. Joann Muller from Forbes and Mark Clothier of Bloomberg News round out this week&apos;s Autoline panel.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1518: The New Guard</title>
            <description>The New Guard&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ad agencies tend to have a long shelf life at GM. Buick signed McCann-Erickson in 1958 while Chevy and Campbell-Ewald went all the way back to 1919. That was until the 2009 bankruptcy. And that was until Joel Ewanick.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ewanick was the Hyundai marketing guru who made actor Jeff Bridges the voice of the Korean automaker and subsequently improved sales. He joined GM in 2010 as VP of U.S. marketing and was quickly named the automaker&apos;s global chief marketing officer in only 6 months. Ewanick moves decisively and has a &quot;take no prisoners&quot; mentality. Just ask any of GM&apos;s old ad agencies. He changed each one in less than a year which was pretty historic at Chevy; that&apos;s something the brand hadn&apos;t done in nearly a century.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week John McElroy welcomes special guest Joel Ewanick for his first visit to Autoline. He is joined by Chrissie Thompson of the Detroit Free Press and Peter De Lorenzo of Autoextremist.com.</description>

            <description>Washington&apos;s Auto Influence&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From all the bailout coverage the past few years, you might&apos;ve thought that automakers only looked to Washington for money. But in reality, the Department of Transportation is involved with every OEM in one way or the other. Take Patrick Davis for instance. He runs a DOT office that searches for new fuels and groundbreaking batteries for electrics and hybrids. Over at the EPA, Margo Oge, who&apos;s in charge of, among other things, emissions, has a phalanx of staff who test every engine and the fuels that run them. And then on the flip side there are executives like Daimler&apos;s Jake Jones who works with the government on programs like the company&apos;s new Student Driving Academy. All three guests join John McElroy from the floor of this year&apos;s Washington Auto Show.</description>

            <description>Dodge &amp; Designs&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&apos;d think being in charge of design for an automaker would be a big enough job, but not for Ralph Gilles. As the designer of the iconic 2005 Chrysler 300, he was promoted to oversee design for all 5 of the company&apos;s brands. But in addition, when CEO Sergio Marchionne started handing out second assignments, Gilles was tagged to run the Dodge brand as well. On this week&apos;s Autoline he not only discusses the demands of both jobs but also Chrysler&apos;s rapid renaissance with both product and sales. Host John McElroy is joined by Natalie Neff from AutoWeek and Jeff Gilbert from CBS Radio Detroit-WWJ 950.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1515: Two Triple Cheese</title>
            <description>Two Triple Cheese&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What would prompt you to pull off the road while driving? Well, for Commander Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen -- you know, the &quot;Hot Rod Lincoln&quot; guys -- it was the mere thought of their favorite food which they sang about in the &apos;70s culinary classic, &quot;Two Triple Cheese Side Order of Fries.&quot;
&lt;br /&gt;
But 30 years later no one seems to be pulling off the road for much of anything. Certainly not for eating evidenced by the galaxy of restaurant drive-up windows; not for phone calls thanks to cell towers &amp; electronics; and now not for the latest eye-averting activity -- texting.
&lt;br /&gt;
These days distracted driving appears to be running rampant. It used to be that your biggest distraction was lunging for the radio whenever that &quot;Titanic&quot; song came on. Instead, today drivers of all ages are multi-tasking behind the wheel leaving one to ask just when did piloting 3,000 pounds of metal at 70 miles per hour become a second or third thought, and is there anything we can do about it?
&lt;br /&gt;
For answers to those questions and more tune into this week&apos;s Autoline where John McElroy and his panel tackles the issue that&apos;s confronting everyone on the road today, distracted driving. He&apos;s joined by three experts who have had an impact on the issue in different arenas. Louis Tijerina is a safety engineer with Ford while Paul Green is with the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute. John&apos;s third guest, Buzz Thomas, is a former Michigan State Senator who had a hand in crafting an anti-texting law in his state.</description>

            <description>Motors and Parts&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Antifreeze was created to start cars and not necessarily brands. But sometimes the stars align -- or in this case the Pentastars -- giving the world a 75-year old company that&apos;s still going strong. Such was the humble beginning of Mopar, Chrysler Corporation Parts. From a name developed for cans of antifreeze to, can you say the word HEMI, Mopar has a rich heritage in engineering, accessories and replacement parts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But today as manufacturers look to find new revenue streams some, including Chrysler, are turning to their brands like Mopar for that growth. And that&apos;s what Pietro Gorlier, the president and CEO of Mopar is doing with service, parts and even with vehicles themselves. This week on Autoline Mr. Gorlier joins John McElroy to discuss the brand and where he and his team are targeting that growth.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1513: Turnaround</title>
            <description>Turnaround&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you happen to be in a jazz band, a turnaround -- chords that take you back to an earlier part of the song -- is something easy that you do all the time. If you&apos;re an executive in the auto industry, a turnaround is a massive undertaking with no guarantee of success. Welcome to Mark Reuss&apos; world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a GM legacy, Mark&apos;s father Lloyd was president of General Motors in the early &apos;90s, he witnessed the ups and downs of this automotive giant from a closer vantage point than others. As the boss&apos; son and then an employee, he rode the company roller coaster like everyone else until, as a corporate executive, he was there when they finally ran out of track and declared bankruptcy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But since that point the GM turnaround has taken hold. And as head of North America, earlier this year Mark&apos;s operation helped GM achieve its largest profit since 2004. There&apos;s still a lot more work to be done but things are back on the right track...and right now there&apos;s plenty of it. This week on Autoline, GM&apos;s Mark Reuss joins John McElroy and his panel to discuss GM, its brands and where it goes from here.</description>

But since that point the GM turnaround has taken hold. And as head of North America, earlier this year Mark&apos;s operation helped GM achieve its largest profit since 2004. There&apos;s still a lot more work to be done but things are back on the right track...and right now there&apos;s plenty of it. This week on Autoline, GM&apos;s Mark Reuss joins John McElroy and his panel to discuss GM, its brands and where it goes from here.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Autoline #1512: Here Comes the Sun (Repeat of 1505)</title>
            <description>Here Comes the Sun&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This January, 2011 Detroit seemed to be channeling 1969 London for a time. That&apos;s when Beatle George Harrison, to escape the burdens of the business world, took some time off to commune with nature and stroll around the home gardens of friend Eric Clapton. With a clear head, he emerged with his epic song &quot;Here Comes the Sun;&quot; a tune that 42-years later you could almost hear walking around the floor of this year&apos;s North American International Auto Show.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gone was the financial gloom of the 2009 NAIAS as well as the shrunken floor space from 12 months ago. This year Detroit welcomed back big aisles, bigger reveals and even some big names -- like Porsche -- who had been staying away. Here comes the sun, indeed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week Autoline captures a little bit of these sunnier climes with four interviews from the floor of Cobo Hall. Joining John McElroy from Detroit, in order of appearance, are: Adrian Hallmark, the Global Brand Director for Jaguar; the President and Co-CEO of IAC Group North America and Asia, James Kamsickas; Scott Strong, the Director of Interior Design for Ford Americas; and the COO and CFO of Subaru of America, Tom Doll.</description>

            <description>Travels with Farley&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The headline might look vaguely familiar. Think early 1960s where it borrows everything but the &quot;Ch&quot; from author John Steinbeck&apos;s famous travelogue &quot;Travels with Charley.&quot; But where that work involved a camper, dog and the continental United States, &quot;Travels with Farley&quot; features a camera crew, a cutting-edge crossover and the hillsides of southern France. Oh, and not to mention a conversation with Ford&apos;s Global Marketing Chief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week on Autoline join John McElroy as he and Ford&apos;s Jim Farley roam the French countryside, in a brand new C-Max crossover, and talk marketing, comebacks and cars, cars, cars. Some of the topics Jim covers during their conversation include his early days in the business, Ford&apos;s refound success and the company&apos;s plans and hopes for its new-to-the-USA crossover, the C-Max.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Autoline #1510: Technotronic (Repeat of 1503)</title>
            <description>Technotronic&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you&apos;re looking for an example of a huge fast marketing splash, few have been more effective than Jo Bogaert. He&apos;s the Belgian music producer who, in 1988, created the &quot;Techtronic&quot; sound that spread like wildfire over land, air and ocean to seemingly everything and every place that played music. His global hit single &quot;Pump Up the Jam&quot; with vocalist Ya Kid K was ubiquitous whether you were at a club in New York, an elevator in Tokyo or a cafe in Paris. The song and the sound spread like Kudzu and kept its grip on world music well into this decade.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jim Newton wouldn&apos;t discourage a &quot;viral&quot; splash like that, but both he and his clients would really prefer to build it themselves. And that&apos;s exactly what they&apos;re doing at Tech Shop. Mr. Newton is the founder of this nationwide nirvana for those who never got enough of Industrial Arts in high school. But actually Tech Shop is much more since it allows anyone with a manufacturing idea, to create, design &amp; produce that dream all for about the cost of joining your local YMCA.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For this week&apos;s special &quot;On-the-Road&quot; edition of Autoline, John McElroy takes you inside the original Menlo Park, California Tech Shop location. Here you&apos;ll meet some of the members of this creative community, experience their dreams coming to life and see why this idea is already spreading Technotronic-like across America, perhaps coming soon to a neighborhood near you.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1509: Blipvert</title>
            <description>Blipvert&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember the computerized character MAX HEADROOM? In the fictional future that he called home, television corporations, not governments, ran the world. And what ran television was advertising. In fact, a high-speed, super concentrated three-second dangerous version called blipverts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, despite its continuing influence on our 21st Century culture, television isn&apos;t quite the ogre as the show&apos;s creators imagined. Plus advertising is still viewed in manageable 15, 30 and 60-second doses. But what they didn&apos;t miss was the ongoing symbiotic relationship of the two. A relationship that goes on display to the world&apos;s largest television audience each year during the NFL&apos;s Super Bowl.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So far there have been 45 Super Bowls played which means 45 sets of advertisers as well. Over the years the auto industry has played a major role in both creativity and content. In 2011, nine separate automotive manufacturers populated the game with nearly 20 different ads spending in excess of $50-million dollars. On this week&apos;s Autoline, John McElroy and his panel of advertising experts examine the Super Bowl and see if the automakers got their money&apos;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But in addition to our Super Bowl ad discussion, John also has his panel look at what the OEMs and their agencies were doing in the months leading up to that big day. With so many automotive accounts having changed hands last year, there&apos;s a lot more than just new creative driving these campaigns. Joining John McElroy on his advertising panel are Jean Halliday from AutoAdOpolis, David Kiley of AOL Autos and Advertising Age and Gary Topolewski, an award-winning advertising creative director.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1508: The DC Dance</title>
            <description>The DC Dance&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If recent history is any guide, many Americans believe that the easiest way to reform our government is to attend a couple of town hall meetings, kick some politicians out of office and wait for the inevitable change to come. However there&apos;s a flaw in that formula, and it has nothing to do with the three branches of government, the Fourth Estate or the voters themselves. The formula simply doesn&apos;t account for three little letters that spell out the powerful acronym NGO.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Non-governmental organizations have a mighty hold over how Washington works. Their influence blankets everything from monetary policy to drug laws to environmental edicts. And whether they&apos;re called think tanks, foundations or associations, these organizations are the pipeline through which much political influence travels. The kind of influence that molds many of our laws, especially those that effect the auto industry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&apos;s why, on a recent trip to the Washington Auto Show, John McElroy made it a point to catch up with two of these DC insiders, along with a California outsider, to talk about our all-around federal automotive policies. Daniel Weiss is a Senior Fellow at the left-leaning Center for American Progress while Fred Smith is the president and founder of the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute. Both card-carrying members of the Washington NGO fraternity. Meanwhile, rounding out the panel is Ron Cogan, the editor of Green Car Journal and GreenCar.com, a leading outlet for green transportation information. And though it&apos;s based on the west coast, most of its content is driven by what happens in Washington.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So check out this week&apos;s Autoline and see why the auto industry, at times, looks a little dizzy thanks to the DC Dance.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1507: Mighty Clouds of Joy</title>
            <description>Mighty Clouds of Joy&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since his appearance in last week&apos;s Super Bowl commercial, many have automatically linked Chrysler with the gritty music of the artist Eminem. And while the soundtrack of &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; worked as a reflection of Detroit&apos;s streets, the song that may in fact be more relevant to the company today has its roots in 1971.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given where Chrysler was just 20 months ago, the music that seems to best capture the emotions coming out of its Auburn Hills headquarters is the 40-year-old pop tune &quot;Mighty Clouds of Joy.&quot; As the company continues to introduce its well-reviewed new or significantly refreshed products -- vehicles that they were working on throughout those dark days of bankruptcy -- lines from the song like &quot;those old storm clouds are slowly drifting by&quot; take on a whole new meaning. Just ask some of those who were there...which is exactly what John McElroy does in this week&apos;s edition of Autoline.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joining John on an all-Chrysler panel are three company veterans who, like many, witnessed the bad times but kept pushing ahead because of the product. Joe Dehner, the head of Dodge Design, Chris Barman, the VLE of E-Segment vehicles and Klaus Busse the head of Interior Design, all talk with John about Chrysler -- the company, its people but most importantly its new product -- and where they all go from here.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1506: High Cotton</title>
            <description>High Cotton&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Three hundred years ago when cotton was king, the tallest and healthiest plants were the most valued. Farmers were said to be in &quot;high cotton&quot; when they had a bumper crop of plants like those because it translated directly to their status and wealth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These days the phrase &quot;high cotton&quot; may be a bit dated, however, it still carries the distinction of wealth. And during January&apos;s North American International Auto Show in Detroit, there was no one sitting in &quot;higher cotton&quot; than those few who were invited to &quot;The Gallery.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A few years ago, to cater to the customer that F. Scott Fitzgerald described as being &quot;different from you and me,&quot; the Detroit Auto Dealers Association, sponsors of the NAIAS, developed this special preview of the most exclusive vehicles at the auto show for the crowd that Fitzgerald termed &quot;the very rich.&quot; Well, if the Rolls-Royce fits...and in this case it does. As does the Maybach, the Bentley, the Maserati and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Join John McElroy as he takes his cameras behind-the-scenes and into a world that even Jay Gatsby couldn&apos;t imagine. He&apos;ll talk to the men behind the event as well as dealers and customers who crossed the country to attend it. Why he even catches up with celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck who developed an exclusive meal for this very exclusive group. It&apos;s a peek inside &quot;The Gallery,&quot; this week on Autoline.</description>

Three hundred years ago when cotton was king, the tallest and healthiest plants were the most valued. Farmers were said to be in &quot;high cotton&quot; when they had a bumper crop of plants like those because it translated directly to their status and wealth.

These days the phrase &quot;high cotton&quot; may be a bit dated, however, it still carries the distinction of wealth. And during January&apos;s North American International Auto Show in Detroit, there was no one sitting in &quot;higher cotton&quot; than those few who were invited to &quot;The Gallery.&quot;

            <title>Autoline #1505: Here Comes the Sun</title>
            <description>Here Comes the Sun&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This January, 2011 Detroit seemed to be channeling 1969 London for a time. That&apos;s when Beatle George Harrison, to escape the burdens of the business world, took some time off to commune with nature and stroll around the home gardens of friend Eric Clapton. With a clear head, he emerged with his epic song &quot;Here Comes the Sun;&quot; a tune that 42-years later you could almost hear walking around the floor of this year&apos;s North American International Auto Show.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gone was the financial gloom of the 2009 NAIAS as well as the shrunken floor space from 12 months ago. This year Detroit welcomed back big aisles, bigger reveals and even some big names -- like Porsche -- who had been staying away. Here comes the sun, indeed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week Autoline captures a little bit of these sunnier climes with four interviews from the floor of Cobo Hall. Joining John McElroy from Detroit, in order of appearance, are: Adrian Hallmark, the Global Brand Director for Jaguar; the President and Co-CEO of IAC Group North America and Asia, James Kamsickas; Scott Strong, the Director of Interior Design for Ford Americas; and the COO and CFO of Subaru of America, Tom Doll.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1504: Travels with Farley</title>
            <description>Travels with Farley&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The headline might look vaguely familiar. Think early 1960s where it borrows everything but the &quot;Ch&quot; from author John Steinbeck&apos;s famous travelogue &quot;Travels with Charley.&quot; But where that work involved a camper, dog and the continental United States, &quot;Travels with Farley&quot; features a camera crew, a cutting-edge crossover and the hillsides of southern France. Oh, and not to mention a conversation with Ford&apos;s Global Marketing Chief.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week on Autoline join John McElroy as he and Ford&apos;s Jim Farley roam the French countryside, in a brand new C-Max crossover, and talk marketing, comebacks and cars, cars, cars. Some of the topics Jim covers during their conversation include his early days in the business, Ford&apos;s refound success and the company&apos;s plans and hopes for its new-to-the-USA crossover, the C-Max.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Autoline #1503: Technotronic</title>
            <description>Technotronic&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you&apos;re looking for an example of a huge fast marketing splash, few have been more effective than Jo Bogaert. He&apos;s the Belgian music producer who, in 1988, created the &quot;Techtronic&quot; sound that spread like wildfire over land, air and ocean to seemingly everything and every place that played music. His global hit single &quot;Pump Up the Jam&quot; with vocalist Ya Kid K was ubiquitous whether you were at a club in New York, an elevator in Tokyo or a cafe in Paris. The song and the sound spread like Kudzu and kept its grip on world music well into this decade.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jim Newton wouldn&apos;t discourage a &quot;viral&quot; splash like that, but both he and his clients would really prefer to build it themselves. And that&apos;s exactly what they&apos;re doing at Tech Shop. Mr. Newton is the founder of this nationwide nirvana for those who never got enough of Industrial Arts in high school. But actually Tech Shop is much more since it allows anyone with a manufacturing idea, to create, design &amp; produce that dream all for about the cost of joining your local YMCA.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For this week&apos;s special &quot;On-the-Road&quot; edition of Autoline, John McElroy takes you inside the original Menlo Park, California Tech Shop location. Here you&apos;ll meet some of the members of this creative community, experience their dreams coming to life and see why this idea is already spreading Technotronic-like across America, perhaps coming soon to a neighborhood near you.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1502: NACTOY&apos;s New Day?</title>
            <description>NACTOY&apos;s New Day?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since 1994, the first awarding of the North American Car of the Year, there has been a parade each year of three finalists with one winner. Amid the 48 contenders and 16 eventual winners with their sleek designs and top-notch engineering there&apos;s been only one car that many observers considered a gateway to the 21st Century, and that was the Toyota Prius Hybrid. Well, it may be 11 years later but welcome to the 21st Century.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This year the more than 50 jurors of the North American Car of the Year chose not just one but two ground-breaking finalists by adding both the Chevy Volt plug-in and Nissan&apos;s Electric LEAF to its final three. But let&apos;s not forget the third member of the COY finalists, Hyundai&apos;s hot-selling Sonata, with its more standard internal combustion engine which received review after glowing review throughout 2010.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On this week&apos;s Autoline, NACTOY founding member John McElroy is joined by two of his fellow jurors, Eddie Alterman from Car &amp; Driver and Marty Padgett from High Gear Media, as they discuss all three finalists, what they mean to the auto industry and who they each believe will be the 2011 North American Car of the Year.</description>

            <description>King of the &quot;NACTOY&quot; Hill&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks to producer/animator Mike Judge, most people connect &quot;King of the Hill&quot; with the former Fox TV series. And though there&apos;s a lot to be said for a 12-year old cartoon series that centered on one character and his life with propane, here at Autoline any &quot;King of the Hill&quot; reference points to one word and one word only, and of course that word is TRUCK! And this time of year when you talk truck, you&apos;re talking about three specific trucks or SUVs -- as the case may be -- who end up as our own &quot;Kings of the Hill,&quot; better known as the finalists for the North American Truck of the Year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&apos;s right, twelve months have flown by and left us with the latest top three trucks voted on by the jurors of NACTOY -- the North American Car and Truck of the Year Awards. These finalists -- Ford&apos;s Explorer, Jeep&apos;s Grand Cherokee and the Dodge Durango -- have been narrowed down from a long list of top-notch candidates with the winner to be revealed at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit January 10th.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joining Autoline host and original juror John McElroy to talk about these finalists and who may be crowned this year&apos;s &quot;King of the Hill&quot; are fellow NACTOY jurors Larry Webster from Popular Mechanics and Chris Paukert of Autoblog.com.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1439: Roman Holiday</title>
            <description>Roman Holiday&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was the movie that turned a trio into stars. Even though William Holden was arguably already there and his leading lady Audrey Hepburn was well on her way, the romantic comedy &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; really focused the spotlight on the third star of this 1953 movie, the Italian motor scooter Vespa. As the trio whipped around Rome it sold us on the delights of small lightweight Italian transportation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now fast forward to 2010, and small Italian transportation is poised to make a comeback here in America as the FIAT brand returns to the market thanks to its tie-in with Chrysler. Even as Sergio Marchionne has been putting the Pentastar pieces back together so Chrysler, Dodge, Ram &amp; Jeep all have viable futures in the industry, at the same time he is ready to unleash his own brand back into the American car culture. The dealers have been chosen and they&apos;re getting ready to showcase the first FIAT product in years, the small, nimble Cinquecento better know as the 500.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And the person in charge of the North American reemergence of the FIAT brand joins John McElroy on this week&apos;s Autoline. Laura Soave is well aware of what FIAT stands for. Not just from last few months of running the brand here in the Americas but from her Italian heritage and spending time growing up in Europe. She has an interesting task in front of her as she tries to resurrect a brand that disappeared from American shoes for a variety of reasons, none of them good. Joining John on his journalist panel to discuss the future of FIAT is Alisa Priddle from The Detroit News and Tim Higgins from Bloomberg News.</description>

And the person in charge of the North American reemergence of the FIAT brand joins John McElroy on this week&apos;s Autoline. Laura Soave is well aware of what FIAT stands for. Not just from last few months of running the brand here in the Americas but from her Italian heritage and spending time growing up in Europe. She has an interesting task in front of her as she tries to resurrect a brand that disappeared from American shoes for a variety of reasons, none of them good. Joining John on his journalist panel to discuss the future of FIAT is Alisa Priddle from The Detroit News and Tim Higgins from Bloomberg News.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Autoline #1438: Innocence Lost</title>
            <description>Innocence Lost&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was a seismic shift 45 years ago. And as all change goes it was unwelcome at the time. So much in fact, that in a manner of fifteen short minutes it transformed a cultural hero to social pariah, all thanks to the innocence of choice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But that&apos;s what happened on July 25, 1965 at the prestigious Newport Folk Festival when Bob Dylan plugged in, turned on and embraced the sound electric. The audience reaction was an early version of shock and awe. His fans became horrified that he had abandoned his acoustic legacy when he launched into an electric version of &quot;Maggie&apos;s Farm.&quot; But in reality what they didn&apos;t know was that he was simply evolving as an artist as evidenced by the success of his beloved &quot;Like A Rolling Stone,&quot; which had been recorded just days before the event. It was clear he was moving on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For more than 100 years the internal combustion engine has driven the car. And though it continues to be tweaked and improved to the point where automotive&apos;s pioneers might not even recognize today&apos;s highly-efficient ICEs, evolution persists. We&apos;ve been talking alternatives for years -- hybrids, PZEVs, Natural Gas and Hydrogen have all piqued our interest, but our muse has always been electrics. So much promise, so much promised, so much never delivered. But finally like Dylan, we&apos;re starting to move on...welcome to the world of the Nissan LEAF.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On this week&apos;s Autoline John McElroy travels to Tennessee -- a state that brought human evolution to the headlines last century -- to talk about the evolution of the car this century as the LEAF goes electric. John gets a deep dive on the car from Nissan Product Planner Mark Perry while marketing chief Jon Brancheau talks to him how they are rolling it out across the country. In addition, John drives the LEAF all around the city of Nashville and gives you his impressions of this first mass produced all-electric pioneer.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1437: Politics as Unusual</title>
            <description>Politics as Unusual&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has the American public ever been so fickle? Two years ago the country went heavily Democratic. This year the pendulum swung strongly Republican. Who knows what next two years hold in store. But what we need to know is: what does this mean for the auto industry?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New fuel economy standards, stricter CO2 legislation, generous EV subsidies, the controversial cap and trade policy, our free trade policy, and the Employee Free Choice Act are all on the agenda. Or, at least they were. Thanks to the mid-term elections, committee chairmanships are switching from one party to the other. That means the legislation agenda is going to switch as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To learn about how the agenda will change, and to put a name to faces of who’s going to be running the show, this week’s Autoline is all about the abrupt about-face in the American political scene. Joining host John McElroy on the show are Nolan Finley, the Editorial Page Editor of the Detroit News, and co-host of the public television program &quot;Am I Right?,&quot; as well as Edward Lapham, the Executive Editor of Automotive News.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1436: Movin&apos; On Up</title>
            <description>Movin&apos; On Up&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The 1970s was the touchstone for transformation in two important American industries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The world of television was changed forever by producer Norman Lear with ground-breaking shows like &apos;All In The Family&apos; and its successful spinoff whose theme song has given us this week&apos;s headline, &apos;The Jeffersons.&apos;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But at the same time that TV was &quot;movin&apos; on up&quot; the U.S. automotive industry was starting a decades long decline. Fueled by OPEC in tandem with the rise of the imports, the Big Three produced model after model of lower quality cars and they began to pay the price. And we all know what price they eventually paid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But since the start of the new century the &apos;downgraded&apos; Detroit Three have been on the road back. Designing and building better cars that are not only attracting both old and new customers into showrooms, but they&apos;re starting to appear on lists that many consumers use to shop for vehicles. One of those tabulations -- the Consumer Reports Reliability Rankings -- was just released and David Champion, the Senior Director of its Auto Test Division joins John McElroy as his guest on this week&apos;s Autoline. Doron Levin of AOL Autos and Fortune Magazine and Scott Burgess, Autocritic of The Detroit News, join John and David to talk about today&apos;s best cars.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1435: Champagne Wishes</title>
            <description>Champagne Wishes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Celebrity and luxury have been part of our culture since the beginning. But that potent combination didn&apos;t truly take off until about twenty-five years ago when television host Robin Leach made &quot;champagne wishes and caviar dreams&quot; our daily mantra. Suddenly greed was good, TV cops became Armani models and we all worshiped the people and products consumed nightly on the juggernaut &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was the springboard that brought us to today&apos;s luxury-satiated society where even ten year olds discuss the merits of Louis Vuitton&apos;s latest. We&apos;re now undeniably smack dab in the middle of a pop culture that&apos;s in love with luxury; and don&apos;t think any of this has been lost on certain companies that make cars.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The American luxury car market used to be just a few select players that came from Italy, Germany and the UK with a couple of homegrowns thrown in for good measure. Today the list of both cars and countries have exploded. But how has the market grown, who are today&apos;s players and which customer is buying what?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joining John McElroy for a look at today&apos;s luxury car market is an all dealer panel who pretty much have all the brands covered. Ken Meade of Meade Lexus is one of the brand&apos;s original dealers whose stores continue to be among the brand&apos;s top-sellers in the Midwest while Chris Consiglio is the Group General Manger of the Eitel Dahm Motor Group who handles three different high-end brands from Germany. And rounding out the panel is a man with a multitude of luxury brands to look after. Rob Kurnick is the president of Penske Automotive Group which operates 325 dealerships which nearly half could be considered luxury -- everything from Bugatti to Rolls Royce to Cadillac and more.</description>

            <description>The Left Bank 2&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last week Autoline Detroit began its coverage of the 2010 Paris Motor Show with four different interviews. This week we&apos;ve decided to emulate the Seine River, take a couple of twists and turns and do something a bit more avant-garde. Yes, we still have a couple of in-depth automotive interviews that you&apos;ve come to expect in Autoline Detroit such as talks with J Mays from Ford and Mike Manley from Jeep. But in addition, this week you&apos;ll get something completely different. In fact, get ready for John McElroy to take you on a walking tour. Not of Paris mind you, but of some of the brands of cars that populate the city, the country, the entire European Community and that you never see here in the states. From Lancia, to Renault to Alfa Romeo and more, John goes from booth to booth sharing with us some of the history of the brand and as well as why these European vehicles may be influencing what we park in our driveways in the coming years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, and don&apos;t miss our preview of the Special Edition Autoline Detroit that we shot in the Ligurian Alps just above Nice. That&apos;s also in this week&apos;s wrap-up from the Paris Motor Show.</description>

            <description>The Left Bank&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The river Siene slices through the city of Paris like the gentle folds of a fresh croissant. To the south is a section known as &quot;La Rive Gauche&quot; or The Left Bank. The moniker is artistic in origin thanks to the community of superlative painters and writers who called it home at one time or another. From Picasso to Hemingway to Matisse to Fitzgerald, some of the greatest works that we still admire today trace their ancestry to the southern section of the City of Lights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And even though those days are gone it doesn&apos;t mean that today The Left Bank is bereft of artistic merit. In fact just the opposite. Over the years it has become home to some of the greatest works of contemporary art though with a more technological feel. And for the next two weeks Autoline Detroit will spotlight this &quot;21st Century Art&quot; as we visit the Paris Motor Show.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this week&apos;s first part, John McElroy talks with Stephen Odell, the CEO of Ford of Europe, Jonathan Browning, the new CEO of Volkswagen of America, Ian Callum, Jaguar&apos;s Director of Design, and Fiat&apos;s Giovanni Mastrangelo, Platform Manager for Small Gasoline Engines.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1432: Don&apos;t Look Back</title>
            <description>Don&apos;t Look Back&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The longtime Hall of Fame baseball pitcher Satchel Paige once said &quot;Don&apos;t look back -- something might be gaining on you.&quot; In the case with today&apos;s luxury car leaders BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus that &quot;something&quot; is Audi.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The great luxury car maker that, in the past, could never quite get over the top has been gaining momentum with awards, marketing and, most importantly, sales. Halo vehicles like the R8 have grabbed the headlines but the real gains are coming across the entire lineup putting pressure on the traditional leaders of the segment. Just what are Audi&apos;s sales goals and how does the company plan to keep the momentum rolling? This week on Autoline Detroit to answer those and other questions on this blazing hot German luxury car maker is Johan de Nysschen, President of Audi of America.

            <itunes:summary>Don&apos;t Look Back

The longtime Hall of Fame baseball pitcher Satchel Paige once said &quot;Don&apos;t look back -- something might be gaining on you.&quot; In the case with today&apos;s luxury car leaders BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus that &quot;something&quot; is Audi.

The great luxury car maker that, in the past, could never quite get over the top has been gaining momentum with awards, marketing and, most importantly, sales. Halo vehicles like the R8 have grabbed the headlines but the real gains are coming across the entire lineup putting pressure on the traditional leaders of the segment. Just what are Audi&apos;s sales goals and how does the company plan to keep the momentum rolling? This week on Autoline Detroit to answer those and other questions on this blazing hot German luxury car maker is Johan de Nysschen, President of Audi of America. John McElroy is joined on his Autoline Detroit panel by David Welch of Bloomberg/Businessweek and Chris Paukert from Autoblog.com.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Autoline #1431: Predictive Power</title>
            <description>Predictive Power

Ensconced in the ivy-covered halls of universities around the world are men and women who spend their days looking for answers.  Answers to questions that might not even exist called &quot;Unknown Unknowns.&quot;  Many recognize this function as engaging in scientific theory which, over the years, has led to accepted works like Einstein&apos;s &quot;General Theory of Relativity.&quot;  But before his or Newton&apos;s or even Darwin&apos;s research was accepted, their theories had to generate testable predictions otherwise known as Predictive Power.

Predictive Power appears on Autoline Detroit but not in the guise of any ground-breaking theories.   Here, as is the case with this week&apos;s show, we divide the phrase and spotlight one word at a time.  

For instance take &quot;power.&quot;  Who better to talk about it than an executive of McLaren Automotive, the British manufacturer of high performance vehicles?  And what better vehicle to talk about than its first sports car developed for those who don&apos;t wear fire-retardant suits, the MP4-12C.  McLaren&apos;s Tony Joseph not only talks to John McElroy about the company and its move into production cars for consumers but also takes him for a walkaround the car that you won&apos;t want to miss.

Then as far as &quot;predictive&quot; or in this case &quot;predictions&quot; go, we turn to Jeremy Anwyl, the CEO of Edmunds.com.  This 45-year-old firm along, with its sister sites, gather automotive information and distribute it to largely a consumer audience.  Mr. Anwyl and his team keep their eyes glued to the OEMs do and analyze everything from production to sales to the executives who run the organizations. He stops by Autoline to give John a look at the automotive world from the Edmunds&apos; perspective.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1430: Family</title>
            <description>Family&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&apos;s often said that the most important part of human life is family. Despite the fact that you may argue with your father on almost everything or your Aunt Rose still squeezes your checks at 35, being able to gather, celebrate and mourn together is unique to the human existence. Plus, that structure provides a perfect environment, which allows us to learn from one another, perhaps about our heritage or maybe life itself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course when it comes to corporations things are a little different to say the least, however, some do embrace the family structure for a variety of reasons. In the automotive industry, for instance, a company like Toyota offers customers three distinct brands that are aimed at different socioeconomic groups. The youngest member of that family, Scion, was created just a few short years ago and provides the entire corporate unit a young and unique set of products and customers. Jack Hollis is in charge of Scion in North America and he joins John McElroy on this week&apos;s edition of Autoline Detroit. Mike Ramsey from the Wall Street Journal and Greg Gardner of the Detroit Free Press join in the discussion.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1429: Containment</title>
            <description>Containment&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It may be a noun with three different meanings, but the word containment has filtered into our daily lives. From news stories spotlighting the Gulf of Mexico to military strategies on the Asian continent, we think of it in big picture terms, but it effects us much differently. Containment is more personal, especially as it relates to transportation. Whether it&apos;s your own vehicle or public transportation, the driving force underneath the hood of both modes are fluids; oil, water and gasoline to name three. Delivering those fluids throughout the vehicle is complicated to say the least. And that&apos;s where containment comes in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the top companies in the automotive &quot;containment&quot; field if you will, is TI Automotive. It&apos;s been building fluid delivery systems since the days of the Model T. Joining John McElroy to discuss today&apos;s complicated world of fluid storage, carrying and delivery technology is TIA President &amp; CEO Bill Kozyra. And joining in on the conversation is Dave VanderWerp of Car and Driver.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1428: Listening Booth: 2010 - Part 2</title>
            <description>Listening Booth: 2010 - Part 2

With a nod to our inspiration, musician Marc Cohn&apos;s new release &quot;Listening Booth: 1970,&quot; in Autoline&apos;s 2010 version last week, our focus wasn&apos;t on forty-year-old songs, but rather a fresh look at Ford&apos;s recent comeback. And that look came from the eyes of someone who has watched it up close -- the company&apos;s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Lewis Booth. In last week&apos;s Part 1 he gave us an accounting of that comeback touching on a variety of subjects including its well-received new products, its surprising profit as well as its still-looming debt.

This week Mr. Booth is back for Part 2 of our discussion with a deeper dive into Ford&apos;s present and future. Join John McElroy along with the New York Times&apos; Bill Vlasic and former Car &amp; Driver chief Csaba Csere as they talk with the man who could be the company&apos;s next Alan Mulally.</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Putting a new twist on &quot;the classics&quot; is suddenly chic and popular. Just ask musician Marc Cohn whose new recording, &quot;Listening Booth: 1970&quot; -- a collection of songs from that year -- is a hit on Billboard. Who would&apos;ve thought re-creating 40-year-old songs like &quot;Wild World&quot; from Cat Stevens, The Grateful Dead&apos;s &quot;New Speedway Boogie&quot; or &quot;Make It With You&quot; by Bread of all groups would raise a winner, yet it did. But maybe given what&apos;s been going on in Dearborn recently we shouldn&apos;t be so surprised.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After all, who would&apos;ve thought even just two years ago that re-creating &quot;classics&quot; like Fiesta, Taurus and Explorer would be returning Ford to its past sales glory, but it is. Of course it&apos;s much more than just a couple of new cars that&apos;s making the difference, but, as any of the Ford team will tell you, having fresh, quality product doesn&apos;t hurt. To understand what&apos;s driving Ford back to the top of the industry, this week Autoline takes a turn in its own &quot;Listening Booth&quot;, as the company&apos;s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Lewis Booth joins John McElroy for the first of two shows. Joining John and Mr. Booth on the panel are Bill Vlasic from the New York Times and former chief of Car &amp; Driver magazine Csaba Csere.</description>

Analysis always seems more important when it has a name attached to it. Take the world of psychology for instance. Sigmund Freud&apos;s surname established the famous &apos;Freudian&apos; school of psychoanalysis while his contemporary Carl Jung gave us the &apos;Jungian&apos; version. Two names that have stood the test of time when it comes to branding analysis. So when it comes to the automotive world is it out of bounds to ask if that type of analysis should also have some sort of moniker? Well this week Autoline Detroit does its best to answer that question as it features three top-notch automotive analysts who opine on everything from the current state of the industry, its 2010 sales, the resurrection of the Detroit Three and those all-important breakthrough vehicles like the Volt and the Leaf we keep waiting for. Joining John McElroy on the his &apos;Autolineian&apos; panel are Rebecca Lindland and John Wolkonowicz two senior analysts from IHS Global Insight and Erich Merkle from Autoconomy.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1425: Hands Down</title>
            <description>Hands Down&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Without a doubt, some of the reasons are simple. Old line factories have closed, there&apos;s more automation in those that remain and foreign companies are building in right-to-work states. With all that working against them, it&apos;s understandable why membership in the United Auto Workers has fallen the last thirty years. Like the constant drip from a faulty faucet, the pool of workers from this once dominant union has been slipping away losing more than a million since its peak in the &apos;70s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But don&apos;t cry for Bob King, the new UAW president. Elected merely a month ago, he knows the job in front of him and it&apos;s no easy task. Not only does he have to retain his current members, but reach out and recruit new ones. Just how he does that is one of the biggest challenges he&apos;ll face. But wait, don&apos;t forget about the questions surrounding The Detroit Three. How will the UAW deal with not only the success of Ford, but also the rebuilding at GM &amp; Chrysler?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are just a few of the tough questions that our all-star panel tackles on this week&apos;s Autoline Detroit. Joining John McElroy to discuss the future of the UAW are Sean McAlinden from CAR, Joe Szczesny from the Oakland Press and Robert Chiaravalli of Strategic Labor &amp; Human Resources.</description>

Without a doubt, some of the reasons are simple. Old line factories have closed, there&apos;s more automation in those that remain and foreign companies are building in right-to-work states. With all that working against them, it&apos;s understandable why membership in the United Auto Workers has fallen the last thirty years. Like the constant drip from a faulty faucet, the pool of workers from this once dominant union has been slipping away losing more than a million since its peak in the &apos;70s.

But don&apos;t cry for Bob King, the new UAW president. Elected merely a month ago, he knows the job in front of him and it&apos;s no easy task. Not only does he have to retain his current members, but reach out and recruit new ones. Just how he does that is one of the biggest challenges he&apos;ll face. But wait, don&apos;t forget about the questions surrounding The Detroit Three. How will the UAW deal with not only the success of Ford, but also the rebuilding at GM &amp; Chrysler?

These are just a few of the tough questions that our all-star panel tackles on this week&apos;s Autoline Detroit. Joining John McElroy to discuss the future of the UAW are Sean McAlinden from CAR, Joe Szczesny from the Oakland Press and Robert Chiaravalli of Strategic Labor &amp; Human Resources.</itunes:summary>

            <description>B Driven&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can see it, can&apos;t you? The slow-motion black and white shots of sweaty sinewy muscles inter-cut with close-ups of a certain athletic footwear and a simple closing graphic. Of course you could &quot;IF&quot; this really were the next iconic brand message from Nike. But this &quot;B Driven&quot; headline references the tsunami of new compact cars that will soon engulf America.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And though the Bs lead the list, this week on Autoline Detroit we look at several new cars, trucks and crossovers either out now or poised to hit the marketplace soon. Joining John McElroy for this new vehicle smorgasbord are two of his fellow voters on the North American Car and Truck of the Year jury, Tony Swan from Car and Driver and Michelle Krebs of Edmunds.com.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout the show they&apos;ll be discussing many of the potential award-winners that could come from virtually any segment including luxury entrants like the CTS Coupe from Cadillac or the latest XJ from Jaguar. Of course performance cars are always in the spotlight especially with new products such as BMW&apos;s 5 Series and Ford&apos;s iconic Mustang with not one but two all-new powertrains: a V-6 and, finally, an honest-to-goodness 5-Liter. And of course there are crossovers as well like the Hyundai Tucson, Kia Sorento and Infiniti QX56 to talk about. But without a doubt, the largest group of important cars coming out this year are indeed the Bs: Ford Fiesta, MAZDA2 and Chevrolet Cruze -- to name three of the bigger volume models -- will be getting the most attention from critics and consumers alike. So join John and his NACTOY panel for a look at the latest and greatest coming to dealer lots this week on Autoline Detroit.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1423: Detroit Drift</title>
            <description>Detroit Drift&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though it may sound like the next installment in &quot;The Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise, this drift refers to what&apos;s going on right now in the auto industry in not only Detroit but across the globe. Fresh leaders, closed brands and new marketing plans are just a few of the topics that go into evaluating today&apos;s automotive landscape by R.L. Polk, the 140-year-old analytical firm with long-time Detroit roots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if anyone knows what&apos;s going on with sales trends, market position and brand loyalty -- to name a few -- it&apos;s Stephen Polk, Chairman, President and CEO of the company. On this week&apos;s special July 4th edition of Autoline Detroit, Mr. Polk joins John McElroy to discuss the latest news on everything from sagging spring sales to the potential plug-in revolution. And joining John on this week&apos;s journalist panel are Jeff Green from Bloomberg News and Tom Walsh of the Detroit Free Press.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1422: Mythology</title>
            <description>Mythology&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Greek culture has given the world significant contributions in several areas. One of the more interesting is the bizarre mixture of heroes, villains, mortals and gods constructed, most experts say, to explain the mysteries of life. How ironic that so much of what we know as &apos;Greek Mythology&apos; was centered around the ancient city of Delphi. Ironic because the Delphi we&apos;re familiar with today had its own mythology; a Tier One supplier born from General Motors in the &apos;90s with a similar lineup of enigmatic characters who mysteriously turned a thriving company into a bankrupt one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the last five years the corporation has struggled until it emerged from bankruptcy late last year. Led out by Rodney O&apos;Neal, its current CEO and President who has been around the company since its GM years, Delphi today is much leaner and much less dependent on its former #1 customer. So equipped with a variety of new clients as well as fresh innovative electronic products, Mr. O&apos;Neal believes that Delphi is ready to reclaim what it lost over these last few years, namely sales and market share.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week on Autoline Detroit John McElroy welcomes Rodney O&apos;Neal of Delphi Automotive. Joining John on his panel are Tom Murphy from WardsAuto.com and Carol Cain of CBS Television Detroit.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1421: Grand Re-Opening</title>
            <description>Grand Re-Opening&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fourteen months ago Chrysler was closing down. We&apos;re all familiar with the strange turns the story took. From bankruptcy to Obama to Italy and back, Chrysler survived, jobs were saved and the Pentastar was back in business. Well almost. There was that little thing about new product; it didn&apos;t have any and wasn&apos;t expected for some time. With its competitors pumping out fresh cars and trucks seemingly each month, it didn&apos;t seem like a scenario for success.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But somehow, someway Chrysler cobbled together a year of better sales with that aged product and, lo and behold, today it finally has something it hasn&apos;t had in over twelve months: a new vehicle in the form of the 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Now it still is the &quot;only&quot; new vehicle available to its dealers for the near future but don&apos;t try to rain on Mike Manley&apos;s parade with that observation. Jeep&apos;s President and CEO is excited about this brand new SUV and what it says about his brand, the company&apos;s upcoming products and the future of the new Chrysler itself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For a closer look at this all new Grand Cherokee, the Jeep brand and how it fits into Sergio Marchionne&apos;s plan for Chrysler, join John McElroy as he welcomes Mike Manley as his guest on this week&apos;s Autoline Detroit. Joining John on his panel are Bob Gritzinger from AutoWeek and Scott Burgess of The Detroit News.</description>

            <description>Elbow Room&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like it or not, we&apos;re all fast becoming neighbors. As the world&apos;s population continues to boom and more and more people congregate in urban areas we&apos;ve created a phenomenon known as megacities. These are metropolitan areas around the globe with populations that exceed 10 million. New York and Los Angeles are the U.S. flagbearers in this urban Olympics which includes places like Tokyo, Mumbai, Shanghai and 20 others (so far). The development of these small population nations has a unique set of challenges in which &apos;movement&apos; is perhaps the most vital. No matter how you cut it whether it comes to work, food, education or entertainment, transportation or &apos;movement&apos; within the megacity is the key. How does it take place now? How will it take place in the future as these megacities continue to grow? What will move people around the area and, finally, what are automotive companies designing for that eventual future?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are just some of the provocative questions that were tackled at the 7th Annual Michelin Auto Design Panel recently held at the Detroit Athletic Club and the subject of this week&apos;s Autoline Detroit. John McElroy served as the Master of Ceremonies for this Automobile Press Association sponsored event. Joining John on the panel were: Clay Dean, director of GM Advanced Design, Scott Strong, Ford&apos;s Global Interior Design Director, Phil Zak, Chief Designer at Hyundai North America and Larry Erickson, the Transportation Design Department Chair at the College of Creative Studies.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1419: Purchasing Power</title>
            <description>Purchasing Power&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Buying in bulk has never been more popular. Warehouse shopping at places like Costco and Sam&apos;s Club has sold many consumers on the procurement secrets of the Big Three -- buy in quantity and the unit price goes down. Whether or not that practice is good for every household is another question, however, there&apos;s no doubting that it&apos;s a winner for the OEMs. Just ask Tom Stallkamp. The former vice chairman and board member of DaimlerChrysler worked his way to the top through Procurement and Supply. Perhaps the only Big Three CEO to ever do so. And he got there by developing innovative purchasing programs and partnerships for Chrysler like SCORE (Supplier Cost Reduction Effort) and the company&apos;s &apos;Extended Enterprise&apos; concept.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today, removed from the the daily automotive grind for more than a decade, Mr. Stallkamp is an Industrial Partner with the private equity group Ripplewood Holdings, yet he remains a keen observer of the industry. This week on Autoline Detroit John McElroy welcomes Thomas Stallkamp, one of the most successful automotive leaders in the last thirty years, to the program for his analysis on the continuing upheaval in the automotive world. Joining John on his panel are Edward Lapham from Automotive News and Neal Boudette of the Wall Street Journal.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1418: An Incredible Ride</title>
            <description>An Incredible Ride&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It started last year with a simple e-mail between two &apos;car guys.&apos; That&apos;s when Victor Muller the creator of the small exotic luxury brand Spyker petitioned Bob Lutz, the then Vice Chairman of General Motors. Mr. Muller was interested in the corporation&apos;s plans for his childhood dream car SAAB. GM, as you&apos;ll recall, was staggering out of bankruptcy and in the middle of jettisoning brands like a Golden Retriever sheds its winter coat. Pontiac was closing while Hummer, Saturn and SAAB were all up for sale but in danger of winding down as well. That one November e-mail sparked a heart-pounding &apos;live-or- die&apos; three months for this iconic Swedish brand. The &quot;incredible ride&quot; as Victor Muller himself describes it finally ended earlier this year with ownership firmly in the hands of this Dutch entrepreneur.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On this week&apos;s show John McElroy welcomes the new owner of SAAB Victor Muller to Autoline Detroit where he&apos;ll discuss not only his suspense-filled acquisition of the car company, but more importantly, how he intends to do what GM couldn&apos;t do with the brand and that is sell cars and make money. Joining John on the panel are Todd Lassa from Motor Trend and David Welch from Bloomberg Businessweek.</description>

It started last year with a simple e-mail between two &apos;car guys.&apos; That&apos;s when Victor Muller the creator of the small exotic luxury brand Spyker petitioned Bob Lutz, the then Vice Chairman of General Motors. Mr. Muller was interested in the corporation&apos;s plans for his childhood dream car SAAB. GM, as you&apos;ll recall, was staggering out of bankruptcy and in the middle of jettisoning brands like a Golden Retriever sheds its winter coat. Pontiac was closing while Hummer, Saturn and SAAB were all up for sale but in danger of winding down as well. That one November e-mail sparked a heart-pounding &apos;live-or- die&apos; three months for this iconic Swedish brand. The &quot;incredible ride&quot; as Victor Muller himself describes it finally ended earlier this year with ownership firmly in the hands of this Dutch entrepreneur.

            <title>Autoline #1417: Platforms</title>
            <description>Platforms&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like many other areas of 21st century life, the publishing world is in an upheaval. Newspapers are consolidating and closing while books are turning into digital devices and music virtually floats around the Internet for free. Yet perhaps the sector with the most on the line is the magazine; those recurrent glossy periodicals that cater to our every interest, taste and whim. The problem is that the magazine audience is getting a little long in the tooth -- to put it mildly -- yielding decreasing sales across the board. And no place is that more evident than with the automotive enthusiast magazine crowd. From Automobile to Car and Driver to Motor Trend to Road &amp; Track, no matter the name, no matter the content, everyone is losing out to the Internet. So the multi-million dollar question is how can these grand old dames of the enthusiast set transfer the magazine experience to a new generation -- one that doesn&apos;t so much read information as it does devour it. Well, one answer may be platforms. Creating unique content specifically for a digital device. Of course that&apos;s easier said that done because then you still have to have an audience who buys it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joining John McElroy to discuss the short and long term future of the automotive enthusiast magazines is a panel who knows the issues first hand. Csaba Csere worked for Car and Driver magazine for nearly three decades leaving as Editor-in-Chief in 2008. Eddie Alterman is charged with facing those challenges today as the current Editor-in- Chief of Car and Driver while John Neff and his popular website, Autoblog.com, is just one of the reasons that the enthusiast crowd is looking for new workable options like platforms.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1416: The Perfect Marriage</title>
            <description>The Perfect Marriage&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It happened last century. Way back, nearly a hundred years ago; a union so sweet, so hand-in-glove that to this day many of us still take it for granted. The alliance was a smart, sublime coupling of west coast imagery and Midwest manufacturing yielding the perfect marriage: the mating of cars and movies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&apos;s right from Laurel and Hardy to Roger and Me, from the Love Bug to Bullitt, celluloid seemed made for our four-wheeled wonders. In fact, if anything its worked almost too well. From the early days of the silent films all the way up to today&apos;s 3D digital blockbusters, cars continue to be enormous stars. But with so many movies in the car film universe, whenever you start to pull together your favorites, it&apos;s a list that can careen out of control pretty &quot;Fast and Furious.&quot; That&apos;s why here at Autoline we leave that sort of heavy lifting to the experts. Joining us for Round Two of our Autoline look at history&apos;s greatest car films are Jim Hall from 2953 Analytics, Todd Lassa from Motor Trend and Peter De Lorenzo of Autoextremist.com. From racing to comedy to Bond to cult, our panel critiques these great films and tells you why, if you have yet to see some of them, you need to put them on your own personal list.</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
For more than two decades those three words have branded Nike into the public consciousness helping make it the success that it continues to be. Of course having great product didn&apos;t hurt, but really, the Wieden and Kennedy advertising team who developed the famous tag line, and subsequent media campaigns, are as responsible as anyone for putting Nike into homes and locker rooms around the world. That&apos;s why behind seemingly every successful consumer goods business is an ethos of creative energy -- a team if you will -- that helps sell that product to all of us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The auto industry is no different. Its storied advertising history is not only well-documented but ingrained in our memories. The problem with that is the &quot;history&quot; part. Some experts believe that automotive advertising sort of flies under the radar these days trying to attract but not offend leaving the pubic many times with nothing more than a milquetoast impression. The question becomes is that the result of an overall strategy or is there something else at work? Are brand issues, globalization or perhaps the financial tumult responsible for this change of style?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week on Autoline Detroit John McElroy and his panel of experts tackle the ever-changing world of automobile advertising. Joining John to discuss what&apos;s been going on and where it all might be headed are advertising journalist Jean Halliday, former ad man turned commentator David Kiley with AOL Autos and an award-winning advertising veteran who is still on the front lines Gary Topolewski.</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
The next time you&apos;re in a store take a walk down the detergent aisle and check out the dozens of different products. Some of the packages that look so comfortable on the shelf may have actually started life as an avatar -- a virtual product in an equally digital grocery store. That may be news when it comes to consumer products but automakers have been engaged with 3-dimension computer design for some time now. In fact this virtual universe allows the manufacturers of these complex machines to take them from concept to clearance -- as it were -- through a process called PLM or Product Lifecycle Management. Not only is it a huge cost saver when it comes to time and materials, but it also gives designers, engineers and marketers alike, 21st Century advantages that their earlier counterparts could only imagine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week on Autoline the top executive at one of the world&apos;s pre- eminent PLM companies joins John to discuss the process and how it continues to revolutionize the auto industry. Bernard Charles, President and CEO of Dassault Systemes talks about the impact of PLM on all of us and how Dassault is out to bring the 3D experience to our daily lives. Joining John and Mr. Charles on the panel are Drew Winter from WardsAuto.com and Christopher Sawyer of Cars In Context.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1413: Habits</title>
            <description>Habits&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They&apos;re defined as acquired behavior patterns that are uniquely involuntary. Known to most of the planet as habits, they come from two camps. Some can be bad if it&apos;s a personal glitch or foible while others might be good if it leads to a desired end product.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Especially if that product is quality. After all, it was the Greek philosopher Aristotle who was first to recognize some 2,300 years ago that &quot;Quality is not an act, it is a habit.&quot; Unfortunately, during the late 20th century, American car makers weren&apos;t reading much Aristotle, or so it seemed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today we&apos;re not sure if the Greek Philosopher has become required auto industry reading or not, but we can say with certainty that U.S. quality numbers are up and up significantly. And on this week&apos;s Autoline, one of the executives in charge of that change joins John McElroy and his panel to tell us how they&apos;re doing it. Bennie Fowler has been on the front lines of this issue for more than three decades. From his days at General Motors in the &apos;70s and &apos;80s into his early years at Ford, he observed the mistakes, the lack of quality, the bad habits if you will, that the American OEMs had eased into. For the last four years he has been in charge of reversing that trend at Ford. And if you look at the numbers, he, and many others in the company, appear to be doing just that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joining John on this week&apos;s panel are Brent Snavely with Detroit Free Press and Bryce Hoffman of The Detroit News.</description>

            <description>Knots Landing&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When it comes to television dramas since the &apos;70s, few have been more consistent than life within the California cul-de-sac called Seaview Circle.  And when it comes to automotive drama over that same time frame who has been more compelling than Auburn Hills-based Chrysler?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the precipice of bankruptcy one moment, onto salvation and success the next, then through a merger, a sale and then back to bankruptcy; if this had been a show on CBS it would have an armoire of EMMYs.  Instead, today it has a mercurial Italian owner and a dubious future.  And that&apos;s the GOOD NEWS!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome to the &quot;new, newer, newest&quot; iteration of Chrysler, the smallest of the historic Big Three.  The challenges of this company are too numerous to list here, but obviously one of the biggest is building quality cars and trucks.  And these days you&apos;re not going to do that without good suppliers.  But with the way that community has been treated by the last two regimes, you sometimes wonder who would still want to do business with Chrysler.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enter Dan Knott, 20-year veteran of the Chrysler culture, and the new head of Purchasing.  Mr. Knott joins John McElroy and his panel to discuss the new way of doing business with Chrysler.  One that he hopes takes them back to the pre-Daimler days of strong vendor relationships and great Chrysler products.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joining John on his panel are Eric Mayne from WardsAuto.com and Daniel Howes, columnist from The Detroit News.</description>

Joining John on his panel are Eric Mayne from WardsAuto.com and Daniel Howes, columnist from The Detroit News.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Autoline #1411: Stop Your Sobbing</title>
            <description>Stop Your Sobbing&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You may recognize the headline above as a famous &apos;60s song written by the Kinks. However, when GM exited from bankruptcy last year it almost turned that hallowed tune on its head. With brands being jettisoned left and right, &quot;Stop Your SAABBING&quot; -- recorded by Big Ed &amp; The Board -- seemed like the song Detroit was ready to export to Trollhattan, Sweden, home of the iconic motor company SAAB. And as word of its impending doom grew you could practically hear the cries from the Swedish automaker&apos;s loyal community for a white knight to save their favorite cars. But instead of resolution came the teeter- totering spectacle where one moment the the brand was saved by some international buyer, while the next the doors were being locked for good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yet in the end, Dutch businessman Victor Muller rode in to save the day on a white hand-built Spyker C8 Aileron Spyder and stopped all the potential sobbing with his purchase of SAAB. And now the resurrection begins. But how can a car company that sold less than 9,000 vehicles last year in America be reborn?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those answers and details on the plan itself join John McElroy and his Autoline panel -- Todd Lassa of Motor Trend and Jeff Bennett from the Wall Street Journal -- as they talk SAAB with Mike Colleran the man in charge.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1410: Reputation</title>
            <description>Reputation&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever noticed the way pop culture treats a &quot;good&quot; reputation? We all want one but it hardly seems to get talked about. Take &apos;80s music for instance where both Joan Jett &amp; the Blackhearts along with college favorites the dBs both scored hits with their separate (and totally different) songs entitled &quot;Bad Reputation.&quot; Now we all may want good to triumph over evil but is there anyone out there humming the tune &quot;Good Reputation?&quot; It almost harkens back to the simple journalism barometer of a dog biting a man. Of course that&apos;s not news. But switch the incisors around and suddenly you&apos;ve got readers, viewers and P.E.T.A. probably jumping all over the man biting dog story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&apos;s sort of the situation Toyota finds itself in today. It spent decades building a rock solid reputation for its vehicle on the foundation of quality, care and customer service which it has seen start to crumble in a mere six months. Now that isn&apos;t to say there aren&apos;t some problems with the cars, in fact problems the company might&apos;ve and should&apos;ve caught earlier. But at this point the question becomes what happens to that reputation. It was once sterling and now it&apos;s teetering over a pool of muck. How does Toyota reclaim what it once had?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On this week&apos;s Special Edition of Autoline Detroit John McElroy sits down with longtime Toyota executive Don Esmond. Mr. Esmond has been out talking directly to the dealer body about their vehicles along with the problems they&apos;re facing in Washington, Tokyo and with that heretofore loyal customer base. He talks candidly about mistakes that were made, lessons learned and getting that &quot;good&quot; reputation back.</description>

In today&apos;s high-tech world, it may be hard to believe but there was once a time in America where the best place to enjoy a movie was in your car. This loose-knit community of film-goers would usually meet on a weekend night in a parking lot full of poles known as a Drive- In. Most are now gone, replaced by so many strip malls and condominiums. However, the yearning for that life lives on in many.

Well, Autoline may not be able to duplicate the experience in its entirety, but this week&apos;s show transforms itself into your own personal drive-in as we feature films &quot;About, Starring and Containing&quot; cars. Our panel of auto experts turned film critics reveal their cinematic interpretations of &quot;The Good&quot; (Bullitt), &quot;The Bad&quot; (Faster, Pussycat Kill Kill) and &quot;The Ugly&quot; (The Betsy), along with a fascinating list of films scattered in-between.

            <title>Autoline #1408: Tiger Woods or Tylenol</title>
            <description>Tiger Woods or Tylenol&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A dizzying number of consumer products have been introduced over the last thirty years. And though thousands have succeeded over that time few have achieved the Mount Olympus of brand recognition that translates into the multi-million dollar world of annual sales. And even fewer from that list have survived a potential public relations nightmare that backed the brand into a corner. For the last three months we&apos;ve been watching the Tiger Woods brand undergo such scrutiny, while 28-years ago Johnson &amp; Johnson faced an even greater disaster with its Tylenol over-the-counter medication. Tylenol, by all accounts, became the gold standard of resuscitating a brand with great corporate public relations. The same can&apos;t be said for the Tiger Woods brand though the entire story is yet to be written.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile Toyota, long one of the most solid brands throughout the world, is currently at a similar crossroads. For the last six months the company has experienced one bad story about its products after another. Accelerators, brakes, cars and recalls have contributed to the public waterboarding of this once proud seemingly indestructible brand. And it doesn&apos;t help that the hits keep coming.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So going forward from today, what path will the company take? What are the challenges it faces in public relations, in marketing and with the automotive world itself? This week Autoline hosts three experts from these disparate fields to talk turkey to and about the Toyota brand, the Toyota company and the Toyota bottom line. Joining John McElroy to do just that are Maria Leonhauser from the world of public relations, Paul Haelterman an authority in auto analysis and Christie Nordhielm who gave us &quot;The Big Picture,&quot; literally, with her book on marketing challenges and solutions for companies like Toyota.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1407: The Eyes Have It</title>
            <description>The Eyes Have It&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whether it&apos;s in the U.S. Senate, the California State House or your own city council, any simple up or down tally where &quot;the ayes have it&quot; can have a significant impact on voters&apos; lives. However, when it comes to having an impact in the world of advertising, there is no bigger forum than the Super Bowl. Especially when there are 106 million potential consumers watching. Truly a place where the &quot;eyes&quot; indeed have it. So for 44 consecutive years businesses have put their products in this spotlight of this special day hoping for a great ROI for the money they spend. And throughout the years automakers have been right there on Super Bowl Sunday trying their best to create the splash that translates to sales.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This year six OEMs braved the nearly $3-million dollar per 30-second advertising Olympics with one, Hyundai, seemingly saturating the entire game. So did Hyundai or the other five -- Audi, Dodge, Honda, Kia, or VW -- get their money&apos;s worth? Is it even possible?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joining John McElroy to try to answer these questions is a panel of automotive advertising experts. Journalist Jean Halliday has written about the industry for years while advertising analyst David Kiley not only covered the business but also worked in it as well. They are joined by an award-winning creative director who is still in the trenches, Gary Topolewski, waiting to produce his next Super Bowl spot.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1406: Nervous System</title>
            <description>Nervous System&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the stub of a toe to the bite of a mosquito, our bodies rely on a complex network of neurons that tell our brain what&apos;s going on. And like our bodies, each car has a pseudo nervous system which controls everything from the steering to satellite radio. For all manufacturers the quality of their cars and the viability of their systems are extremely important. However, for the world&apos;s number one automaker Toyota, its been nothing short of the holy grail. Quality and reliability were once the keys to the design, production and selling of its products. But right now several of Toyota&apos;s top models are experiencing what could best be parenthetically described as a severe neurological disorder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week on Autoline John McElroy examines the latest reliability and quality woes facing Toyota and what some competitors like Ford have been doing to improve its numbers in those categories.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1405: Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</title>
            <description>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many know this classic 1939 film pitted an everyman Jimmy Stewart against the rich and powerful under the U.S Capitol Dome. And though more than 70 years have passed, even the writers of this academy-award work of fiction couldn&apos;t have imagined that Washington would be even more corpulent and confusing in 2010. And one of the best examples of this weighty indecision can be found in what passes, or doesn&apos;t pass, for the nation&apos;s energy policy. Solar, Wind and Shale are just a few power options that we&apos;ve added to the mix over the years while natural gas, electric and hydrogen hint at what may be driving our cars and trucks down the road: yet today no one knows for sure what&apos;s best and where we&apos;re going.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So the question remains: what is our policy and who is driving it? And where better to try to get a handle on what&apos;s going on than &quot;inside the beltway&quot; as they say, than by paying a visit to our nation&apos;s capitol itself. This week Autoline presents its own version of &quot;Mr. McElroy Goes to Washington&quot; from the floor of the Washington Convention Center. There John is joined by two members of what are known as NGOs or Non-governmental organizations along with the publisher of a cutting-edge automotive periodical to discuss everything from off-shore drilling to the EPA.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1404: The Sun Also Rises</title>
            <description>The Sun Also Rises&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After a decade of reporting everywhere from local streets to foreign wars, Ernest Hemingway wrote and published his first novel &quot;The Sun Also Rises.&quot; And though you might think we chose this title to turn a clever phrase regarding this week&apos;s guest, it has more to do with what the book wasn&apos;t named...at least in the United States. With the novel focused partially on traveling in Europe in the 1920s, Hemingway originally titled the book &quot;Fiesta.&quot; Of course it was changed here in America but used in several countries throughout the continent. And how appropriate for this week&apos;s guest who chose to make a splash here in the U.S. recently with a European car called, ironically enough, &quot;Fiesta.&quot; Ford&apos;s Global Marketing guru Jim Farley has been turning the Blue Oval every which way trying to draw attention to the new crop of critically-acclaimed products it has been putting out and it&apos;s been working on. With a sweep of the 2010 North American Car and Truck of the Year awards earlier this month with Fusion &amp; Transit Connect, and the Fiesta and Focus on the way, they might not be holding a party down in Dearborn quite yet, but clearly Ford is on the rise.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1403: Getting Better</title>
            <description>Getting Better&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Throughout the sixties the &quot;sweet and savory&quot; song writing from the Lennon &amp; McCartney partnership produced lines that emphasized the beautiful schizophrenia of life. That&apos;s why this week it didn&apos;t take much to imagine that the good folks at the Detroit Auto Dealers Association might&apos;ve been recalling the 2009 NAIAS with the Beatles&apos; chorus &quot;I&apos;ve got to admit it&apos;s getting better...it can&apos;t get no worse&quot; echoing in their ears. Yet the good news is true to the song, this year&apos;s edition is indeed &quot;getting better&quot; thanks to more OEM booths, more journalists and a heck of a lot of more smiles even though they -- the smiles -- are probably still bordering on the &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; type.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This week on Autoline Detroit John McElroy talks to three automotive professionals from disparate parts of the industry -- wholesale, retail and analytical -- to hear what they have to say about not only the 2010 North American International Auto Show, but where the next twelve months will take us.</description>

            <description>Even though Chrysler will display some of its vehicles at this year&apos;s auto show in Detroit, they decided not to have a press conference or make any big announcements. This is somewhat perplexing since the show is right in Chrysler&apos;s back yard and they haven&apos;t held any press events since their day long one back in November. With that in mind, on this edition of Autoline EXTRA, John and his panel discuss what they expect to see from Chrysler at this year&apos;s show. Is the company missing a big opportunity or not? Joining John in the discussion are Sarah Webster from the Detroit Free Press, Jim Hall of 2953 Analytics and Guy Gordon from WDIV-Detroit.</description>

            <title>Autoline #1402: Crawlin&apos; From the Wreckage</title>
            <description>Crawlin&apos; From the Wreckage&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who would&apos;ve predicated thirty years ago that a little known new wave song from England&apos;s Dave Edmunds would prove to be the perfect theme for the 2010 North American International Auto Show? Last January&apos;s edition of the world&apos;s most important auto show was less about cars, trucks and crossovers as it was about bailouts, Obama and bankruptcies. Add to that the strange Kabuki dance around the attempted restoration of Cobo Hall -- the show&apos;s longtime site -- and the &apos;09 show had all the panache of sportscaster Howard Cosell&apos;s 1975 Variety show. But what a difference a year makes...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Crawlin&apos; from the wreckage, into a brand new car&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just as the song&apos;s chorus suggests a rebirth, the 2010 NAIAS is likewise being resurrected. Manufacturers are again investing in their booths, prodigal sons have returned and the show is even recharging the career of &apos;80s singer Eddy Grant with its &quot;Electric Avenue&quot; display. So watch this week&apos;s Autoline Detroit for an in-depth preview of all that is going on at this year&apos;s North American International Auto Show.</description>

            <itunes:summary>Crawlin&apos; From the Wreckage

Who would&apos;ve predicated thirty years ago that a little known new wave song from England&apos;s Dave Edmunds would prove to be the perfect theme for the 2010 North American International Auto Show? Last January&apos;s edition of the world&apos;s most important auto show was less about cars, trucks and crossovers as it was about bailouts, Obama and bankruptcies. Add to that the strange Kabuki dance around the attempted restoration of Cobo Hall -- the show&apos;s longtime site -- and the &apos;09 show had all the panache of sportscaster Howard Cosell&apos;s 1975 Variety show. But what a difference a year makes...

&quot;Crawlin&apos; from the wreckage, into a brand new car&quot;

Just as the song&apos;s chorus suggests a rebirth, the 2010 NAIAS is likewise being resurrected. Manufacturers are again investing in their booths, prodigal sons have returned and the show is even recharging the career of &apos;80s singer Eddy Grant with its &quot;Electric Avenue&quot; display. So watch this week&apos;s Autoline Detroit for an in-depth preview of all that is going on at this year&apos;s North American International Auto Show.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Autoline #1401: The Result of Care: Part Two</title>
            <description>The Result of Care: Part Two&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No matter the vocation it&apos;s a struggle to achieve quality or to be the best. Well, imagine trying to define it. Some write complex tomes containing various recipes which is fine for a Debate Team but hardly applicable to everyday life. Others like philosopher Robert Pirsig take a sleeker, more modern day approach. He believes the best or highest quality can be defined simply as producing whatever by &quot;the result of care.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So if philosophers, lit experts and big thinkers battle over meanings, how do you come up with a standard that means &quot;the best?&quot; Well if you&apos;re the jurors of the North American Car and Truck of the Year Awards (NACTOY) you have a criteria you work from. Sure there are still disagreements, arguments and fights over who is &quot;more right&quot; but that&apos;s the beauty of the award: subjectivity to the max.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And on this week&apos;s Autoline John McElroy and his panel discuss those fantastic sparks inside, outside and around the vehicle that made them go WOW! Joining John to discuss the finalists for Truck of the Year are fellow jurors Michelle Krebs from Edmunds.com and Mark Phelan of the Detroit Free Press.</description>

            <title>Autoline Detroit: #1111</title>
            <description>SPLIT VISION&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Experts say the simplest way to examine the auto industry is to evaluate where it is today and imagine where it&apos;s heading next. This week Autoline Detroit features two guests -- one who looks at the problems of today and another who envisions the promise of tomorrow. Health care is undoubtedly one of the more onerous burdens facing the auto industry, especially when is comes to the Detroit Three. Scot Sharland thinks he can help. As Executive Director of AIAG, the Automotive Industry Action Group, his team has been designing health care solutions that mirror the quality improvements realized by the auto industry over the past decade. He&apos;ll talk about what they are and how he believes they can help. Yet the problems of today pale in comparison to what the future holds. Or what the future may be. And there aren&apos;t too many people on earth who have given that topic more thought than Syd Mead, the self-described &quot;visual futurist.&quot; Mr. Mead has been designing all types of transport since the &apos;50s and may be best known for his contributions to the 1982 film &quot;Bladerunner.&quot; On this week&apos;s Autoline he shares some of his thoughts on where transportation is headed in the 21st century, including his vision for the &quot;electronic horse&quot; and the &quot;electronic herd&quot; among others.&lt;br /&gt;
