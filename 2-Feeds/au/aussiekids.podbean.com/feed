		<itunes:subtitle>Our PodcastRoom will cover many aspects of our daily school lives here in Australia. 		</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>&#x3C;B&#x3E;You have reached the life of an Aussie Kid as recorded in their own Aussie Kids PodcastRoom.&#x3C;/B&#x3E;
&#x3C;BR&#x3E;&#x3C;BR&#x3E;

Welcome to our 2008 episodes. The students are working within a unit entitled "Being Aussie Being Proud".&#x3C;BR&#x3E;&#x3C;BR&#x3E;
Australia can be identified in many ways, from our unique plant and animal life to special places and people. Some say we have no claim to this country as we are not the traditional owners. Others say we only have a criminal history and just come from convict stock.&#x3C;BR&#x3E;&#x3C;BR&#x3E;
Others say we are a young country and have not had enough time to achieve anything special in the world. Our history is much greater than this.
&#x3C;BR&#x3E;&#x3C;BR&#x3E;

But what makes our country unique in the world?&#x3C;BR&#x3E;&#x3C;BR&#x3E;

What really makes us Aussie and why should we be proud?
&#x3C;BR&#x3E;&#x3C;BR&#x3E;
Just sit back, relax and enjoy another educational episode from the Aussie Kids PodCastRoom.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What would our lives be without light? We need it to see everything we do in every moment of the day. We rely on light to read a book, cross the street, admire artwork, watch the sunset, and look into faces. Light plays a role in some of our most sophisticated technology. It enables our CD&#8217;s to play music or record movies. High speed optical cable is used in our communications. Lasers are employed in cutting edge surgery and defence. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.science.org.au/primaryconnections/lightfantastic.htm">Light Fantastic </a>unit is an ideal way to link science with literacy in the classroom. It provides opportunities for students to explore where light comes from, how it is used, how light travels and how it helps us to see. Students&#8217; thinking about light and its role in our lives and our community will be developed using hands-on activities. In this podcast students (9 and 10 year olds) will explain how light helps us to see and how we can use light to create a shadow puppet theatre.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to another episode. We have been currently studying the question &#8220;Why we should be safe on the internet?&#8221; My class has been looking at the tricks and traps of using the internet. We have studied various advertising marketer strategies and the number of ways we can keep ourselves safe when using the internet.  </p>
<p>My class created and conducted their own Survey Monkey for schools around the world, to gather data and see whether there was a need to promote internet safety. From their intensive research they created their own persuasive report and interview session with their own advertising radio commercials. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Podcasting sounds fun, but what are the educational benefits behind it. How can you as a teacher successfully use it within your classroom? As an end of term reflection of my current teaching style, I gave the job to my students in the last week of school, to explain to me what they really enjoy about podcasting. Reviewing their work over the holidays I was quite surprised with their understanding of the educational benefits, so much so, that I really needed to share their knowledge with you. </p>
<p>So within this unplanned episode the students will be explaining to you why they enjoy podcasting, and as a teacher I will attempt to give you some tips and hints on how you can implement podcasting effectively and educationally within your classroom.</p>
<p>Why not check us out at <a href="http://www.yarrileess.eq.edu.au/home/ngilm6/home.html">St@rtWithIT</a> for more information about podcasting and what else we are up to in our classroom.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Podcasting sounds fun, but what are the educational benefits behind it. How can you as a teacher successfully use it within your classroom? As an end of term reflection of my current teaching style, I gave the job to my students in the last week of school, to explain to me what they really enjoy about podcasting. Reviewing their work over the holidays I was quite surprised with their understanding of the educational benefits, so much so, that I really needed to share their knowledge with you. 

So within this unplanned episode the students will be explaining to you why they enjoy podcasting, and as a teacher I will attempt to give you some tips and hints on how you can implement podcasting effectively and educationally within your classroom.

Why not check us out at St@rtWithIT for more information about podcasting and what else we are up to in our classroom.
