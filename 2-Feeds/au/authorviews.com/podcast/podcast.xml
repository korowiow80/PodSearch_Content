			<description><![CDATA[AuthorViews is excited to bring you the latest in our ongoing series of two-minute interviews with authors around the world. In this installment, we get the privilege of hearing from Betsy Carter, the founder of the award-winning magazine New York Woman. A former writer for publications such as Esquire and Newsweek, she continues to write for a variety of national magazines. 

This is far from Ms. Carter's first foray into the land of book-length writing. Her memoir Nothing to Fall Back On was a best seller and her fiction debut, The Orange Blossom Special, was part of NPR's Summer Reading 2005 program. 

The conversation we had with her at Tess Fest 2008 was about her newest novel Swim To Me, a book praised by numerous reviewers. Joanne Wilkinson of BookList says, "In her warm, appealing second novel, Carter displays a sure feel for her 1970s Florida setting, right down to the aqua color schemes." Publisher's Weekly says of her work, "The results are sensationalist, predictable and satisfying."

Get your feet wet with us as we join Betsy Carter on a romp that takes us from the Bronx to Weeki Wachee Springs in Tampa, Florida!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[AuthorViews is proud to present two minutes with the legendary GiO! We had the honor of catching up to this New Orleans icon during the 2007 Tennessee Williams Festival right here in the Crescent City. 

In this brief 120 seconds, GiO talks about her time on Bourbon Street as well as her contribution to Louisiana in Words. 

GiO came to perform in New Orleans during the 1988 Republican Convention and got hooked on the architecture and feeling of decay exuded by the city. With ten years of dancing behind her and degree from New York's Pratt Institute, she moved to New Orleans possessed of a vision. A vision of re-igniting the fires of classical burlesque and bringing it acknowledgement as a legitimate art form. 

Dubbed "The Burlesque Queen of New Orleans" by The Times-Picayune, she reigned on Bourbon Street for seventeen years. This highly educated woman has also been a radio host, poet, performance artist, and much, much more since the day she came to New Orleans and discovered that it was her home. 

Eloquent, playful, and lovely to behold, even with only two minutes, GiO is not one to miss!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Ladies and Gentlemen, AuthorViews is proud to announce two minutes with Pamela Davis-Noland. It's an intimate video chat that we performed at the 2008 Alternative Media Expo in New Orleans, in which she spoke about her debut novel, Coffee Colored Dreams. 

Ms. Davis-Noland deserves points for persistence. If she had crumbled when her first promised book deal fell through, then theater goers would have been deprived of a powerful stage presentation. That's right, after pursuing the tricky route of self publication Ms. Davis-Noland has brought her story to the stage where it is garnering rave reviews.

			<description><![CDATA[AuthorViews is proud to present two minutes with Vicki Lane, author of The Elizabeth Goodweather Appalachian Mysteries. We had the pleasure of catching up to Mrs. Lane at the 2007 Virginia Festival of the Book where she speaks about Old Wounds, her most recent book in the series, as well as her own personal background. 

Originally from Florida, Mrs. Lane has lived in Appalachia for more than thirty years now. Describing her past as that of a "back to the earth hippie," she keeps her books rooted in the realities of daily life in the mountains outside of Asheville, NC. She takes particular pride in the fact that she is often told that she got the dialect of the area right. 

Step into the mountains with Vicki Lane and you will never look at them the same way again!]]></description>

We had the pleasure of meeting with Mr. Taylor in New Orleans at the 2008 Alternative Media Expo to talk about his book and the Irish Ghost, Jack O'Keefe (no relation to Steve) that is one of its main characters. 

Because of O'Keefe's actions during his life, heaven did not want him. Having tricked the Devil twice during his life made hell equally inaccessible. Now Jack O'Keefe, a modern spin on the classic Jack O'Lantern myth, must roam the Earth in penance. It is through his eyes that 17th century Ireland is brought to the readers in the context of stories told to professional thief Adam Beesler. ]]></description>

			<itunes:author>AuthorViews</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[AuthorViews is thrilled to introduce Scott Gold, author of the juicy and succulent meat guide book, The Shameless Carnivore: A Manifesto for Meat Lovers. 

We met up with Gold at the 2008 Tennessee Williams/New Orleans Literary Festival to talk about his gourmet debut, as well as the research, interviews and shocking taste-tests that make the book so informative, comprehensive and fun.

The Shameless Carnivore is NOT an anti-vegetarian outcry for people to kill and consume animals recklessly. Rather, it's a thoughtful, humorous and research-driven exploration of the "integrity of meat," complete with personal accounts of Gold's experiences with different types of meat, the history of hunting and meat-eating, meat recipes and more.

Was Scott Gold involved in an outrageous Vegan Conspiracy? If The Shameless Carnivore were a cut of meat, what kind of cut would it be? Find out now in this mouth-watering two-minute video. After the clip, if you're still hungry for a second helping, feel free to check out an excerpt from the book at the Random House website. Bon Appetit! ]]></description>

			<title>Alice Wilson-Fried</title>
			<itunes:author>AuthorViews</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[AuthorViews is proud to present two minutes with New Orleans-born author Alice Wilson-Fried, cut from her interview at the 2008 Alternative Media Expo in New Orleans. 

We met up with Wilson-Fried to discuss her fiction debut, Outside Child, a wonderfully written and believable mystery set in New Orleans. The main characters, Ladonis Washington and her brother HeartTrouble, grow up in the notorious Magnolia Housing Projects of Uptown New Orleans -- where Wilson-Fried lived for most of her childhood. 

Built in 1941, at its height, the Magnolia Projects housed more than 2000 people in over 1400 apartments. But by the time Hurricane Katrina flooded the area in August 2005, the Magnolia Projects were almost completely vacant. Now, almost 3 years after the storm, the city has begun to demolish the abandoned ruins. 

For the past couple of decades, the Magnolia Projects were known throughout the entire country for their insanely high violent-crime and drug-use rates. According to Wilson-Fried, however, the projects weren't always like that. 

In this video, Wilson-Fried talks about what the Magnolia Housing Projects were like when she was a child, before gangs, drugs and violence plagued the community. In Outside Child, Wilson-Fried takes the reader through a seemingly neglected period of New Orleans history. If you like the video, feel free to check out an excerpt from the book at Wilson-Fried's website. ]]></description>

			<title>Caesar Meadows</title>
			<itunes:author>AuthorViews</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[AuthorViews would like to introduce cartoonist Caesar Meadows, creator of the comic strip Mumbeaux Gumbo, which appears monthly in the New Orleans magazine Where Y'at. 

Growing up in New Orleans, Meadows would buy his comic books at local K&B Drug Stores, which were bought out by Rite Aid in the late 1990s. He spent a great deal of his childhood enjoying comics and ultimately taught himself how to illustrate and write his own cartoons. 

In addition to Mumbeaux Gumbo, Meadows has another strip called Qomix published by Antigravity Magazine. Meadows self-publishes both strips as micro-comics -- miniature versions small enough to fit in your pocket -- and sells them in hand-made cardboard packages shaped like pyramids, robots, TV sets and microbuses.

Meadows does most of his work out of Jigsaw Junction, a quaint house in Reserve, LA, that serves as both his own personal art studio and one of Louisiana's only public libraries for comics. 

In this video, Meadows discusses the role comics played in his childhood and why he chose to name his strip Mumbeaux Gumbo. ]]></description>

			<title>Dr. Milo Pinkerton III</title>
			<itunes:author>AuthorViews</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[AuthorViews would like to introduce mad scientist Dr. Milo Pinkerton III, a.k.a Lewis D'Aubin, founder and lead vocalist of The Consortium of Genius (COG). 

The COG is half rock band, half sketch comedy routine with an array of funny and sinister characters. They perform all over New Orleans and have even made several TV appearances. You can check out some of the COG's sketches, music videos and the television series, COG TV, on their YouTube Channel. 

We met up with Dr. Pinkerton at the 2008 Alternative Media Expo in New Orleans -- not so much to talk about the band, its accomplishments or its upcoming shows; but rather to discuss Dr. Pinkerton's ambitious goal of TAKING OVER THE WORLD. 

This is without a doubt the least educational video AuthorViews has ever released. It has no value whatsoever and will not enlighten you in the least about the COG or Dr. Pinkerton's musical talents. But that's okay because it's fun to watch and you can find out anything you want to know about the band, including upcoming "lectures," bios, lyrics, pictures, videos and reviews, at the COG's EVIL website, www.consortiumofgenius.com. ]]></description>

Bevis' debut book, And God Looked Away: A Katrina Journal, is a graphic and vivid personal account of the traumatic experiences that Bevis and his girlfriend endured and witnessed while riding out the most destructive natural disaster in American history. 

But as Bevis discusses in the video, it wasn't the storm itself that did most of the damage. Levee failure, subsequent flooding and the pitifully slow governmental response were what really did New Orleans in. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[AuthorViews is pleased to present two minutes with young adult fiction author Paula Chase-Hyman, cut from her interview at the 2007 Virginia Festival of the Book. 

Chase-Hyman met up with AuthorViews to discuss So Not the Drama, the first novel in her Del Rio Bay Clique series. So Not the Drama is a funny and meaningful story about friendships, name-calling and the pursuit of popularity in high school. What makes this novel different than your typical high school story, however, is its incorporation of ethnic and cultural diversity. Finally, a teen book in which not all the characters are white! 

There are now two more Del Rio Bay Clique novels available, as well: Don't Get It twisted and That's What's Up. 

In this video, Chase-Hyman talks about So Not the Drama, and her inspiration to write stories for teens that embrace -- rather than ignore -- diversity. ]]></description>

			<title>Tedd M. Walley</title>

			<description><![CDATA[AuthorViews is pleased to present two minutes with writer, graphic artist and publisher, Tedd M. Walley, cut from his interview at the 2008 Alternative Media Expo in New Orleans. Walley is the creator of Voodoo Maverick Publishing and its explicit, violent and unique comic book series, MATHILDA: The Forces of Evil VS. The 3rd Grade. 

At first glance, I didn't know what to expect. Walley approached the AuthorViews booth dressed completely in black -- black boots, black leather pants, black shirt and black hat -- with tattoos, piercings, aviator sunglasses, and even a few skulls here and there. You don't have to be a detective to figure out why Walley is often referred to as the "man-in-black" of the comic book world. 

Once the interview began, it was obvious that beneath the dark exterior was an extremely talented, creative and well-spoken individual. Walley is an entrepreneur, comprising his own one-man company called Voodoo Maverick Publishing. Walley founded the company so that he could launch, develop and market MATHILDA effectively. 

It's amazing how much effort Walley puts into Voodoo Maverick and MATHILDA. He does everything -- writing, penciling, inking, lettering, advertising, marketing, promotions and web design. All this on the side of his full-time job as the Professor of Visual Communication at Delgado Community College in New Orleans. 

In this video, Walley discusses MATHILDA and why he thinks readers enjoy it so much. ]]></description>

AuthorViews met up with Louie Crowder at the 2008 Alternative Media Expo in New Orleans to talk about Calme Au Blanc. In this two-minute video cut from his interview, Crowder discusses how living in a city as culturally rich as New Orleans can have a profound impact on what people do and how they do it. For Crowder, New Orleans culture permeates what he writes about and even his writing style. 

We are releasing this video just in time for Calme Au Blanc's final week of performances. After a successful run at the Big Top Gallery in New Orleans, this is your last chance to catch the play. 

The final three performances are Thursday through Saturday, March 27 - 29, at 8:00PM at the Big Top Gallery. 

Also, to give you a preview of Calme Au Blanc, Crowder was nice enough to provide an excerpt from the play, which you can read below the video. ]]></description>

			<title>Michael &quot;Rex&quot; Dingler</title>
			<itunes:author>AuthorViews</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[From the Crescent City, AuthorViews is excited to introduce Michael "Rex" Dingler, New Orleans artist, activist and creator of the NoLa Rising Project. We met up with Dingler at the 2008 Alternative Media Expo in New Orleans for an interview you don't want to miss. 

If you've had the chance to wander around New Orleans within the last year or so, anywhere from the bustling streets of the French Quarter to the emptiness of the lower Ninth Ward, you've no doubt seen the uplifting work of Dingler and his NoLa Rising Project. 

NOLA Rising is a post-Katrina art campaign encouraging the people of New Orleans to display works of art across all areas of the city, in hopes of renewing the creative spirit of New Orleans and just giving residents something bright and cheerful to smile about. 

Since the project's inception in mid-2007, Dingler personally has drawn over 2000 posters and 500 signs that have been put up by NoLa Rising "street teams" on walls, telephone polls, bulletin boards -- anywhere and everywhere -- throughout the Greater New Orleans area. 

Dingler has spawned an entire movement out of his vision to brighten up New Orleans. Friends and supporters contribute to NoLa Rising with paintings and signs by the hundreds, hoping to replace the bleakness of a hurricane's aftermath with creativity, color and the New Orleans spirit. 

For some (ridiculous) reason, there are a few individuals throughout the city who have taken offense at the project, viewing the art as nothing more than graffiti. 

According to an article in The Gambit Weekly, "Fighting the Aerosol Nation," for the past five years, Fred Radtke has been in charge of a Louisiana nonprofit organization called Operation: Clean Sweep, essentially an anti-graffiti task force. 

With the support of local government and law enforcement, Radtke is responsible for removing graffiti. But since he can't just erase the graffiti, Radtke covers it with gray paint, and consequently has come to be known as the The Gray Ghost. 

Over the past few months, Radtke and Operation: Clean Sweep have begun to target NoLa Rising, specifically Rex Dingler. This is not only unfair, but insane, since Dingler clearly has positive intentions, not to mention the fact that this project has nothing to do with graffiti -- it's installation artwork that can be removed easily. What's the point of painting the "gray ghost" over a stapled-up poster that you can simply pull down? 

Radtke has gone so far as to have a police officer cite Dingler for 1,100 counts of illegally posting on telephone polls, an absurd charge that Dingler is fighting wholeheartedly, despite the immense cost of his legal defense. As the trial date nears, here's what Dingler has to say about Radtke. 

Taking the advice of his legal representation, Buddy Spell of the law firm Spell & Spell, Dingler has set up a defense fund to help him raise enough money to cover his legal costs. Donations to the fund can be made to: 

SPELL & SPELL
C/O Michael Dingler Defense Fund
924 Ellis Street
Franklinton, LA 70438

Check out Dingler's AuthorViews video and the Defend New Orleans video, for more information on NoLa Rising and the trumped-up charges against the artist. 

There's also a good article in New Orleans CityBusiness, called "'Gray Ghost' Feuds with Nola Rising Creator," which offers statements from both Dingler and Radtke. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[AuthorViews is excited to present two minutes with fantasy novelist Chris Matherne, cut from his interview at the 2007 New Orleans Book Fair. 

Matherne is a life-long fan of fantasy and adventure novels. In fact, he decided to write The Shaping of a Destiny because he was tired of reading "slow paced fantasy adventure books that seemed to crawl along at a snail's pace." Matherne's debut novel is anything but slow. 

In this video, Matherne discusses why he thinks readers enjoy The Shaping of a Destiny, and offers two humorous anecdotes about his writing experiences. ]]></description>

AuthorViews met up with Pierce at the 2007 New Orleans Book Fair to talk about her first poetry anthology, Geometry of the Heart. Although Pierce has had nearly 60 poems published in various books and anthologies, this is the first time she has published an entire book with her work exclusively.

			<description><![CDATA[AuthorViews would like to introduce Dedra Johnson, an accomplished writer, blogger and novelist, who has been doing fantastic blogging work with our sister company, Patron Saint Productions. 

Dedra sat down with AuthorViews at the 2007 New Orleans Book Fair to talk about her debut novel, Sandrine's Letter to Tomorrow, an inspiring story about a light-skinned black girl who grows up in 1970s New Orleans in an environment of poverty, racial prejudice and emotional abuse. 

A resident of the Crescent City, Dedra has received tremendous praise for her book locally, as well as nationally. Sandrine's Letter to Tomorrow is well-written, with rich, realistic characters that seem to touch readers who grew up not only in New Orleans, but in any city where race and class were often divisive issues. 

In this two-minute video, Dedra describes how 9-year-old Sandrine evolves over the course of the story, ultimately learning to stand up to some of the negative forces in her life. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[AuthorViews is proud to present two minutes with Ann Conti Morcos, cut from her interview at the 2007 New Orleans Book Fair. 

With nearly two decades of writing and editing experience, Morcos published her first children's book in 2002. The Tale of Nada Nutria is a story about a community of nutria that gets separated when a hurricane destroys their home. 

Nutria are large rat-like rodents, ranging from 10-20 pounds in adulthood. Native to South America, nutria were brought to Louisiana by fur traders in the early 1900s. 

The Tale of Nada Nutria is truly one-of-a-kind, the first and only children's book ever written about nutria. What's remarkable is that Morcos is able to express themes as powerful and human as friendship, family and courage with nutria as her main characters. 

In this video, Morcos describes the two historical Louisiana events that her story is based on, and explains why she actually decided to write a children's book about nutria. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[From the world of fantasy AuthorViews brings you two minutes with Robert Fanney, a new author video, filmed at the 2007 Virginia Festival of the Book

Luthiel's Song is geared towards young adult readers, primarily young girls (11-16 years old) with a taste for the heroic and fantastic. Fanney shares with us this world he has created, a place where dreams and nightmares often intrude upon day to day life. 

His foundling hero, Luthiel, breaks from the pattern of the traditional changeling in that rather than being an elf left to be raised by humans she has been left with the elves. On the advent of her fifteenth birthday things change drastically. She finds herself fighting through the dreamworld in a quest to save someone close to her from dying. 

Dreams are the source of magic in Robert Fanney's world, which is cause for both hope and fear. Now through the magic of the internet you can hear him share the thoughts and ideas that compose the framework of this delightful fantasy world!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[From the dark side of the Mississippi Delta Author Views brings you two minutes with John Pritchard, a new author video, filmed at the 2007 Tennessee Williams / New Orleans Literary Fest

A native of the Delta region, Pritchard shares a darkly humorous take on the deep south in Junior Ray. In this, his first novel, he presents a study of two characters who are polar opposites. Episodic in nature, the story is basically a character study of people separated by social class. It also addresses the theme of just how much will people accept in the name of being "protected form danger."

A warm and sociable gentleman, Pritchard candidly shares the joy being published has given him, beaming like a child on Christmas morning when he speaks of his book. This brief video opens a window onto the pride of creation and the satisfaction of becoming a published author.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[It is our distinct pleasure to bring you a new author video, filmed at the 2007 Tennessee Williams / New Orleans Literary Fest.

When most people hear the phrase "Louisiana Politics," the first thing to cross their mind is usually either corruption or absurdity. New Orleans native Jason Berry takes those preconceptions and tops them with his political comedy, Last of the Red Hot Poppas. 

While most people know him for his hard hitting investigations into sexual abuse in the catholic priesthood, Berry has been both an historian and a cultural writer for many years. In this 2 minute video he talks about branching out into yet another genre with this knee slapping comedy of scandal and politics, a work that begins with the all too believable premise of a Louisiana governor being found deceased and naked with lipstick in some incriminating places. The story is a wild romp that is nothing short of scandalicious!]]></description>

Now imagine those first few days with no electricity, no air conditioning, no running water -- inside the psych ward at the Orleans Parish Prison!

In this brief video, nurse Gavin Johnson talks about getting through Katrina with his elderly father in the psychiatric ward of a prison in downtown New Orleans where they had to shoot the windows out just to get air.

Don't worry -- this video is actually sweet, not graphic; many of the rumors about the prison -- such as a mass escape -- were flat wrong. For the full inside view, get a copy of Gavin Johnson's new book, Prisoners of Katrina.]]></description>

Munsch is the creator of such classics as The Paper Bag Princess, Mud Puddle, and Thomas' Snowsuit. The manic Mr. Munsch has a unique way of writing -- his stories are created live, in the classroom, based on one of the kids, then honed over years of telling until the lines are just right.

Robert Munsch has written hundreds of books. His books have sold over 30 million copies. Annick Press recently released a compendium of Munschworks -- a four-volume collection of Robert Munsch stories.

In this 2-minute video, filmed at the Toronto offices of Annick Press, Munsch describes the difficulty in translating the animation of his verbal stories to paper. The video gives a wee glimpse into the magic of Munsch. We hope you'll enjoy it!]]></description>

In Your Face is about "the pressure on teens to live up to unattainable ideals of beauty," according to Graydon. The book talks about where our ideas of beauty come from, all the way back to early childhood. It goes on to take its readers through an historical and cross-cultural look at physical ideals.

Made You Look is also aimed at young readers, examining how they're targeted by marketing and advertising. Like In Your Face, this book also delves into the ideals that are pressed upon teens by various societal influences. 

In this 2-minute video, filmed at the Toronto offices of publisher Annick Press, Graydon explains how and why these ideals are unobtainable and describes her hopes for creating a more "media-literate" youth.]]></description>

This 2-minute video was filmed at Annick Press&apos; gorgeous offices overlooking the harbour in downtown Vancouver&apos;s historic Gastown district. In the video, Foon is bathed in luminous green light as he talks about the ecological underpinnings of his epic adventure.</itunes:summary>

The accolades include Foreword Magazine's Book of the Year Award, the American Library Association's Michael L.

If you have read any of Loris' books (Boy Soup, Dirty Dog Boogie, Cabbagehead, Nothing Beats A Pizza and Zigzag, among others), you will appreciate this glimpse into the source of that rich humor. Loris lights up for the camera, with mischief in her eyes and poetry on her lips.

In this video, Loris Lesynski talks mostly about her new book, I Did It Because.... Students always ask Loris where her stories and language come from. This is her response, an instructional book for young authors that teaches in a delightful way "how a poem happens."

With this cookbook, Hoyer excludes the Americanized version of what Mexican food is and instead gives a gastronomical survey of authentic cuisine from various geographical regions of Mexico.

In addition to recipes for these dishes, Hoyer also gives adaptation instructions for modern approaches to traditional Mexican cooking methods, such as making your own tortillas.

He describes one of his favorite recipes from the book, Cochinita Pibil, or Pit-Roasted Pork, in this 2-minute video filmed in Santa Fe, New Mexico. WARNING: If you watch this clip when you're hungry, it could cause panic.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Today's 2-minute video is a real treat, thanks to the robust storytelling of artist and author Franklin Adams.

The video was filmed at the Bywater Tech Center in June, 2006. Franklin Adams is Professor Emeritus at Tulane University where he was dean of the school of architecture before he retired.

Professor Adams' book, The Yellow River Kid, co-written with James Whitmore, is an adventure yarn built around a floatplane. The authors have been working on the story for decades. In fact, they've been at it so long that Adams has difficulty telling the difference between his characters and real people, as you'll see.

The Yellow River Kid is a manuscript in production. As soon as copies are available, we'll post a purchase link next to the video. If you want to contact Professor Adams about his book, just drop us a line here at AuthorViews.]]></description>

In today's 2-minute video, Underwood talks about her use of language in art. An early and ardent blogger (see her New Orleans Gypsy blog), Underwood weaves words into her work, quite literally. The day we filmed, she was writing out in longhand the names of the dead from Hurricane Katrina.

Salisbury bases many of her characters on family and friends. In this 2-minute video, filmed at the 2006 Virginia Festival of the Book, she explains a particularly unique part of her family history that inspired one of the "wild women" of the book’s title.

The Wild Women of Lake Anna is a family affair in other ways, too. Salisbury's son, Christopher Grotke, did the illustrations for the book. ]]></description>

It's the fictional tale of Patricia Morelos and her adventurous son, who leaves Washington, D.C., and heads to Mexico. The 17-year-old runs off without his mother's permission to assist in rescue efforts at a disastrous silver mine cave-in. When Morelos' son is kidnapped, she soon realizes she will have to rescue him herself -- with no help from the authorities.

Filmed just days after a mandatory evacuation order was lifted, the series contains the poignant reactions of New Orleans' offbeat literary community to the destruction of their hometown.

Today's 2-minute segment features school teacher James Newton, whose parents met and married in New Orleans. Wanting to contribute directly to the recovery, Jim sought out a teaching position in the city.

In an update to this piece, Jim tells us that his efforts to become a teacher in New Orleans were rebuffed by the Louisiana Department of Education, which was still in shock and not reponding very well in those days. So Jim took a position with the heavily-damaged Jackson County, Mississippi, school district, which welcomed him with open arms.]]></description>

I watched as Underwood wrote by hand all the names of those who died in Hurricane Katrina. Listen to how she used the list in her memorial installation.

In a ritual at the Dougherty Arts Center tomorrow, August 29, beginning at 9:30 a.m., Underwood and volunteers will recite all 1900 names. Her memorial service is just one of the thousands of Katrina anniversary events being held throughout the world.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[AuthorViews turned around the camera on filmmaker David S. White at the 2005 New Orleans Bookfair. Like the other people in our "Katrina Tapes" collection, David had just returned to the city and has that Post-Traumatic look most of us carried that day.

Imagine being a budding filmmaker, working for years and finally getting a film accepted for viewing at a major film festival, then having all that wash away in front of your eyes. It's unbelievable the amount of trauma Katrina wrought -- even for those whose possessions were not drowned under eight feet of toxic saltwater.

Today, David S. White stands at the brink of a dream fulfilled. On Thursday, August 31, 2006 -- weather permitting -- his latest film, Sex Between Us, will debut at the Howlin' Wolf club in New Orleans. Again, weather permitting, his short film, The Date, will premiere at the New Orleans Film Festival in October.]]></description>

On my first trip back to New Orleans after Katrina, the city was under mandatory evacuation orders and largely deserted except for National Guard troops and relief workers. Rolling down Bourbon Street on my way out of town, who should I see but Josh Clark, tape recorder in hand, gathering as much first-hand testimony as his batteries would permit.

Louisiana in Words is not a transcript of those observations -- a treasure trove that chronicler Clark will no doubt publish some day. Rather, the book contains extremely short contributions from people in all walks of life -- well-known writers to unknown farmers -- from all over the Great State of Louisiana.

Sula's mutual affection for her owner is evident, as she eagerly licks his face. That symbiosis is one of the major tenets of Foster's most recent book, The Dogs Who Found Me. The non-fiction work is about 17 stray dogs that Foster has rescued throughout his life and, as he puts it, "how they helped me."

			<itunes:summary>Just in case anyone&apos;s confused about Ken Foster&apos;s canine love, he sports a T-shirt that reads, &quot;I Love My Pit Bull,&quot; and shares his camera time with his own pet pit bull, Sula.

Sula&apos;s mutual affection for her owner is evident, as she eagerly licks his face. That symbiosis is one of the major tenets of Foster&apos;s most recent book, The Dogs Who Found Me. The non-fiction work is about 17 stray dogs that Foster has rescued throughout his life and, as he puts it, &quot;how they helped me.&quot;

Foster&apos;s dogs comforted him through 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, and other traumatic events. In this 2-minute video, he explains how his dogs helped him realize he had a near-fatal heart condition.</itunes:summary>

			<description><![CDATA[Pat Feeney points out that although the Cuban Missile Crisis has been covered extensively in books, none of those written words have ever really told the tale of the American military wives and children.

Her first book, An Indefinite Period, is a nonfiction account of her experience on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base as one of those military wives. In this 2-minute video, captured at the 2006 Virginia Festival of the Book, Feeney gives us a glimpse at the evacuation procedure she and her children endured during the Crisis.

Watch the video to see how words from John F. Kennedy during that evacuation still move her, more than 40 years later, and inspired the title of her book.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This video of the flamboyant Ms. Heller was filmed over a year ago in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Both Heller and AuthorViews have moved around so much in the interim it was hard to get approval to release the video. Today, we can finally share this 2-minute gem with you.

If You Hear the Message Three Times, LISTEN is a collection of anecdotes from Heller's life. They're "my stories, told with my sense of humor," she says. 

In the video, Heller relates the story of a cave dive in Hawaii where she went searching for the meaning of life. All of a sudden, the author -- who is also a singer -- belts out the song that came to her during her dive.

What song did she hear? Watch and find out!]]></description>

Perfect Steel Trap: Harpers Ferry 1859 is the product of O'Connor's research into the infamous arsenal raid in 1859 and the subsequent capture, trial, and hanging of John Brown. The novel is written in the fictional voices of Brown's son, Owen, and Osborne Anderson, who both helped with the raid. Although the book is historical fiction, the content is nearly 100% factually accurate.

			<description><![CDATA[We conclude our series, "The Katrina Tapes," with this extraordinary video of University of New Orleans professor and anthropologist, Martha Ward, discussing her book, Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau.

Laveau was a Creole hairdresser who worked in the French Quarter and lived in nearby Faubourg Marigny. She and her daughter, also named Marie Laveau, were renowned Voodooists. Both these women were sought out as healers and advisors and held prominent places in New Orleans society.

In this 2-minute clip, Ward, wearing colors as wild as her book's cover, talks about her research, including attending Voodoo ceremonies and touring St. Louis Cemetery #1. How much of Laveau is fact or fiction? Watch.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Abram Himelstein is a teacher in the New Orleans Public School System -- or was -- there is not much left of the System these days. He's also an organizer for the New Orleans Bookfair and the co-author, with Jamie Schweser, of Tales of a Punk Rock Nothing.

In this 2-minute video clip, Himelstein describes the traditional route of the self-published author: throw the books in the trunk of a car, get on the road, try to sell enough copies to cover gas and meals.

From this modest beginning, Tales of a Punk Rock Nothing has gone to over 20,000 copies in print. About 5000 of those copies turned back into pulp when Hurricane Katrina added thousands of gallons of water to the storage facility holding the books.

This is Himelstein's second video for AuthorViews. Be sure to check out his video for The Neighborhood Story Project -- an amazing program for helping students become publishers while capturing the history of their neighborhoods.]]></description>

Hot Iron Press is a quality letterpress shop -- or was, anyway -- it's hard to do quality letterpress under 5 feet of water. Kyle and partner Jennie LeBlanc just celebrated the release of their new book, "Making Stuff and Doing Things (The How 2 Book)" from Microcosm Press. It's a collection based on the popular "How 2 Zine" and it's only $10 cheap so you should buy it and help them rebuild from Katrina!

Kyle Bravo and Jennie LeBlanc are still in Denton, Texas, but hopeful of returning to New Orleans in the near future. In this 2-minute video, Kyle talks a little about the Bookfair and a little more about what makes New Orleans so special. Just listen.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Photographer and installation artist Elizabeth Underwood lost everything to hurricane Katrina except her body. Taken were her home, her job, and her life's work.

In today's 2-minute video, Underwood looks like a schoolgirl with Post Katrina Stress Disorder: A stack of subversive texts tilted on her hip, the distracted look in her eyes of someone who only hours earlier got to see the pulp that used to be her property.

We were lucky to have Elizabeth Underwood in New Orleans for the last decade. We will be lucky to get her back again, soon. Her web site, which is loaded with Underwood's unsettling photography ("an exploration of the trauma survivor"), indicates Underwood will return to the Crescent City in the winter of 2006 "as part of a fine-arts fellowship to explore the psychological and aesthetic effects of the region's devastation."

You can start with your own video, Ms. Underwood. So should you, dear reader.

Chef Katrina is one of our green people (we'll have another one later this week). She illustrates the sort of local color you'll find at the New Orleans Bookfair, the annual Halloween gathering of counterculture authors, performance artists, and ne'er-do-wells.

The 2005 Bookfair took place at the Zeitgeist Theater / Barrister's Gallery on Oretha Castle Haley Blvd. in the Central City district of New Orleans. We found Chef Katrina wandering the aisles, mostly spent of her powers, yet still ladeling toxic gumbo for all to remember her by.

			<description><![CDATA[I can't imagine a better way to start The Katrina Tapes here at AuthorViews than with longtime New Orleans Bookfair organizer Abram Himelstein.

Abram has been involved with the Bookfair since it began in 2001. More importantly, he is co-director of the Neighborhood Story Project (NSP), one of the most ingenious and successful high school writing programs I have ever encountered. Through the NSP, high school students use interviews and photography to collect the stories of their neighborhoods. Words and art are then edited, polished, and assembled into quality paperback books.

The five books that have resulted from this project are extraordinary. They have become bestsellers in local bookstores. Student authors have found themselves on the receiving end of media attention (NPR) and $1000 advances against book royalties. What a fabulous way to teach writing, journalism, publishing, and business -- all while capturing the oral history of a community.

Our 2-minute video with Abram was shot live at the 2005 New Orleans Bookfair and contains ambient trumpet as a stamp of authenticity. I think you'll enjoy this video and I hope you'll check out the Neighborhood Story Project web site for great inspiration.

			<title>St. Augustine Church</title>
			<itunes:author>AuthorViews</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Beginning next week, AuthorViews will start releasing "The Katrina Tapes" -- a series of interviews filmed at the New Orleans Bookfair in October, 2005.

The Bookfair was the first major post-K cultural event in the city, coming just 2 weeks after the mandatory evacuation was lifted and residents were invited back home (or invited back homeless, as the case often was). This is a startling collection of first-hand impressions and we look forward to bringing them to you.

We're starting with this very short video of St. Augustine Church -- the oldest African-American Catholic Church in America. In the aftermath of Katrina, the Archdiocese of New Orleans decided to close "Saint Aug" -- a decision that has met with an outpouring of local, national, and international support for this landmark church.

This video marks another landmark: AuthorViews intern David Kaplan will be graduating from Tulane University next week. David was our first digital video intern. In the past few months he has sampled every aspect of filmmaking for the web. He did the camera work on this piece, along with much of the editing and titling.

Our video of Saint Aug is really more of a snapshot than a story. Several of us here at the New Orleans office have been involved in the campaign to save Saint Aug. We are pleased to note that the Archdiocese has given Saint Aug a reprieve to increase membership and save the church. We'll keep you posted.

You can also enjoy a radio documentary on Saint Augustine produced by AuthorViews' own George Ingmire at neworleansnarratives.com.

			<description><![CDATA[We are very pleased to release an expanded installation at AuthorViews today for Molly Bruce "Brucie" Jacobs' new book, Secret Girl, a memoir from St. Martin's Press.

Secret Girl tells how Brucie Jacobs came to discover she had a "mentally retarded" sister who had been institutionalized since birth, and how Brucie came to know this sister and bond with her in the last years of her secret sister's life.

In addition to Brucie's 2-minute video, shot after closing time at the Virginia Festival of the Book, St. Martin's has given us permission to run an excerpt from the book -- the scene in which Brucie first hears about the Secret Girl.

			<description><![CDATA[We are delighted to present for you today a two-minute video on one of the most extraordinary books I have ever seen: Microchip Manufacturing, by Dr. Stanley Wolf.

Microchip Manufacturing is a step-by-step guide to producing the computer chips that are built into everything nowadays from credit cards to smart clothing. The book is an incredible publishing achievement, with full-color illustrations on every page, most of which were created by the author of the text, Dr. Stanley Wolf.

Along with the two-minute video for this book, we have permission to share an excerpt with you. The excerpt covers how to set-up and run a "Wafer Fab" -- a factory for building computer chips! It's a PDF file -- not HTML -- so you'll have to download it to view the gorgeous illustrations.

Microchip Manufacturing is really a book on practical nanotechnology. It may be over the head of many readers, but the book is the sort of "labor of love" that we enjoy featuring here at AuthorViews.

TVS and Two Fingers is a performance troupe out of Fort Collins, Colorado, who take their zany brand of musicianship into schools to educate and entertain. We shot this video while recording interviews with two Fort Collins authors, the incomparable Pat Hartman and Tim Van Schmidt (a.k.a. TVS).

This video features a poem called Scissors and it's one of the shortest cuts on our site. Yes, we'll probably never make the cut for MTV, but it's a quick clip so check it out.

			<description><![CDATA[There is no doubt that this was the most difficult interview to film in the AuthorViews summer tour 2005. I remember how hard it was for me to retain my composure and continue to ask Steven Boone to open his wounded heart for us to see. This brief clip -- just a few seconds, really -- feels like an eternity, which is, in fact, its destination.

A Heart Traced in Sand is the story of a teenage girl with an incandescent spirit and a father who is forced to watch and learn as her body is stolen by cancer. Even as her form betrays her, Naomi nurtures a "warrior spirit." We can all benefit from watching with her father as Naomi's story unfolds.

At the beginning of Easter week, Steven's loss and Naomi's triumph are vivid reminders of the poignancy of the cycle of life. We are privileged to share this vision with you.

Steven Boone -- Thank You and Welcome to AuthorViews.

			<description><![CDATA[I love the name of this novel: Long Pig. In today's 2-minute video, you'll learn the reason William C. Miller bestowed that unusual title on his new book.

Long Pig is a comic novel about politics, centered around a mayoral election in San Francisco where anything goes. Down here in New Orleans, we are in the throes of a mayoral election that is as bizarre as any in history. Some 20-plus candidates are competing for the votes of a displaced electorate. Long Pig hits home.

Author William C. Miller is quite familiar with the vagaries of California politics. A long-time trial lawyer, he is particularly proud of his rendering of the courtroom scenes in this satire of California political and media madness.

Nagler abandoned her home, her fiance, her career, even her country in search of... something. We can all relate to that itch to just split. But Nagler actually did it, traveling on her own to Central America where she met a Mayan shaman and lost herself in the jungle.

What happened when she returned from this quest? Watch this brief 2-minute clip and find out. Jun Q'anil: One Who Walks The Way is recommended for anyone who needs to break out of the box of modern Western living and tap a deeper sense of meaning.

Nagler abandoned her home, her fiance, her career, even her country in search of... something. We can all relate to that itch to just split. But Nagler actually did it, traveling on her own to Central America where she met a Mayan shaman and lost herself in the jungle.

What happened when she returned from this quest? Watch this brief 2-minute clip and find out. Jun Q&apos;anil: One Who Walks The Way is recommended for anyone who needs to break out of the box of modern Western living and tap a deeper sense of meaning.

			<description><![CDATA[Pat Hartman's second book set in Venice, California, Ghost Town is a nickname for the Oakwood district of Venice known for being a dangerous place. Dangerous, but the rents were cheap.

Part Hartman raised her daughter in Ghost Town. This is a memoir of her time there in the early 1980s. Ghost Town is a microcosm of the Venice experience, complete with colorful characters, rampant crime, and a family scene at the very edge of the American experience.

Pat helped shepherd many writers, including me, as editor of Salon: A Journal of Aesthetics. You can find back issues at her web site. Today, she continues to make the establishment uncomfortable with her thoughtful essays at EarthBlog -- including a rant against circumcision that is painful to read!

			<description><![CDATA[We offer a very moving video today with "business therapist" Maureen Walsh, who has made a career of helping artistic people appreciate business while helping business people appreciate the arts. Maureen was our host for the Santa Fe AuthorViews shoot in 2005.

Maureen Walsh is co-author with Marilyn Graman of the book, The Female Power Within. The two women founded Life Works in Manhattan which for years has been conducting workshops to help women understand and use their natural female power. This book is based on those classes. We are fortunate to have an excerpt from the book for you to enjoy as well.

In her 2-minute video, Walsh talks about female power: it's noticed most when it's missing. It is an emotional interview that capped a long day. Through the video, you can see how powerful authorship is, too: we author these books and they change our lives.

			<description><![CDATA[The World Cafe is a guidebook that teaches how to host productive conversations, whether in the salon setting of a living room or the more structured setting of a boardroom.

In four years of filming author interviews, I have never met a speaker with the depth of sincerity combined with the knowledge of her subject that Juanita Brown displays. I could have filmed her for hours. But to meet our strict 2-minute rule, I not only had to slash her interview but I also had to include co-author David Isaacs, the gentler half of this amazing author team.

I think the two minutes that survived editing is terrific. This book offers something I've never seen before which the world desperately needs: a structured way to talk with each other. My hat is off to Juanita Brown and David Isaacs and their seminal guide, The World Cafe.

Debra is an image consultant who works with authors, among others, helping them to communicate with style. I like Debra's approach -- she's more concerned about finding a look that reflects your personality than forcing you to look like someone else in order to succeed in business.

AuthorViews can be used for more than just introducing books. We have filmed interviews with performance artists, literary agents, media coaches, acquisition editors, etc. Today's 2-minute video is a good example of how people can use AuthorViews to market to authors and others in the book trade.

It might not be Wolfgang's Vault -- the recently commercialized collection of concert promoter Bill Graham's memorabilia -- but Van Scmidt's archive provides a valuable, first-person account of the U.S. music scene through the eyes and ears of a local journalist.

In this 2-minute video, Van Schmidt lets us in on a joke with John Cage and shares an orange with Carlos Santana. For those who lived through the '70s and now want to remember them -- or those fascinated with the musical history of that era -- King Koncert delivers pictures and profiles not available anywhere else.

Beast of Bengal is a mystery novel based on one of those Letters from Calcutta. In that letter, author Elaine Pinkerton's father describes a corpse discovered at the hospital where he is stationed in India.

Pinkerton has filled in the backstory of this mystery with her imagination. It is all set against a background of Gandhi's struggle to liberate India from foreign rule. Elaine Pinkerton lays out the details in this 2-minute video.

Sixty years after Richard's service as a doctor in India, this box of letters arrived at his daughter's house. The communiques inside the box were so riveting they cost Elaine Pinkerton her job. She quit work to edit them into this volume: From Calcutta with Love.

Those who served in the China-Burma-India theater, their families and loved ones, will appreciate the detail and nuance these letters contain about life in Calcutta mid-century. What they'll also find are tender expressions of love along with the unvarnished horrors of war. Please join Richard & Reva's daughter, Elaine Pinkerton, as she introduces this long distance love affair in today's 2-minute clip.

In two breathless minutes, Epting takes us on a verbal tour of fascinating places. He stops at the spot where the first plane flew, where Ben Franklin flew a kite, where the corndog was invented! Chris' previous book, James Dean Died Here, was National Public Radio's "Book of the Summer" -- you might have heard one of his stories featured on NPR.

The title of Chris' book is never explained in the video -- most likely because I did something during the interview to mess up the clip. The title refers to a park where Elvis Presley used to go to relax and pass around the football. This video was filmed in Hollywood, California -- very near the park where Elvis passed.

In this 2-minute video, Pat talks about her first book, Call Someplace Paradise, which is about that most quintessential of beach towns: Venice, California. Pat is the creator and maintainer of VirtualVenice.info, a web site that catalogs everything Venice, and she pours all that knowledge into this book.

			<description><![CDATA[I have known Gary Michael Smith for many years, and one of the things I've always admired about this teacher-author-actor-writer-publisher is that he seldom writes for free.

Gary Michael Smith gets paid for most articles he writes -- even when he's writing about his cats! In Writing for Magazines and Trade Journals, Smith shows you how to get paid, too.

As a writing instructor at the University of New Orleans, Smith has coached hundreds of students in writing and publishing for pay. One of those students made a small fortune selling her first article -- find out just how much in this crisp 2-minute video.

			<title>Lawrence Wright</title>
			<itunes:author>AuthorViews</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Todays video is for a book so new, not even Amazon has it yet. Lawrence Wright is a screenwriter (The Siege) and a columnist for The New Yorker. The Looming Tower, a book about the Saudi bin Laden family and the history of the Al Qaeda movement, is sure to cause a stir this fall when it is released for the five year anniversary of September 11, 2001.

This interview was recorded in Austin, Texas, on the AuthorViews 2005 summer tour. We were lucky to catch Larry Wright in town; he has made dozens of trips to the middle east over the last five years doing research for this book. When we interviewed him, he was still assembling and fact-checking the final manuscript.

Of the books title, Wright says it refers to a verse from the Koran that Bin Laden used often: Death will find you even in the looming tower. The verse was also found on the computer of one of the members of the Al Qaeda cell in Hamburg and it appears to be a code used by the 9-11 hijackers.]]></description>
			<itunes:subtitle>The Looming Tower</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:summary>Todays video is for a book so new, not even Amazon has it yet. Lawrence Wright is a screenwriter (The Siege) and a columnist for The New Yorker. The Looming Tower, a book about the Saudi bin Laden family and the history of the Al Qaeda movement, is sure to cause a stir this fall when it is released for the five year anniversary of September 11, 2001.

This interview was recorded in Austin, Texas, on the AuthorViews 2005 summer tour. We were lucky to catch Larry Wright in town; he has made dozens of trips to the middle east over the last five years doing research for this book. When we interviewed him, he was still assembling and fact-checking the final manuscript.

Of the books title, Wright says it refers to a verse from the Koran that Bin Laden used often: Death will find you even in the looming tower. The verse was also found on the computer of one of the members of the Al Qaeda cell in Hamburg and it appears to be a code used by the 9-11 hijackers.</itunes:summary>

			<description><![CDATA[While we have promised new video every day, I am going to take a pause from our releasing schedule and show an older video to honor my former boss, Michael Hoy, proprietor of Loompanics Unlimited, publisher and seller of the worlds most controversial and unusual books.

Mike was the guest of honor at the 2004 New Orleans Bookfair where we made todays AuthorViews video. In the video, he says Ive been doing this for approximately thirty years and, the good lord willing, Ill be doing it for another thirty. Apparently, the good lord has other plans; Loompanics announced this week they are going out of business.

I spoke with Hoy two days ago and Im happy to report that its not ill health or some lawsuit that is responsible for closing Loompanics; rather, it is fatigue with slowly declining sales. Most books in Loompanics legendary catalog -- which Hoy proudly displays during his AuthorViews video -- can not be found in even the largest bookstore; now, however, theyre available online from stores such as Amazon.com that sell virtually every book.

Loompanics will be greatly missed as the problem child of American publishing -- a living symbol of freedom of the press. You will find many places that sell unusual books but almost no one anymore with the courage to publish them: books that every government wants destroyed and most parents wants prohibited. (See yesterdays blog entry for some of my favorite Loompanics titles.) In the coalmine of book publishing our canary just croaked. Book publishing will be so much more boring without Loompanics.]]></description>

Ingerman has a degree in biology and has harbored a lifelong concern for the environment. Medicine for the Earth is based on many years of cross-cultural explorations into the science of transmutation -- in particular, religious practices involving neutralizing poisons or cleaning the energy in a house or community.

Patron Saint Productions is doing a campaign for Medicine for the Earth, and so we have the benefit of an excerpt along with Sandys 2-minute video. Well be doing a campaign this spring for Sandys book, Soul Retrieval, which has achieved near cult status among spiritualists.]]></description>

Jon and I recorded for an hour and a half; the video here is 2-minutes. We left out most of what we talked about, including the origins of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Wired, HotWired, Mondo2000, bOING bOING, FringeWare, Salon, The WELL, and the battle to bring free WiFi to Austin.

What remains is Extreme Democracy, a new collection of essays on how technology is changing the way politics is played. The video is long enough for a brief reflection on how the Howard Dean campaign used the net -- thats the origin of this book. The destination? The Internet has become the volunteer coordinater and cash machine fueling modern political campaigns.

Will we soon have Internet voting? The Mayor of New Orleans proposed to make this city the first to hold Internet elections, but the state government shot that down. Internet voting is coming, and Extreme Democracy is a timely look at what form it will likely take. Youll also find Jon Lebkowsky hanging out at his own blog, Weblogsky, or the consulting firm he runs, Polycot.]]></description>

He also operates Chatgris Press, a book publisher with a dozen titles in print.

Theres a video for that book here on AuthorViews that was shot way back in 2003 (but is now iPod ready).

Movie Extra 101: Your Shortcut to Stardom resulted from the booming motion picture business here in New Orleans. Prior to Katrina, tax incentives brought big and small movie productions to town, and Gary got small parts in several films.

Josh Peter has his old beat back now, but its different. Will New Orleans professional football team, The Saints, come back home? Will they play in the now-infamous Louisiana Superdome? Will the professional basketball franchise, The Hornets, be sold? What will happen to all the displaced high school and college athletes? So many questions in the wake of the storm.

Joshs video is for the book with the longest title in our archives: Fried Twinkies, Buckle Bunnies  Bull Riders: A Year Inside the Professional Bull Riders Tour. In our 2-minute video, Josh goes behind the chutes to get the inside story on an emerging sport. It captures this award-winning sportswriter at a time of innocence, what we call Pre-K down here.]]></description>

The author is Tripp Friedler, a restless entrepreneur who gets paid to help people find an intelligent path to their dream life. His company -- and his book -- is called Free Gulliver. Its one of my favorite videos because he doesnt say one good thing about his book and when hes done you want to buy it.

We made this video at the Bywater Tech Center in New Orleans last June. Weve also got a nice excerpt from Free Gulliver about retirement -- or the lack thereof. Tripp is all about making your work something you love and would never want to retire from.

Tripps 2-minute video has been on the site for awhile, but is released today with a new edit and formatted for download into iTunes: just right-click to download, drag it into iTunes, drop it on your iPod, and share it with an impoverished dreamer you love.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Branching across every genre, from mystery and romance to flash fiction and prose poetry, this anthology features the best works by living writers on the heart of New Orleans, with one previously unpublished by Tennessee Williams. Features Ellen Gilchrist, Richard Ford, Robert Olen Butler, Andrei Codrescu, Barry Gifford, Poppy Z. Brite, Julie Smith, John Biguenet, Nancy Lemann, and Valerie Martin, among others. The characters in these works find themselves everywhere from Sarajevo on the eve of the First World War to Algiers Point just across the Mississippi River, but their stories are all anchored in the French Quarter. They wander from the 18th-century New World to a rooftop view of Bourbon Street on the cusp of the third millennium. Interspersed with the history of the city, these stories penetrate the standard cliches and reflect the true sense of the French Quarter-its sensuality, mystery, the life behind its walls-and lift the veils of privacy altogether. Whether surrealism or satire, these exceptional stories are beautiful, poignant, tragic, and comic.]]></description>
