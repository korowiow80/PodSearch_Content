Telomere Length Predicts Coronary Heart Disease Risk and Statin Response
REFERENCE: Lancet 2007; 369:107
NILESH SAMANI, Glenfield Hospital, Leicester

A new genetic test could help predict which individuals will develop coronary heart disease among those with similar conventional risk factors. The length of the terminating structures of chromosomes, telomeres, can be used to predict cardiovascular mortality in middle-aged men, according to a study from Leicester in the UK which analysed blood samples collected for the West of Scotland Primary Prevention Study, (WOSCOPS). Nilesh Samani gave Helen Morant the details.</description>

Miscarriage Risk in Women with Low Body Mass Index 
REFERENCE: BJOG 2007 114:170
PAT DOYLE, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine

Underweight women were found to be at increased risk of miscarriage, according to a study published in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.  A team from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine conducted a survey by questionnaire of 6 000 women among whom 600 had a first trimester miscarriage.  Using a “case-control” method of comparison it emerged that women with a body mass index below 18.5 had a 70 per cent increase in their risk of miscarriage.  Peter Goodwin heard more about the study from Pat Doyle of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  </description>

Gene defects and mutations could be markers for early onset obesity. This is according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine which concludes that the leptin receptor should be further explored as a cause of obesity, along with other genetic factors emerging from a multinational study called: the Genetics of Obesity Study. Sarah Maxwell heard the latest from Sadaf Farooqi in Cambridge, England.</description>

Aggressive Statin Therapy: Better than Endarterectomy for Patients with Carotid Stenosis?
REFERENCE: Abstract No. 17
HENRIK SILLESEN, University of Copenhagen

Patients with carotid artery stenosis run much lower risks of further events if treated aggressively with a statin, according to a study reported at the International Stroke Conference in San Francisco by Henrik Sillesen. Of 1,000 patients in the Stroke Prevention By Aggressive Reduction of Choleseterol Levels (SPARCL) study with documented carotid stenosis, those who received high-dose atorvastatin had a reduced need for endarterectomy in the follow up period. The aggressive statin treatment was as effective as endarterectomy at preventing future strokes. Helen Morant talked to Henrik Sillesen about the promise of this medical approach to treating such high-risk patients.</description>

MRI scanning could make it possible to treat stroke patients safely and effectively with thrombolytics such as tPA beyond the recommended 3 hour window. The International Stroke Conference heard analysis of pooled data from five European Stroke Centers that compared CT and treatment within 3 hours with the use of MRI  plus treatment either within 3 hours or longer than this. After his presentation in San Francisco Peter Schellinger explained the study to Helen Morant.</description>

Stroke patients may be going through pointless tests, according to a poster presented by researchers at the Trillium Health Centre in Ottawa. The Stroke clinic there looked at whether routinely ordered tests, trans thoracic echo and 24 hour rhythm monitoring, actually changed patients&apos; treatment, and found that generally, the results of these tests didn’t change a thing.

The Stroke clinic there looked at whether routinely ordered tests, trans thoracic echo and 24 hour rhythm monitoring, actually changed patients&apos; treatment, and found that generally, the results of these tests didn’t change a thing. Helen Morant talked to Nicole Pageau about their findings. </itunes:summary>

The Wingspan Stent: Safe Intra-Cranial Angioplasty?

FELIPE ALBUQUERQUE, Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix

The Wingspan stent is a new approach to keeping open the atherosclerotic intracranial vessels of stroke and TIA patients. Early results presented to the San Francisco Conference suggest that it doesn’t harm patients, but that it seemed to block fairly quickly, Felipe Albuquerque talked to   Helen Morant about these much anticipated results.</description>

Thrombectomy For Acute Stroke: Results of the Multi MERCI Trial
REFERENCE: Abstract No. LB5
WADE SMITH, University of California, San Francisco

Mechanical removal of the clot that’s causing an acute stroke is showing promising early signs, and is safe. The first of a new generation of the MERCI (Mechanical Embolus Removal in Cerebral Ischemia) devices for removing clots has compared favorably to its predecessors and can also be used in patients for whom the standard therapy, thrombolysis, has failed. Wade Smith on behalf of the MERCI investigators talked to Helen Morant about the results.

GIST Trial: Treating Glucose Levels Acutely Doesn’t Help Survival, but Does Cause Hypotension
REFERENCE: Abstract No. LB2
CHRISTOPHER GRAY, University of Newcastle

Treating high blood sugar in the acute phases of stroke doesn’t reduce risk of death or severe disability, the GIST – UK (Glucose Insulin in Stroke Trial) has found. This is despite other trials reporting that high glucose levels are associated with increase risk of stroke. Investigators also found that treating glucose levels aggressively also lowered blood pressure. To discuss this surprise result, and the background to the trial, Helen Morant talked to Chris Gray.</description>

PHILIPPE MAYAUD, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine

In patients who are infected with both HIV and herpes simplex type 2 the activity of the AIDS virus may be diminished by therapy with one of the established anti-herpes drugs, according to the findings of a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine by authors in France, England and Burkina Faso. Philippe Mayaud talked about his results with Peter Goodwin in which HIV concentrations in the blood and vagina of patients co-infected with both herpes and HIV were found to be reduced by continuous treatment with the anti-herpes agent valacyclovir.</description>

Daily administration of an analog of growth hormone releasing factor to HIV patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy significantly decreased visceral fat and improved their lipid profiles. This development-stage drug, TH9507, was well tolerated and may help patients reduce central fat accumulation and abnormal lipid profiles,  both of which are know cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, decreases in central fat may have a positive effect on patients&apos; self-image.

Entecavir Shows Activity Against HIV But Also Selects for an Antiretroviral Drug Resistance Mutation
REFERENCE: Abstract: 136LB, 14th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Los Angeles February 25-29, 2007
CHLOE THIO, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine

Entecavir, used to treat hepatitis B virus infections, can lower levels of HIV in co-infected patients but also selects for a mutation that makes HIV resistant to entecavir as well as the antiretroviral drugs lamivudine and emtracitabine. These findings, derived from three case reports and associated laboratory studies, have important implications for the treatment of HBV in HIV-infected patients. Current guidelines, issued in October 2006 and which recommend entecavir as a first-line treatment of HBV in co-infected individuals who do not require anti-HIV therapy, need to be reconsidered. Chloe Thio discussed her study results and their implications with Dan Keller at the 14th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Los Angeles. </description>

Raltegravir doubled the antiviral response rate and the increase in CD4 cells among treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients who were resistant to at least one drug in each of the nucleoside, non-nucleoside, and protease inhibitor classes. Two placebo controlled trials (BENCHMRK-1 and BENCHMRK-2) randomized a total of almost 700 subjects to either raltegravir 400 mg twice daily or to placebo, each on a background of optimized antiviral background therapy. Raltegravir is an integrase inhibitor and acts to block the enzyme that allows HIV’s nuclei acid to integrate into the DNA of host cells.</description>

In a population of treatment-experienced HIV-infected subjects, maraviroc plus optimised background antiretroviral therapy provided significantly superior virologic control and increases in CD4 cell counts compared with placebo plus optimized background therapy. There were no clinically relevant differences in the safety profiles between the maraviroc and the placebo treatment groups. These drugs do not attack the virus itself but rather block host cells’ CCR5 cell surface cytokine receptors that HIV interacts with to gain entry into the cell.</description>

In the developing world breastfeeding is the recommended infant feeding method, even for women infected with HIV. While early cessation of breastfeeding reduces HIV transmission to the baby, studies have shown that it increases morbidity and mortality in the infants. Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life appears to reduce HIV transmission, as opposed to “mixed” breastfeeding with supplementation with formula or solid foods.

JEFFREY ANDERSON, University of Utah, Salt Lake City
COMMENT: DOUGLAS ZIPES, University of Indiana, Indianapolis

The hope of refining treatments for cardiovascular disease by genotyping patients to detect individual sensitivities to particular medical therapies was brought a step closer at the ACC meeting in New Orleans by results from a study using a rapid genothype test.  Jeffrey Anderson told Peter Goodwin about the assay they&apos;ve been investigating which indicates required dosing of warfarin.</description>

Two big studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented simultaneously at the American College of Cardiology meeting in New Orleans have shown that two emerging therapies aimed at reducing risks in patients with coronary disease have failed to do so. The president of the ACC, Steven Nissen, talked with Peter Goodwin about the COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation) trial, in which patients with stable coronary artery disease were randomized to receive optimal medical therapy with or without PCI. He also discussed findings of the ILLUSTRATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management Using Coronary Ultrasound to Assess Reduction of Atherosclerosis by CETP Inhibition and HDL Elevation) study in which the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor, torcetrapib was found to have adverse effects when used for modifying lipid profiles among coronary patients.</description>

A combination of two antihypertensive agents has given improved blood pressure control in a study with nearly 2000 patients reported to the ACC meeting in New Orleans by a group from the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Suzanne Oparil presented findings on the use of the direct rennin inhibitor, aliskiren, combined with the angiotensin receptor blocker, valsartan. She explained to Peter Goodwin how this “dual renin system blockade” gave enhanced blood pressure lowering in patients with mild to moderate hypertension who were followed with ambulatory monitoring.</description>

DAVID MOORE, Imperial College, London and Lima

A new test for TB, trialled in Peru, has proved more powerful and yet faster and cheaper than alternatives, making it especially suitable for use in resource-limited settings where tuberculosis is becoming more rampant, partly through the world-wide advance of HIV.  David Moore and his colleagues have published results in the New England Journal of Medicine of a massive investigation conducted in Lima with nearly 4 000 samples of the sputum test called: Microscopic-Observation Drug-Susceptibility (MODS) Assay.  Their findings promise not only to improve diagnosis and save lives in developing countries and other settings with limited health-care resources, but also out-perform costly gold-standard technology-intensive TB diagnosis methods currently used where cash is not a problem.  The MODS test, David Moore told Peter Goodwin during a visit to Peru, gives sensitive and specific diagnosis in as little as seven days, and concurrently yields drug susceptibility data which helps combat multi-drug resistant TB.</description>

Patient Power Best to Manage Diabetes
REFERENCE: ABSTRACT Press Release, San Diego ACP 2007
HILARY SELIGMAN, University of California, San Francisco

Doctors can best help their patients with diabetes by taking particular care to put management into the hands of the patients themselves, rather than asking them to slavishly follow the doctors&apos; instructions, conference-goers in San Diego heard. A new ACP guide booklet for diabetes management called &quot;Living with Diabetes&quot;, designed to be used by patients in consultation with their doctors, has made concrete improvements in diabetic management, according to results from a study released during the American College of Physicians annual meeting.  Peter Goodwin talked with one of the authors of the new initiative, Hilary Seligman.</description>

Drug Eluting Stents, PFO Closure: Indications Not Obvious
REFERENCE: ABSTRACT ACP Internal Medicine 2007, ERA 002
MARK REISMAN, Swedish Medical Center, Seattle

Drug eluting stents may not always be the automatic choice over the bare metal variety for patients requiring intervention, despite the important clinical advantages that have been emerging from their introduction recently. This is according to Mark Reisman who gave the Internal Medicine 2007 conference in San Diego his latest insights from the rapidly changing world of interventional cardiology. At this (recently renamed) annual meeting of the American College of Physicians he also discussed the difficult question of which patients are candidates for PFO closure, and what the clinical objectives of this might be: including the possible reduction of migraine headaches.  After his session he talked with Peter Goodwin.</description>

Can Road-Side Tranexamic Acid Therapy Reduce Mortality and Blood Transfusions after Trauma? The CRASH Trial.

JAIME MIRANDA, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Lima 

An antifibrinolytic agent, tranexamic acid (commonly used to reduce bleeding during surgery) is being investigated as first-aid to cut mortality and the need for blood transfusion immediately after trauma or injury. The CRASH trial, still in its early phases in a worldwide adult population, aims to bring particular benefit to developing countries, many of which are blighted by trauma with few measures, if any, having been available up to now to reduce the death toll. In Lima, Peru, Jaime Miranda discussed his group&apos;s ongoing investigation with Peter Goodwin.</description>

Enoxaparin could be the new standard anti-thrombotic therapy for patients receiving fibrinolysis for ST elevation myocardial infarction. This finding is from the double-blind EXTRACT-TIMI 25 Trial which compared the low molecular weight heparin with unfractionated heparin and saw a consistent treatment superiority from enoxaparin with a reduction in repeat myocardial infarction and mortality.

Is there any hope for an HIV vaccine? According to Anthony Fauci, of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, there is – but it might not be a perfect vaccine. He believes that even a vaccine that does not confer total immunity could still be of use, because it may slow disease progression and also reduce the spread of the disease. He talked with Derek Thorne about his co-authored paper in the New England Journal of Medicine.</description>

A new study suggests that current guidelines for the treatment of severe pneumonia in children under one year should change. The investigation, which took place in South Africa, found that HIV status and polymicrobial disease were among the predictors for treatment failure, and these findings have implications for the guidelines drawn up by the WHO.

1. Eggs From Young Patients Before Chemotherapy: New Hope for Future Fertility
REFERENCE: ABSTRACT O-107
Ariel Revel, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem

Harvesting eggs from young girls before they undergo aggressive chemotherapy can now be done to give the hope of pregnancy in the future, according to fertility experts from Jerusalem reporting to the European conference on fertility being held in Lyon. The investigators have obtained oocytes from girls as young as five years. Lead author Ariel Revel talked about his group&apos;s findings with Sarah Maxwell.

2. First Baby Born From Thawed, Frozen, In-Vitro Matured Oocytes
REFERENCE: ABSTRACT Oral 018
Hananel Holzer, McGill University, Montreal

The results of a study that has produced the first live birth by maturing oocytes in vitro which have been collected from unstimulated ovaries, freezing them, and subsequently thawing them for fertilization were presented to the ESHRE meeting in Lyon. This is the first time oocytes collected without hormonal stimulation have resulted in pregnancies. For some women potentially facing sterility, such as those with breast cancer who do not have time for hormonal stimulation, this technique provides the hope of pregnancy which could otherwise be denied. Sarah Maxwell interviewed Hananel Holzer about the findings. 

3. Ovarian Stimulation: Menotrophin Gives More Live Births than Follicle-Stimulating Hormone for Assisted Reproduction
REFERENCE: ABSTRACT Oral 098
Masoud Afnan, Birmingham Women&apos;s Hospital

Of two types of gonadotrophins currently used for ovarian stimulation in assisted reproduction one has now clearly demonstrated superiority in a meta-analysis presenteted to the fertility conference in Lyon.  Human menotrophin (hGH) gave more live births than recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (rFSH) whether reproduction was by in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Peter Goodwin talked with Masoud Afnan from Birmingham after his presentation of the study which he co-authored with Madelon van Wely and Julko van der Veen.

4. Single Embryo Transfer Recommended For Most Patients Receiving Donated Oocytes
REFERENCE: ABSTRACT O-007
Viveca Söderström-Anttila, Väestoliitto Fertility Clinics, Helsinki

When oocytes are donated to achieve a pregnancy, single embryo transfer should generally be recommended over double transfer, according to the findings of a study from Helsinki.  Sarah Maxwell discussed the data with Viveka Söderström.</description>

Intensive Care: Prophylactic Steroids Prevent Postextubation Laryngeal Oedema
REFERENCE: Lancet 2007;369:1083-89 Editorial page 1061
RUPERT PEARSE, Barts and The London School of Medicine

A big step forwards in the management of patients in the emergency room who need artificial ventilation has been reported in the Lancet.  An effective way to prevent postextubation laryngeal oedema has been reported. A study carried out by Bruno François of the Dupuytren Teaching Hospital in Limoges at 15 intensive-care units of the Association des Réanimateurs du Centre-Ouest, has found that giving patients prednisolone therapy 24hrs before a planned extubation can substantially reduce the incidence of laryngeal oedema and the need for reintubation. Karen Regester spoke to Rupert Pearse who wrote the commentary on the article in the Lancet.</description>

Shorter Anti-Viral Treatment for Hepatitis C: Less Effective Than Standard Regimen

MITCHELL SHIFFMAN, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond

Standard anti-viral therapy for Hepatitis C needs to be used to the full duration according to a publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. Following provocative evidence from previous smaller studies, suggesting that anti viral therapy can be shortened, the ACCELERATE trial (the largest international study with genotypes 2 and 3) was set up to resolve whether shortening the duration of therapy for patients would give the same virologic response rates as with the standard regimen. It found that full-dose, full-duration therapy with interferon and ribavirin needs to be adhered to. Nicola Solomon interviewed Mitchell Shiffman to find out more. </description>

Non-adherence is a big factor reducing the efficacy of tuberculosis treatment according to a review of research released by the Public Library of Science&apos;s online medical journal, PLoS Medicine. The article suggests that more needs to be done to resolve barriers to therapy compliance in order to help reduce the global burden of tuberculosis.

The same birth rates following in-vitro fertilisation can be achieved with single embryo transfer as with double transfer, according to the findings of a study from Sweden. A retrospective investigation looked at whether multiple births, and other risk factors associated with double embryo transfer, can be avoided when single transfer is used whilst still achieving the same live delivery rates.

1. Blood Pressure Drugs Reduce Mortality in Patients with Diabetes: The ADVANCE Study
REFERENCE: Abstract 312 Hot Line 1 Sunday
STEPHEN MACMAHON, The George Institute, University of Sydney
COMMENT: RAYMOND GIBBONS, Mayo Clinic, Rochester MN 

The randomised placebo controlled ADVANCE study of 11000 patients with diabetes has demonstrated that a combination of the ACE  inhibitor, perindopril, with the diuretic indapamide can lower blood pressure and mortality. The investigators saw an impact even in patients who did not have high blood pressure. Lead study author Stephen MacMahon said this approach should be included in current practise guidelines. Sarah Maxwell spoke with him at the meeting in Vienna.
Commented on Stephen McMahon&apos;s presentation of the ADVANCE study looking at the use of perindopril plus indapamide among patients with diabetes:  a study with 11 000 patients divided between active and placebo in which a 14 per cent improvement in all-cause mortality, an 18 per cent reduction of cardiovascular deaths, was achieved together with reductions of the incidence of both renal and coronary disease.

2. Lifestyle and Heart Disease in Europe: A Growing Problem
REFERENCE: Abstract 316
DAVID WOOD, Charing Cross Hospital, London

Among 8000 coronary patients in 9 European countries, smoking prevalence hasn’t changed over the last 12 years, and obesity is going up – that’s according to the combined EUROASPIRE surveys, which were presented at the ESC congress. Derek Thorne got more from David Wood, of Charing Cross Hospital in London.

3. Drug Eluting Stents, Bare Metal Stents: No Survival Difference
REFERENCE: Hot Line 1 Sunday 11:00 2 Sept/ESC Congress 2007 Vienna 1-5 September 
STEFAN JAMES, Uppsala Clinical Research Centre, Sweden
COMMENT: RAYMOND GIBBONS, Mayo Clinic, Rochester MN

Another year’s results of the long term outcome of using drug-eluting stents as compared with bare-metal stents from Sweden reveal that there is no longer an increased risk of late mortality when using drug-eluting stents according to Stefan James of Uppsala Clinical Research Centre. He suggested that improvements in technique have helped reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction associated with using drug-eluting stents nevertheless the risk of blood clots still remains. Overall survival of patients was found to be the similar for both categories of stent. </description>

1. Chronic Stable Angina: Should ESC Guidelines on Clopidogrel as Pre-Treatment to Planned Coronary Angiography be Changed?
PETR WIDIMSKY, Charles University, Prague
COMMENT: ECKART FLECK, Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin
REFERENCE: Hot Line II Monday 3rd Sept

The ESC guideline suggesting all patients with chronic stable angina having coronary angiography should have clopidogrel pre-treatment is now being questioned following findings of the PRAGUE-8 Study, which randomized patients to receive the anti-platelet agent either non selectively before angiography, or selectively after angiography in those considered to need PCI. The PRAGUE investigators concluded that the ESC guideline was unjustified for the treatment of elective angiography in chronic stable angina, and that the previous practice of selective administration of clopidogrel should be resumed.  Nicola Solomon talked with Petr Widimsky at the ESC Congress in Vienna. Derek Thorne heard comments on the findings from Eckart Fleck.

2. Enoxaparin Superior to Unfractionated Heparin for STEMI at 12 months Follow Up: ExTRACT-TIMI 25 Trial
DAVID MORROW, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston
REFERENCE: 1027, Clinical Trial Update I

Further data to support the use of enoxaparin has come out of the latest update from the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 study. It shows at 12 months follow up, that the benefits of enoxaparin are durable and still superior to unfractionated heparin for patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing fibrinolytic therapy. Sarah Maxwell interviewed David Morrow at the Vienna meeting.

1. Drug Eluting Stents: Higher Late Mortality in STEMI Patients Than Bare Metal: GRACE Registry Findings
GABRIEL STEG, Hôpital Bichat, Paris
COMMENT: FREEK VERHEUGT, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen
REFERENCE: Hotline III, number 709

The GRACE registry looking at over 60 000 patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction has shown that patients live longer if they receive bare metal stents than if they get drug eluting stents. Gabriel Steg presented these latest data at the ESC meeting in Vienna. Sarah Maxwell discussed the findings with him.

2. Looking for Atherosclerosis in the Legs Could Save Lives
CURT DIEHM, University of Heidelberg
COMMENT: FREEK VERHEUGT, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) can be diagnosed easily by a test using the ankle brachial index (ABI) and its presence can indicate a high risk of myocardial infarction. Curt Diehm explained his findings to Derek Thorne, while Peter Goodwin got expert comment from Freek Verheugt.

2. Heart Attacks Drop After Smoking Ban in Ireland
EDMOND CRONIN, Cork University Hospital
REFERENCE: Abstract 3506, European Society of Cardiology Congress, 2007, 1-5 September, Vienna, Austria


Study data that support banning smoking in public places were unveiled at the ESC congress by a team from Ireland. After the smoking ban in 2004, admissions for acute coronary syndromes dropped, and lead author Edmond Cronin explained the significance of his findings to Derek Thorne.</description>

1. Better Criteria For Cardiac Resynchronisation Needed in Heart Failure: PROSPECT Trial Results
STEFANO GHIO, San Matteo University Hospital, Italy
COMMENT: CECILIA LINDE, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm
REFERENCE: Hotline III, 3222 page 315

The standard echocardiographic criteria for selecting patients to receive cardiac resynchronisation are not adequate according to Stefano Ghio. During the ESC Congress in Vienna he presented results from the PROSPECT trial and afterwards he talked with Sarah Maxwell. Cecilia Linde gave Nicola Solomon her comments on the findings.

2. Selective Invasive Treatment Best for Women with Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes
EVA SWAHN, University Hospital Linköping, Sweden
COMMENT: ECKART FLECK, Deutsches Herzzentrum, Berlin
REFERENCE: HOTLINE II, Monday 8am

Women who undergo selective invasive treatment for non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes do better than those who receive routine early invasive treatment. This is according to the OASIS 5 study from Sweden that randomised women to either of the two approaches. The findings suggest that females with non-ST elevation ACS should be approached differently from their male counterparts. Sarah Maxwell interviewed OASIS investigator Eva Swahn at the ESC meeting in Vienna. Eckart Fleck of the Deutsches Herzzentrum in Berlin gave his comments on her comments to Derek Thorne.

3Patients with High Restenosis Risk Benefit More from Drug Eluting Stents
RAUL MORENO, University Hospital La Paz, Madrid
REFERENCE: Abstract 3103

Results from a large meta analysis suggest that drug eluting stents have a greater benefit when the risk of restenosis increases. This could affect the “off label” use of these stents. Raul Moreno, of the University Hospital La Paz, Madrid, discussed his findings with Derek Thorne.

Which HIV Treatment is Best for Patients with HIV and Hepatitis C?
JUAN BERENGUER, Hospital Gregorio Marañón, Madrid
REFERENCE: Abstract V-1385/ICAAC Congress 2007 Chicago 16-20 September

A retrospective study has thrown doubt on the theory that protease inhibitors (PIs) are a preferable antiretroviral treatment for patients co-infected with HIV and Hepatitis C virus. Previous research had suggested that PIs had a more beneficial effect on liver fibrosis than NNRTIs, but a study based at the Hospital Gregorio Marañón in Madrid has found the opposite. Derek Thorne discussed the data with Juan Berenguer.</description>

Stable Angina: Add PCI To Medical Therapy If Guided by SPECT-Detected Ischemia? COURAGE Nuclear Sub-Study Results
LESLEE SHAW, Emory University, Atlanta
COMMENT: DANIEL JONES, AHA President, University of Mississippi, Jackson
REFERENCE: Late Breaking Clinical Trials, Session 1

Some patients with stable angina may be best treated by adding percutaneous intervention to optimal medical therapy.  This is the finding of a "nuclear sub-study" of the COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Using Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation) trial. Although the study found no benefit of adding angioplasty in most patients, the AHA conference heard from Leslee Shaw that if myocardial ischemia is monitored using Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), there could be a role for angioplasty in a subgroup of patients. Peter Goodwin talked with Dr Shaw after her presentation and then asked the American Heart Association President, Daniel Jones, for his assessment. ]]></description>

Torcetrapib in Patients at High Risk for Coronary Events: ILLUMINATE Trial Latest Results
PHILIP BARTER, Heart Research Institute, Sydney, Australia
COMMENT: GORDON TOMASELLI, Johns Hopkins University, Baltmimore
REFERENCE: Late Breaking Clinical Trials Session 2

A randomized double-blind study involving over 15,000 patients at high cardiovascular risk which looked at the new agent torcetrapib (an inhibitor of cholesteryl ester transfer protein, CETP) resulted in higher mortality in the experimental arm. The study compared torcetrapib plus atorvastatin with atorvatstin alone. Inhibition of CETP increases HDL levels and reduces LDL levels and should combat atherosclerosis. Sarah Maxwell spoke with Philip Barter who presented data on the ILLUMINATE trial at the American Heart Association meeting in Orlando.

Oral Contraceptive Use: More Carotid and Femoral Atheroschlerosis Later in Life
ERNST RIETZSCHEL, University of Ghent, Belgium
COMMENT: JENNIFER MIERES, New York University
REFERENCE: News Briefing

Women who used the contraceptive pill had increases in atherosclerotic plaque in their carotid and femoral arteries of between 20 and 30 percent by the time they reached late middle age.  This is the finding of the ASKLEPIOS study conducted by the University of Ghent in which plaque was measured by ultrasound in 2 500 healthy men and women.  Ernst Rietzschel presented data from the study to the 2007 Sessions of the AHA, and afterwards discussed the findings with Peter Goodwin.
