         <link>http://audiojourneys.podhoster.com/index.php?sid=933&amp;pid=9791</link>
         <description><![CDATA[Audio Journeys are exploring the ancient ruins of a Mayan village in El Salvador. Twenty kilometers northwest of San Salvador the capital of El Salvador is the 650 year old village of Joya de Ceren, the only UNESCO World Heritage Site in El Salvador.  What makes this site very unique is that the everyday life of the Mayans was preserved when around 600 A.D. a volcano erupted spewing volcanic ashes that covered the land, caused the common people to flee their homes.   We tour the site with an El Salvador archaeology assistant and speak with Dr. Payson Sheets one of the archaeologist studying the site since its rediscover in 1976.  Dr. Payson Sheets is primary archaeologist for the University of Colorado’s excavations at the site of Ceren in El Salvador.  You can find out more about visiting El Salvador at www.ElSalvador.travel . You can purchase this half-hour Audio Journey on CD at www.AudioJourneys.org 			]]></description>

         <title>New Lanark Village World Heritage Site Scotland</title>
         <link>http://audiojourneys.podhoster.com/index.php?sid=933&amp;pid=9512</link>
         <description><![CDATA[New Lanark a UNESCO World Heritage Site is the location of this Travel Radio International’s Audio Journey.  New Lanark is a beautifully restored 18th century cotton mill village nestled in the spectacular south Lanarkshire valley in southern Scotland, close to the Falls of Clyde and less than an hour from Edinburgh and Glasgow.  

Over 200 years ago the impressive sandstone cotton mills of New Lanark were built by an enterprising Scot, David Dale, in a dramatic gorge in Southern Scotland, close to the famous Falls of Clyde.  Raw cotton arrived from North America by ship.  The cotton was spun in New Lanark using hydro-power.  Soon the village became known all over the world under the enlightened management of Dale’s son-in-law, the social pioneer, Robert Owen.  

Today visitors can come for the day or stay in the historic hotel that was once a mill. Richard Evans is our guide. Photo is an historic print from the New Lanark Website.

Today competition with human activities threatens some of the world's last remaining turtles. The Center for the Study of Conservation, a department of Guatemala's University system is in Monterrico to protect the turtles and surrounding mangrove forests. We meet Sid Eschenbach, president of Green Wave Hotel Association, owner of a beach front lodging and champion for the turtles. We walk through a neighborhood of local residents next to the biotope.

It was built by Russian fur trappers who were there for the sea otter pelts that were made into hats and clothing, mostly for China.

         <link>http://audiojourneys.podhoster.com/index.php?sid=933&amp;pid=7044</link>
         <description><![CDATA[About Ak' Tenamit 
Ak' Tenamit means “New Village” in the Q’eqchi Mayan language, because our organization is transforming life in the Q’eqchi villages of eastern Guatemala. Those villages are located around the Río Dulce, far from the nearest road – most are reached by a boat trips and hikes through the rain forest – and they lack electricity, running water and basic sanitation. When Ak’ Tenamit was founded in 1992 by a small group of foreign volunteers and village leaders, most of the communities it serves lacked access to medical care and had only rudimentary schools, if any. Few students studied to the sixth grade, and most girls dropped out by third, or fourth grade. Illiteracy rates were 70%--80%, and malnutrition, parasites, and various curable diseases were common.

Ak’ Tenamit consequently began improving village schools, providing teacher training, and coordinating donations of school supplies. The local people built a riverside clinic while foreign medical volunteers began visiting villages and training health promoters, while others taught groups of women to make paper from cornhusks and other waste. Since then, those initiatives have evolved to include preventative medicine programs, promotion of education for girls, a floating dental clinic, a secondary school that offers practical training in sustainable tourism and development, a network of cooperatives that produces and markets an array of handcrafts, and specific programs promoting gender equality, environmental protection and preservation of Q’eqchi culture.

         <title>Lighthouse at Point Arena California</title>
         <link>http://audiojourneys.podhoster.com/index.php?sid=933&amp;pid=5289</link>
         <description><![CDATA[On a scenic road trip through Northern California, we stop to explore the little City of Point Arena.  The 1870 Point Arena Lighthouse Station is a good place to find out about early California history while observing nature.

The Point Arena Lighthouse Station was built in 1870.  The current lighthouse was built in 1908, to replace the 1870 lighthouse that was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake. Daily guided tours with knowledgeable docents take visitors to the top of the 115 foot tower.  We meet Point Arena Lighthouse docents and board members, Brian Riel, James Platt and Patrick Hobart. 


In 1822 Augustin Fresnel, a French Physicist, invented a theater lens that could project candle light a very long distance. They look like giant glass beehives, with a light at the center.  The Fresnel lenses were soon used for navigational aids in lighthouses around the world. The Historic Point Arena Lighthouse has one of the last remaining Fresnel lens in the world. James Platt tells us why the lighthouse was built here.


We are exploring the Historic Point Arena Lighthouse in Point Arena California. The Point Arena Lighthouse is celebrating its 100th birthday in 2008. We walk up the spiral staircase to the top of the lighthouse where we stand next to the beautiful 100 year old Fresnel lens.  Patrick Hobart tells us about the 1870 staircase we are about to ascend.
We arrive at the top of the Point Arena Lighthouse tower. Because of its amazing efficiency, a Fresnel lens could easily throw its light 20 or more miles to the horizon. This 100 year old lens has been replaced by a more modern, small plastic model that is attached outside the lighthouse.


Near the top of the lighthouse a door opens to the outside.  If you dare, you can lean out the tower, to see the view of the Pacific Ocean and the little plastic Fresnel light that now guides ships.  





We are exploring the 130 year old Point Arena Lighthouse Station in Point Arena California.  The Historic Fog House is another building open to visitors. Point Arena Lighthouse Keepers Board of Directors president, Jim Platt talks about this buildings significance.

In the Fog House we meet Rae Radtkey, Executive Director of the Point Arena Lighthouse keepers Association. Rae talks about the future of the 130 year old Point Arena Lighthouse Station.

You have been listening to another Travel Radio International Audio Journey.  We have been exploring the Point Arena Lighthouse Station in Point Arena California.

         <description><![CDATA[We are on a Four-Hundred-Years-of-History road trip across the Commonwealth of Virginia. 

We’re here in the Blue Ridge Mountains, southeast of Roanoke, Virginia.
 
Virginia’s Explore Park interprets what life was like 
for some people in the Seventeenth, Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries’ in western Virginia.  

Costumed historians 
tell visitors about life 
in each of the centuries.

In the early Seventeen-hundreds, 
the Blue Ridge Mountains of Western Virginia were settled by Germans, Scotch and Irish. 
These immigrants had cut all ties with Europe. 
Having nothing to lose 
these pioneers bravely began 
to settle the wilDERness.  

In the turbulent decade of the Seventeen-fifties,
to protect their families, livestock, and neighbors
the settlers in Augusta County, Virginia, 
built wooden stockades around their homes. 

Virginia’s Explore Park has reconstructed 
a Seventeen-fifty-seven frontier fort.   
Patricia Lawrence has arrived at the site with Deborah Pitts, Executive Director of Virginia’s Explore Park.  

We meet two historians in period costumes at the large wooden gate of the eighteenth-century frontier fort.

In the land that was to become the United States of America, 
the seventeenth century was a time of great change for indigenous people like the small populations of Totero’s

         <description><![CDATA[We are on a 400-Years-of-History, road trip across the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Thirty miles south-east of Roanoke, near Hardy Virginia, we stop to explore the Booker T. Washington National Monument.  The Booker T Washington National Monument is located on the tobacco plantation where Booker T Washington was born into slavery, on April 5, 1856.  From his very meager and miserable beginnings, Booker T Washington became one of the United States’ foremost African-American educators, and the founder of the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama.

We are exploring the Booker T Washington National Monument in the Commonwealth of Virginia.  Patricia Lawrence meets our guide, National Park Service Ranger Betsy Haynes, at the Visitors Center, overlooking the 207 acre Burroughs plantation.  We walk on the Plantation Trail to the reconstructed Slave Cabin, where Booker T Washington was born, and lived the first nine years of his life.

         <link>http://audiojourneys.podhoster.com/index.php?sid=933&amp;pid=3345</link>
         <description><![CDATA[We are on a 400 years of history road trip across Virginia.  On May 14, 1607 three merchant ships from England landed on the shores of the James River.  They were sponsored by the Virginia Company of London, whose investors hoped to make a profit from the resources of the New World, North America.  King James the first of England chartered the venture.

On the banks of the James River, near the original British colony, 17th century history is told at the Jamestown Settlement.  The Jamestown Settlement is a museum and an outdoor living history site of 17th Century Virginia.  Todd Johnson, the interpretive site manager, meets us at the visitors’ center.

         <link>http://audiojourneys.podhoster.com/index.php?sid=933&amp;pid=3346</link>
         <description><![CDATA[We are celebrating the 400th Anniversary of America. On our road trip across the Commonwealth of Virginia we explore Colonial Williamsburg.  

Colonial Williamsburg tells the story of America, in the years preceding and during the American Revolution.  More than 500 buildings have been preserved and replicated to re-create eighteenth century Williamsburg, the first capital of the colonies.  

We are exploring Virginia’s Historic Triangle, the three cities of Jamestown, Yorktown and Colonial Williamsburg.  Richard Josey is one of the interpreters at Colonial Williamsburg who helps to keep history alive with first person reenactments.

         <description><![CDATA[We are exploring Belgium.  We are at the Oostende sailing ship festival on the old freight docks of this once very busy seaport.
 In the seaport town of Oostende on the last weekend in May, one of the world’s largest sailing ship festivals is held.  

There are many ships to explore and much activity when we arrive on the docks of Oostende; announcers, marching bands and battle ship reenactments fill our senses.  The first person we meet is a musketeer and one of the Festival’s organizers.
