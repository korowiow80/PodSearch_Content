    <description>We love music even more than chocolate and we constantly research, listen to &amp; painstakingly collate what we consider to be the best music in the world. So we thought it would be a nice idea to put out a weekly radio show to spread the word about some of our musical discoveries and support the world of quality, underground music.

We also write a little blog as well giving people the heads up on new releases, artists and interesting projects with a few authorised downloads, saucy videos and interesting links.

      <title>Audio Texture Radio Show - May 25, 2012</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1595724/600x600_5182830.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jesse Futerman&lt;/b&gt; kicks off the show this week with his beat tribute to Yusef Lateef before one of modern funks finest, &lt;b&gt;Sugarman 3&lt;/b&gt;, get all new retro and show most of the others how it's done. &lt;b&gt;Heatsick&lt;/b&gt; then provided the raw, lo-fi Casio vibes which sound a whole lot better than most tunes produced in double expensive studios. The raw, vintage, electronic experiments of &lt;b&gt;Bruck Haack&lt;/b&gt; were then given a little twist from &lt;b&gt;Prince Language&lt;/b&gt; for good measure.

We've slept a bit on &lt;b&gt;The Internet&lt;/b&gt; but we were happy to pick up the album a couple of weeks ago as they're definitely one of the more interesting &lt;b&gt;Odd Future&lt;/b&gt; acts as '&lt;b&gt;Lincoln&lt;/b&gt;' ably demonstrates. Now we are happy to announce, after championing them since day one, that the &lt;b&gt;Mancini &amp;amp; The Creepers&lt;/b&gt; album has finally arrived and it's great, fresh, UK urban vocal business - well done &lt;b&gt;Jakarta&lt;/b&gt; records for making it happen. &lt;b&gt;XL&lt;/b&gt; records have dragged the one and only, &lt;b&gt;Bobby Womack&lt;/b&gt; back into the studio with the intent of doing a &quot;&lt;b&gt;Gil Scott&lt;/b&gt;&quot; on him. From what we've heard it hasn't all worked but '&lt;b&gt;The Bravest Man&lt;/b&gt;' is certainly sounding fine.

&lt;b&gt;Traxman&lt;/b&gt; then juked up the dance, Chicago style, with the mellowest track from his recent and good (by Chicago standards) album, out on &lt;b&gt;Planet Mu&lt;/b&gt;. Things then took a turn for the mellow with &lt;b&gt;Simon Scott&lt;/b&gt; and part of his tribute album to the flat and boring, Fens in East Anglia of all places. &lt;b&gt;Trapist&lt;/b&gt; kept things generally horizontal but with some nice percussive and abrupt wake up moments to keep you on your toes before &lt;b&gt;Fetsum&lt;/b&gt; kept the mellow vibes rolling, nice and steady style.

Now we're suckers for a good cover version and &lt;b&gt;Gabriele Poso&lt;/b&gt; has come up with a really fresh jazz take on the Dawn Penn classic '&lt;b&gt;You Don't Love Me&lt;/b&gt;'. &lt;b&gt;Atjazz &lt;/b&gt;then provided a super musical, souful house take on GP's&amp;nbsp; Cuban project before from out of hiding &lt;b&gt;Dobie&lt;/b&gt; comes through with a little taster of his great new EP for &lt;b&gt;Big Dada&lt;/b&gt;.

      <itunes:summary>Jesse Futerman kicks off the show this week with his beat tribute to Yusef Lateef before one of modern funks finest, Sugarman 3, get all new retro and show most of the others how it's done. Heatsick then provided the raw, lo-fi Casio vibes which sound a whole lot better than most tunes produced in double expensive studios. The raw, vintage, electronic experiments of Bruck Haack were then given a little twist from Prince Language for good measure.

We've slept a bit on The Internet but we were happy to pick up the album a couple of weeks ago as they're definitely one of the more interesting Odd Future acts as 'Lincoln' ably demonstrates. Now we are happy to announce, after championing them since day one, that the Mancini &amp;amp; The Creepers album has finally arrived and it's great, fresh, UK urban vocal business - well done Jakarta records for making it happen. XL records have dragged the one and only, Bobby Womack back into the studio with the intent of doing a &quot;Gil Scott&quot; on him. From what we've heard it hasn't all worked but 'The Bravest Man' is certainly sounding fine.

Traxman then juked up the dance, Chicago style, with the mellowest track from his recent and good (by Chicago standards) album, out on Planet Mu. Things then took a turn for the mellow with Simon Scott and part of his tribute album to the flat and boring, Fens in East Anglia of all places. Trapist kept things generally horizontal but with some nice percussive and abrupt wake up moments to keep you on your toes before Fetsum kept the mellow vibes rolling, nice and steady style.

Now we're suckers for a good cover version and Gabriele Poso has come up with a really fresh jazz take on the Dawn Penn classic 'You Don't Love Me'. Atjazz then provided a super musical, souful house take on GP's&amp;nbsp; Cuban project before from out of hiding Dobie comes through with a little taster of his great new EP for Big Dada.

      <title>Audio Texture Radio Show - May 18, 2012</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1595724/600x600_5182830.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the show is back on the road and on the regular with a great, generally soulful, selection this week - it should sound pretty good during what looks like the start of summer for large parts of the northern hemisphere. &lt;b&gt;Portformat&lt;/b&gt; kicked things off in fine style from his great album about to drop on &lt;b&gt;Tokyo Dawn&lt;/b&gt;. The album is full of great beats and production and with a dazzling array of guest vocalists, this boy just gets better and he was pretty good to start off with! The &lt;b&gt;Jazzanova&lt;/b&gt; live group album has just dropped and if you like the classic sounds of black America then it will be right up your street. Vintage soulful jazz was then the order of the day from the reissued &lt;b&gt;Solis Lacus&lt;/b&gt; album on &lt;b&gt;Heavenly Sweetness&lt;/b&gt; as &lt;b&gt;Favourite&lt;/b&gt; recordings also carry on their reissue series with another of the great &lt;b&gt;Ray Stephen Oche&lt;/b&gt; albums, out about now.

&lt;b&gt;Guido Mobius&lt;/b&gt; then weirded up the show a bit with '&lt;b&gt;All Evil Ways&lt;/b&gt;' from his interesting new album on &lt;b&gt;Karaoke Kalk&lt;/b&gt; before sonic adventurer &lt;b&gt;RYAT&lt;/b&gt; kept things off the beaten track from her forthcoming album on &lt;b&gt;Brainfeeder&lt;/b&gt;, a bit Bjorkish vocally but certainly none the worse for that and generally a great unique sound. &lt;b&gt;Slugabed&lt;/b&gt;'s album on &lt;b&gt;Ninja&lt;/b&gt; has finally dropped and we're particularly liking the cosmic soul vibes of '&lt;b&gt;Unicorn Suplex&lt;/b&gt;'. Best use of a blues sample award goes to the debut single from &lt;b&gt;The Allergies&lt;/b&gt; and their '&lt;b&gt;Big Star&lt;/b&gt;' tune on &lt;b&gt;Riddim Fruit&lt;/b&gt;, a really fine start to the recording project from mix king &lt;b&gt;DJ Moneyshot&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;Rackabeat&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;HornDogz&lt;/b&gt; then kept the funk flowing and enlisted the vocal talents of &lt;b&gt;Ty&lt;/b&gt; to make some of that classic sounding hip hop, nice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A little 4/4 section finished the show kicking off with a taster of the new &lt;b&gt;Fantastic Mr. Fox &lt;/b&gt;EP on &lt;b&gt;Black Acre&lt;/b&gt;, great leftfield house vibes. &lt;b&gt;Auntie Flo&lt;/b&gt; then carried on the deep house mission from one of our albums of the year, &lt;b&gt;Future Rhythm Machine&lt;/b&gt; - check it! &lt;b&gt;Pitchben&lt;/b&gt; then went super deep and soulful with surely one of the warmest tunes of the summer, the &lt;b&gt;Alexander Maier 1to11 &lt;/b&gt;remix of '&lt;b&gt;Unique&lt;/b&gt;' - lovely! &lt;b&gt;Enawadan&lt;/b&gt; then kept the soul vibes flowing before &lt;b&gt;Lone&lt;/b&gt; finished the show in fine style with '&lt;b&gt;Earths Lungs&lt;/b&gt;' from his excellent new album on &lt;b&gt;R&amp;amp;S.&lt;/b&gt;

      <itunes:summary>So the show is back on the road and on the regular with a great, generally soulful, selection this week - it should sound pretty good during what looks like the start of summer for large parts of the northern hemisphere. Portformat kicked things off in fine style from his great album about to drop on Tokyo Dawn. The album is full of great beats and production and with a dazzling array of guest vocalists, this boy just gets better and he was pretty good to start off with! The Jazzanova live group album has just dropped and if you like the classic sounds of black America then it will be right up your street. Vintage soulful jazz was then the order of the day from the reissued Solis Lacus album on Heavenly Sweetness as Favourite recordings also carry on their reissue series with another of the great Ray Stephen Oche albums, out about now.

Guido Mobius then weirded up the show a bit with 'All Evil Ways' from his interesting new album on Karaoke Kalk before sonic adventurer RYAT kept things off the beaten track from her forthcoming album on Brainfeeder, a bit Bjorkish vocally but certainly none the worse for that and generally a great unique sound. Slugabed's album on Ninja has finally dropped and we're particularly liking the cosmic soul vibes of 'Unicorn Suplex'. Best use of a blues sample award goes to the debut single from The Allergies and their 'Big Star' tune on Riddim Fruit, a really fine start to the recording project from mix king DJ Moneyshot &amp;amp; Rackabeat. HornDogz then kept the funk flowing and enlisted the vocal talents of Ty to make some of that classic sounding hip hop, nice.

A little 4/4 section finished the show kicking off with a taster of the new Fantastic Mr. Fox EP on Black Acre, great leftfield house vibes. Auntie Flo then carried on the deep house mission from one of our albums of the year, Future Rhythm Machine - check it! Pitchben then went super deep and soulful with surely one of the warmest tunes of the summer, the Alexander Maier 1to11 remix of 'Unique' - lovely! Enawadan then kept the soul vibes flowing before Lone finished the show in fine style with 'Earths Lungs' from his excellent new album on R&amp;amp;S.

      <title>Audio Texture Radio Show - April 6, 2012</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1595724/600x600_5182830.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unrepentantly electronic selection is the order of this weeks show with &lt;b&gt;Dean McPhee&lt;/b&gt; kicking things off with a long meandering electroacoustic adventure from the &lt;b&gt;Son Of The Black Peace&lt;/b&gt; album before the prolific &lt;b&gt;Me Raabenstein&lt;/b&gt; drops the abstract beatscape '&lt;b&gt;Jabbering and Jam&lt;/b&gt;'. A deep future Afroelectronic experiment then seemed fitting from the Damon Albarn led &lt;b&gt;DRC Music&lt;/b&gt; project, pieced together deep in Kinshasa with a load of local musicians and a fine roster of western producers.

A little &lt;b&gt;Project Mooncircle&lt;/b&gt; section then seemed appropriate as they are putting out a load of beat tapes (as in actual tapes) with a few new artists that I'm happy to now know about. Vienna boy &lt;b&gt;Szenario&lt;/b&gt; kicked things off with '&lt;b&gt;Shy&lt;/b&gt;' before Krakow native &lt;b&gt;Good Paul&lt;/b&gt; fed us electronic dreams. Ninja new boy and sample fiend &lt;b&gt;Hot Sugar&lt;/b&gt; then gatecrashed the &lt;b&gt;PMC&lt;/b&gt; party but brought the right flavoured beats before tagging South Carolina homey &lt;b&gt;Kwala&lt;/b&gt;. To finish off the &lt;b&gt;Mooncircle&lt;/b&gt; love in we had to drop another track from the excellent &lt;b&gt;Rumpistol/Red Baron&lt;/b&gt; album coming to all good record stores soon.

A little mish mash mix up took care of the second half of the show kicking off with the deep dub stylings of &lt;b&gt;Deadbeat&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;Daniel&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Tate&lt;/b&gt; which led nicely into an &lt;b&gt;Osunalde&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Palenque&amp;nbsp;remix from the excellent&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Jende Ri Palenge&lt;/b&gt; comp on &lt;b&gt;Soul Jazz&lt;/b&gt;. If deep bassline beats are your flavour then make sure you check the forthcoming &lt;b&gt;Bass Clef &lt;/b&gt;album soon to drop on &lt;b&gt;Punch Drunk.&lt;/b&gt; We then dropped a new&amp;nbsp;remix of&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Trus'me&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;and said a warm welcome back to the &lt;b&gt;Prime Numbers&lt;/b&gt; label, it has seemed like ages. &lt;b&gt;Tennis&lt;/b&gt;, with some great vocals from Fink, then injected the soul vibes before we gave you a little taster from the exciting new album from &lt;b&gt;Dave Aju&lt;/b&gt; which is currently on repeat at Audio Texture HQ.

      <itunes:summary>An unrepentantly electronic selection is the order of this weeks show with Dean McPhee kicking things off with a long meandering electroacoustic adventure from the Son Of The Black Peace album before the prolific Me Raabenstein drops the abstract beatscape 'Jabbering and Jam'. A deep future Afroelectronic experiment then seemed fitting from the Damon Albarn led DRC Music project, pieced together deep in Kinshasa with a load of local musicians and a fine roster of western producers.

A little Project Mooncircle section then seemed appropriate as they are putting out a load of beat tapes (as in actual tapes) with a few new artists that I'm happy to now know about. Vienna boy Szenario kicked things off with 'Shy' before Krakow native Good Paul fed us electronic dreams. Ninja new boy and sample fiend Hot Sugar then gatecrashed the PMC party but brought the right flavoured beats before tagging South Carolina homey Kwala. To finish off the Mooncircle love in we had to drop another track from the excellent Rumpistol/Red Baron album coming to all good record stores soon.

A little mish mash mix up took care of the second half of the show kicking off with the deep dub stylings of Deadbeat &amp;amp; Daniel Tate which led nicely into an Osunalde&amp;nbsp;Palenque&amp;nbsp;remix from the excellent&amp;nbsp;Jende Ri Palenge comp on Soul Jazz. If deep bassline beats are your flavour then make sure you check the forthcoming Bass Clef album soon to drop on Punch Drunk. We then dropped a new&amp;nbsp;remix of&amp;nbsp;Trus'me&amp;nbsp;and said a warm welcome back to the Prime Numbers label, it has seemed like ages. Tennis, with some great vocals from Fink, then injected the soul vibes before we gave you a little taster from the exciting new album from Dave Aju which is currently on repeat at Audio Texture HQ.

Vintage vibes from &lt;b&gt;Meirelles&lt;/b&gt; then added some Brazilian sunshine to the mix - look out for the excellent &lt;b&gt;Bossa Jazz &lt;/b&gt;compilation it was taken from if you fancy more of the same. The modern dream team of &lt;b&gt;Quantic&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Alice Russell&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;The Combo Barbaro&lt;/b&gt; then provided some classy soul vibes. You really do need to buy their album that has just been released, trust us. More modern vintage vibes were then provided thanks to Mr. Day and the soulful delights of '&lt;b&gt;Right On&lt;/b&gt;' from the soon to be released '&lt;b&gt;Dry In The Sun&lt;/b&gt;' album.

We don't drop enough Barcelona made music on the show mainly because, to be brutally honest, most of it&amp;nbsp; just isn't up to standard but &lt;b&gt;Seward&lt;/b&gt; are beyond reproach and our favourite band in the city. Starting off as a sprawling live project, they've trimmed down the group size and started putting some recordings down and both live and recorded they are great. If you are a label, they are also unsigned -tip! Don't say we didn't warn you. &lt;b&gt;Sven Kacirek&lt;/b&gt; our favourite German drum experimentalist then followed with a track from his forthcoming album on &lt;b&gt;Pingipung&lt;/b&gt; before &lt;b&gt;Bang On!&lt;/b&gt; provided the Liverpool urban music flavour. Portland duo, &lt;b&gt;Blaktronics&lt;/b&gt; then kept the slo-mo beats rolling, &lt;b&gt;Ostinato&lt;/b&gt; waved the flag for the Sydney beat making massive and &lt;b&gt;Lo Tide&lt;/b&gt; represented for the rejuvenated &lt;b&gt;Future Sounds Of Jazz&lt;/b&gt; comp, now at the dizzy heights of volume 12.

&lt;b&gt;Mathias Stubo&lt;/b&gt; is spreading his wings, away from disco deviance as the genre fusing '&lt;b&gt;Those High Frequency Feelings&lt;/b&gt;' showed, which led nicely into the feel good house vibes of '&lt;b&gt;Magic&lt;/b&gt;' from &lt;b&gt;Recloose&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Jazzanova&lt;/b&gt; are about to drop a new album with help from a full contingent of musicians and the disco vibes of '&lt;b&gt;Theme From Belle Et Fout&lt;/b&gt;' are a little taste of things to come. &lt;b&gt;Ebo Taylor&lt;/b&gt; then finished the show with some great Ghanain funk vibes from his great new album &lt;b&gt;Appia Kwa Bridge&lt;/b&gt;.

      <title>Audio Texture Radio Show - March 23, 2012</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1595724/600x600_5182830.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you'll be happy to hear there wasn't much talking in this weeks show, hardly any in fact for the last 40 mins when it was a future boogie/nu disco/house mixup selection but it was hip hop that kicked things off from &lt;b&gt;The&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Darkhorsemen&lt;/b&gt; aka &lt;b&gt;Jon Wayne&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;Dibia&lt;/b&gt;$e (team!) before &lt;b&gt;Homeboy&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sandman&lt;/b&gt; kept the lyrical quality and underground vibe flowing, showing why 2012 is going to be his big year if there is any justice. &lt;b&gt;Project&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Mooncircle&lt;/b&gt;, who are never far from this show, then provided some great spaced out, tripped out beats from &lt;b&gt;Rumpistol&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Red&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Baron&lt;/b&gt; before New Zealand super group &lt;b&gt;Shogun&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Orchestra&lt;/b&gt;, containing members of &lt;b&gt;The&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Black&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Seeds&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Fat&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Freddie&lt;/b&gt;'s &lt;b&gt;Drop&lt;/b&gt; provided the soul jazz vibes with a touch of Asia thrown in for good measure.

The mix up selection then started in earnest courtesy of &lt;b&gt;My Panda Shall Fly&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;Benjamin Jackson&lt;/b&gt; with some great boogie beats. &lt;b&gt;Kelpe&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp; his '&lt;b&gt;Cola Mine&lt;/b&gt;' track then picked up the future boogie baton and ran with it with before handing over to &lt;b&gt;Crackazat&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Slugabed&lt;/b&gt; who ran the final two legs culminating in the whole team getting gold for future soul endeavor and the fair play award as well.

Disco was then the order of the day with a great rework of &lt;b&gt;Ned Doheney&lt;/b&gt;'s '&lt;b&gt;Prove My Love&lt;/b&gt;' from &lt;b&gt;Ruben&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;Ra&lt;/b&gt; before &lt;b&gt;El&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Freakadell&lt;/b&gt; went full on disco for the consistently great &lt;b&gt;Compost&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Disco&lt;/b&gt; label, which haven't put a foot wrong so far in their short but sweet existence. Things then went all quality house with the first of two cuts from the &lt;b&gt;Don't Be Afraid&lt;/b&gt; label kicking off with the &lt;b&gt;DJ 3000&lt;/b&gt; remix of label boss's '&lt;b&gt;Pizza&lt;/b&gt;' tune from earlier last year (I downloaded it into an obscure folder by mistake and only discovered it yesterday, along with 4 other great EPs, 9 months later!) and then the latest offering on the label from &lt;b&gt;Mr&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Beatnick&lt;/b&gt; who is holding down the quality in his brief, but hopefully long, recording career. &lt;b&gt;Devonwho&lt;/b&gt; then ended the show in fitting style with some heavily pitched down, deep cosmic beats from his new EP on &lt;b&gt;All&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;City&lt;/b&gt;.

The Darkhorsemen - Taking Over Empires (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gillespetersonworldwide.com/2012/03/kutmah-presents-worldwide-family-volume-2-release-date-change/&quot;&gt;Brownswood&lt;/a&gt; promo)

      <itunes:summary>So you'll be happy to hear there wasn't much talking in this weeks show, hardly any in fact for the last 40 mins when it was a future boogie/nu disco/house mixup selection but it was hip hop that kicked things off from The Darkhorsemen aka Jon Wayne &amp;amp; Dibia$e (team!) before Homeboy Sandman kept the lyrical quality and underground vibe flowing, showing why 2012 is going to be his big year if there is any justice. Project Mooncircle, who are never far from this show, then provided some great spaced out, tripped out beats from Rumpistol and Red Baron before New Zealand super group Shogun Orchestra, containing members of The Black Seeds and Fat Freddie's Drop provided the soul jazz vibes with a touch of Asia thrown in for good measure.

The mix up selection then started in earnest courtesy of My Panda Shall Fly &amp;amp; Benjamin Jackson with some great boogie beats. Kelpe &amp;amp; his 'Cola Mine' track then picked up the future boogie baton and ran with it with before handing over to Crackazat and Slugabed who ran the final two legs culminating in the whole team getting gold for future soul endeavor and the fair play award as well.

Disco was then the order of the day with a great rework of Ned Doheney's 'Prove My Love' from Ruben &amp;amp; Ra before El Freakadell went full on disco for the consistently great Compost Disco label, which haven't put a foot wrong so far in their short but sweet existence. Things then went all quality house with the first of two cuts from the Don't Be Afraid label kicking off with the DJ 3000 remix of label boss's 'Pizza' tune from earlier last year (I downloaded it into an obscure folder by mistake and only discovered it yesterday, along with 4 other great EPs, 9 months later!) and then the latest offering on the label from Mr. Beatnick who is holding down the quality in his brief, but hopefully long, recording career. Devonwho then ended the show in fitting style with some heavily pitched down, deep cosmic beats from his new EP on All City.

We love music even more than chocolate and we constantly research, listen to &amp; painstakingly collate what we consider to be the best music in the world.

      <title>Audio Texture Radio Show - March 16, 2012</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1595724/600x600_5182830.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a show of two halves this week with a largely folk based, Americana selection for a change followed by an unrepentant electronic finale. Saying that though &lt;b&gt;Atom&lt;/b&gt; and his atmospheric bleepy soundtrack to his own 2011 photo exhibition opened proceedings before &lt;b&gt;Gareth Dickson&lt;/b&gt; and a tune from his personal soundtrack to some South American adventures caused by affairs of the heart sent the show into more ethereal territory. Melodic beats made in Poland from &lt;b&gt;Astroboter&lt;/b&gt; then sustained the show's warm glow before &lt;b&gt;Gillian Welch&lt;/b&gt; provided some lovely southern fried Americana which strangely seemed like the most natural progression to the sublime sounds of French based Malian songstress &lt;b&gt;Fatounata&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Diawara&lt;/b&gt;.

Now &lt;b&gt;J Mascis&lt;/b&gt; has been on a musical journey, no two ways, and amazingly his solo album &lt;b&gt;Several Shades Of Why&lt;/b&gt; has seen this hardcore icon mellow, perhaps not unusually for a grey haired, almost 50 year old, to great effect. &lt;b&gt;Jonathon Wilson&lt;/b&gt; then provided some great stoned country rock from his album &lt;b&gt;Gentle Spirit&lt;/b&gt; which is currently on repeat at Audio Texture HQ. &lt;b&gt;Quantic&lt;/b&gt; is back with a new album with his old spa &lt;b&gt;Alice Russell&lt;/b&gt; and all we can say is it's a classy affair partly due to the continued use of &lt;b&gt;The Combo Barabaro&lt;/b&gt;, his crack team of Colombian musos, Alice's real deal soul vocals and some wonderful arrangements - we'll be hitting you with more tracks soon.

So then the electronic fun and games began with a track from the new, all played live, &lt;b&gt;Brandt Brauer Frick Ensemble&lt;/b&gt;'s album before &lt;b&gt;Old Apparatus&lt;/b&gt; combined with some &lt;b&gt;Shangaan Electro&lt;/b&gt; to great modern Afro dub effect. &lt;b&gt;Barker&lt;/b&gt; then provided some pleasant, quirky, melodic electronica before &lt;b&gt;Synkro&lt;/b&gt; marked the return of the &lt;b&gt;R&amp;amp;S&lt;/b&gt; sub label, &lt;b&gt;Apollo&lt;/b&gt; in fine style. &lt;b&gt;Lando Kale&lt;/b&gt; then kept his great run of form with some brand new classic house vibes soon to released on the stylistically ducking and diving &lt;b&gt;Hotflush&lt;/b&gt; label. &lt;b&gt;Untold&lt;/b&gt; then ended the show with some mind melting future bassline action for &lt;b&gt;Hemlock&lt;/b&gt;, nasty boy.

The new &lt;b&gt;Portico Quartet&lt;/b&gt; material has just been given some progressive remix treatment and &lt;b&gt;Will Ward's Circle Trap&lt;/b&gt; remix is the pick of the bunch for us. The new &lt;b&gt;RareBit&lt;/b&gt; album is a really interesting listen with more hidden depths and layers than most but '&lt;b&gt;I'll Be Hard On You&lt;/b&gt;' is something else, fantastic, cultured jazz flavoured beats which led perfectly into some of that original jazz flavour and &lt;b&gt;Tyrone Washington&lt;/b&gt;'s '&lt;b&gt;Submission&lt;/b&gt;' from the excellent &lt;b&gt;Best Of Perception &amp;amp; Today Records&lt;/b&gt; compilation put together by the one and only &lt;b&gt;DJ Spinna&lt;/b&gt; and coming shortly on &lt;b&gt;BBE&lt;/b&gt; records.

House music was then the order of the day from Chicago's &lt;b&gt;Gene Hunt&lt;/b&gt; but given a Detroit resident's remix courtesy of &lt;b&gt;Theo Parrish&lt;/b&gt;. Austrian &lt;b&gt;Roman Rauch&lt;/b&gt; then provided the deep house vibes with his Curtis Mayfield sampling '&lt;b&gt;Hell Below&lt;/b&gt;'. &lt;b&gt;Hype Williams&lt;/b&gt; then ended the show with a radical &lt;b&gt;Shangaan&lt;/b&gt; remix from the recent &lt;b&gt;Honest Jon&lt;/b&gt;'s compilation which in our books is much better than the source material.

      <itunes:summary>Balearic business courtesy of the new Incarnations EP kicked off this weeks show where we let the tunes run their long, meandering courses and lock you into their&amp;nbsp; hypnotic grooves. Arp 101, courtesy of an Eglo Records freeload then switched the vibe to some 80's style, modern electro funk before Madrid's Alex Under went mesmerizingly deep and dark with 'BOLA5' from his excellent new album available on Soma Records. The new Portico Quartet material has just been given some progressive remix treatment and Will Ward's Circle Trap remix is the pick of the bunch for us. The new RareBit album is a really interesting listen with more hidden depths and layers than most but 'I'll Be Hard On You' is something else, fantastic, cultured jazz flavoured beats which led perfectly into some of that original jazz flavour and Tyrone Washington's 'Submission' from the excellent Best Of Perception &amp;amp; Today Records compilation put together by the one and only DJ Spinna and coming shortly on BBE records.

Senegalese Mbalax started the second half of the show and another killer long groove this time at high tempo from Jeri-Jeri &amp;amp; Mbene Diatta Seck ably produced by the one and only Mark Ernestus before some fresh modern broken beats from Blaktronics new album, coming shortly on Tokyo Dawn, highlighted the drums move from palms and animal skin to fingers and pads. House music was then the order of the day from Chicago's Gene Hunt but given a Detroit resident's remix courtesy of Theo Parrish. Austrian Roman Rauch then provided the deep house vibes with his Curtis Mayfield sampling 'Hell Below'. Hype Williams then ended the show with a radical Shangaan remix from the recent Honest Jon's compilation which in our books is much better than the source material.

We love music even more than chocolate and we constantly research, listen to &amp; painstakingly collate what we consider to be the best music in the world. So we thought it would be a nice idea to put out a weekly radio show to spread the word about some of our musical discoveries and support the world of quality, underground music.

      <title>Audio Texture Radio Show - February 24, 2012</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1595724/600x600_5182830.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Colman Brothers&lt;/b&gt; got this weeks show off to a nice mellow jazzwise start with '&lt;b&gt;On A Better Day&lt;/b&gt;' taken from the new &lt;b&gt;Heavenly Sweetness&lt;/b&gt; compilation, &lt;b&gt;Digging the Blogosphere&lt;/b&gt;, before the beautiful sound of &lt;b&gt;Joyce&lt;/b&gt; bathed the show in some Brazilian sunshine and served as a little taster of her forthcoming live album on &lt;b&gt;Far Out&lt;/b&gt; due out in March. Our new discovery of the week &lt;b&gt;Goran Kajfes&lt;/b&gt; then kept the jazz but added some great African vibes from his excellent album &lt;b&gt;X/Y &lt;/b&gt;- a great blend of jazz, Africa, eastern vibes and electronica - a bit expensive (plush packaging) but worth it. &lt;b&gt;Boddhi Satva&lt;/b&gt;'s ancestral soul vibes have been infiltrating the house scene for a while and we're pleased to report that his debut album is about to drop on &lt;b&gt;BBE&lt;/b&gt; records and it's one of those rare things, a house album that actually works start to finish, the production is deep and there's some great vocalists on there as well, as '&lt;b&gt;Ngari Konon&lt;/b&gt;' featuring &lt;b&gt;Oumou Sangare&lt;/b&gt;, more than ably demonstrates.

&lt;b&gt;Hyperdub&lt;/b&gt; seem increasingly determined to transcend their reputation as a home for bass music and their forthcoming release from &lt;b&gt;Fhloston Paradigm&lt;/b&gt; aka &lt;b&gt;King Britt&lt;/b&gt; is deep, dark, raw, stripped back, hypnotic electronica which will probably educate and confuse &lt;b&gt;Hyperdub&lt;/b&gt; bass heads in equal measures. This paved the way for a stripped back, less is more, Ethiopian electro experiment courtesy of &lt;b&gt;Fresh Touch&lt;/b&gt;, make sure you check the video as well for some great footage of Haile Selassie. Chopped and heavily screwed vibes were then the order of the day as &lt;b&gt;Caracal&lt;/b&gt;, another producer who prefers to remain anonymous, gave us a taster of his forthcoming EP on &lt;b&gt;Black Acre&lt;/b&gt;. Australian pianist and composer, &lt;b&gt;Anthony Pateras&lt;/b&gt; then kept the vibes dark with the unsettling '&lt;b&gt;Infectious&lt;/b&gt;' from his OST, &lt;b&gt;Errors Of The Human Body&lt;/b&gt; before &lt;b&gt;Felix Kubin&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Venetian Snares&lt;/b&gt; dropped some, quite frankly, mental beats.

Now we've been keeping tabs on &lt;b&gt;Airhead&lt;/b&gt;'s all too sparse output since day one and were happy to receive a promo single from &lt;b&gt;R&amp;amp;S&lt;/b&gt; this week with new material and also news that this young, guitar playing producer has seemingly been saving all his output for an album release also due on &lt;b&gt;R&amp;amp;S&lt;/b&gt; later this year. Two classically trained, adventurous, producers named &lt;b&gt;Colo&lt;/b&gt;, then kept the leftfield beats rolling with '&lt;b&gt;Rick&lt;/b&gt;' from their inspired debut EP on &lt;b&gt;Take&lt;/b&gt;. Uptempo beats then finished the show off nicely led by &lt;b&gt;Duct&lt;/b&gt;, a music technology professor who practices what he teaches before &lt;b&gt;Sisi Bakbak&lt;/b&gt; (allegedly Thom York) gave &lt;b&gt;Sbtrkt&lt;/b&gt;'s '&lt;b&gt;Hold On&lt;/b&gt;' a pleasing twist and ended the show in fine fashion.&amp;nbsp;

      <itunes:summary>The Colman Brothers got this weeks show off to a nice mellow jazzwise start with 'On A Better Day' taken from the new Heavenly Sweetness compilation, Digging the Blogosphere, before the beautiful sound of Joyce bathed the show in some Brazilian sunshine and served as a little taster of her forthcoming live album on Far Out due out in March. Our new discovery of the week Goran Kajfes then kept the jazz but added some great African vibes from his excellent album X/Y - a great blend of jazz, Africa, eastern vibes and electronica - a bit expensive (plush packaging) but worth it. Boddhi Satva's ancestral soul vibes have been infiltrating the house scene for a while and we're pleased to report that his debut album is about to drop on BBE records and it's one of those rare things, a house album that actually works start to finish, the production is deep and there's some great vocalists on there as well, as 'Ngari Konon' featuring Oumou Sangare, more than ably demonstrates.

Hyperdub seem increasingly determined to transcend their reputation as a home for bass music and their forthcoming release from Fhloston Paradigm aka King Britt is deep, dark, raw, stripped back, hypnotic electronica which will probably educate and confuse Hyperdub bass heads in equal measures. This paved the way for a stripped back, less is more, Ethiopian electro experiment courtesy of Fresh Touch, make sure you check the video as well for some great footage of Haile Selassie. Chopped and heavily screwed vibes were then the order of the day as Caracal, another producer who prefers to remain anonymous, gave us a taster of his forthcoming EP on Black Acre. Australian pianist and composer, Anthony Pateras then kept the vibes dark with the unsettling 'Infectious' from his OST, Errors Of The Human Body before Felix Kubin and Venetian Snares dropped some, quite frankly, mental beats.

Now we've been keeping tabs on Airhead's all too sparse output since day one and were happy to receive a promo single from R&amp;amp;S this week with new material and also news that this young, guitar playing producer has seemingly been saving all his output for an album release also due on R&amp;amp;S later this year. Two classically trained, adventurous, producers named Colo, then kept the leftfield beats rolling with 'Rick' from their inspired debut EP on Take. Uptempo beats then finished the show off nicely led by Duct, a music technology professor who practices what he teaches before Sisi Bakbak (allegedly Thom York) gave Sbtrkt's 'Hold On' a pleasing twist and ended the show in fine fashion.&amp;nbsp;

      <title>Audio Texture Radio Show - February 14, 2012</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1595724/600x600_5182830.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the show is back in full effect after a rare missed week due to work commitments and we kick off in fine style with a track from the&lt;b&gt; Project Mooncircle&lt;/b&gt; 10th anniversary boxset, a nice slice of deep bassline action from &lt;b&gt;Rain Dog&lt;/b&gt;, one of many great tunes celebrating this ever improving label and their dedication to unearthing fresh beat making talent. A 10th anniversary is a real milestone for a label in todays difficulty record selling climate and to have put out over a 100 releases in that time makes it even more so. Fink then kept the deep vibes flowing with an excellent &lt;b&gt;Close&lt;/b&gt; remix of his '&lt;b&gt;Perfect Darkness&lt;/b&gt;' track from last year before &lt;b&gt;Shlohmo&lt;/b&gt; kept the future soul vibes flowing with the excellent '&lt;b&gt;Wen Uuu&lt;/b&gt;' from his recent EP on &lt;b&gt;FoF&lt;/b&gt; music.

We couldn't resist dropping more &lt;b&gt;Jeb Loy Nichols&lt;/b&gt; as his new album is about to drop on &lt;b&gt;Decca&lt;/b&gt;. We'd already hit you with '&lt;b&gt;Hard Times&lt;/b&gt;' but this time the track has been given a little reggae remix courtesy of &lt;b&gt;Curtis Lynch&lt;/b&gt; to take the tune back to it's JA roots. Ruder dancehall bassline vibes then invaded the airwaves as Belleruche's &lt;b&gt;DJ Modest&lt;/b&gt; gave &lt;b&gt;Hint&lt;/b&gt;'s '&lt;b&gt;Crash and Burn&lt;/b&gt;' a little dubstep refix. &lt;b&gt;Lorca&lt;/b&gt; has been on our radar since last year and showed why by supplying a nice slice of swinging, jazz flavoured, funky house niceness before &lt;b&gt;Micatone&lt;/b&gt; dropped the tempo and injected some country edged soul with their welcome return.

Now we've been on the case of &lt;b&gt;Mancini and The Creepers&lt;/b&gt; since day one and I'm happy to report their debut album is about to drop. Now some people are going to say they sound a bit Ghostpoet like and we're not going to dispute that but to be honest we'd heard them before Ghostpoet and to be honest we don't care who was first as they both rock. &lt;b&gt;Joash&lt;/b&gt; with a little help from &lt;b&gt;Chocolate Garage&lt;/b&gt; then single handedly revived hip house with the killer '&lt;b&gt;Mission&lt;/b&gt;'. &lt;b&gt;Subsequent&lt;/b&gt; featuring &lt;b&gt;Festa&lt;/b&gt; then rounded off a trio of leftfield hip hop gems in a German stylee, thanks to &lt;b&gt;Nonine&lt;/b&gt; for that one. &lt;b&gt;Mo Kolours&lt;/b&gt; then dropped a real slice of Mauritian flavoured beat madness as he is wont to do before &lt;b&gt;Bullion&lt;/b&gt;, if he hadn't already, cememented his stylistic versatility with '&lt;b&gt;Say Arr Ee&lt;/b&gt;' from his new &lt;b&gt;R&amp;amp;S&lt;/b&gt; release before &lt;b&gt;Maddslinky&lt;/b&gt;'s &lt;b&gt;Azymuth&lt;/b&gt; rerub ended the show in fine Brazilian beats style.

      <itunes:summary>So the show is back in full effect after a rare missed week due to work commitments and we kick off in fine style with a track from the Project Mooncircle 10th anniversary boxset, a nice slice of deep bassline action from Rain Dog, one of many great tunes celebrating this ever improving label and their dedication to unearthing fresh beat making talent. A 10th anniversary is a real milestone for a label in todays difficulty record selling climate and to have put out over a 100 releases in that time makes it even more so. Fink then kept the deep vibes flowing with an excellent Close remix of his 'Perfect Darkness' track from last year before Shlohmo kept the future soul vibes flowing with the excellent 'Wen Uuu' from his recent EP on FoF music.

We couldn't resist dropping more Jeb Loy Nichols as his new album is about to drop on Decca. We'd already hit you with 'Hard Times' but this time the track has been given a little reggae remix courtesy of Curtis Lynch to take the tune back to it's JA roots. Ruder dancehall bassline vibes then invaded the airwaves as Belleruche's DJ Modest gave Hint's 'Crash and Burn' a little dubstep refix. Lorca has been on our radar since last year and showed why by supplying a nice slice of swinging, jazz flavoured, funky house niceness before Micatone dropped the tempo and injected some country edged soul with their welcome return.

Now we've been on the case of Mancini and The Creepers since day one and I'm happy to report their debut album is about to drop. Now some people are going to say they sound a bit Ghostpoet like and we're not going to dispute that but to be honest we'd heard them before Ghostpoet and to be honest we don't care who was first as they both rock. Joash with a little help from Chocolate Garage then single handedly revived hip house with the killer 'Mission'. Subsequent featuring Festa then rounded off a trio of leftfield hip hop gems in a German stylee, thanks to Nonine for that one. Mo Kolours then dropped a real slice of Mauritian flavoured beat madness as he is wont to do before Bullion, if he hadn't already, cememented his stylistic versatility with 'Say Arr Ee' from his new R&amp;amp;S release before Maddslinky's Azymuth rerub ended the show in fine Brazilian beats style.

      <title>Audio Texture Radio Show - February 3, 2012</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1595724/600x600_5182830.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the whole original Chicago footwork scene, that blew up on the back of &lt;b&gt;Planet Mu&lt;/b&gt;'s crusade, was a bit of disappointment musically but the dancing was out of this world. Now a whole heap of producers, with broader palettes, have jumped on board the wagon things are starting to get more interesting and the latest mutation is &lt;b&gt;Dream Continuum&lt;/b&gt;'s fusion of footwork and 90's drum and bass which is set to smash up the dance in 2012, check &lt;b&gt;'Side Set It&lt;/b&gt;' that opens the show and get your rave on. Around this time every year the &lt;b&gt;J Dilla&lt;/b&gt; tributes to commemorate his passing start, thus prompted, I thought I'd give you his classic take on '&lt;b&gt;Think Twice&lt;/b&gt;' which led nicely into some &lt;b&gt;Propaground&lt;/b&gt; action with &lt;b&gt;Gusby&lt;/b&gt;'s deep soul groover, '&lt;b&gt;Analogik Love Pt II&lt;/b&gt;'. &lt;b&gt;Jeb Loy Nichols&lt;/b&gt; then provided some '&lt;b&gt;Countrymusicdisco&lt;/b&gt;' in fine blue eyed soulful style, look out for his new album dropping anytime now on &lt;b&gt;Decca&lt;/b&gt;.

As mentioned recently the new &lt;b&gt;Blundetto&lt;/b&gt; album is sounding great start to finish, so just to prove we're not lying we thought we'd drop you another little taster, this time Ethio jazz style with the excellent &lt;b&gt;Akale Horns&lt;/b&gt; in full effect. &lt;b&gt;Afrobuddha&lt;/b&gt; with the aid of the &lt;b&gt;Kakatsitsi Drummers&lt;/b&gt; then provided some hyper real Afro House Sounds before &lt;b&gt;Dancing Turtle&lt;/b&gt;'s new signing &lt;b&gt;Elpoep&lt;/b&gt; provided some deep hypnotic beats from their excellent new release. &lt;b&gt;DVA&lt;/b&gt; then dropped the future soul from his new album on &lt;b&gt;Hyperdub&lt;/b&gt; which funnily sounds largely like vintage broken beat with a slightly poorer choice of vocalists and obviously is none the worse for it.

Whilst I'm at easy comparisons the new &lt;b&gt;Gang Colours&lt;/b&gt; album is sounding like a slightly less melancholic &lt;b&gt;James Blake&lt;/b&gt;, you probably don't need much more encouragement than that to check him out. There is a nice &lt;b&gt;Slugabed&lt;/b&gt; EP floating about at the moment with some cheeky tunes on. It was a tossup which one to drop but we opted for the soulful strains of '&lt;b&gt;Rockin U&lt;/b&gt;' featuring the one and only &lt;b&gt;Leon Ware&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Deep Medi&lt;/b&gt; new boy &lt;b&gt;Dark Tantrums&lt;/b&gt; then provided some deep, simple but atmospheric dub step flavours before &lt;b&gt;NonGenetic &amp;amp; Cooptrol&lt;/b&gt; showed that dubstep is a perfect riddim for some lyrical expression, if only more beat producers thought that way. Uptempo beats then led the show to its conclusion with some great bassline action from &lt;b&gt;Dark Sky&lt;/b&gt; and then &lt;b&gt;Magic Wire&lt;/b&gt;'s, &lt;b&gt;Neon Jung&lt;/b&gt; who really gave the sub woofers a good testing.

      <itunes:summary>So the whole original Chicago footwork scene, that blew up on the back of Planet Mu's crusade, was a bit of disappointment musically but the dancing was out of this world. Now a whole heap of producers, with broader palettes, have jumped on board the wagon things are starting to get more interesting and the latest mutation is Dream Continuum's fusion of footwork and 90's drum and bass which is set to smash up the dance in 2012, check 'Side Set It' that opens the show and get your rave on. Around this time every year the J Dilla tributes to commemorate his passing start, thus prompted, I thought I'd give you his classic take on 'Think Twice' which led nicely into some Propaground action with Gusby's deep soul groover, 'Analogik Love Pt II'. Jeb Loy Nichols then provided some 'Countrymusicdisco' in fine blue eyed soulful style, look out for his new album dropping anytime now on Decca.

As mentioned recently the new Blundetto album is sounding great start to finish, so just to prove we're not lying we thought we'd drop you another little taster, this time Ethio jazz style with the excellent Akale Horns in full effect. Afrobuddha with the aid of the Kakatsitsi Drummers then provided some hyper real Afro House Sounds before Dancing Turtle's new signing Elpoep provided some deep hypnotic beats from their excellent new release. DVA then dropped the future soul from his new album on Hyperdub which funnily sounds largely like vintage broken beat with a slightly poorer choice of vocalists and obviously is none the worse for it.

Whilst I'm at easy comparisons the new Gang Colours album is sounding like a slightly less melancholic James Blake, you probably don't need much more encouragement than that to check him out. There is a nice Slugabed EP floating about at the moment with some cheeky tunes on. It was a tossup which one to drop but we opted for the soulful strains of 'Rockin U' featuring the one and only Leon Ware. Deep Medi new boy Dark Tantrums then provided some deep, simple but atmospheric dub step flavours before NonGenetic &amp;amp; Cooptrol showed that dubstep is a perfect riddim for some lyrical expression, if only more beat producers thought that way. Uptempo beats then led the show to its conclusion with some great bassline action from Dark Sky and then Magic Wire's, Neon Jung who really gave the sub woofers a good testing.

      <title>Audio Texture Radio Show - January 27, 2012</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1595724/600x600_5182830.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it's all about the mellow vibes this week kicking off with &lt;b&gt;Torus&lt;/b&gt;, an 18 year old from Holland with a talent that belies his years and a great first release for the fledgling &lt;b&gt;Sonic Router&lt;/b&gt; label. One of two tracks in this week's show from &lt;b&gt;Sandro Perri&lt;/b&gt; followed to show what an underexposed talent this Canadian boy is, make sure you check out his &lt;b&gt;Impossible Spaces&lt;/b&gt; album. &lt;b&gt;Teho Teardo&lt;/b&gt;, the great Italian soundtrack composer, followed with a track from his new album on his own &lt;b&gt;Specula&lt;/b&gt; label before &lt;b&gt;The Boats&lt;/b&gt; provided a teaser of their great sounding new album on the ever consistent and interesting&lt;b&gt;12K&lt;/b&gt; label.

The &lt;b&gt;Gang Colours&lt;/b&gt; album is coming on &lt;b&gt;Brownswood&lt;/b&gt; in February and this latest single is another fresh sounding slice of melodic electronica that bodes well for the full length release. We then dug out some &lt;b&gt;Guts&lt;/b&gt; to keep the soul flowing before &lt;b&gt;Anchorsong&lt;/b&gt; upped the tempo but kept the sweetness intact. It looks like 2012 is going to be a big year for &lt;b&gt;Homeboy Sandman&lt;/b&gt;. The new promo teaser dropped through from &lt;b&gt;Stones Throw&lt;/b&gt; this week and '&lt;b&gt;The Miracles&lt;/b&gt;' is just killing it and the other cuts are great as well. &lt;b&gt;Earnest Endeavours&lt;/b&gt; are going from strength to strength with their second release, this time from &lt;b&gt;Darkhouse Family&lt;/b&gt; and roping in &lt;b&gt;Om'Mas Keith&lt;/b&gt; on vocal duties hasn't hurt them any. Londoners &lt;b&gt;Midnight Davies&lt;/b&gt; then supplied some darker, slightly sinister vibes with some pleasing musical touches.

Now &lt;b&gt;Lapalux&lt;/b&gt;'s sun has been rising all last year and it looks like he's finally going to slap everone round the chops with the imminent arrival of his submerged soulful, pysched out EP of beats about to drop on &lt;b&gt;Brainfeeder&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Blundetto&lt;/b&gt; then brought us back to planet earth with the aid of &lt;b&gt;Tommy Guerrero&lt;/b&gt; and we have to say his new album is sounding good all the way through, look out for it on &lt;b&gt;Heavenly Sweetness&lt;/b&gt; in the not too distant future. &lt;b&gt;Boss Kite&lt;/b&gt; then skweed the shop right up with some lovely restrained, spacious electro soul, another cool little EP available once again for free from &lt;b&gt;Donkey Pitch&lt;/b&gt;. The new &lt;b&gt;Aeroc&lt;/b&gt; album on &lt;b&gt;Ghostly International&lt;/b&gt; is a lovely slice of melodic electronica which brought us nicely to another cut from the excellent &lt;b&gt;Impossible Spaces&lt;/b&gt; album from &lt;b&gt;Sandro Perri&lt;/b&gt; before &lt;b&gt;Nathan&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Davies&lt;/b&gt; provided some deep jazz vibrations to end this weeks super mellow special.

      <itunes:summary>So it's all about the mellow vibes this week kicking off with Torus, an 18 year old from Holland with a talent that belies his years and a great first release for the fledgling Sonic Router label. One of two tracks in this week's show from Sandro Perri followed to show what an underexposed talent this Canadian boy is, make sure you check out his Impossible Spaces album. Teho Teardo, the great Italian soundtrack composer, followed with a track from his new album on his own Specula label before The Boats provided a teaser of their great sounding new album on the ever consistent and interesting12K label.

The Gang Colours album is coming on Brownswood in February and this latest single is another fresh sounding slice of melodic electronica that bodes well for the full length release. We then dug out some Guts to keep the soul flowing before Anchorsong upped the tempo but kept the sweetness intact. It looks like 2012 is going to be a big year for Homeboy Sandman. The new promo teaser dropped through from Stones Throw this week and 'The Miracles' is just killing it and the other cuts are great as well. Earnest Endeavours are going from strength to strength with their second release, this time from Darkhouse Family and roping in Om'Mas Keith on vocal duties hasn't hurt them any. Londoners Midnight Davies then supplied some darker, slightly sinister vibes with some pleasing musical touches.

Now Lapalux's sun has been rising all last year and it looks like he's finally going to slap everone round the chops with the imminent arrival of his submerged soulful, pysched out EP of beats about to drop on Brainfeeder. Blundetto then brought us back to planet earth with the aid of Tommy Guerrero and we have to say his new album is sounding good all the way through, look out for it on Heavenly Sweetness in the not too distant future. Boss Kite then skweed the shop right up with some lovely restrained, spacious electro soul, another cool little EP available once again for free from Donkey Pitch. The new Aeroc album on Ghostly International is a lovely slice of melodic electronica which brought us nicely to another cut from the excellent Impossible Spaces album from Sandro Perri before Nathan Davies provided some deep jazz vibrations to end this weeks super mellow special.

      <title>Audio Texture Radio Show - January 20, 2012</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1595724/600x600_5182830.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So loads of nice electronic bits and bobs in this weeks show kicking off with a killer tune from &lt;b&gt;Virtual Boy&lt;/b&gt; from their forthcoming album on &lt;b&gt;Alpha Pup&lt;/b&gt; due in February, should be a goodie if '&lt;b&gt;Memory Of A Ghost&lt;/b&gt;' is anything to go by. That was followed by some great soul music from Russia of all places, a country gaining a steady reputation for it's electronic producers but the &lt;b&gt;Valique&lt;/b&gt; track is straight out of the American soul handbook. &lt;b&gt;Twit One&lt;/b&gt; then kept the vibe rolling with a cheeky little edit of Brazilian soul boy &lt;b&gt;Tim Maia&lt;/b&gt;. As you've already heard &lt;b&gt;Bonobo&lt;/b&gt; has commissioned some great remixes of his Black Sands album from last year and the &lt;b&gt;Falty DL&lt;/b&gt; twist of '&lt;b&gt;All In Forms&lt;/b&gt;' we're sure you'll agree is another winner.

&lt;b&gt;Mike Gao&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Daisuke Tanabe&lt;/b&gt; are the latest producers to grace the &lt;b&gt;Faces&lt;/b&gt; series of singles from &lt;b&gt;Project Mooncircle&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Gao&lt;/b&gt; in particular has excelled himself with a great side of deep musical beat excursions as '&lt;b&gt;Futuristic Wife&lt;/b&gt;' ably showcases. &lt;b&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Oh No&lt;/b&gt; go under the name of &lt;b&gt;Gangrene&lt;/b&gt; and we're loving the beats on their latest single '&lt;b&gt;Vodka &amp;amp; Ayahuasca&lt;/b&gt;' - pure pysched out beat making, shame the vocals couldn't live up to the production. The nice boys at &lt;b&gt;Donkey Pitch&lt;/b&gt; then, rather sweetly, provided the chopped and screwed soul of '&lt;b&gt;Sweat Mode&lt;/b&gt;' from &lt;b&gt;Ghost Mutt&lt;/b&gt; for free! The show then got into some deep progressive jazz with another taster of the great sounding &lt;b&gt;Portico Quartet&lt;/b&gt; album which is due very shortly but which still seems too long.

Things then went all dubbed up courtesy of &lt;b&gt;Jah Guidi&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Sanguebom&lt;/b&gt; an interesting little French outfit who we hope to hear more of before the ever fresh &lt;b&gt;Juan Atkins&lt;/b&gt; provided some great electro vibes under his &lt;b&gt;Model 500&lt;/b&gt; guise. &lt;b&gt;Xosar&lt;/b&gt; then provided some deep spooky house music before &lt;b&gt;Boddhi Satva&lt;/b&gt; graced us with some deep ancestral soul, aided and abetted by V&lt;b&gt;ikter Duplaix&lt;/b&gt;'s sweet vocals. &lt;b&gt;Tim Toh&lt;/b&gt; then upped the intensity with the percussive monster '&lt;b&gt;Pandemonium&lt;/b&gt;' from his latest sterling effort on &lt;b&gt;Philpot&lt;/b&gt; before &lt;b&gt;Raffertie&lt;/b&gt; showed his maturing, more spacious, sound with the '&lt;b&gt;Mass Appeal&lt;/b&gt;' title track from his excellent forthcoming EP for the &lt;b&gt;Ninja&lt;/b&gt; boys.

      <itunes:summary>So loads of nice electronic bits and bobs in this weeks show kicking off with a killer tune from Virtual Boy from their forthcoming album on Alpha Pup due in February, should be a goodie if 'Memory Of A Ghost' is anything to go by. That was followed by some great soul music from Russia of all places, a country gaining a steady reputation for it's electronic producers but the Valique track is straight out of the American soul handbook. Twit One then kept the vibe rolling with a cheeky little edit of Brazilian soul boy Tim Maia. As you've already heard Bonobo has commissioned some great remixes of his Black Sands album from last year and the Falty DL twist of 'All In Forms' we're sure you'll agree is another winner.

Mike Gao and Daisuke Tanabe are the latest producers to grace the Faces series of singles from Project Mooncircle and Gao in particular has excelled himself with a great side of deep musical beat excursions as 'Futuristic Wife' ably showcases. The Alchemist and Oh No go under the name of Gangrene and we're loving the beats on their latest single 'Vodka &amp;amp; Ayahuasca' - pure pysched out beat making, shame the vocals couldn't live up to the production. The nice boys at Donkey Pitch then, rather sweetly, provided the chopped and screwed soul of 'Sweat Mode' from Ghost Mutt for free! The show then got into some deep progressive jazz with another taster of the great sounding Portico Quartet album which is due very shortly but which still seems too long.

Things then went all dubbed up courtesy of Jah Guidi and Sanguebom an interesting little French outfit who we hope to hear more of before the ever fresh Juan Atkins provided some great electro vibes under his Model 500 guise. Xosar then provided some deep spooky house music before Boddhi Satva graced us with some deep ancestral soul, aided and abetted by Vikter Duplaix's sweet vocals. Tim Toh then upped the intensity with the percussive monster 'Pandemonium' from his latest sterling effort on Philpot before Raffertie showed his maturing, more spacious, sound with the 'Mass Appeal' title track from his excellent forthcoming EP for the Ninja boys.

      <title>Audio Texture Radio Show - January 13, 2012</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1595724/600x600_5182830.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So off we go again after the Christmas break, back, refreshed and raring to get stuck into some great music whilst ignoring all the hype - no hipster house here thank you. When we read this new micro genre term we didn't lower ourselves to investigate further but our theory is it's house music designed for people who are too cool to dance or just haven't got any co-ordination but to be honest we hope never to find out.&lt;br /&gt;

This week started with a song for our bank induced, crisis ridden times with &lt;b&gt;Jeb Loy Nichols&lt;/b&gt; covering Pablo Gad's classic, 'Hard Times' to amazing effect and it bodes well for Jeb's new album. &lt;b&gt;Doctor L&lt;/b&gt;, the uncompromising and diverse French producer is also coming through with a new album on &lt;b&gt;Comet&lt;/b&gt; and we're particularly liking the street poetry meets deep jazz beats of '&lt;b&gt;Vocal Kidnaping&lt;/b&gt;' featuring the &lt;b&gt;Unknown Poets&lt;/b&gt;. Some classic fusion then followed from &lt;b&gt;The Headhunters&lt;/b&gt; who are being re-issued by &lt;b&gt;R2&lt;/b&gt; records in 2012. The label is also embarking on a series of other classic album reissues with a killer program lined up - watch this space!&lt;br /&gt;

Classic sounding, new music with a Charles Stepney vibe then followed from &lt;b&gt;Quantic &amp;amp; Alice Russell&lt;/b&gt; backed up by the &lt;b&gt;Combo Barbaro&lt;/b&gt; with an amazing slice of soul which again bodes more than well for the new album release in April. &lt;b&gt;The Echocentrics&lt;/b&gt; ably followed with their interpretation of Timbaland's '&lt;b&gt;We Need A Resolution&lt;/b&gt;' from a really nice little EP of Timbaland covers done in a live soulful style. &lt;b&gt;Medline&lt;/b&gt; then kept the soul vibes flowing on a blaxploitation tip with his excellent, soon to be released '&lt;b&gt;Soldier Of Love&lt;/b&gt;' track - look out for all sorts of releases from him this year. Fresh new talent from Brighton then followed in the shape of the promising &lt;b&gt;J. Biscuits&lt;/b&gt; from Brighton who has just put out a lovely little album of eastern tinged beats for free download from his bandcamp page, surely a producer to watch.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;John Phonics&lt;/b&gt; then kept the beats flowing with a collaboration with &lt;b&gt;Peter Cannon&lt;/b&gt; given a &lt;b&gt;Pedestrian&lt;/b&gt; remix, from the inaugural release on &lt;b&gt;Prism&lt;/b&gt; records another promising label start up. &lt;b&gt;Robert Glasper&lt;/b&gt;'s new album is sounding great with all sorts of interesting collaborations and the first single from it, '&lt;b&gt;Ah Yeah'&lt;/b&gt; featuring &lt;b&gt;Musiq Soulchild&lt;/b&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;b&gt;Chrisette Michele&lt;/b&gt; is no exception. &lt;b&gt;Julien Dyne&lt;/b&gt; then provided a taster of his new album on &lt;b&gt;BBE&lt;/b&gt; which is due anytime now and will no doubt help cement this young New Zealand talent's reputation. &lt;b&gt;Toulouse Low Trax&lt;/b&gt; aka Detlef Weinrich from Kreidler then provided some deep dub tribal, slo mo house vibes from his forthcoming album due on &lt;b&gt;Karaoke Kalk&lt;/b&gt; in February, another winning album.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Downliners Sekt&lt;/b&gt; then showed why they are some of our favourite leftfield dubsters of recent times as they take some average shoegaze and turn it into a deep hypnotic dub roller, nice. &lt;b&gt;Stan Smith&lt;/b&gt; is one of out new hip hop discoveries and this New York MC is about to drop his debut album aided by some bruk style production from &lt;b&gt;Daz-I-Kue&lt;/b&gt; and it's sounding like a modern day hip-house winner start to finish. &lt;b&gt;Jonti&lt;/b&gt; has gone and released some of his early material for free after the success of his material on &lt;b&gt;Stonesthrow&lt;/b&gt; last year and there are some real nuggets on there, &lt;a href=&quot;http://stonesthrow.com/news/2012/01/jonti-sine-and-moon-album-free-download&quot;&gt;seek&lt;/a&gt; it out! Russian 8-bit don &lt;b&gt;Pixelord&lt;/b&gt; is another one steadily building his rep and, amongst others, from his new EP we're particularly liking the &lt;b&gt;Groundislava&lt;/b&gt; remix of '&lt;b&gt;Imaginery Friends&lt;/b&gt;'. &lt;b&gt;Minamo&lt;/b&gt;, a Japanese quartet then provided the abstract live vibes that nicely finished the show from their new album on &lt;b&gt;Room40&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

TROPICAL BEATS WITH AN AFRO-LATIN FLAVOUR
Friday 16th March 2012
AUDIO TEXTURE HI-FI,
DJ ROGER C &amp; 
JORGE DA BEAT

DIOBAR
Av. Marques de L&#8217;Argentera, 27
(beneath Greek Restaurant Dionisos)

BARCELONA
23:00 - 03:00
Free Entry

After the success of Hot Sauce's inaugaration, when the Dio Bar was an oasis of smiling, gyrating bodies on the coldest night of the year we are going to do it all over again in March. Expect more sizzling Tropical rhythms from Audio Texture Hi-Fi and Roger C, more &quot;percussion madness&quot; from Jorge Da Beat and more hip shaking, good time dancing and smiles from some of Barcelona's best party people.

The term &#8216;Tropical&#8217; has been used a lot in club and music circles over the last two or three years with great record labels like Soundway Records, Analog Africa, Strut &amp; Now Again, leading the charge with their great compilation albums and re-issues of long forgotten Afro, Latin, Caribbean grooves and lesser known regional music styles. Far flung urban music has also been coming to the attention of a wider audience with Baile Funk, Kuduro, Cumbia, Hip-Life and more recently Moombhaton all now a staple of many modern clubs and of course the feel good, bass heavy, indigenous sounds of Jamaica have never been far away over the last 40 years.

New club night, &#8216;Hot Sauce&#8217; is a rallying point for all these tropical rhythms in Barcelona where top selectors DJ Roger C (Joint Sessions / Sunday Joint)  and the Audio Texture Hi-Fi will be laying down some original swinging, sweaty dancefloor treats, and their modern electronic offspring. They will be assisted by talented percussionist Jorge Da Beat, firing off rhythms from his bongos, congos and djembe.

Expect to hear Highlife, Biguine, Kuduro, Forro, Kwaito, Mbalax, Soca, Afrobeat, Mambo, Calypso, Chicha, Soukous, Vallenata, Bossa, Salsa, Samba Soul, Dancehall, Mento, Techno Brega &amp; live bongo madness all night long in Barcelona's brand new super spicy, hot and sweaty, hip shaking Tropical monthly mash up - &#8216;Hot Sauce&#8217;.

&#8232;Tras el &#233;xito de la inaguracion de Hot Sauce, cuando el Dio Bar era un oasis de caras sonrientes y cuerpos en movimiento en la noche mas fr&#237;a del a&#241;o, vamos a hacerlo todo de nuevo en Marzo. Contando con los ritmos tropicales m&#225;s ardientes de Audio Texture Hi-Fi y Roger C, adem&#225;s de una locura de percusi&#243;n por parte de Jorge Da Beat y mas golpes de caderas, buenos bailes y sonrisas por parte del mejor grupo de gente Barcelona &#161;vosotros!

El t&#233;rmino 'Tropical'  se ha utilizado mucho en los clubes y c&#237;rculos de la m&#250;sica durante los &#250;ltimos dos o tres a&#241;os, debido a grandes discogr&#225;ficas  como Soundway Records, Analog Africa, Strut &amp; Now Again que han destacado con sus  fant&#225;sticas recopilaciones de &#225;lbumes, reediciones de las olvidadas Afro, Latino, Caribe&#241;o grooves y  los estilos menos conocidos de la m&#250;sica regional. Soplos de lejana m&#250;sica urbana han venido tambi&#233;n, sucumbiendo ante un  p&#250;blico m&#225;s amplio con Baile Funk, Kuduro, Cumbia, Hip-life y recientemente, Moombhaton, convirti&#233;ndose  en un alimento b&#225;sico de muchos clubes modernos y, por supuesto, los envolventes graves  y las agradables sensaciones  de los  sonidos Jamaicanos  que han permanecido durante  los &#250;ltimos 40 a&#241;os.&#8232;&#8232;

&quot;Hot Sauce&quot; nuevo night club, es un punto de encuentro para todos estos ritmos tropicales en Barcelona, &#8203;&#8203;donde la mejor selecci&#243;n de Djs: DJ Roger C (sesiones conjuntas / Joint domingo) y Audio Texture Hi-Fi se encargaran  de hechizarte  con original swinging, una gustosa y sudorosa pista de baile y sus hijos electr&#243;nicos mas modernos. Se contar&#225; con la colaboraci&#243;n del talentoso percusionista Jorge Da Beat, disparando ritmos con sus bongos, congos y djembe.&#8232;&#8232;

Esperamos escuchar Highlife, Biguine, Kuduro, Forro, Kwaito, Mbalax, Soca, Afrobeat, Mambo, Calypso, Chicha, Soukous, Vallenato, Bossa, Salsa, Soul Samba, Dancehall, Mento, Brega Techno y la locura de nuestro bongo durante toda la noche en el nuevo estilo de Barcelona:  un s&#250;per picante, caliente y sudoroso movimiento de cadera tropical mensual - &quot;Hot Sauce&quot;.

After the success of Hot Sauce's inaugaration, when the Dio Bar was an oasis of smiling, gyrating bodies on the coldest night of the year we are going to do it all over again in March. Expect more sizzling Tropical rhythms from Audio Texture Hi-Fi and Roger C, more &quot;percussion madness&quot; from Jorge Da Beat and more hip shaking, good time dancing and smiles from some of Barcelona's best party people.

The term &#8216;Tropical&#8217; has been used a lot in club and music circles over the last two or three years with great record labels like Soundway Records, Analog Africa, Strut &amp; Now Again, leading the charge with their great compilation albums and re-issues of long forgotten Afro, Latin, Caribbean grooves and lesser known regional music styles. Far flung urban music has also been coming to the attention of a wider audience with Baile Funk, Kuduro, Cumbia, Hip-Life and more recently Moombhaton all now a staple of many modern clubs and of course the feel good, bass heavy, indigenous sounds of Jamaica have never been far away over the last 40 years.

New club night, &#8216;Hot Sauce&#8217; is a rallying point for all these tropical rhythms in Barcelona where top selectors DJ Roger C (Joint Sessions / Sunday Joint)  and the Audio Texture Hi-Fi will be laying down some original swinging, sweaty dancefloor treats, and their modern electronic offspring. They will be assisted by talented percussionist Jorge Da Beat, firing off rhythms from his bongos, congos and djembe.

Expect to hear Highlife, Biguine, Kuduro, Forro, Kwaito, Mbalax, Soca, Afrobeat, Mambo, Calypso, Chicha, Soukous, Vallenata, Bossa, Salsa, Samba Soul, Dancehall, Mento, Techno Brega &amp; live bongo madness all night long in Barcelona's brand new super spicy, hot and sweaty, hip shaking Tropical monthly mash up - &#8216;Hot Sauce&#8217;.

&#8232;Tras el &#233;xito de la inaguracion de Hot Sauce, cuando el Dio Bar era un oasis de caras sonrientes y cuerpos en movimiento en la noche mas fr&#237;a del a&#241;o, vamos a hacerlo todo de nuevo en Marzo. Contando con los ritmos tropicales m&#225;s ardientes de Audio Texture Hi-Fi y Roger C, adem&#225;s de una locura de percusi&#243;n por parte de Jorge Da Beat y mas golpes de caderas, buenos bailes y sonrisas por parte del mejor grupo de gente Barcelona &#161;vosotros!

El t&#233;rmino 'Tropical'  se ha utilizado mucho en los clubes y c&#237;rculos de la m&#250;sica durante los &#250;ltimos dos o tres a&#241;os, debido a grandes discogr&#225;ficas  como Soundway Records, Analog Africa, Strut &amp; Now Again que han destacado con sus  fant&#225;sticas recopilaciones de &#225;lbumes, reediciones de las olvidadas Afro, Latino, Caribe&#241;o grooves y  los estilos menos conocidos de la m&#250;sica regional. Soplos de lejana m&#250;sica urbana han venido tambi&#233;n, sucumbiendo ante un  p&#250;blico m&#225;s amplio con Baile Funk, Kuduro, Cumbia, Hip-life y recientemente, Moombhaton, convirti&#233;ndose  en un alimento b&#225;sico de muchos clubes modernos y, por supuesto, los envolventes graves  y las agradables sensaciones  de los  sonidos Jamaicanos  que han permanecido durante  los &#250;ltimos 40 a&#241;os.&#8232;&#8232;

&quot;Hot Sauce&quot; nuevo night club, es un punto de encuentro para todos estos ritmos tropicales en Barcelona, &#8203;&#8203;donde la mejor selecci&#243;n de Djs: DJ Roger C (sesiones conjuntas / Joint domingo) y Audio Texture Hi-Fi se encargaran  de hechizarte  (continued)</itunes:summary>
