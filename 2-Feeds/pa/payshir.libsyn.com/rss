This segment will confront current political events and explain how it directly affects the community.

			<title>Hip Hop War Report Episode 15 (Jena 6, Rev Yearwood Assault, General AMIR)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://hiphopwarreport.com/hip-hop-war-report-episode-15-jena-6-rev-yearwood-assault-general-amir-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<div><p>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to a new episode of the Hip Hop War Report. Today we bring you breaking news involving the Jena 6 travesty and a recent hate crime of similar nature that&nbsp;occurred at the University of Maryland. Sue Ying will brief everyone on the Jena 6 case and its latest developments. Bashir will chime in and give you the truth behind the hate crime that the University of Maryland won't even acknowledge as an act of terror. Bashir speaks with Solomon Commissiong who is Assistant Director of Student Involvement and Public Relations on campus at the Nyumburu Cultural Center. Solomon and 2 of his colleagues give us the true breakdown of what took place as well as the current emotional state on campus. &lt;p&gt;</p>
<pre></pre></div><div><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre></pre></div><div><p>&lt;p&gt;Before we even get to that we have to shed light on a gross injustice by US Capitol Police on a very dear friend of the Hip Hop War Report. Reverend Lennox Yearwood was brutally attacked by US Capitol Police simply for exercising his right to appear at a public hearing on Capitol Hill. Minister Yearwood is the president of the Hip Hop Caucus a organization which strives for political and social change. The Hip Hop Caucus organizes youth to get actively involved in issues of war, poverty, racial injustice and the environment. Please go to www.hiphopcaucus.org and support this movement.&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p class="Heading11"><span><strong><font size="5">Rev. Yearwood released, charged with assaulting a police officer:</font></strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Heading31"><span><strong><font size="3">Part of increasing Capitol Hill crackdown on voices of dissent</font></strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><br/>Rev. Lennox Yearwood, Jr., President of the Hip Hop Caucus, was released from custody yesterday evening, after his arraignment. He is charged with assaulting a police officer and disorderly conduct outside of the hearing room on Capitol Hill where Gen. Petraeus gave testimony on </span><country-region></country-region><place></place><span>Iraq</span><span> this past Monday. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Rev. Yearwood gave this statement yesterday after his arraignment hearing: &quot;My role is to make government more transparent to the people, especially people of color. How am I supposed to convince other African-Americans to come to Capitol Hill to participate in democracy, when Capitol Police will go so far as to jump me when I question my exclusion from a hearing that is open to the public? We all know what ‘driving while Black‘ is, well I would call this ‘democracy while Black.‘ Rev. Yearwood was being excluded from the hearing room, because, according to the lieutenant on the scene, he was not in line. Witnesses attest to the fact that Rev. Yearwood was in line, but he was denied a blue post-it note ticket without reason when Police handed them out down the line shortly before they started letting people enter.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;Please read regarding Aaron Patterson</p>
<p class="head22"><strong>Aaron Patterson Targeted in Police and Fed Frame-up</strong></p>
<p class="byline">By Caryl Sortwell</p>
<p><strong>Chicago, IL - </strong>When ex-death row inmate Aaron Patterson was pardoned by Illinois Governor George Ryan in January, 2003, he came out of prison vowing to fight for justice. Within hours of his release, Patterson spoke at a Chicago anti-war rally. The next day he was a featured speaker at an anti-police frame-up community forum hosted by Comite Exigimos Justicia. In the months since his release, Aaron Patterson has proven to be a tireless and inspiring leader in the struggle against Chicago police misconduct, brutality and torture. He emerged as the city’s single most important leader of this fight. This made Patterson an irresistible target for the Chicago police and the U.S. Justice Department.</p>
<p>On Aug. 5, Aaron Patterson was arrested by the Chicago Police Department and Federal Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents. Patterson was charged, along with Isaiah Kitchen and Mark Mannie, with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and firearms. Patterson is not charged with possession of drugs or guns, rather the prosecutors are alleging that he intended to become involved in illegal activities. According to the federal government, it is involved in this case because it is able to seek sentences that are much greater than those administered at a local level. Aaron Patterson, if convicted, could face life in prison and millions of dollars in fines.</p>
<p>The source of the government’s evidence against Patterson is derived from an informant who is known by the street name of Fox. Fox was arrested in November 2003 for possession of over $100,000 in drugs and was facing a possible 30-year prison sentence. Yet Fox never went to prison, because he told authorities he could deliver Aaron Patterson to them. In March, under guidance from the Justice Department, Fox initiated contact with Patterson and taped a series of conversations with him, for which Fox was paid $6000 by the government.</p>
<p>According to Patterson, he knew all along that he was being targeted and taped by the government through Fox. At the same time that Fox was taping Patterson, Patterson was taping Fox. He was trying to trap the government agents who were trying to entrap him. As he told the Chicago Tribune, “I got videotapes, I got license plate numbers of undercover cars. Serial numbers for all the money. Everything.? Whether Patterson’s evidence of his entrapment will be helpful to his defense is unclear, since federal agents removed loads of evidence from his mother’s home the day of his arrest. </p>
<p>From his jail cell, where he sits after his bail was denied, Patterson was asked what his goal was when trying to document the police corruption surrounding his arrest. “It was to expose. Let’s do something real and get it on tape. The stunt was not to get locked up. The stunt was that I wanted to do something that would put them on the spot.?</p>
<p>Aaron Patterson’s arrest took place just 24 hours after a federal judge in Chicago ordered former Chicago Police Commander Jon Burge back to Chicago to testify. Jon Burge is alleged to have tortured or to have supervised the torture of 108 Black and Latino suspects while he was a detective in Chicago Police Area 2 and commander of Area 3. Burge and the detectives working under him are accused of using electric shock and suffocation with typewriter covers to extract confessions. One of those tortured suspects was Aaron Patterson, who has a pending civil suit against Burge.</p>
<p>Aaron Patterson has survived police torture and years spent on death row for a crime he didn’t commit and he came out swinging against a corrupt and racist criminal justice system. By targeting him, the Chicago Police Department and the U.S. Justice Department are trying to tell victims of police and prosecutorial misconduct to suffer in silence. Anti-police corruption activists will not stay silent. Instead we will raise our voices to denounce this latest frame-up and to demand the immediate release of Aaron Patterson!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Greetings everyone and welcome to a special edition of the
Hip Hop War Report. There has been a lot going on in the news and we do our
best to give it to our people straight. </p>





<p class="MsoNormal">The first part of this podcast is provided by Digital Dex
from the <a href="http://www.mixtapeshow.net/">www.mixtapeshow.net</a></p>

mixtapeshow.net. I encourage all War Report listeners to go to <a href="http://www.mixtapeshow.net/">www.mixtapeshow.net</a> and get the full episode<o:p></o:p></p>





<p>During the last few weeks, Hip-Hop has been under serious fire from the
mainstream media, not only because of the backlash following Don Imus termination,
but the more recent 60 minutes interview featuring Camron and Anderson
Coopers interpretation of the Stop Snitching mantra. So in order to bring some
clarity to the situation, I spoke to several different community leaders, all
of different backgrounds.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Greetings and welcome to this special edition of the Hip Hop War Report. Today we bring to you a podcast based on the most important thing in your life: YOUR HEALTH!. The War Report has teamed with KhaazRa MaaRanu from <a href="http://">www.dpeeps.com</a><a href="http://www.dpeeps.com"> </a>and <a href="http://www.holisticperspective.net/">www.holisticperspective.net</a> to get his insight on the topic of &quot;gene mutation&quot;. KhaazRa breaks it down into common terms so we can all understand the importance of this topic. The Hip Hop War Report is dedicated to keeping the public informed with truth. In order to enjoy a healthy life we have to change our eating habits and at least recognize what is bad for our bodies. We start this podcast with great words from the world renowned journalist and political prisoner, Mumia Abu Jamal. Mumia weighs in on the topic of global warming. This piece is titled the &quot;Planets Death Row&quot;. Please take time to listen to the facts and truth about this very serious problem.<br/><br/>I would like to give you this information passed on to me by a War Report correspondent, Da Da the Goldenchild. Its a comparison between WATER and COKE. You be the judge!<br/><br/>WATER<br/>#1. 75% of Americans are chronically dehydrated.<br/>(Likely applies to half the world population.)
<br/>#2. In 37% of Americans, the thirst mechanism is so weak that it is mistaken for hunger.<br/>#3. Even MILD dehydration will slow down one's metabolism as 3%.<br/>#4.
One glass of water will shut down midnight hunger pangs for almost 100%
of the dieters studied in a University of Washington study.
<br/>#5. Lack of water, is the #1 trigger of daytime fatigue.<br/>#6.
Preliminary research indicates that 8-10 glasses of water a day could
significantly ease back and joint pain for up to 80% of sufferers.<br/>#7.
A mere 2% drop in body water can trigger fuzzy short-term memory,
trouble with basic math, and difficulty focusing on the computer screen
or on a printed page.
<br/>#8. Drinking 5 glasses of water daily decreases the risk of colon
cancer by 45%, plus it can slash the risk of breast cancer by 79%., and
one is 50% less likely to develop bladder cancer. Are you drinking the
amount of water you should drink every day?
<br/><br/>COKE<br/>#1. In many states the highway patrol carries two
gallons of Coke in the trunk to remove blood from the highway after a
car accident.<br/>#2. You can put a T-bone steak in a bowl of Coke and it will be gone in two days.
<br/>#3. To clean a toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl
and let the &quot;real thing&quot; sit for one hour, then flush clean. The citric
acid in Coke removes stains from vitreous china.<br/>#4. To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers:
<br/>Rub the bumper with a rumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in Coca-Cola.<br/>#5. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion.
<br/>#6. To loosen a rusted bolt: Apply a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several minutes.<br/>#7.
To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking pan, wrap
the ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before ham is
finished, remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke
for a sumptuous brown gravy.
<br/>#8. To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of Coke into the
load of greasy clothes, add detergent, and run through a regular cycle.
The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road
haze from your windshield.
<br/><br/>FOR YOUR INFORMATION:<br/>#1. The active ingredient in Coke is
phosphoric acid. It will dissolve a nail in about four days. Phosphoric
acid also leaches calcium from bones and is a major contributor to the
rising increase of osteoporosis.
<br/>#2. To carry Coca-Cola syrup (the concentrate) the commercial
trucks must use a hazardous Material place cards reserved for highly
corrosive materials.<br/>#3. The distributors of Coke have been using it to clean engines of the trucks for about 20 years!
<br/><br/>Now the question is, would you like a glass of water? or Coke?<br/><br/>For more information about this podcast click these links: (If the links are not working please cut and paste)<br/>Please also visit KhaazRa's new website <a href="http://www.holisticperspective.net" title="holisticperspective.net">www.holisticperspective.net</a><br/><br/><a href="http://www.dpeeps.com" title="dpeeps.com">www.dpeeps.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.prisonradio.org" title="prisonradio.org">www.prisonradio.org</a><br/><a href="http://www.freemumia.com" title="freemumia.com">www.freemumia.com</a><br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Welcome to another episode of the Hip Hop War Report. Today's episode
features interviews JR, the Minister of Information, from the Block
Report.&nbsp; JR interviews Flava Flav and Chuck D. from the world renowned
hip hop group, &quot;Public Enemy&quot;.&nbsp; JR and Flava Flav discuss the legacy of
&quot;Public Enemy&quot;, as well as Stanley &quot;Tookie&quot; Williams and Flav's reality
show.<br/>The second segment features our independent artists
spotlight.&nbsp; Today's spotlight will feature Brooklyn's own DaDa the
Golden Child.&nbsp; This interview will be conducted by Akir.&nbsp; In this
interview Akir and Golden Child discuss the collaborative effort known
as The Reavers.&nbsp; The Reavers is a group comprised of eleven independent
hip-hop artists from across the nation.&nbsp; The Reavers' album is an
incredible effort boasting many great names such as:&nbsp; Golden Child,
Hasan Salaam, Akir, Billy Woods, Karniege, Keith Masters and
Priviledge, just to name a few.<br/>The Reavers first single is entitled
&quot;The Slums&quot;and was produced by Golden Child.&nbsp; &quot;The Slums&quot; is a
recording reality that delves into the lives of people in the hood.&nbsp;
The emcees performing on this song express their views, good and bad,
about the places where we dwell.&nbsp; &quot;The Slums&quot; communicates how the
people in the hood fight back.&nbsp; The creative lyricism displayed on &quot;The
Slums&quot; illustrates how the poor neighborhoods and projects were
designed as traps.&nbsp; These traps keep people contained in a distressed
state and fighting amongst themselves despite what the media may tell
us.&nbsp; We highly recommend The Reavers' album &quot;Terror Firma&quot;.<br/>They go
on to discuss DaDa the Golden Child's hip-hop/reggae band &quot;Plan B&quot;.&nbsp;
Akir and Golden Child talk about how progressive hip-hop is becoming as
it pertains to the live show.&nbsp; Golden Child also discusses the Original
Sessions' Band Showcase, in which Plan B is currently involved.&nbsp; We are
also pleased to announce that Golden Child will be a new correspondent
for the Hip Hop War Report.<br/>Finally, this episode concludes with an
interview between JR and Chuck D, in which they discuss independent
labels and freelance media.&nbsp; Chuck D expresses his opinion on the
record industry vs. the music business.<br/><br/><a href="http://">www.myspace.com/dadathegoldenchild</a><br/><a href="http://www.sonicbids.com/goldenchild">www.sonicbids.com/goldenchild</a><br/><a href="http://www.oneenterprises.com">www.oneenterprises.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/blockreportradio">www.myspace.com/blockreportradio</a><br/><a href="http://www.publicenemy.com">www.publicenemy.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.myspace.com/thereavers">www.myspace.com/thereavers</a><br type="_moz"/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Thank you for tuning in for this special edition of the Hip Hop War Report. Today is a double episode that features new music from AKIR in memory of Sean Bell who was murdered on his wedding day by the NYPD. <br/><br/>HIP HOP WAR REPORT EPISODE 7.1<br/>

<p class="MsoNormal">POCC: Block Report Radio interview political prisoner Mumia
Abu Jamal </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal">Hip Hop War Report Correspondent
Minister of Information JR of POCC: Block Report Radio interviewed Black
Panther political prisoner Mumia Abu Jamal about the 25<sup>th</sup> year of
his unjust incarceration, as well as, the 40th Anniversary of the founding of
the Black Panther Party.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal">During the interview, he gives his
opinion on Black Panthers who are still in the battle for human right and self
determination, as well as, on those that have “retired? from the Movement. He
talks about how he believes conditions in the poorest parts of Black Amerikkka
have gotten progressively worst than they were in the 60’s. Mumia also goes
into the mainstream media’s portrayal of the Party, and how it’s coverage was
not surprising, and how leftwing authors including Charles Jones’ “The Black
Panther Party Reconsidered?, and his own book “We Want Freedom? have done a lot
to “open up perspectives?. </p>


<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal">Mumia gives his reflections on the
late great cofounder of the Black Panther Party, Minister of Defense Huey P.
Newton, as well as his opinion on the relevance of the Black Panthers 10 Point
Platform today, in the Black community. Mumia goes on to discuss how it is “as
important as life or death? for journalist to cover stories that aren’t being
covered as well as offer a progressive opinion to stories that are being picked
up by the mainstream. He discusses the war of terrorism in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and how
the media pushed people into supporting a bogus war among other things.</p>


<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal">It is important that listeners of
the Hip Hop War Report and POCC: Block Report Radio support the unconditional
release of political prisoner Mumia Abu Jamal, recognizing that he is one of
the most revolutionary and articulate voices in the media, of our generation,
as well as, his so-called trial was plagued with unfairness, including the
refusal to admit the confession of Arnold Beverly into evidence, the dismissing
of potential Black jurors simply because they were Black, police coercion of
witnesses, and ballistic tests that state that the caliber of the bullet that
killed Faulkner was not the same caliber of bullets that fit Mumia’s gun, among
other things. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Deputy
Minister of Culture Jocelyn of POCC: Block Report Radio interviews a number of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Oakland</st1:place></st1:city> high school
students on why they’re organizing a benefit basketball tournament for
political prisoner Mumia Abu Jamal. During this interview, the students talk
about the injustices in Mumia’s trial, the need for people to come out and
support the basketball tournament, and Mumia, because if this injustice
happened, “it could happen to anybody, it could happen to you, it could happen
to me?. They also explained that the basketball tournament will be happening on
December 10<sup>th ‘06</sup>, at <st1:placename w:st="on">Poplar</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype w:st="on">Park</st1:placetype> in <st1:place w:st="on">West

Team, Mistah F.A.B., the Pack, Team Thunder, and more. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This particular segment of POCC: Block Report Radio was put
on the Hip Hop War Report podcast, because we believe that it is important for
youngsters to take interest and action, in issues that are facing their
communities, realizing that in most cases it is the young people who create
change in any given society. We hope that this inspires young and older people
alike to get educated and involved in freeing Black political prisoners in this
country. It is our social responsibility, especially because Mumia Abu Jamal,
and others fought for our rights, when a majority of us, weren’t even fighting
for our own rights. Free All Political Prisoners!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u><span><font size="3">&nbsp;</font></span></u></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Hip Hop War Report Correspondent Minister of Information JR of the POCC: Block Report Radio interviewed Chairman Fred Hampton Jr about the importance of the “POCC’s Long Live the Legacy? as well as the 40<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the Black Panther Party. The tour had many stops including <city w:st="on">Oakland</city>, <city w:st="on">Berkeley</city>, <city w:st="on"><place w:st="on">San Francisco</place></city>, and NYC. Chairman Fred goes on to explain the strategy behind some of the organizing that the Black Panthers were doing like the “Free Breakfast? program and the stop sign campaign. He talked about how he, like Tookie Williams, grew up in a climate where “you could either a boy scout or a banger?, not a freedom fighter, in the absence of a freedom fighting organization like the Black Panther Party, which gave the people the vehicle to fight back in our own interest. Chairman Fred says that he dedicates his life, as well as the life of the organization, the Prisoners of Conscience Committee, to making sure that nobody in our community has to grow up in that climate again. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He related how the Black Panther Party’s mission was to demonstrate for the people, so that they could take up the campaigns to fight in their own interest such as the street sign campaign in the 60’s, and he related it to how right now in ’06, youngsters again started getting hit by cars on that same exact corner in North Oakland, and in the spirit of the Black Panther Party, the people took it upon themselves to create stop signs where they thought that they should be.

<p>Welcome to the UNDERWORLD MIX CD brought to you exclusively by Turntable Anihilists. The UNDERWORLD is not just a mix tape, it is a constant smack in the face that 'HIP HOP&quot; is still alive. We say UNDERWORLD because our underground music has turned into a world of possibilities. We are the people of the streets, the emcee's radio's fear. We do not hide the truth. We speak loud and proud. For some emcee's the UNDERWORLD is the only place they will ever be heard. For others it is a launching pad for they're career to be. The UNDERWORLD is the one place that can take you into the future and bring you back to where you started. The UNDERWORLD for us is who we are where we live and how we talk. Just like hip hop it was created by us the people of the ghetto. The UNDERWORLD allows emcee's from everywhere to come together as one and represent hip hop at its purest form. As long as the music industry keeps supporting garbage music, the UNDERWORLD will always be alive in the hearts of real hip hop heads everywhere. If you are tired of the music you continually hear come join the under UNDERWORLD world project. This is a movement created and supported by the people for the people.<br/><br/>To book DJ GI JOE contact him at :</p>

This is a bill that will give major music and other media conglomerates such as phone and internet companies the&nbsp;power to regulate the speed of artist websites, search-engines and music downloads sites.

<p>Davey D. discusses how internets speeds in many other countries including South Africa and Beirut are 50 to 100 times faster than in America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Davey D. talks about congressman Bobby Rush and the &quot;C.O.P.E. act&quot; Also how the music industry, media and telecommunications companies are working together to stack the deck against indie artist and other competitors</p>
