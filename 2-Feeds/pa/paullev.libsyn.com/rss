	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Welcome to Light On Light Through,      Episode  81 - 15 minutes of clear, cogent analysis from me about why MSNBC was dead wrong to suspend Keith Olbermann.&nbsp; Well, I'll leave it to you to judge whether my analysis is clear and cogent, but the long and the short of it is, although I've found fault with Olbermann's over-the-top denunciations of everyone from Hillary Clinton to Bill O'Reilly to Jack Bauer, his suspension from MSNBC is based on the dangerous and foolish myth that news commentators are supposed to be "objective," and not connected in any way to those they may interview.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">I had first come to know Patrick after his review of Rhino Handmade's <em>Come to the Sunshine</em> compilation CD in 2005 - the CD has my group The Other Voices (aka The New Outlook) singing "Hung Up On Love," a song I wrote with Mikie Harris, produced by Ellie Greenwich &amp; Mike Rashkow, and released on Atlantic Records in 1968.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">Patrick played "Hung Up On Love" and a dozen other recordings that I wrote, sang, produced (or all three) on our show in 2006.&nbsp; As a special coda, I performed my new song, "Lime Streets," for the very first time at the end of the show.&nbsp; I had written it just a month before the interview. Patrick was good enough to lend me his daughter's cool little keyboard for my rendition - it was my only instrumentation, so I was practically unplugged.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">A complete list of the songs played on the show follows.&nbsp; Patrick has a nice 'n' easy interview style, and I really had a good time.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">Among the secrets revealed for the first time on the show:&nbsp; <strong>how Ed Fox and I wrote "The Lama Will Be Late This Year" (and who, exactly, was 'Hawaiian Herb'?) . . . .the real reason that jazz-man Boris Midney left the Soviet  Union&nbsp; . . . what song got in the way of The Vogues releasing their recording of my song, "Unbelieavable (Inconceivable You)", on Reprise Records? . . . . and how old was Linda Kaplan when she wrote "Skyscraper" with me in the late 1960s? ( well, a lot younger than when she later wrote the famous "Toys 'R Jingle" . . . . "I don't wanna grow up . . . .")</strong></span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Welcome to Light On Light Through, Episode 79, in  which you will hear the complete 65-minute interview Patrick Rands did with me about my music, in June 2006.&nbsp; &nbsp;I drove up to WZBC Radio studios outside of Boston on a beautiful early  summer afternoon for the interview by Partick Rands on his "Test  Patterns" radio show on WZBC (Boston College) Radio.&nbsp; With my 1972 LP, Twice Upon a Rhyme, re-issued in mini-CD by Big Pink/Beatball Records in December 2008, and to be re-issued in a vinyl re-pressing by Whiplash/Sound of Salvation Records in November 2010, I thought this interview, in which Patrick played 14 of my songs (many rarely heard before) to be especially significant.&nbsp;&nbsp; A complete playlist and links to the music on the Web follow below ...
   
I had first come to know Patrick after his review of Rhino Handmade's Come to the Sunshine compilation CD in 2005 - the CD has my group The Other Voices (aka The New Outlook) singing "Hung Up On Love," a song I wrote with Mikie Harris, produced by Ellie Greenwich &amp; Mike Rashkow, and released on Atlantic Records in 1968.
&nbsp;
Patrick played "Hung Up On Love" and a dozen other recordings that I wrote, sang, produced (or all three) on our show in 2006.&nbsp; As a special coda, I performed my new song, "Lime Streets," for the very first time at the end of the show.&nbsp; I had written it just a month before the interview. Patrick was good enough to lend me his daughter's cool little keyboard for my rendition - it was my only instrumentation, so I was practically unplugged.
&nbsp;
A complete list of the songs played on the show follows.&nbsp; Patrick has a nice 'n' easy interview style, and I really had a good time.
&nbsp;
Among the secrets revealed for the first time on the show:&nbsp; how Ed Fox and I wrote "The Lama Will Be Late This Year" (and who, exactly, was 'Hawaiian Herb'?) . . . .the real reason that jazz-man Boris Midney left the Soviet  Union&nbsp; . . . what song got in the way of The Vogues releasing their recording of my song, "Unbelieavable (Inconceivable You)", on Reprise Records? . . . . and how old was Linda Kaplan when she wrote "Skyscraper" with me in the late 1960s? ( well, a lot younger than when she later wrote the famous "Toys 'R Jingle" . . . . "I don't wanna grow up . . . .")

   
And the playlight is as follows:
&nbsp;
1. No Olympian Height(s) - recorded by The Other Voices (The New Outlook), Paul Levinson, Stu Nitekman, Ira Margolis (Stu singing lead), song written by Brute Force, produced by Ellie Greenwich &amp; Mike Rashkow, 2nd single released on Atlantic, 1968
&nbsp;
2. Hung Up On Love - recorded by The Other Voices (The New Outlook) - Paul Levinson, Stu Nitekman, Ira Margolis (but Mike Rashkow singing lead) - song written by Paul Levinson &amp; Mikie Harris, produced by Ellie Greenwich &amp; Mike Rashkow, B-side of both May My Heart Be Cast Into Stone, and No Olympian Heights, singles released on Atlantic, 1968 (included on Rhino's Come to the Sunshine CD, 2004)
&nbsp;
3. Picture Postcard World - recorded by The Definitive Rock Chorale - studio group with Ellie Greenwich, Toni Wine, Ron Dante, etc - song written by Paul Levinson, produced by Ellie Greenwich &amp; Mike Rashkow, released on Decca, 1968
&nbsp;
4. Unbelievable (Inconceivable You) - recorded by The Vogues - song written by Paul Levinson, produced by Dick Glasser for Reprise, 1968, but never released
&nbsp;
5. Sunshine Mind - recorded by Donna Marie (who sang in the Archies) - song written by Paul Levinson, produced by Jimmy "Wiz" Wisner, released on Columbia, 1968
&nbsp;
6. Love Colored Glasses - studio demo recorded by Mikie Harris, written by Paul Levinson &amp; Mikie Harris, 1968
&nbsp;
7. Teacups and Tapestry - studio demo (artist unknown), written by Paul Levinson and Boris Midney, 1969
&nbsp;
8. Skyscraper - studio demo by Linda Kaplan (later wrote "Toys 'R U" jingle), written by Paul Levinson &amp; Linda Kaplan, 1968
&nbsp;
9. Ring Around My Rosie - recorded by Protozoa - song written by David Fox, produced by Paul Levinson, Ed Fox, and Herb Abramson, Buddah Records, 1969
&nbsp;
10. Merri- Goes-Round - recorded by Trousers (studio group; Bruce Scott singing lead) - written by Paul Levinson &amp; Ed Fox, produced by Paul Levinson &amp; Ed Fox, released on Wizdom Records, 1969
&nbsp;
11. Not Yet Ready to Say Goodbye - recorded by Paul Levinson, with Ed Fox and Peter Rosenthal (Paul singing lead) - written by Paul Levinson &amp; Linda Kaplan, produced by Paul Levinson &amp; Ed Fox, released on Twice Upon A Rhyme LP, HappySad Records, 1972 (musicians on this album also include Don Frankel, Jay Sackett, Alan Fuhr, Boris Midney)
&nbsp;
12. The Lama Will Be Late This Year - recorded by Paul Levinson, with Ed Fox and Peter Rosenthal (Ed singing lead) - written by Paul Levinson &amp; Ed Fox, produced by Paul Levinson &amp; Ed Fox, released on Twice Upon A Rhyme LP, HappySad Records, 1972 (musicians on this album also include Don Frankel, Jay Sackett, Alan Fuhr, Boris Midney)
&nbsp;
13. Alpha Centauri - recorded by Peter Rosenthal (home demo) - written by Paul Levinson &amp; Peter Rosenthal, 2000
&nbsp;
14. Lime Streets - live performance by Paul Levinson, written by Paul Levinson, 2006
&nbsp;
&nbsp;And you'll also hear nice medley of New Outlook folk rock under some of the interview near the beginning...

We talk about the capacity of a coin to capture the past and bring it to millions, how Victor David Brenner persuaded Theodore Roosevelt to commission a new Lincoln Penny back at the beginning of the 20th century, and how Joel envisioned this scene and rescued it from the oblivion of the past in a brand new lithograph.&nbsp;&nbsp; This interview will be of special interest to historians, artists, coin collectors, and all students of communication and technology, and how this affects our psyches and our world...</span></span></span></span></span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Welcome to Light On Light Through, Episode 66:&nbsp; Robert J. Sawyer Talks About FlashForward .... With less than a week to go until the premiere of FlashForward on ABC Television on September 24, 2009, 8 pm Eastern time - based on Rob Sawyer's novel of the very same name - I was delighted to catch Rob on the phone in Toronto for this sage, penetrating interview in which Rob reveals what it feels like to be on the verge of having his novel seen on screens around the world in this ABC series.&nbsp; Rob takes us through the steps of moving from novel to screen, his admiration for the stellar cast, his clear vision of possible future paths for his FlashForward novel universe, at a time when everyone will be coming to know the slightly different story in the television series, and much more.&nbsp; Whether you're a writer with dreams of seeing of your words on the screen, or a fan of great science fiction is this new golden age of television, this is the interview you'll always remember.Links:

In the Fall of 2007, I sat down for an interview by Mark Molaro, for his popular Internet TV show, The Alcove.&nbsp;&nbsp; His guests have included Arianna Huffington, Carl Bernstein, Campbell Brown, and other notables.&nbsp; Mark and I talked for 20 minutes about the future of media, the impact of new media on everything from politics to television shows such as Mad Men, to my view that &quot;information overload&quot; is really &quot;information underload,&quot; or lack of vital navigational information.&nbsp;&nbsp; This interview was the first time I publicly started talking about New New Media, the subject of my forthcoming book (to be published by Pearson, Allyn &amp; Bacon in the Summer 2009).&nbsp; You can see the interview on television via the link or YouTube screen below.&nbsp; Or, if more convenient, or you'd like to listen while running, walking, or driving, you an listen to the major excerpt presented in this podcast...Helpful links:Mark Molaro's interview with me on The Alcove - full videoThe complete Alcove series of interviewsMore details on New New Media&nbsp; The Soft Edge ...

Lost, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Journeyman, Battlestar Galactica, and Heroes...Plus flashes&nbsp;... mostly about the continuing Obama revolution, and a little about John &quot;Palpatine&quot; McCain...Helpful links:my blog reviews of Lost, Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Journeyman, Battlestar Galactica, and Heroes... just about every episode ... all at http://InfiniteRegress.tvmy infamous Only Idiots Don't Watch Television ... first published under the more innocuous title of &quot;TV's New Golden Age&quot; in Newsday in July 2006my political commentary on Barack Obama and the Presidential campaigns ... also at http://InfiniteRegress.tvlisten for a special audio clip of David S.

Analog published 10 of my stories in the 1990s, and helped establish me as a science fiction writer.&nbsp;&nbsp; This interview was not only a real pleasure for me to conduct, but I suspect will be a source for years to come of invaluable information and insight for anyone who aspires to being a published short-fiction science fiction writer ... Plus flashes&nbsp;... The Plot to Save Journeyman - that is, three chances to win free copies of The Plot to Save Socrates, just by watching the next episodes of NBC's Journeyman!&nbsp;&nbsp; (Note added in 2008: The contest ended in 2007.)
Here's a list of all my science ficiton stories (and two fact articles) published in Analog to date (updated November 2011):&nbsp;

			<title>Another Network Undercuts the Results of its Own Post-Debate Presidential Poll - This Time, MSNBC about Barack Obama</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<br/>The networks continue to denigrate the results of their own post-debate polls-<br/><br/>Last night, Chris
Matthews mentioned on MSNBC's <span style="font-style: italic;">Hardball</span> that Barack Obama won the
poll that MSNBC conducted after the Democratic Presidential debate on
Tuesday-<br/><br/>To which Chuck Todd, MSNBC's &quot;official&quot; pollster
replied - that poll was done with cell phones, via which Obama's
supporters could keep pounding the call keys...<br/><br/>To which Matthews responded - like in the 1936 <span style="font-style: italic;">Literary Digest</span> poll...<br/><br/>To which I would respond:<br/><br/>No, Chris, not like that 1936 poll at all, which was supposed to be a poll of a randomly selected part of the voting population, but was skewed or biased because it was conducted from lists of automobile owners and people who had telephones in their homes, and only very rich people had those luxuries in those days, so the <span style="font-style: italic;">Literary Digest</span> poll wrongly showed the Democrat FDR losing...<br/><br/>Which
has nothing in common with MSNBC's post-election poll - except that it,
too, was conducted by phone. But it was never designed as a randomly
conducted poll.<br/><br/>What Chris should have said to Chuck Todd was:&nbsp; wrong, callers can't cast votes more than once on the same phone...&nbsp; Or, if by some bizarre chance they could, then simply install a program on your vote-reception software which would make it impossible for anyone to cast a vote more than once on the same cell phone.<br/><br/>Very easy, really - and certainly preferable to encouraging viewers to vote in your poll, and the undercutting the results.<br/><br/>Well,
at least Ron Paul now has company - now Obama's supporters, like Ron
Paul's, are discounted because they participate in a poll that a
network conducts, and then expresses no confidence in because they
don't like the results.<br/><br/>=============<br/><a href="http://blip.tv/file/446915">My 50-minute lecture</a> about network after-debate polls and the media's misreporting of Ron Paul, delivered to my class at Fordham University<br type="_moz"/>]]></description>

			<title>Colmes Mends Ways About Misreporting Ron Paul; Hannity Recalcitrant</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/colmes_mends_ways_about_misreporting_ron_paul_hannity_recalcitrant]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;<br/>The universe is finally behaving as it should be. You may recall that <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/09/hannity-colmes-denigrate-ron-pauls.html">after the last Republican Presidential debate</a> on Fox, Hannity &amp; Colmes - who disagree about just about everything - were united in their certainty that Ron Paul's first place finish in Fox's after-debate phone-in text poll was some kind of fix - multiple dialing by the same people, to be exact, even though Fox had wisely made that option not possible.<br/><br/>Hannity was up to his same tricks tonight - braying that Ron Paul's first place finish was &quot;stacked&quot;. Whereas Colmes, to his credit, calmly said he was reporting the results. As was the case last time, Hannity didn't bother to offer any evidence.<br/><br/>You can see this all in this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDwDIj5ahuY">YouTube clip</a>. Also sweet is the way Hannity has the gall to complain to Ron Paul that Hannity gets booed by Ron Paul supporters when Hannity gives speeches.<br/><br/>Booed? Hannity should count his lucky stars that he continues to have a microphone. I certainly would never hire anyone with such a poor standard of truth and evidence to teach courses in a department in which I was Chair.</p>

			<title>Question on My Midterm Exam About Ron Paul and Mass Media Mistreatment</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/question_on_my_midterm_exam_about_ron_paul_and_mass_media_mistreatment]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>As you know, I devoted 50-minutes of my Intro to
Communication and Media Studies class last month at Fordham University
to a lecture about the mass media's mistreatment of Ron Paul. Although
Ron Paul is now getting much more media attention, the mistreatment
continues - as evidenced, to give just one example, of <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/10/open-letter-to-cnbc-about-taking-down.html">CNBC's taking down of a post-debate poll</a>
which Ron Paul won - and this means that people who value our
democratic system need to continue to keep a wary eye on our media, and
call them out when necessary.<br/><br/>You can see the <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/10/my-sept-28-2007-lecture-at-fordham.html">video of my lecture here</a>.<br/><br/>I
thought you also might be interested in a question I gave my Intro to
Comm and Media Studies class today, as part of their midterm exam:<br/><br/></p>

<blockquote>1.
Consider Ron Paul’s Presidential campaign the Source of communication.
Using the Shannon-Weaver model, explain all the steps that the campaign
must go through, in order to reach its Destination, the American
people. Make sure you address each step in the process, as well as what
can (and did) go wrong in the process, and possible remedies for
addressing this. (Option: If you like to do this analysis for another
Presidential candidate, that would be acceptable, but make sure you
have specific examples to present.)</blockquote><br/><br/>The exam was open book, and the students had a choice of questions.  I don't know yet how many chose to answer this one.<br/><br/>The
crux of the correct answer was that the media misreporting of Ron Paul
constitutes noise in the Channel, and the best way of remedying that is
providing feedback - meaning, let the media and the world know that
such misreporting is unacceptable.<br/><br/>I'll keep you posted on how my students do on this question (without, of course, revealing any names.)]]></description>

			<title>Modest Proposal:  Why Not Support the Best Candidates in Each of the Two Parties?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/modest_proposal_why_not_support_the_best_candidates_in_each_of_the_two_parties_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<br/><span style="font-style: italic;">I wrote the following on another blog back in March.&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of the growing number of Ron Paul supporters - people who believe we should take the Constitution and its restrictions on government seriously - and Al Gore's winning the Nobe Prize yesterday,&nbsp; my modest proposal that we should work to support the best candidates in each of the two major parties seems more viable and relevant than ever...</span><br/><br/>The approach most people take to Presidential elections is, pick a
candidate - if you can - one candidate, and support him or her to the
hilt. If your candidate fails before getting the nomination, you may or
may not switch to another, and go through the same process.<br/><br/>If
your chosen candidate is a Democrat, you likely will have little real
interest in the Republicans, except to hope that they choose the
weakest person to run for office. And vice versa - if your favorite
candidate is a Republican, all you likely will care about regarding the
Democrats is what they can do, presumably unintentionally, to help your
Republican candidate win.<br/><br/>But does this approach get the best out of our democracy?<br/><br/>I'm
trying something a little different this time around. I am going to try
to pick my favorites in both the Democratic and the Republican fields,
and do whatever little I can to help them get nominated. If I'm lucky
enough to see both nominated, I'll then decide whom to vote for in the
general election.<br/><br/>So far, here are my favorites, and why:<br/><br/><strong>Democratic Party</strong>:<br/><br/><em>Al Gore</em>:
pluses: his election would correct the deep injustice of the 2000
election, he was anti-Iraq-war from the beginning, he is genuinely
interested in science to improve our human condition; minuses: I'm
concerned that he may be in favor of Congress's crackdown on
&quot;indecency,&quot; given his wife Tipper's history on this issue<br/><br/><em>Barack Obama</em>:
pluses: he was anti-Iraq-war from the beginning, he would bring a
Kennedy-esque youthful vitality to the White House, it would be healthy
for America to have an African-American President; minuses: not enough
experience, and untested on many issues<br/><br/>*<em>John Edwards</em>: see below for note added on April 21, in which I've including Edwards in my Democratic favorites<br/><br/><strong>Republican Party</strong>:<br/><br/><em>Ron Paul</em>:
pluses: he was anti-Iraq-war from the beginning (and, better than Gore
and Obama, was in office at the time, and voted against the war
resolutions), he is a vigorous defender of the Constitution and the
First Amendment, he is an opponent of government censorship, he's in
favor of private enterprise in space (so is Gore); minuses: he's in
favor of states (but not the Federal government) banning abortion (I'm
in favor of a women's right to choose), an opponent of gun control (I
agree that the Second Amendment is consistent with Paul's position -
I'm in favor of amending it), urged US neutrality in Israeli-Hezbollah
war.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>So, there you have it. I currently consider
myself a supporter of all three candidates. Regarding Gore and Obama, I
would certainly be happy with a Democratic ticket that had them both
(Gore for Pres, Obama for VP), and I would be happy with a ticket that
had either for President. Regarding Ron Paul: at this point, there is
no other Republican even remotely as good, in my view.<br/><br/>Regarding
the minuses for all three candidates: I'll keep researching their
positions and records, and of course be on the look-out for new
developments. And I'll also be open to any new candidates, or to any
dramatic shifts in all of the candidates currently in the field, but
I'm not holding my breath for either.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>*Added 21 April 2007 - <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/04/john-edwards-favorite-book.html">John Edwards' Favorite Book</a>
is I. F. Stone's The Trial of Socrates. If find this so impressive -

			<title>Open Letter to CNBC Managing Editor: Apologize to American People about Your Taking Down of Ron Paul Poll, or Resign</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/open_letter_to_cnbc_managing_editor_apologize_to_american_people_about_your_taking_down_of_ron_paul_poll_or_resign]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<span>To</span>: Allen Wastler<br/>Managing Editor, CNBC.com <br/><br/><span>From</span>: Paul Levinson, PhD<br/>Professor &amp; Chair, Department of Communication and Media Studies<br/>Fordham University, NYC<br/><br/><span>re</span>: your <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/21257762">An Open Letter to the Ron Paul Faithful</a> of October 11, in which you explain why you took down your poll, conducted after the Michigan Republican Presidential debate, and featured on your web site<br/><br/>1. You invite comments and response to your Open Letter, and provide an e-mail address. Since your action is, in my view, a matter of great public concern, I am not only e-mailing this response to you, but publishing it in my InfiniteRegress.tv blog and here on LightonLightThrough.<br/><br/>2. I am not one of the &quot;Ron Paul Faithful&quot;. Although I greatly admire many of his positions, especially his support of our Constitution, I have not yet endorsed any candidate, and am indeed on record as urging Americans to support the best candidate in each of our two main parties, so as to give us the best choice in the general election. You are welcome to see my <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/03/something-new-how-about-we-look-for.html">How About We Look for the Best Candidate in =Both= Parties</a> for details.<br/><br/>2a. I am writing to you, therefore, as a professor, scholar, and observer of media and politics, with a keen interest in seeing the press serve our democracy as Thomas Jefferson and our Founding Fathers intended - that is, by providing us with the truth wherever possible.<br/><br/>3. Let me now address the issues you raise in your Open Letter:<br/><br/>You write that &quot;these Internet polls are admittedly unscientific and subject to hacking&quot;.<br/><br/>True, but the &quot;scientific&quot; polls - the ones that rely on random sampling - are subject to error, as well. See, for example, the famous poll that predicted that FDR would lose the 1936&nbsp;Presidential election.<br/><br/>Also, while the Internet may indeed be subject to hacking, do you have any proof that hacking took place in this case? You further say that your &quot;poll was either hacked or the target of a campaign&quot;. Again, your proof?<br/><br/>You further say that &quot;[t]he next day, our email basked was flooded with Ron Paul support messages. And the computer logs showed the poll had been hit with traffic from Ron Paul chat sites. I learned other Internet polls that night had been hit in similar fashion.&quot;<br/><br/>None of the above actions are &quot;hacking&quot;. You owe Ron Paul's supporters and the American people an apology.<br/><br/>Indeed, the fact that the polls reflected votes &quot;from Ron Paul chat sites&quot; does not even support your conclusion that your poll was &quot;the target of a campaign&quot; - conceivably some of the votes that came from the sites could have come from people who had come to the sites, impressed by what they saw of Ron Paul in the debate, and then went on to cast their votes in your poll. Does that sound to you like &quot;a campaign&quot;?<br/><br/>You further say that Ron Paul's supporters, presumably including anyone who voted for Ron Paul in your poll, &quot;also ruined the purpose of the poll. It was no longer an honest 'show of hands' -- it suddenly was a platform for beating the Ron Paul drum.&quot;<br/><br/>What do you suppose influences public opinion in any election campaign? What is your definition of an &quot;honest show of hands&quot;? Is a potential voter who expresses support for a candidate, because that potential voter already liked that candidate prior to a given debate, somehow not &quot;honest&quot;? If what you wanted to measure in your poll was how previously undecided people felt about the performance of candidates in the debate, why did you not say so in your poll, and devise some way of measuring this? (For example, trying to identify a sample of undecided voters beforehand, and then asking them for their preferences after the debate?)<br/><br/>Instead, you conclude your Open Letter with the following: &quot;When a well-organized and committed 'few' can throw the results of a system meant to reflect the sentiments of 'the many,' I get a little worried. I'd take it down again.&quot;<br/><br/>Again, you offer no evidence whatsoever that anything in the poll was &quot;thrown,&quot; and you similarly offer no evidence about how &quot;few&quot; of the &quot;many&quot; were composed of Ron Paul supporters.<br/><br/>Indeed, you offer no evidence of anything, really - just supposition and innuendo - and that gets me more than a little worried, about your competence and capacity to be Managing Editor of CNBC.com's website.<br/><br/>If something needs to be &quot;taken down,&quot; it may well be your position as Managing Editor.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[To: Allen WastlerManaging Editor, CNBC.com From: Paul Levinson, PhDProfessor &amp; Chair, Department of Communication and Media StudiesFordham University, NYCre: your An Open Letter to the Ron Paul Faithful of October 11, in which you explain why you took down your poll, conducted after the Michigan Republican Presidential debate, and featured on your web site1. You invite comments and response to your Open Letter, and provide an e-mail address. Since your action is, in my view, a matter of great public concern, I am not only e-mailing this response to you, but publishing it in my InfiniteRegress.tv blog and here on LightonLightThrough.2. I am not one of the &quot;Ron Paul Faithful&quot;. Although I greatly admire many of his positions, especially his support of our Constitution, I have not yet endorsed any candidate, and am indeed on record as urging Americans to support the best candidate in each of our two main parties, so as to give us the best choice in the general election. You are welcome to see my How About We Look for the Best Candidate in =Both= Parties for details.2a. I am writing to you, therefore, as a professor, scholar, and observer of media and politics, with a keen interest in seeing the press serve our democracy as Thomas Jefferson and our Founding Fathers intended - that is, by providing us with the truth wherever possible.3.

			<title>Ron Paul Makes the Only Worthy Point in the CNBC Republican Debate</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/ron_paul_makes_the_only_worthy_point_in_the_cnbc_republican_debate]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<br/>Here are some of the highlights and lowlights in the
Republican Presidential debate which concluded a fw hours ago in
Michigan. It was on CNBC, and will repeated tonight at 9pm on MSNBC:<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic;">Fred Thompson</span>:
started out nearly comatose, and then settled in. But he's fuzzy on
most of the issues, and looks like Dwight David Eisenhower on a bad
day. His best moment was responding to a pretty good crack by Romney,
about the Republican debates being like <span style="font-style: italic;">Law and Order</span>
- a big cast, and Fred Thompson comes in at the end. Thompson smiled
and said, pretty good, and I thought I was going to be the best actor
up here.<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic;">Mitt Romney</span>:
his response to whether the President needs to consult Congress before
going to war - Romney said he'd leave that to the attorneys - was one
of the lowest points, not only in this debate, but in American history,
period. (See Ron Paul's response to this, below.)<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic;">Rudy Giuliani</span>:
his response about whether the Internet required FCC-like cultural
policing was troubling, to say the last. He's not in favor of creating
new government agencies, but he might look into it, if the problem
doesn't subside. But, what's the problem? No one disputes the need of
police to go after predators, on and off line. The question was about
the &quot;cultural&quot; problems of the Internet (porn?) and what should be done
about that. A better answer would have been: &quot;The FCC is
unconstitutional even as a regulator of broadcasters. The last thing I
would do is extend its violation of the First Amendment to the
Internet.&quot; Too bad Ron Paul didn't get a chance to answer that
question. Fortunately, Ron Paul did get a chance to respond about the
President going to war...<br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic;">Ron Paul</span>:
his finest moment was his outrage over Romney's gibberish about
consulting attorneys. Read the Constitution, Ron Paul said - it clearly
says that Congress, not the President, has the power to declare war.<br/><br/>You don't need to be a lawyer to understand that.  You need to be just minimally literate.<br/><br/>Also
admirable was Ron Paul's unwillingness to blindly support whoever gets
the Republican nomination - that nominee would need to stop following
Bush's disastrous and unconstitutional foreign policy.<br/><br/>It's rare indeed to hear a political candidate in either party speak such plain truth to the American people, and to the world.<br/><br type="_moz"/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<br/>Sputnik celebrates its 50th anniversary this Thursday, October 4 - the first
artificial satellite to circle the planet. It was soon followed by
Sputnik 2 (dogs in space, 1958), first human in space (Yuri Gagarin,
1961), Telstar (first telecom satellite, 1962), and then we walked on the
Moon (Armstrong and Aldrin, 1969).<br/><p>Notice that I didn't say
Soviet or US above, because it doesn't really matter. Humans in space
is what counts. But everyone of course knows that Sputnik - Russian for
&quot;fellow traveler&quot; - set off the space race which we in the US
eventually &quot;won&quot; in 1969. Prior to then, Telstar was our only first
accomplishment.<br/><br/>And what did that victory get us? A space shuttle,
with brave astronauts, some of whom lost their lives. But no one has
gotten too far beyond this planet. We've sent robots to Mars, and
that's exciting, but robots neither laugh nor cry - they're not human.<br/><br/>And
so, as the 50th anniversary of Sputnik arrives, I can only hope that
we start doing a little better. Civilization is filled with examples of
major inventions that stayed dormant for centuries - even millennia.
The Chinese invention of the printing press in 700 or 800 AD, and its
failure to be used for a mass print and popular culture, is one of the
most vivid examples. (I wrote about this way back in 1977, in my essay,
&quot;Toy, Mirror, and Art: The Metamorphosis of Technological Culture&quot; - it
was reprinted in my 1995 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0963120395/ref=nosim/?tag=dexter2a-20">Learning Cyberspace</a> - and I'll try to post the essay here in the next few weeks.)<br/><br/>Let's not wait 700 more years to really get out into space.

			<title>Latest ABC Mistreatment of Ron Paul: I Intend to Include This in the Next Edition of My Textbook</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/latest_abc_mistreatment_of_ron_paul_i_intend_to_include_this_in_the_next_edition_of_my_textbook]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<br/>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freemarketnews.com/WorldNews.asp?nid=49633">Free Market News Network</a>
reports that WMUR neglected to cover Ron Paul at his &quot;Family Day&quot; rally
in Manchester, New Hampshire this past weekend. WMUR is a state-wide
television operation, with headquarters in Manchester.<br/><br/>What
struck me most about this was not the lack of coverage itself -
infuriating and undemocratic, as it is - but the fact that WMUR is an ABC
affiliate!<br/><br/>Just this past Friday, at the lecture I delivered to
my &quot;Intro to Communication and Media Studies&quot; class at Fordham
University (we'll have the video up on YouTube soon), I detailed a
series of outrageous ABC misreportings of Ron Paul since May - ranging
from leaving him out of poll results to publishing misleading photographs that made his
supporters seem far fewer at a rally in Iowa than they actually were.
But I concluded, in an effort to be fair, that ABC seems to have been
improving in the accuracy of its reporting lately, with Fox guilty of the
worst recent transgressions.<br/><br/>But here we are, once again, with a
national ABC television affiliate apparently up to the same old
business. If the Free Market News story is correct - and it's been up
online more than a day with no opposing comments offered - then ABC is
continuing to dig itself into a hole it may never get out of.<br/><br/>Because,
whatever happens in this election, the shameful performance of ABC News
at so many junctures - regarding mostly Ron Paul, but also, at least
once, Dennis Kucinich - will not be forgotten. Indeed, I expect it will
be a section in many textbooks about media and politics. I know I
certainly will be putting something about this in my next edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0415197724/ref=nosim/?tag=dexter2a-20">The Soft Edge: A Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution.</a><br/><br/>See <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/paullevinson/books.html#softedge">reviews of the most recent edition</a> of The Soft Edge.<br/><br type="_moz"/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span>I was delighted to hear Ron Paul say at the Republican Presidential debate on PBS that he is opposed to the Federal death penalty. He indicated that this was one of the few positions he changed his views about over the years - at one time, he supported the Federal death penalty - and his reason was that DNA evidence has shown too many innocent people found guilty.<br/><br/>My position has always been against death penalties on all levels. Even before DNA evidence, it seemed to me that juries are fallible, they are capable of error, and putting a person to death on the basis of a wrong jury decision was one of the very worst things a civilized society could ever do. Life in prison without parole was a strong enough punishment, and one which allowed reversal in the event that new evidence came to light or old evidence proved faulty.<br/><br/>As on so many other issues, the libertarian distrust that Ron Paul has of government, and his sheer logic, have led him to an enlightened, humanitarian position. My only disagreement with Ron Paul on this issue is that I would like to see capital punishment outlawed on a state level, too. </span></p>

			<title>Kucinich at Dem Debate:  &quot;I Would Give 16-Year Olds the Vote&quot;</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><br/>You see the Democratic Presidential Debate at Dartmouth last night? You gotta love Mike Gravel. Asked by Tim Russert how he could run for President and be trusted with the nation's fiscal responsibility, when he ran up a big unpaid debt, Gravel proudly shot back - hey, look who I stuck with that debt, I stuck the credit card companies with a $90,000 debt, and they deserved it!<br/><br/>But probably the most important point from an underdog&nbsp;- maybe the&nbsp;most important point made by any candidate&nbsp;- came from Dennis Kucinich, who said he not only favored lowered the drinking age to 18, but the voting age to 16. I seriously support such a lowering of the voting age - I've been saying for years that it should be lowered to 14 - an age at which, according cognitive psychologist Jean Piaget, people have completely adult reasoning processes, and have had them for at least two years.<br/><br/>Among the top tier Democrats, I thought John Edwards did splendidly&nbsp; last night. He comes across as the most human - the least political - and made some points against Hillary and Obama on stopping the business as usual in Washington. I especially liked Edwards' solution to the social security crisis: rather than raising the cap (it's currently $97,000+), create a window, in which income earners won't pay social security tax above the current cap, until they reach a much higher level of income.(I actually most favor Ron Paul's solution of letting people below a certain age opt of social security - but Edwards' is at least an innovative solution, which doesn't punish people in the upper middle class).<br/><br/>But, yeah, let's lower the voting age to 16.&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly we adults have not voted all that brilliantly in the past few elections...</p>

			<title>An Example of How Pro-War Republicans Are Trying to Mislead Us about MoveOn.org and General Petraeus</title>

      <p><br/>I enjoy hearing from
people who disagree with my blog posts, podcasts, radio and TV
appearances. I've always agreed with Socrates that dialog is the best
path to knowledge.<br/><br/>Here's an example of a little exchange that
occurred this morning, shortly after my weekly radio interview by Bob

MoveOn.org - General Petraeus &quot;Betray Us&quot; controversy.<br/><br/>My
position: Most people - just about everyone, I'd say - can understand
the difference between a General giving advice to Congress, supporting
a President in his harmful foreign policy, that betrays the best
interests of our country. This is what the MoveOn.org ad was clearly
saying. Not that the General was betraying us on the battlefield, or by
working with the enemy - a clearly absurd point to make, and which no
one, even the war's most bitter opponents, has ever suggested.<br/><br/>But the Republicans are clearly trying to pretend that the literal traitor point is what the MoveOn.org ad in the <span style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span> was saying.<br/><br/>Here
is the e-mail I received, followed by my reply. (Out of courtesy to the

heard your comments this AM on the radio concerning the Moveon.org ad

confirmed exactly what most know about academics in the liberal arts.
Your views are so tainted by your liberal leanings, it’s impossible for
you to present an evenhanded report on anything.<br/><br/>I guess I live
in an ivory tower (slightly to the right of yours,) as I have not heard
one utterance which described the ad the way you did. Perhaps in the
liberal bastions of Manhattan, that nexus of all learning and
civilization, one could believe in one’s heart that the average
American took the ad to mean something entirely different than the
words as written, but my guess is that if you spent a bit of time out
in good old “flyover? country you would find that most Americans knew
exactly what the folks at Moveon.org meant. They were simply calling
the general a traitor. The doublespeak you used to dance around the
meaning was certainly the stuff of legend and on that I must commend.<br/><br/>It’s almost as classic as “we support the troops but don’t support the war? and the like.<br/><br/>Is
the job of a journalist to report the facts without bias or comment or
is it to advance a personal agenda? The answer you give to that
question, the answer you give when you look yourself in the eye
brushing your teeth in the morning, will tell us where you stand.</blockquote><br/><br/>And my reply ...<br/><blockquote>You're
the one who should have trouble looking at yourself in the mirror:
you're obviously intelligent, and therefore must know that there's a
big difference between saying someone's advice or assessment betrays
the best interests of this country (which is what the MoveOn ad is
saying about the General), and saying someone is betraying us on the
battlefield or in dealings with foreign powers (which is what the
Republicans are claiming).<br/><br/>But I'd guess you're probably very
familiar with what the Republicans are up to - you write as if you're

			<title>Five Major News Networks Ranked in Their Fair/Unfair Treatment of Ron Paul</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/five_major_news_networks_ranked_in_their_fair_unfair_treatment_of_ron_paul]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<br/>With the Fall at our doorstep, and the lecture I'm giving to my class
at Fordham University about the media mistreatment of Ron Paul just a
week away, I thought I'd share with you a little list I put together,
which ranks the five major TV news networks on their coverage of Ron
Paul as well as other presidential candidates these past six months.<br/><br/>Since
I'm not omniscient, I may have missed some network errors and abuses.
All corrections and additions are welcome in the comment section.<br/><br/>1.
CNN: in first place. They've done nothing wrong that I know of, and get
kudos for the YouTube CNN debate a few months ago, in which questions
came from people who submitted videos to YouTube, rather than so-called
experts in the media. CNN decided which questions to air, but this is
still a <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/07/first-youtubecnn-presidential-debate.html">real breakthrough</a> in the democratization of media.<br/><br/>2.
MSNBC has in general done a fine job in its reporting of Ron Paul and
the other campaigns. MSNBC commentators Tucker Carlson and Pat Buchanan
have been public and explicit in their support of Ron Paul. But MSNBC
got off to a bit off a rough start. Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews,
discussing the candidates' positions on the war after the debate of May
4, <a href="http://patriotronpaul.blogspot.com/2007/05/msnbc-ignores-congressman-pauls.html" target="_blank">neglected to mention</a> that Ron Paul has been systematically against the war.  They both improved their reporting considerably, shortly thereafter.<br/><br/>3.
CBS has done nothing wrong in its coverage of the current campaigns,
either, as far as I know. But I put CBS in third place because of its
continuing <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/09/good-for-dan-rather-cbs-deserves-to-be.html">graceless treatment of Dan Rather</a>, who was forced out of CBS
after courageously reporting about George Bush's military past, in the
election campaign of 2004.<br/><br/>4.  Now we take a sharp turn downward with Fox News.  <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/09/hannity-colmes-denigrate-ron-pauls.html">Hannity and Colmes</a>
denigrated Ron Paul's first place finish in the Fox phone-in poll
conducted after the last Republican Presidential debate on Fox - the
two claimed that Ron Paul's supporters were multiple-dialing. Not only
was there no evidence for this, it turns out a second call from the
same phone resulted in a text reply that the vote wouldn't count.
O'Reilly, to his credit, did have Ron Paul on his show. But to
O'Reilly's discredit, <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/09/bill-oreilly-and-ron-paul.html">he barely gave Ron Paul a chance</a> to get a word in edgewise.<br/><br/>5. ABC is in the cellar.  Worse than Fox, ABC <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/08/abcs-abuse-of-american-electorate-to-be.html">failed to mention</a> on at least one occasion that Ron Paul came in first in its post-debate poll.  It <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/08/abcs-abuse-of-american-electorate-to-be.html">removed comments</a> from Ron Paul supporters on its online board, and then proceeded to shut it down.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[With the Fall at our doorstep, and the lecture I'm giving to my class
at Fordham University about the media mistreatment of Ron Paul just a
week away, I thought I'd share with you a little list I put together,
which ranks the five major TV news networks on their coverage of Ron
Paul as well as other presidential candidates these past six months.Since
I'm not omniscient, I may have missed some network errors and abuses.
All corrections and additions are welcome in the comment section.1.
CNN: in first place. They've done nothing wrong that I know of, and get
kudos for the YouTube CNN debate a few months ago, in which questions
came from people who submitted videos to YouTube, rather than so-called
experts in the media. CNN decided which questions to air, but this is
still a real breakthrough in the democratization of media.2.
MSNBC has in general done a fine job in its reporting of Ron Paul and
the other campaigns. MSNBC commentators Tucker Carlson and Pat Buchanan
have been public and explicit in their support of Ron Paul. But MSNBC
got off to a bit off a rough start. Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews,
discussing the candidates' positions on the war after the debate of May
4, neglected to mention that Ron Paul has been systematically against the war.  They both improved their reporting considerably, shortly thereafter.3.
CBS has done nothing wrong in its coverage of the current campaigns,
either, as far as I know. But I put CBS in third place because of its
continuing graceless treatment of Dan Rather, who was forced out of CBS
after courageously reporting about George Bush's military past, in the
election campaign of 2004.4.  Now we take a sharp turn downward with Fox News.  Hannity and Colmes
denigrated Ron Paul's first place finish in the Fox phone-in poll
conducted after the last Republican Presidential debate on Fox - the
two claimed that Ron Paul's supporters were multiple-dialing. Not only
was there no evidence for this, it turns out a second call from the
same phone resulted in a text reply that the vote wouldn't count.
O'Reilly, to his credit, did have Ron Paul on his show. But to
O'Reilly's discredit, he barely gave Ron Paul a chance to get a word in edgewise.5. ABC is in the cellar.  Worse than Fox, ABC failed to mention on at least one occasion that Ron Paul came in first in its post-debate poll.  It removed comments from Ron Paul supporters on its online board, and then proceeded to shut it down. ABC also showed a lone Ron Paul supporter
before the Iowa caucus, in contrast to big crowds for Romney, when in
fact Ron Paul had big crowds of supporters, too. Then there was Mark Levin,
in ABC's radio line-up, who called upon his listeners to call up Ron
Paul headquarters with advice that Ron Paul couldn't win. And, just for
good measure, ABC spread some its abuse around, and cropped Dennis Kucinich out of a photo Democratic contenders.The
good news for Fox and ABC is that the election campaigns are
continuing, and they can change their ways. Actually, Fox has been
worse than ABC in the past month, and that may be a sign that ABC is
finally seeing the error of its ways.I'd like to see all five major news networks report the election campaigns truthfully.  The American people require no less.I'll&nbsp; keep you posted.]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[<br/>I'm just watching Keith Olbermann, back on MSNBC's Countdown, after
several days of being down and out with appendicitis ...&nbsp; It's good to see him back on his show.<br/><br/>I by no means agree with all of Keith's positions and remarks.   I especially didn't like <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/01/olbermanns-suspension-of-rationality.html">his caustic attack on 24</a>
last year, his shots at Bill O'Reilly sometimes are over
the top. (But see my blog post about O'Reilly's site giving away
&quot;Please Don't Taze Me, Bro&quot; bumper stickers - <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/09/oreilly-sinks-to-new-low-his-site-is.html">a new low</a>, even for
O'Reilly.)<br/><br/>But whatever Keith's flaws, he offers a unique and
much-needed commentary. Not only because it generally comes from the
left (which I don't always agree with, either), but because it is
sharp, outrageous, fresh and funny.<br/><br/>Alison Stewart does a good
job as Keith's regular substitute, but you can see Keith's special
contribution right there. Alison's content is the same as Keith's, her
delivery is fine, but I laugh, gasp, or get angry maybe one out every ten times I do when watching Keith Olbermann.<br/><br/>Welcome back, Keith, and keep up the good, infuriating work.<br/><br/>]]></description>

<p>The result is that we are enjoying increasing discretion and control

to wait for television to show them to us. The iPhone is helping as
well, by allowing people to see such videos when they are away from

life with each and every submission that is chosen to appear in these
pages. And surely this issue – our fourth – is breathing deeply! The
voices here are many and diverse. Each one has given a breath of life
to these pages, and we invite you to witness that life, allow it to
move you, make you think and feel and perhaps do a bit of growing, too.Author Interview with Paul Levinson============================Enjoy ... here's one of my favorite lines ... &quot;I’d

<p>I continue to be fascinated - haunted, even - by Martin Scorsese's 2005 film about Bob Dylan, <em>No Direction Home</em>.&nbsp; I'd seen large pieces of it before, but saw the whole movie for the first time just a few nights ago.</p>









<p>Dylan's performance of &quot;With God On Our Side&quot; at the Newport Folk Festival with Joan Baez in the summer of 1963 is the high point of the movie.&nbsp; His voice never sounded better - Joan Baez's voice has always sounded great.&nbsp; She takes him by the hand out on stage, and the two waifs open up with what is probably the most powerful anti-war song ever written - we all go to war irrationally thinking and claiming God's on our side.&nbsp; This is exactly what Mike Huckabee said in defense of staying the course in Iraq, when Ron Paul spoke out in last week's debate about the war being wrong, strategically, as well as unconstitutional.&nbsp; Dylan's lyrics are, sadly, as searingly relevant today as in 1963.</p>









<p>But by 1964, Dylan was singing another kind of song at the Newport Festival - &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;.&nbsp; This was the pivotal transitional song. The lyrics are sublime, but they never had&nbsp;much relevance to any current event.&nbsp; The Newport crowd applauded, willing to give Dylan the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; He was, after all, still acoustic, and still sincere.<br/></p>









<p>But Dylan was singing &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot; in 1965 in Newport, with electric backing.&nbsp; In just two years, he had morphed from the most powerful, splendid, social&nbsp;critic ever known in folk song to a caustic, psychedelic commentator on the human condition.&nbsp; Someone who even, for the first time, it seemed, may even have been sarcastic and condescending to his audience. For all of that, he got booed...</p>









<p>I've always loved both of Dylan's phases.&nbsp; But given the state of the world today, I miss the Dylan who sang up there with Joan Baez, and still wonder at the transformation.&nbsp; The assassination of JFK, Dylan's wanting some of the fame enjoyed by the Beatles, just needing to move on to other things - these were no doubt&nbsp; important factors.&nbsp; But, somehow, insufficient, either singly or in concert, to explain just what happened to Dylan....</p>

Crunchgear's Seth Porges asked and and answered that yesterday: Yes.&nbsp; The new iPod Touch steals some of the
iPhone’s thunder. That's proof enough.&nbsp; And then there’s Beck’s “Cellphone’s Dead,? the Touch’s demo song.&nbsp; Observes Sascha Segan of <i>PC Magazine</i>, “The phone is the weakest part of the iPhone anyway.?
</p>




<p>
I think not.&nbsp; First, Porges and Segan make the mistake
that industry analysts - in contrast to media historians - often do.&nbsp;
They’re equating the industry, or social and economic structures
surrounding a medium, with what the medium does or doesn’t do,
itself.&nbsp; Television national networks, for example, were spent by
the late 1980s.&nbsp; But television - the enjoyment of audio-visual stories,
news, etc on a screen under one's control - was as powerfully appealing
as ever.&nbsp; The result was the not decline of television, but its
migration to cable and BitTorrent.
</p>




<p>The phone is not the weakest part of the iPhone - it’s actually the strongest
part.&nbsp; A device that gave us great connections to all of the Internet
would be wonderful - but its magic is that it also lets us call someone
we love, or a business partner, and receive calls from same.&nbsp; A
conversation with a real person - if she or he is the right person -
usually trumps anything else we might be up to online.
</p>




<p>AT&amp;T and its antiquated system is the weakest part.&nbsp; But
AT&amp;T was never in the vanguard of cell phone service in the first
place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, as the near-monopolistic giant in the first hundred years of the telephone, it impeded its dissemination to the point that it was not until the 1950s, some 75 years after the telephone's invention, that more than 50-percent of Americans had telephones in their homes.<br/>
</p>



The iPhone will continue and thrive with its cell phone
service prominent and important - but with other carriers and other
plans.

			<title>iPhones In My Classroom</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/i_phones_in_my_classroom]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<br/>Fall 2007 classes begin today at Fordham University,
where I teach.&nbsp; I have a big Intro to Mass Media course, which I teach
every term, and I’m looking forward to igniting at 1:30pm...

<p>I have a policy - which I’m pretty relaxed about, as I am about most
rules - about cell phones and laptops in my classroom.&nbsp; In general, I
discourage students from talking or texting on their cell phones during
class.&nbsp; Talking, of course, can distract the rare student who wants to hear my lecture.&nbsp; But even texting has its problems - let's say I ask a question, and someone texts a student from last term for the answer?<br/></p>
<p> But laptops are ok.&nbsp; Yeah, I know students IM on them, but the
laptops at least provide the possibility of looking something up - an encyclopedia or library on the go - and that’s fine with me, even
during one of my lectures.
</p>

<p>But ... what should I do about iPhones?&nbsp; I have no idea how many
students will have them today, but it’s a sure bet that more and
more students will have iPhones in the future.&nbsp; The iPhone, obviously,
is a cell phone and web browser (and an iPod).
</p>

<p>I’m going to err on the side of open systems.&nbsp; I already encourage my students to read blogs, listen to podcasts, watch videos on YouTube - it's written into the Intro to Media curriculum.&nbsp; If my students want
to use their iPhones as cell phones, and have conversations with
friends during the class, so be it.&nbsp; But on the chance that they’ll be
using the iPhone to locate some bit of fascinating, pertinent knowledge
on the Web - hey, that’s all to the good.
</p>

<p>
Of course, I will draw the line during our open book exams…

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Welcome to Light On Light Through podcast Episode 43, Violence and Videogames: The Truth, where I examine the two main types of &quot;scientific evidence&quot; that purport to show that violence in videogames leads to violence in the real world - and explain why they show nothing of the sort.&nbsp; The experiments measure violence &quot;profiles&quot; based on results of tests, not violence in the real world.&nbsp; The surveys show correlation not causation between violent videogames and violence in the real world - and I explain exactly what that means.I've been studying and teaching about the statistical flaws and inadequacies in these studies for years as a Professor of Communication and Media Studies.&nbsp; If you'd like to really understand what these studies are trying to demonstrate, but why they do not, invest 15 minutes of your time and listen to this podcast.Plus flashes&nbsp;...&nbsp;iTunes and NBC split - no big deal - bitTorent is the future, anyway ... now ABC is not only misreporting Ron Paul, but cropping Kucinich out of photos ... great summer television...&nbsp;

			<title>NBC and iTunes Stop Their Old-Fashioned Dance</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/nbc_and_i_tunes_stop_their_old_fashioned_dance]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<br/>A lot of hand wringing, phosphor, and ink spilled over the news that NBC shows won't be for sale any more on iTunes.  According to <a target="blank" href="http://machinist.salon.com/blog/2007/08/31/apple_nbc/">Apple</a>,
that's because it didn't want to go along with an NBC price hike that
would have upped the per-episode download price from
$1.99 to $4.99 for consumers...<br/><br/>But, you know what? They're both wrong. NBC, sure, for wanting to get more money for its downloaded shows,
but iTunes and NBC were both wrong, in the first place, to charge even
$1.95 per download.<br/><br/>Most people already know that that you can see
episodes of most major shows for free, on the NBC or whatever network's
web site - not to mention bittorent and all the rest.<br/><br/>The world
of television consumption is changing, almost by the minute, and it's moving towards people watching whatever they want, when they
want, and not paying for it. Actually, there's probably a shorter
distance between this and traditional free television in your living
room than download-and-pay.<br/><br/>NBC and Apple are usually ahead of
the pack in understanding this new world. Maybe NBC does understand this, and
wants to drive more viewers to its own site.<br/><br/>But whatever the
reasoning, it's a safe bet that corporate, profit-per-item mentality is

            <description><![CDATA[<br/><br/>The U.K's <a target="_blank" href="http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/bobbie_johnson/2007/08/scoring_points_with_the_voters.html">Guardian</a> just reminded me of something I already knew, which has crucial relevance both to video gamers and the current Presidential campaign:<br/><br/>Hillary
Clinton is no friend of video gaming. In fact, along with Senators
Lieberman, Johnson, and Bayh, she proudly introduced the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Entertainment_Protection_Act">Family Entertainment Protection Act</a>
in November, 2005. The Wikipedia entry explains that this law if enacted
would have exacted &quot;fines of $1000 dollars or 100 hours of community
service for a first time offense of selling a 'Mature' or 'Adult-Only'
rated video game to a minor, and $5000 or 500 hours for each subsequent
offense.&quot;<br/><br/>Fortunately, it was not enacted - Congress had more sense than Hillary and her unconstitutionally minded colleagues. Indeed, similar acts in various states had already been struck down as
unconstitutional.<br/><br/>Hillary, unfortunately, comes by her disregard
for the First Amendment through her husband. Bill Clinton signed the
Communications Decency Act into law in 1996. That affront to the freedom
of communication carried as much as $2000 and a two-year-in-prison
penalty. Fortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court struck that one down.<br/><br/>Bill claimed he figured that act was unconstitutional, too, and the
Supreme Court would declare it to be. So ... why did he sign it into law? <br/><br/>Surely he was not unaware of the straightforward Presidential action of not
signing a destructive act into law, in the first place?<br/><br/>Bill Clinton and his circumlocutions fortunately can no longer threaten the First Amendment.<br/><br/>But
Hillary's now running for President, leading many of the Democratic
polls, and unless she explicitly says otherwise, a wise assumption
would be that her election as President would bring to our nation steep
fines, forced community service, and even jail time for forms of
communication clearly protected under the First Amendment.<br/><br/>We
all want to protect our children. Trampling on the Constitution is not
the way to do it. We can do better than run scared with the likes of Jack Thompson,
and the flawed studies he cites. (See <a href="http://http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/06/how-i-went-face-to-screen-with-jack.html">my &quot;debate&quot; with Thompson</a> on CNBC
last year.)<br/><br/>We have candidates who understand this. Republican
candidate Ron Paul has the best record of respecting the Constitution.
Democratic candidate Dennis Kucinich is a close second.<br/><br/>I hope the rest of the candidates will follow their leads, and not Hillary's.<br/><br/><a href="http://digg.com/2008_us_elections/Hilliary_Would_Witch_Hunt_Videogamers"><img width="91" height="17" src="http://digg.com/img/badges/91x17-digg-button.gif" alt="Digg!"/></a><br/><br/>for more on Bill Clinton and the Communications Decency Act of 1996:&nbsp; see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0415197724/ref=nosim/?tag=dexter2a-20">The Soft Edge: A Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution</a>, pp. 154-160.<br/><br/>See also 15-minute podcast: <a href="http://paullev.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=251798">Violence and Videogames - The Truth</a><br/><br/>]]></description>

			<title>A Lesson from AT&amp;T History</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/a_lesson_from_at_t_history]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<br/>It's always useful to look at history.<br/><br/>Since AT&amp;T lawyers seem to be doing the most grumbling about
opening the iPhone to other carriers, I thought it might be helpful to look at AT&amp;T’s reign as a near monopoly in American telephone
service, or at very least the predominating force, until the <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/networkingtopics/networking/story/0,10801,77644,00.html">“divestiture?</a> on January 1, 1984 gave regional service to the Baby Bells.<br/><br/>You needn't look very far to notice a very telling fact.&nbsp; <br/><br/>Indeed, it is something which always struck me as the most telling about
AT&amp;T’s 100-year rule - something which says it all, I think, about the
impact of near-monopolies on phone service:

<p>The telephone was invented in 1876.&nbsp; It wasn't until the 1950s that
more than 50% of Americans enjoyed telephone service in their homes.
</p>


<p>Yes, the pace of progress was a little different, then, but not that
different.&nbsp; Television was in more than 90% of American homes by end of
the 1950s, a little more than ten years after it was introduced commercially.
</p>


<p>AT&amp;T held its service very close to its vest.&nbsp; Customers in
effect leased phones from AT&amp;T.&nbsp; You had no choice but to use its
service.&nbsp; Sound familiar? <br/></p>

<p>Under this regime, it took more three quarters of a century
for phone service to reach the homes of more than 50% of Americans.
</p>


Unfortunately, AT&amp;T seems to have not learned very much from
this experience.&nbsp; It is trying its same old tricks with iPhone
service.&nbsp; Fortunately, it looks like we won't have to wait a hundred years to divest ourselves of these tricks.<br/><br/><br type="_moz"/>

            <description><![CDATA[<br/>It was the summer of 1984 - the very dawn of the digital age.&nbsp; Stewart Brand and I were having lunch with several other people near the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute in La Jolla, California, where we had just given lectures in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was when I first heard Stewart say &quot;information wants to be free.&quot;&nbsp; He said it again over lunch.&nbsp; And&nbsp; I replied - well,
maybe so, but creators of information still need to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was a staunch supporter of copyright and patent.&nbsp;

<p>I’m still a strong believer in copyright.&nbsp; But, in the two and a half decades
since then, the wretched excesses of the RIAA and like organizations
have caused me to clarify to myself and others exactly what I mean.&nbsp;
And that would be:&nbsp; If some person or organization wants to make money
from my writing or other creative work, they need my permission and of
course need to pay me. I'm not allergic to money. But if someone wants to take my book out of a
library, read my blog, listen to my podcast, buy a second-hand copy of
my book, that’s fine, even great.&nbsp; I'm delighted, and I don’t expect to get paid.&nbsp; Which means that, to
be consistent, I should have no problem with someone acquiring a new
copy of any of my books and not paying me - and, in fact, that’s fine,
too. I have no problem at all with that.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>
</p>








<p>And that's why, as I wrote yesterday, I was so happy about <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/08/hats-off-to-george-hotz.html">George Hotz</a> and his re-soldering the iPhone to
work with a T-Mobile sim card.&nbsp; Apple and

			<title>My Four Rules: The Best You Can Do To Make It As A Writer</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/my_four_rules_the_best_you_can_do_to_make_it_as_a_writer]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>What follows are my four cardinal rules for making it as a writer.&nbsp; Never any guarantees - but if you follow these rules, you'll be giving yourself the best possible chance:</p>










<ol><li>Don't think about an idea for a story or an article too long - just write it.&nbsp; As far as the world is concerned, an unwritten idea doesn't exist, and might not have even been thought, in the first place.</li><li>Finish what you start writing.&nbsp; As far as the world is concerned, an unfinished piece of writing doesn't exist, and might not have even been written, in the first place.</li><li>Email, mail, or otherwise send out to a potential publisher whatever you finish writing.&nbsp; As far as the world is concerned, a piece of writing that only you and your friends and family but no publishers know about, might not have even been written, in the first place.</li><li>If the publisher or editor turns your story down, send it right out to another publisher or editor - there will always be another one.&nbsp; As far as the world is concerned, an unpublished piece of writing might not have even been written-</li></ol>










<p>Well, you get the picture.&nbsp; I hope this helps...</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[What follows are my four cardinal rules for making it as a writer.&nbsp; Never any guarantees - but if you follow these rules, you'll be giving yourself the best possible chance:










Don't think about an idea for a story or an article too long - just write it.&nbsp; As far as the world is concerned, an unwritten idea doesn't exist, and might not have even been thought, in the first place.Finish what you start writing.&nbsp; As far as the world is concerned, an unfinished piece of writing doesn't exist, and might not have even been written, in the first place.Email, mail, or otherwise send out to a potential publisher whatever you finish writing.&nbsp; As far as the world is concerned, a piece of writing that only you and your friends and family but no publishers know about, might not have even been written, in the first place.If the publisher or editor turns your story down, send it right out to another publisher or editor - there will always be another one.&nbsp; As far as the world is concerned, an unpublished piece of writing might not have even been written-










Well, you get the picture.&nbsp; I hope this helps...

<p>Bravo for unlocking iPhone!</p>
<p>What does this mean?</p>
<p>The iPhone from Apple comes &quot;locked&quot; when purchased - meaning, it can only work with an AT&amp;T sim card - you know, the card on which you have phone numbers from the phone you're currently using.</p>
<p>So, what's someone to do who buys an iPhone, but is currently using a phone with a sim from a different carrier?&nbsp;&nbsp; In George Hotz's case, that carrier was T-Mobile.</p>
<p>So, the 17-year old took apart his iPhone, and after two months of tinkering and analyzing and soldering, he got his iPhone to work with his T-Mobile sim.</p>
<p>Which is the way it should have been, all along.</p>
<p>Apple and AT&amp;T may not like it, but what George Hotz did is perfectly legal - owners of cell phones have the right to put in whatever sim card they choose.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apple may have locked the iPhone, but George Hotz, having purchased the iPhone, had every right to unlock it, if he could.</p>
<p>Locks are not way to go in the digital age...</p>

			<title>The Call to Mental Telepathy</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/the_call_to_mental_telepathy]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Mental telepathy is&nbsp;still a long way off.&nbsp; After all, communicating via voice and fingers,&nbsp;to people near and&nbsp;far, in response to every impulse, is not the same as communicating mind-to-mind. <p>But consider this: </p>
<p>The first electronic medium - the telegraph - required the user to&nbsp;travel to an office outside the home to send a message.&nbsp; The telephone greatly improved this, by allowing sending and receiving of messages from within the home, and via voice.&nbsp; </p>
<p>That still left you incommunicado when&nbsp;you were walking down the street, with no pay phones in sight. </p>
<p>But cell phones came to the rescue on that score - the cell phone in effect obsolesces the phone booth - and enables&nbsp;us to communicate to anyone, anywhere, wherever we or they may be happen to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now iPhones and Blackberries and similar media are widening the cell phone's flow, bringing written words, pictures, moving images, and even images with sounds into our immediate grasp. </p>
<p>All of this is physical, and therefore not yet mental telepathy.&nbsp; And the process is far from complete - there are many kinds of communication, like the long-predicted videophone, which are not yet integrated into the ease of the iPhone.</p>
<p>But the distance between what our mind imagines and wants in the realm of communication has never been shorter. </p>
<p>And when Bluetooth is thoroughly integrated with all iPhone features, and the features increased, the distance will be further shortened. </p>
<p>And then ... well,&nbsp;we'll be&nbsp;knocking on mental telepathy’s door.&nbsp; We may never have it, actually.&nbsp; But we’ll be close. </p>

			<title>Cellphone as Porlock: Coleridge in the Digital Age</title>

			<title>Talking About Media Misreporting of Ron Paul this Tues Night in Manhattan</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/talking_about_media_misreporting_of_ron_paul_this_tues_night_in_manhattan]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey - a heads-up for everyone in the New York area, with an interest in the mainstream and Internet media coverage of the 2008 Presidential election, and its current percolating campaigns:</p>
<p>I've been invited to talk to the New York City Ron Paul Meet-Up group at 7:30pm this&nbsp;Tuesday - in particular, about the media's misreporting and in one case outright attack on Ron Paul, and what can be done about it.</p>
<p>I'll be talking at the <a href="http://www.pourhousenyc.com/">Village Pourhouse</a> on 11th Street and 3rd Avenue (southwest corner) for 30-45 minutes, followed by 15-30 mins for questions and answers.</p>
<p>The meeting room will be spacious.&nbsp; The general public is welcome.&nbsp; Admission&nbsp;will be&nbsp;free.</p>
<p>I think the media coverage of our election campaigns thus far should be of concern to anyone&nbsp;who values&nbsp;our democracy.</p>
<p>Ron Paul and his supporters, in particular, have received less than truthful treatment from a variety of media.&nbsp; ABC News and its affiliates has had the greatest confluence of misreporting, and I'll be talking in particular about ABC's posting of misleading photos, reporting of Internet poll results which left out Ron Paul's standing, and, in the case of ABC radio talkshow host Mark Levin,&nbsp;about his&nbsp;urging listeners to call Ron Paul headquarters with hostile comments.</p>
<p><em>Full disclosure</em>: I'd be outraged about such media malfeasance whomever I supported, but I do support Ron Paul for the Republican nomination for President.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's easy for me to do, for two reasons.&nbsp;1. I think our country's disregard of the Constitution - whether it's trampling on the First Amendment or going to war without the Declaration of War required - has gotten us into enormous difficulties.&nbsp; Ron Paul is the only candidate in either party with a lifelong commitment to supporting the Constitution.&nbsp; 2. My second reason for supporting Ron Paul for the Republican nomination is that the other Republican candidates are simply impossible for me to support - three of them don't believe in evolution, and most support the Bush administration's continuation of the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>But there are Democrats I admire, too.&nbsp; Indeed, any of them&nbsp;is easily better than any of the Republicans, with the exception of Ron Paul.&nbsp; But the three leading Democratic contenders - Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Edwards (in that order for me) also have qualities that would make me consider their candidacies very seriously (not to mention Al Gore, who at this point is not in the running).</p>
<p>Accordingly, I'm urging everyone to work for the best candidate receiving the nomination in each party.&nbsp; And in the happy event that this happens, we can then decide&nbsp;in the general election who is better - the Democrat or the Republican - to lead this country.&nbsp; <em>End of Disclosure</em>.</p>
<p>But, whichever candidate you support, I hope you agree that our democracy&nbsp;is best served by truthful&nbsp;media coverage.&nbsp; How can we make a rational decision when we're fed misleading and false information? It would be good to see you on Tuesday.&nbsp; And I'll be posting a postscript here&nbsp;to my talk later Tuesday night or early Wednesday.</p>

			<title>Paul J. Feiner for Greenburgh Town Supervisor</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/paul_j_feiner_for_greenburgh_town_supervisor]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The vast majority of you - my American and world-wide readers - will have never heard of Paul Feiner. Understandable - you don't live in the town of Greenburgh, a few miles north of New York City, where my wife and I and family have lived since the summer of 1992.<br/><br/>But if you want know a local champion, a tireless fighter for everything that's good in suburban/urban life, then you'd benefit from knowing Paul J. Feiner. He's been Town Superviser of Greenburgh, New York - a two-year, elected position - since 1991. He ran twice for Congress - as a Democrat in what was then a highly Republican district - and lost ... &nbsp;Greenburgh and America's loss.<br/><br/>I've always voted for Paul Feiner, but got to know him really well last year.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[The vast majority of you - my American and world-wide readers - will have never heard of Paul Feiner. Understandable - you don't live in the town of Greenburgh, a few miles north of New York City, where my wife and I and family have lived since the summer of 1992.But if you want know a local champion, a tireless fighter for everything that's good in suburban/urban life, then you'd benefit from knowing Paul J. Feiner. He's been Town Superviser of Greenburgh, New York - a two-year, elected position - since 1991. He ran twice for Congress - as a Democrat in what was then a highly Republican district - and lost ... &nbsp;Greenburgh and America's loss.I've always voted for Paul Feiner, but got to know him really well last year. Verizon was offering fiber optic service in Greenburgh (I'm using it right now in this connection), and needed Town Council approval to offer television service through the fiber optics. Unsurprisingly, Cablevision, which had a monopoly on cable service in this area, opposed Verizon's request.Feiner, with a mostly balky Town Council baying at his every point, stood up and courageously argued for freedom of choice in television providers in Greenburgh.

			<title>True Confession: Why I Would Never Write Under a Pseudonym</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/true_confession_why_i_would_never_write_under_a_pseudonym]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>As some of you know, I write both <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/06/my-books-novels-and-nonfiction-and.html">fiction and non-fiction</a>.&nbsp; I try to do as much damage as possible.</p>

<p>To some extent, I lead two separate lives as an author.&nbsp; There are many people who know me only or primarily as a science fiction writer, and many who know me mostly as an author of books on the history, evolution, and social impact of communications media.</p>

<p>I'm sometimes asked why I don't write under two separate names.&nbsp; The logic is that I might be taken more seriously in my non-fiction if I wasn't also known as a science fiction writer.</p>

<p>Actually, this may have once been a problem - long before I started writing.&nbsp; Back in the 1950s, Isaac Asimov claimed he ran into&nbsp;difficulties with colleagues at Boston University - where he taught in the chemistry department - because of his science fiction.&nbsp; But Asimov went on to have fabulous careers as both a science and a science fiction writer, both under the name of Isaac Asimov.&nbsp; (He did publish a few novels under the pen name Paul French.)</p>

<p>Nowadays, I don't know who would really think that being a science fiction author could detract from how seriously readers take your non-fiction.&nbsp;&nbsp; If anything, I think most of the world recognizes that science fiction, though fun, often deals with the most&nbsp;profound issues in the universe - our place in the cosmos, our capacity to create machines that think (which leads us to contemplate what we mean by intelligence, thought, consciousness), etc.&nbsp; You know, those sorts of things...</p>

<p>So I would never write under a pseudonym for that reason - that it might hurt my nonfiction career to be known as a science fiction writer - even if I were so inclined, which I'm not.</p>

<p>Some writers, unhappily, have no choice but to write under a pseudonym - for economic reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have sold so poorly under their real name, that the only way bookstores will stock their books&nbsp;is if they&nbsp;are packaged under a new name.&nbsp; Fortunately, and thank my lucky stars, that hasn't happened to me (yet).</p>

<p>But there is one transcendent reason which will keep me, I'm sure, from ever writing under a pseudonym. &nbsp;It does not have to do with the profundity of science fiction, nor with my level of success as writer.</p>

<p>It has to do with the girl who sat next to me in social studies class in <br/>7th grade. &nbsp;(And&nbsp;there may have been&nbsp;one in 6th grade, and in 9th grade, too.)&nbsp;&nbsp; She is the reason I would never ever write under a pseudonym, regardless of any good reasons.</p>

<p>She pretty&nbsp;much ignored me back then, and&nbsp;I want to maximize the chances that when she walks into a bookstore somewhere today or tomorrow, she will notice, out of the corner of her eye, my name on a book on a shelf.&nbsp; And at that moment, she will realize all that she could have had back in&nbsp;our junior high school class....</p>

<p><img src="http://x.myspace.com/images/blog/smileys/anxious.gif"/>&nbsp; yeah, that's the reason...</p>

			<title>The Durability of Paper</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/the_durability_of_paper]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>People have been complaining about the big stack of paper printouts they have received from AT&amp;T for their iPhone service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have been objecting almost as much to the paper delivery as to the bill, saying that if the iPhone were as a true harbinger of the future as its champions (including me) claim, its telephone carrier would have figured out a way to send the bill electronically.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But&nbsp;I doubt that paper’s really the issue.&nbsp; I've never seen anyone object to getting some paper cash in hand. </p>
<p>Paper, of course,&nbsp;has long been&nbsp;put forth&nbsp;as an early item to be replaced by the digital realm.&nbsp; I remember lots of talk and writing back in the 1980s about the “paperless office?.&nbsp; It didn’t happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll let Sierra Waters, heroine of my novel <i>The Plot to Save Socrates</i>, explain why.&nbsp; Here’s what she’s thinking on the very first page of&nbsp;the novel:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><div class="bodycopy"><p><a href="http://paullevinson.info/books.html"><img src="http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i175/PaulLev/th_socrates.jpg" align="right"/></a>...written on the only substance which could survive decades, maybe longer, without batteries, which required only the light of the sun to be read, or the moon on a good night, or a flickering flame when there was no moon.&nbsp; Paper.&nbsp; A marvelous invention.&nbsp; Thin and durable...</p>
</div></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And paper also has what I call “reliable locatability? - what’s written on one part of a piece of paper today will be in the same place tomorrow. </p>
<p>So, as much as I dislike bills, I actually prefer getting them on paper. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, if the history of phone and online service is any indication, iPhone AT&amp;T service will sooner or later&nbsp;progress to very low, flat rates for huge amounts of data - which I doubt that anyone will be complaining about, whether on paper or screen.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[People have been complaining about the big stack of paper printouts they have received from AT&amp;T for their iPhone service.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have been objecting almost as much to the paper delivery as to the bill, saying that if the iPhone were as a true harbinger of the future as its champions (including me) claim, its telephone carrier would have figured out a way to send the bill electronically.&nbsp; 
But&nbsp;I doubt that paper’s really the issue.&nbsp; I've never seen anyone object to getting some paper cash in hand. 
Paper, of course,&nbsp;has long been&nbsp;put forth&nbsp;as an early item to be replaced by the digital realm.&nbsp; I remember lots of talk and writing back in the 1980s about the “paperless office?.&nbsp; It didn’t happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I’ll let Sierra Waters, heroine of my novel The Plot to Save Socrates, explain why.&nbsp; Here’s what she’s thinking on the very first page of&nbsp;the novel:
&nbsp;
...written on the only substance which could survive decades, maybe longer, without batteries, which required only the light of the sun to be read, or the moon on a good night, or a flickering flame when there was no moon.&nbsp; Paper.&nbsp; A marvelous invention.&nbsp; Thin and durable...
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
And paper also has what I call “reliable locatability? - what’s written on one part of a piece of paper today will be in the same place tomorrow. 
So, as much as I dislike bills, I actually prefer getting them on paper. 
Meanwhile, if the history of phone and online service is any indication, iPhone AT&amp;T service will sooner or later&nbsp;progress to very low, flat rates for huge amounts of data - which I doubt that anyone will be complaining about, whether on paper or screen.

			<title>Bob Shannon Back on WCBS-FM Radio in New York</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/bob_shannon_back_on_wcbs_fm_radio_in_new_york]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I was just listening to Bob Shannon on WCBS-FM &quot;oldies&quot; radio in New York.&nbsp; It's good to have him back.</p>

<p>As some of you may know, Bob and the WCBS-FM dj staff were abruptly banished a few years ago, when WCBS-FM Radio became &quot;Jack&quot; radio.&nbsp; I'll resist the four letter word that fits with &quot;Jack&quot; and rhymes with fit, but let's just say that &quot;Jack&quot; didn't fit New York City or oldies music, and this sarcastic, automated, sour format brought&nbsp; down what good music the format managed to play.</p>

<p>&quot;Jack&quot; was brought in to increase the ratings and revenue of an oldies station that was already doing fine in both areas - &quot;Jack&quot; was inoculation against the graying oldies audience.</p>

<p>Well, every once in a while, commerciality comes through heroically, and, in Jack's case, it turned out that the ratings actually dwindled under his format.</p>

<p>And so Bob Shannon and some old&nbsp; and new, fully human, disc jockeys were brought back along with the good name and sounds of WCBS-FM oldies radio in New York City last month.</p>

<p>You know, there's no substitute for a human, not-pre-recorded disc jockey.&nbsp; Especially when he has the easy, encyclopedic knowledge of rock music, as Bob Shannon has, along with a great, sparkling sense of humor.</p>

<p>Welcome home, Bob!</p>

			<title>Practical Rhyme</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/practical_rhyme]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I was thinking about rhymes&nbsp; - not poetry, necessarily, but just rhyming, and how it originated in our history, in our language.</p>
<p>Marshall McLuhan provides a clue, as he does for so much in communication: lots of things that we regard as art forms or sports, McLuhan says, started out as very practical technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, horseback riding was once just a practical way to travel.&nbsp;&nbsp; The automobile made horseback riding into a sport, even an art-form.</p>
<p>I first heard McLuhan say this back in the mid-1970s.&nbsp; Since then, I've come with examples of my own.&nbsp; For example - delicatessen.&nbsp; Ham and corned beef started out as ways of preserving meats.&nbsp; Once refrigeration came along, we no longer needed that spicing for preservation - but we liked the taste so much, we kept on eating and enjoying the delicatessen - it had become an art form.&nbsp; Or take convertible cars: in the days before air conditioning, we rolled the roof down to keep cool.&nbsp; Now we don't need to do that to be cool, physically - but we like our convertibles because we <em>look</em> cool, driving around in them.</p>
<p>And rhyme?&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, think about it.&nbsp; Before writing was invented, our ancestors had to rely completely upon their memories.&nbsp;&nbsp; In these oral cultures, anything that enhanced the power of memory, helped it work better, was welcome.</p>
<p>Rhymes ... the Velcro of the mind...</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>People in the Middle Ages spoke of a Prester John - a prince of a far off kingdom in the East.&nbsp; He was said to have magic powers and magical instruments.&nbsp; Most magical of all was his &quot;speculum,&quot; through which Prester John could see all the provinces in his kingdom.&nbsp; A sort of television...</p>
<p>Scholars, inspired by this legend, began referring to their surveys and encyclopedias as &quot;specula&quot; - or speculum literature.&nbsp; There was a speculum of history, of astronomy, of alchemy, of morals.&nbsp; Someone even wrote&nbsp;a speculum on fools.</p>
<p>The speculum, in other words, had gone on in the popular and then scholarly imagination to encompass not only the physical world but the realm of ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe a little more like the Internet than television...</p>
<p>But it doesn't really matter what we call our wondrous devices today.&nbsp; Whether television, or Internet, or iPhone, what counts is they are real.</p>
<p>For we have gone with our technology from the realm of myth to what we can keep on tables, or desks, in our very hands.</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever seen a television show - including <em>Twin Peaks</em> - so brazenly unresolved.&nbsp; The question, then: is that good?</p>
<p>People complained about the open, ambiguous ending of <em>The Sopranos</em>.&nbsp; Well, <em>John from Cincinnati</em> was ambiguous at the beginning, the middle, or the end?</p>
<p>Good or bad?</p>
<p>The murkiness of the show will certainly make it memorable.&nbsp; Is it always necessary to have clear-cut resolutions in our narratives?</p>
<p>I've been criticized for not tying up more loose ends at the of my time-travel novel, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0765311976/ref=nosim/?tag=dexter2a-20">The Plot to Save Socrates</a></em> - in particular, for one major character (no, not Socrates).&nbsp; I don't know ... I ended my novel that way because it felt good, right.</p>
<p>After all, life is usually ambiguous in its endings, not resolved, so why do some of us insist upon resolution in our fiction?</p>
<p>I think <em>John for Cincinnati</em> was probably too unresolved throughout for my tastes in narrative.&nbsp; I don't mind a murky jewel at all, but I like seeing a little more light through it, when I hold it up in my mind for scrutiny, at least some of the time.</p>
<p>But I suspect <em>John from Cincinnati</em> will be scrutinized for light and meaning for a long time to come.</p>

<p><em>And this just in from Iowa - Ron Paul placed 5th in the Iowa Straw Poll.&nbsp; Certainly not a win, but ahead of Tommy Thompson, and better than many expected.&nbsp;&nbsp; Politics, as ever, is unpredictable, and this is why it is so important for media to report the news, and the results of their own polls, as accurately as possible.</em></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[&nbsp;
Welcome to Episode 40 of Light On Light Through in which we focus on a very unwelcome development: the media disenfranchising of Republican Presidential candidate Ron Paul.&nbsp; I admire his unflinching support of the Constitution (including the First Amendment), do not agree with every one of his positions, but whether we agree with any candidate's positions or not, we should be alarmed when a major news network such as ABC forgets to mention that a candidate, in this case Ron Paul, came in first in its poll, gives the impression that Ron Paul had fewer supporters at a rally than he in fact had, etc.&nbsp; I've written blog posts about this abuse of our democratic system, intend to teach my Intro to Communication and Media Studies class at Fordham University about this in Fall, and am hoping this podcast will help get more word of this out to the American people...
And this just in from Iowa - Ron Paul placed 5th in the Iowa Straw Poll.&nbsp; Certainly not a win, but ahead of Tommy Thompson, and better than many expected.&nbsp;&nbsp; Politics, as ever, is unpredictable, and this is why it is so important for media to report the news, and the results of their own polls, as accurately as possible.
Plus flashes&nbsp;... David Wiltse's Sedition opens in Westport - the beginning of the 20th-century assault on the First Amendment ... The Bourne Ultimatum is outstanding - why? ... summer television - Meadowlands, Big Love, John from Cincinnati, Weeds ...

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Just got back from <em>The Bourne Ultimatum</em>, and I agree with all the superlatives.&nbsp; The movie had everything - fine, razor-keen acting, captivating plot, non-stop breathtaking action.&nbsp; &nbsp;This third movie in the <em>Bourne</em> series is clearly the best of three - though the first, <em>The Bourne Identity</em>, was almost as good.&nbsp; (I thought the second, <em>The Bourne Supremacy</em>, was not as good as the first and third.)</p>
<p>But I'm wondering why, given that the essential elements of the <em>Bourne</em> series plot are so familiar, these movies - and the first and last ones in particular - are so good.&nbsp; We've seen many movies about spies and secret agents abused&nbsp; by their employers.&nbsp; Many movies about secret agent amnesia.&nbsp; Many movies about spies on the run for their lives, helped by beautiful women, civilian or agent&nbsp;- some of whom survive, some not.</p>
<p>What makes the <em>Bourne</em> series different?</p>
<p>If I told you, my life would be forfeit...</p>

<p>My hibiscus tree is in full bloom.&nbsp; I told you last week about my myrtle ... I guess every plant has a story ... or, at least, I have a story for just about everything I've ever planted...</p>
<p>We bought this hibiscus as a sickly sapling about 15 years ago.&nbsp; It was on sale, and something about it looked promising, even though it looked as it had just been cured of some kind of insect attack.</p>
<p>I planted it on a low-maintenance side of our property (actually, our property could be described as all low-maintenance).&nbsp; The hibiscus tree - with soft, crumply pink-lavender flowers - struggled for the first five-ten years.&nbsp; But it always came back the next year, and managed to come through with some splendid blooms.</p>
<p>Last year, we had a decrepit white birch cut down - that's always the key.&nbsp; A little&nbsp;bit more sun, maybe&nbsp;the hibiscus&nbsp;was&nbsp;ready, who knows.</p>
<p>But this year, for the first time, the hibiscus really looks like a tree.&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks&nbsp;as if&nbsp;it more than doubled its size from&nbsp;last year.&nbsp; &nbsp;All feels good in this tiny corner of the cosmic.&nbsp; The hibiscus has claimed its proper place.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><a id="static_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595141561?ie=UTF8&tag=ligonligthr-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=1595141561"><img id="static_preview_img" src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/21HqfV6SZGL._AA_SL160_.jpg" border="0"/></a></p>
<p>Sarah Beth Durst has written a delightful fantasy novel - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1595141561/ref=nosim/?tag=dexter2a-20">Into the Wild</a> - which details the adventures of fairytale characters ... who have escaped the fairytale.&nbsp; I'll post a proper review, soon ... but, in the meantine, I wanted to say a little about &quot;meta-fiction,&quot; in general...</p>
<p>What is &quot;meta-fiction&quot;?&nbsp; Well, it's fiction in which the story is in some sense about the very telling of the story.&nbsp; You could have characters escaping from one story into another - as in Durst's novel - or discovery of a novel within&nbsp;a novel that tells the story of the first novel ... </p>
<p>There's something intellectually delicious about this.&nbsp; Indeed, any time there is any action around the boundaries of stories - whether from characters leaving stories (also seen &nbsp;in&nbsp;<place w:st="on"><city w:st="on"><span>Arnold</span></city></place><span> Schwarzenegger's </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0800177975/ref=nosim/?tag=dexter2a-20">Last Action Hero</a>), or between stories and external realities, you usually have something good and important on the pages or the screen.&nbsp; In fact, in <span>Schwarzenegger's case, this meta-energy may have spilled over into his successful political career...</span></p>
<p><span>I guess my own novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0765311976/ref=nosim/?tag=dexter2a-20">The Plot to Save Socrates</a>, is a little meta-valent ... Certainly since <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/08/letter-from-sierra-waters.html">Sierra Waters</a> sent me that letter...</span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[
Sarah Beth Durst has written a delightful fantasy novel - Into the Wild - which details the adventures of fairytale characters ... who have escaped the fairytale.&nbsp; I'll post a proper review, soon ... but, in the meantine, I wanted to say a little about &quot;meta-fiction,&quot; in general...
What is &quot;meta-fiction&quot;?&nbsp; Well, it's fiction in which the story is in some sense about the very telling of the story.&nbsp; You could have characters escaping from one story into another - as in Durst's novel - or discovery of a novel within&nbsp;a novel that tells the story of the first novel ... 
There's something intellectually delicious about this.&nbsp; Indeed, any time there is any action around the boundaries of stories - whether from characters leaving stories (also seen &nbsp;in&nbsp;Arnold Schwarzenegger's Last Action Hero), or between stories and external realities, you usually have something good and important on the pages or the screen.&nbsp; In fact, in Schwarzenegger's case, this meta-energy may have spilled over into his successful political career...
I guess my own novel, The Plot to Save Socrates, is a little meta-valent ... Certainly since Sierra Waters sent me that letter...

			<title>More on &quot;Sedition&quot; - The Play and the Professor, Then and Now</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/more_on_sedition_the_play_and_the_professor_then_and_now]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm still thinking about David Wiltse's <em>Sedition</em> - the play I saw and wrote about, <a href="http://paullev.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=242369">here</a> and <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/08/david-wiltses-sedition-premiers-in.html">elsewhere</a>, on Sunday - and I'm realizing the impact it has already had on my life and work.</p>
<p>I posted a note in my InfiniteRegress.tv blog yesterday, about <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/08/abcs-abuse-of-american-electorate-to-be.html">ABC News' misreporting</a> of the results of its own post-debate polls - in particular, ABC somehow forgetting to mention that Ron Paul came in first.</p>
<p>Now, I've written political posts before, and many critical of the media, but I have to say I had a special zest and focus when writing that post - and listing it on Digg, where it now has more than <a href="http://digg.com/2008_us_elections/Fordham_Univ_Prof_to_Include_ABC_s_Mis_Reporting_Ron_Paul_in_Curriculum">800 Diggs</a>.&nbsp; Wiltse's <em>Sedition</em> stirred that part of me that knows that being a&nbsp;worthwhile professor is more than teaching your students in the classroom - it is taking a stand on important public issues, and using your voice to bring issues to the public's attention.</p>
<p>This, of course, is the lesson Professor Schrag taught us in <em>Sedition</em>.&nbsp; I am grateful for having been reminded of it at Sunday's splendid performance in Westport.</p>

<p>I was honored and pleased to be informed, a few days ago, that I'm in the above Twitter Mosaic&nbsp; - Bogey and Bergman in the <em>Casablanca</em> movie poster.</p>

<p>Now <em>Casablanca</em> is one of my favorite movies, and I'm a Bogey and Bergman fan - and I assume you've all heard of that great movie and actor and actress.</p>

<p>But what's a Twitter Mosaic?</p>

<p>First, Twitter.com is part of the new Web wave of social applications.&nbsp; In Twitter's case, you can keep in instant touch with what your friends, family, business associates, whatever are doing.&nbsp; You'll find a Twitter Box on the bottom left of this page.&nbsp; By all means check out it, and, if you like it - how could you not - by all means &quot;follow&quot; me on Twitter, and I'll do the same for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm PaulLev over there.</p>

<p>Which&nbsp; brings me to the Mosaic.&nbsp; Twitter_mosaic over on Twitter.com creates mosaics from user pictures on the site.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's how I got into the Casablance mosaic!&nbsp;&nbsp; My picture never had it so good&nbsp;- actually, it's my <a href="http://infiniteregress.tv/">http://InfiniteRegress.tv</a>&nbsp; logo - except, of course, even smaller...&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was thinking about the dandelions in my garden, and how I like them every bit as much as the flowers and bulbs I've deliberately planted.</p>
<p>I've never understood the general dislike of weeds that flower - ranging in some cases to a mania to want to pull them out.&nbsp; If the color is nice, if the flower adds some sparkle to your lawn, why pick a fight with that?</p>
<p>I could understand if the unplanted flowers were so aggressive that they took over everything you carefully planted.&nbsp; But dandelions, though a stubborn species, pose no threat to most planted flowers.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, they do just fine with daisies, black-eyed susans, and violets (which I guess, in some quarters, are also considered weeds).</p>
<p>Bottom line (of plants) for me:&nbsp; dandelions and violets are really no different than more exotic wildflowers.&nbsp; It's good to see them - for when&nbsp;they pop up, you're seeing the result of a what some breeze blew over, and it's nice to see the cosmos at work in that...</p>

			<title>Wiltse's &quot;Sedition&quot;: Perfect Medium for 1917 First Amendment Story</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/wiltse_s_sedition_perfect_medium_for_1917_first_amendment_story]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>There's something about a play - seeing the action in person, rather than through or on a screen, can be uniquely moving.&nbsp; And when the play is about a political issue, the intellectual and emotion combination can make a permanent impact for the better on your psyche.</p>
<p>We just got back from David Wiltse's <em>Sedition</em>, premiering this weekend at the Westpost Country Playhouse in Connecticut.&nbsp; Mark Shanahan - known to readers and listeners of <font color="#993300">Light</font> <font color="#993366">On</font> <font color="#cc3399">Light</font> <font color="#cc6699">Through</font> as one of the <a href="http://paullev.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=241319">Four Phils</a> - plays Associate Professor Cassidy, in this powerful play about Wiltse's real grandfather, Andrew Schlag, Professor of German in Nebraska during World War I.</p>
<p>This is a&nbsp;story about the beginning of the erosion of the First Amendment in World War I - an erosion which has attained deluge proportions with the Patriot Act and the&nbsp;FCC's and Congress's attack on broadcasting.&nbsp; Seeing&nbsp;this story in play format, about a time in which there was no television,&nbsp;radio was an infant, and even motion pictures were just a little beyond toddling, was especially appropriate and effective.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the garb for 1917, we in the&nbsp;2007 audience became part of that 1917 world, by virtue of sitting in a live audience, the way people did back then.</p>
<p>A problem with the medium of the theater, of course, is that, if you don't live in the area, it's not easy for you to see the play.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if you get a chance to see <em>Sedition</em> - if it by chance&nbsp;gets made into a movie, or&nbsp;turns up on television or YouTube - you'll be&nbsp;glad you&nbsp;saw it, if only through the more remote media of our&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile for the politics of the play, see <a href="http://paullevinson.blogspot.com/2007/08/david-wiltses-sedition-premiers-in.html">my review</a>: David Wiltse's&nbsp;&quot;Sedition&quot; Premiers in Westport: Powerful Championship of&nbsp;First Amendment.</p>

<p><hr/></p>
<p><font color="#000000">It was Arthur C.

<p>The magic of Bluetooth is that you quickly feel as if you're not even talking on a cell phone, or via any device.&nbsp; You're talking, and your voice is somehow magically transported.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having a conversation via Bluetooth, I think, is the closest we have to mental telepathy.</p>
<p>I especially like it in my car.&nbsp; My Prius is Bluetooth-enabled.&nbsp; This means that as soon as I start the car, I can receive and make calls - through the car's dashboard.&nbsp; True,&nbsp;I do have to have my cell phone in my pocket or otherwise in the car.&nbsp; But, again, I'm often not even aware that there's a cell phone involved.&nbsp; It feels to me, for all the world, as I'm talking to you or whomever, right through my car - even though, of course, you're nowhere near my car.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I first fell for the Starland Vocal Band in the summer of 1976.&nbsp; My wife and I were on our honeymoon in London, and the BBC was playing &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot; at least a couple of times an hour.</p>

<p>The record has everything - vibrant harmonies, catchy tune, and a clever and well crafted lyric.&nbsp; I agree with every word of it.&nbsp; Why wait until the cold dark night if you can have it right now, in the afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus, it's fun&nbsp;easily seeing the person&nbsp;you're making love to... </p>

<p>Bill Danoff wrote a classic song.</p>

<p>The Starland Vocal Band is often cited as a classic one-hit wonder.&nbsp; Although Bill Danoff and Taffy Nivert Danoff (half of the Starlight Vocal Band) had earlier written &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; with John Denver, and often performed with him, nothing much happened with the Band after &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot;.</p>

<p>Doesn't matter.&nbsp; Bill and Taffy and Margot Chapman and Jon Carroll made a&nbsp;record which, although it's only one, can stand up to the best of the Mamas and Papas and the other great harmony groups.</p>

<p>Why I am a writing about them now?&nbsp; I just came across their page of MySpace, and put in them in my <a href="http://www.myspace.com/twiceuponarhyme">Top Friends</a> - which, in a way, they've been for years...</p>

<p>One other thing ... I just noticed - I may have already known but forgot - that the Starlight Vocal Band's second album is titled <em>Rear View Mirror</em>.</p>

<p>Like <font color="#cc3366">Light</font> <font color="#9966cc">On</font> <font color="#9933ff">Light</font> <font color="#9900cc">Through</font>, <em>Rear View Mirror</em> is a phrase that Marshall McLuhan loved to use...</p>

			<title>My Worst Novel</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/my_worst_novel]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span>I was not happy when I came across a critic's snooty review of <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/paullevinson/books.html#borrowed">Borrowed Tides</a> a few years ago, which concluded that it was my worst novel.</span></p>
<p><span>I moaned about this to a friend, who helpfully remarked that, hey, some novel that you wrote has to be your worst - they can't all be your best - so why be concerned about it?</span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[I was not happy when I came across a critic's snooty review of Borrowed Tides a few years ago, which concluded that it was my worst novel.
I moaned about this to a friend, who helpfully remarked that, hey, some novel that you wrote has to be your worst - they can't all be your best - so why be concerned about it?
I understand the logic, but still...
Borrowed Tides is about the first starship to Alpha Centauri, that leaves our solar system in the 2020s - with only enough fuel for a one-way trip.&nbsp; That's not so bad as a plot device, is it?&nbsp; The captain is a philosopher, his second is an expert in Native American mythology (which plays a role in the story), there's a passionate woman with great taste in rock 'n' roll, and a Russian, and a Japanese gardener - what's wrong with that?
True, I do have the ship turning at pretty steep angles travelling at half speed of light - which violates what we know about bodies in motion here on Earth - but deep space and half-speed-of-light speed isn't exactly what we have here on Earth either, is it?&nbsp;
And it does seem, as the ship rounds Alpha Centauri, that it's starting to roll backwards in time ... 

So there you have it, Borrowed Tides, my worst novel...

<p>The name of textbook Sterin is writing is <em>Mass Media for the Digital Millennium</em>.&nbsp; Allyn &amp; Bacon, its publisher, say it &quot;will be the first college textbook with an embedded and assignable media component built from the ground up&quot;.&nbsp; Students will be able read about Marshall McLuhan, for example, maybe even what I say about McLuhan in my <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/paullevinson/books.html#digmcl">Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium</a>, and then click on me talking about McLuhan, nearly ten years after my book was published.</p>
<p>I'm&nbsp;one of fifteen &quot;experts&quot;&nbsp;who are&nbsp;being so&nbsp;invited by Sterin into his book.&nbsp; I'm not only honored, of course - but gratified to be part of the future that McLuhan, I, and so&nbsp;many other have been&nbsp;predicting - the integration of word, written and spoken, and the image.&nbsp; As I've been saying for years - that's the way our&nbsp;brains operate, why not our media?</p>

			<title>Coleridge's Tears</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Ever wonder why people cry their eyes out at a movie or a television show?<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not just children, but men and women, fully grown?<span>&nbsp; </span>Not about a documentary about a slain president or a real-life princess who died too young, but about characters and plots that are purely fiction?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Hey, ever wonder why <em>you</em> have cried during such presentations, and I bet there is nearly no one on this planet who has not?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Samuel Taylor Coleridge had the answer &ndash; even though he was writing a good fifty years before the invention of motion pictures.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691018618/ref=nosim/?tag=dexter2a-20">Biographia Literaria</a>, published in 1817, the man who wrote the "Rime of the Ancient Mariner"? talks about "that willing suspension of disbelief, for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith"?.<span>&nbsp; </span>(Interestingly, later in the same paragraph, Coleridge also disparagingly mentions "the film of familiarity and selfish solicitude"? which can get in the way of that willing suspension, but he of course is not talking about our kind of film.)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Let&rsquo;s substitute "filmic"? for "poetic,"? and see how Coleridge&rsquo;s observation explains our tears in front of screens.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>First, Coleridge recognizes that we approach a movie or television show &ndash; as indeed we do a poem, a short story, or a novel &ndash; with a healthy degree of skepticism or "disbelief"?.<span>&nbsp; </span>We do not believe for an instant that what is up there on the screen or down there on the page is really happening.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We have to be coaxed or persuaded to pretend that it&rsquo;s real.<span>&nbsp; </span>The disbelief, in other words, is not only suspended or put aside, but knowingly so.<span>&nbsp; </span>We become, literally, double-minded, one part knowing that what we&rsquo;re looking at is not really happening, the other part playing along with the illusion that it is.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>This point is absolutely crucial, and by the way makes appreciation of fiction very different from propaganda, in which the goal of the communicator is to make us suspend our disbelief and forget that we ever had it in first place.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In contrast, we can cry our eyes out, get frightened at a horror movie, all from the safe vantage point of knowing, just a stone&rsquo;s throw away in our mind, that there&rsquo;s nothing really, truly to cry or get scared about.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Now, admittedly, there may be other things that go into this mix &ndash; willing suspension of disbelief need not operate in solitude.<span>&nbsp; </span>We might cry at a movie or television show because it reminds us of something sad or tragic that happened in our lives, or our world, and there would be no disbelief making us cry in that.<span>&nbsp; </span>We would be crying because our experience, sadly, made what we saw on the screen all too believable.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Or we might cry because we see something on the screen which relates not to a real experience, but evokes a similar emotion we felt about some other experience &ndash; grief, like all human emotions, is easily transferable.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If we cried in real life because we were jilted, we might well cry about some other kind of loss we see depicted on the screen.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Willing suspension of disbelief, then, is not only something which does not operate in isolation, it is usually part of complex continuum of experiences we had and did not have, all drawn into the emotional festivities by the poet or filmmaker.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>And, if we with agree with Coleridge, it all lasts but a moment.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pretty powerful, high-octane stuff.<span>&nbsp; </span>The spice of life &ndash; and art.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Dear Readers - I received the following this morning in my e-mail, and, after much consideration, I've decided to post it on all of my blogs, in an effort to be of whatever assistance I can to Sierra ...</em></p>
<p>Dear Dr. Levinson - Pardon this unexpected e-mail, but since you have written about me, and my work, I thought you might be receptive. Truthfully, I'm can't be at all sure that this will even reach you. Setting e-mail to be delivered at a future date is one thing.&nbsp; Setting e-mail to be delivered in the past is, of course, something quite else.</p>
<p>First, I do want to sincerely thank you for all the good things you have <a href="http://paullevinson.info/books.html">written about me</a>, and for the good attention you have brought to me from <a href="http://www.curledup.com/plotsave.htm">others</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means a lot to me, believe me.&nbsp; I also appreciate the care you have taken in not revealing too much of my story, in too much detail - you seem to understand the dangers of too much leaked information in what I am doing.</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, I would ask you, and anyone who reads this, to convey whatever information you might have about the whereabouts and activities of the following people in 2008:&nbsp; Alcibiades, Heron of Alexandria, and Thomas O'Leary.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first two are of course historical figures, and may be and in fact are likely using different names in 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any information about their 2008 activities would be enormously helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thomas O'Leary is of course a much more common name.&nbsp; I am interested in the Thomas O'Leary who is a member of the secretive Millennium Club in New York City, and, also, I believe, teaches as an &quot;adjunct,&quot; likely in philosophy or history, in one or two universities in New York.</p>
<p>I've have taken the liberty of setting an account for myself on your system - I can be reached at <a href="mailto:Sierra@LightonLightThrough.com">Sierra@LightonLightThrough.com</a> </p>

			<title>The Lives and Times of Dr. Phil D'Amato</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/the_lives_and_times_of_dr_phil_d_amato]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span>Shaun Farrell recently completed his podiobook of my novel, The Silk Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaun was the 4th Dr. Phil D'Amato ... Who is Phil D'Amato? Well, this seems like a good time to lay out some of&nbsp;his key biographical details...</span></p>

<p><span>Dr. Phil D'Amato is a fictional forensic detective with the NYPD, who has a penchant for getting involved in strange cases...</span></p>

<p><span>Here is his story...</span></p>

<p><span><strong>The First Phil</strong>: That would be me - Phil D'Amato's author, and creator. I started telling his story in the summer of 1993, when I came across Stephen Hawking's &quot;Chronology Protection Conjecture&quot;. Even if time travel were mathematically possible, Hawking thought that the universe would not let it happen. Because time travel could unravel the whole cause-and-effect moorings of the universe .... Somehow, in my mind, that became a great set-up for a metaphysical murder mystery. Phil investigates the death of scientists whose only link was that they were working together on a time-travel project, now abandoned.</span></p>

<p><span>The short story - actually, a novelette, &quot;<a href="http://www.sff.net/people/paullevinson/books.html#shortfic"><span>The Chronology Protection Case</span></a>,&quot; at over 7500 words - was published in the September 1995 issue of <span><em>Analog Magazine</em></span>. It became an immediate hit, getting nominations for the <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/paullevinson/books.html#awards">Nebula and Sturgeon Awards</a>, and being reprinted in what by 2005 would be three books (<em><span>Supernatural Sleuths</span></em>, <em><span>Nebula Awards 32</span></em>, and <em><span>The Best Time Travel Stories Of All Time</span></em>), as well one online magazine. I went on to publish &quot;<a href="http://www.sff.net/people/paullevinson/books.html#shortfic"><span>The Copyright Notice Case</span></a>&quot; in 1996 (Nebula nominee, and winner of the Homer award) and &quot;<a href="http://www.sff.net/people/paullevinson/books.html#shortfic"><span>The Mendelian Lamp Case</span></a>&quot; in 1998 (reprinted in <span><em>Best SF#3</em></span>, <span><em>Science Fiction Theater</em></span>, and <span><em>The Hard SF Renaissance</em></span>) - both featuring Phil, both in <span><em>Analog</em></span> - and then I turned my attention to&nbsp;getting Phil into the covers of novels...</span></p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.sff.net/people/paullevinson/books.html#silkcode"><span>The Silk Code</span></a>, published in 1999, was my first novel and my first Phil D'Amato novel. It went on to win the <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/paullevinson/books.html#awards"><span>Locus Award for Best First Novel of 1999</span></a> (a rarity for me - I usually get no further than nominations). <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/paullevinson/books.html#conplag"><span>The Consciousness Plague</span></a> followed in 2002 and <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/paullevinson/books.html#pixel"><span>The Pixel Eye</span></a> in 2003.

<p><span>But, by then, Phil was already leading a second life...</span></p>

<p><span><strong>The Second Phil</strong>: In February 2002, I returned from a science fiction convention in <city w:st="on"></city><place w:st="on"></place>Boston (&quot;Boskone&quot;) to find a letter from Jay Kensinger. Who was Jay? I had no idea. Turned out he was a filmmaker in <city w:st="on"></city><place w:st="on"></place>San Francisco, who had made a low-budget movie of &quot;The Chronology Protection Case&quot;. Jay wrote the screen play, directed, and acted in his movie - right, he played Phil. We worked out all the legal details <em>ex post facto</em> and <em>pdq</em>. The movie is a little more than 30 minutes, and it's been shown to rave audiences at science fiction conventions around the country (I was only stirring up the crowd, from the back of the room, at some of them.) Jay recently made <span>a trailer for the movie</span> (scroll down the right hand column to see the trailer). You might also want to see some of Jay's other work (search on his name on YouTube). I really like it - movies by the second Phil....</span></p>

<p><span><strong>The Third Phil</strong>: walked into my office at <place w:st="on"></place><placename w:st="on"></placename>Fordham <placetype w:st="on"></placetype>University, about a month after I'd first heard from the second Phil. I had <span><em>The Chronology Protection Case</em> movie</span> on a tv screen in my office (now you see how hard I work at that job...) (no, really, I'm Chair of the Department of Communication and Media Studies, I was doing <em>research</em>, Your Honor...) But little did I know that the person who walked in was none other than Mark Shanahan - a gifted actor and voice-over pro. Mark liked the movie, asked what I thought about his writing a radioplay of the story.... Of course I said yes...</span></p>

<p><em><span><em>Fast forward to June, 2003, <city w:st="on"></city><place w:st="on"></place>New York City...</em> </span></em><span>Zoom in to a table ... at which are seated Mark, Jay, and me! We're all in tuxedos (another rarity). We're at the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Award gala dinner. The <span>radioplay for <em>The Chronology Protection Case</em></span> has been nominated for an Edgar Award for Best Mystery Stage Drama of 2002! (You can hear it by clicking on the Odeo player in the right-hand column.&nbsp; It's pretty close to the top.&nbsp; It's free.&nbsp; Enjoy.) Of course, it didn't win ... like I told you above, about being nominated and winning? But it was a great evening, anyway!</span></p>

<p><span>Here's how we got there: Mark's <span>radioplay of <em>The Chronology Protection Case</em></span> was performed live at the <placetype w:st="on"></placetype>Museum of <placename w:st="on"></placename>Television and Radio in <city w:st="on"></city><place w:st="on"></place>New York City, September 2002. That was what received the nomination. </span></p>

<p><span>Mark, of course, not only wrote the radioplay, but, like Jay, plays Phil! (Something about that Phil - anyone who writes him wants to be him.) Mark also went on to co-produce a studio version of the radioplay, available from Audible. </span></p>

<p><span>But if you like free, that brings us, ever so smoothly, to ...</span></p>

<p><strong><span><strong>The Fourth Phil</strong>:</span></strong><span> Who&nbsp;would be&nbsp;Shaun Farrell, who, as I mentioned when I started telling you Phil's life story,&nbsp;just finished&nbsp;a <a target="_blank" href="http://thesilkcode.blogspot.com/"><span>podiobook of <span><em>The Silk Code</em></span></span></a>.&nbsp; It was #1, by the way, for more than a month over on podiobooks.com&nbsp;- hey, not winning an award, but I and the other Phils will take it....&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span><strong>The Fifth Phil</strong>:</span></strong><span> Ooops - ok, I'm getting ahead of myself here. But the Fifth Phil will be whoever plays him in the first Phil D'Amato feature-length movie, or TV show, neither of which has happened yet....<br/>=============</span></p>

<p><span>Meanwhile, here are some other important facts about the Phils that I didn't want to get lost in the above:</span></p>

<p><span>A - Two Phils (me and Shanahan) are irredeemable New Yorkers; the other two (Jay and Shaun) are Californians.</span></p>

<p><span>B - I'm writing a new Phil D'Amato novel - but first I have to finish the sequel to <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/paullevinson/books.html#socreading"><em><span>The Plot to Save Socrates</span></em></a>.</span></p>

<p><span>C - I got the name Phil D'Amato as follows: I have an old friend on the NYPD whose first name is Phil. I tacked on D'Amato, because Al D'Amato was Senator from <state w:st="on"></state><place w:st="on"></place>New York at the time, and I thought every time his name was mentioned, it would be good publicity for me and my stories. Al lost the very next election. (But someone did tell me that Phil D'Amato means love love - true!)</span></p>

<p><span>D- Mark Shanahan starred in the <place w:st="on"></place><city w:st="on"></city>Westport (<state w:st="on"></state>Connecticut) County Playhouse performance of <em><span>Journey's End</span></em>.&nbsp; He's currently performing in David Wiltse's <em>Sedition </em>in that very same playhouse.&nbsp; I'll be joining him this Sunday - August 5 - on a panel to discuss the play (about the beginning of the 20th century assault on the First Amendment, in World War I).&nbsp; Two Phils on the same stage ...</span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Shaun Farrell recently completed his podiobook of my novel, The Silk Code.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shaun was the 4th Dr. Phil D'Amato ... Who is Phil D'Amato? Well, this seems like a good time to lay out some of&nbsp;his key biographical details...

Dr. Phil D'Amato is a fictional forensic detective with the NYPD, who has a penchant for getting involved in strange cases...

Here is his story...

The First Phil: That would be me - Phil D'Amato's author, and creator. I started telling his story in the summer of 1993, when I came across Stephen Hawking's &quot;Chronology Protection Conjecture&quot;. Even if time travel were mathematically possible, Hawking thought that the universe would not let it happen. Because time travel could unravel the whole cause-and-effect moorings of the universe .... Somehow, in my mind, that became a great set-up for a metaphysical murder mystery. Phil investigates the death of scientists whose only link was that they were working together on a time-travel project, now abandoned.

The short story - actually, a novelette, &quot;The Chronology Protection Case,&quot; at over 7500 words - was published in the September 1995 issue of Analog Magazine. It became an immediate hit, getting nominations for the Nebula and Sturgeon Awards, and being reprinted in what by 2005 would be three books (Supernatural Sleuths, Nebula Awards 32, and The Best Time Travel Stories Of All Time), as well one online magazine. I went on to publish &quot;The Copyright Notice Case&quot; in 1996 (Nebula nominee, and winner of the Homer award) and &quot;The Mendelian Lamp Case&quot; in 1998 (reprinted in Best SF#3, Science Fiction Theater, and The Hard SF Renaissance) - both featuring Phil, both in Analog - and then I turned my attention to&nbsp;getting Phil into the covers of novels...

The Silk Code, published in 1999, was my first novel and my first Phil D'Amato novel. It went on to win the Locus Award for Best First Novel of 1999 (a rarity for me - I usually get no further than nominations). The Consciousness Plague followed in 2002 and The Pixel Eye in 2003. (The Silk Code and The Consciousness Plague have also been published in Polish editions. And &quot;The Mendelian Lamp Case&quot;&nbsp;has seen print in Czech.)

But, by then, Phil was already leading a second life...

The Second Phil: In February 2002, I returned from a science fiction convention in Boston (&quot;Boskone&quot;) to find a letter from Jay Kensinger. Who was Jay? I had no idea. Turned out he was a filmmaker in San Francisco, who had made a low-budget movie of &quot;The Chronology Protection Case&quot;.

Jay recently made a trailer for the movie (scroll down the right hand column to see the trailer). You might also want to see some of Jay's other work (search on his name on YouTube). I really like it - movies by the second Phil....

D- Mark Shanahan starred in the Westport (Connecticut) County Playhouse performance of Journey's End.&nbsp; He's currently performing in David Wiltse's Sedition in that very same playhouse.&nbsp; I'll be joining him this Sunday - August 5 - on a panel to discuss the play (about the beginning of the 20th century assault on the First Amendment, in World War I).&nbsp; Two Phils on the same stage ...

<p><span>Yeah ... about seven or eight years ago, I took a sprig of Trailing Myrtle (known also as Vinca minor or Periwinkle - great names - looks a lot like the above) and planted it on the side of our house that receives almost no sun. It was so shady there that even the few deep-forest ferns I planted were struggling. You could almost hear them gasping for sunlight. There were so few roots around that every good rain or melting snow - or worse, a hard rain after a deep freeze - had a fair chance of flooding our crawl space.</span></p>
<p><span>I pretty much forgot about the ferns and Myrtle, both.</span></p>
<p><span>But some of our trees were trimmed last Fall, and I just noticed on the side of our house that the struggling plants are doing splendidly. The ferns are big and feathery. Trailing Myrtle covers almost a entire, formerly vacant area. Bright green leaves and little purple flowers are everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span>And it did rain cats and dogs last week, and, come to think of it, the crawl space got wet but not flooded.</span></p>
<p><span>Not to make too much of this, but I think there's a lesson here - sometimes it's good to just do one little thing, and then let it go, and see where the vagaries of nature and trimmed trees take it...</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I used to drink coffee, a long time ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>I still love the taste. <span>&nbsp;</span>My favorite gelato is coffee.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the brew itself developed the strange effect of turning me into a real grouch the next day. Some people said this was a complete reversal for me.<br/><br/>I can't recall just when I switched to tea.<br/><br/>Tea's a touchy thing.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[I used to drink coffee, a long time ago.&nbsp; I still love the taste. &nbsp;My favorite gelato is coffee.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the brew itself developed the strange effect of turning me into a real grouch the next day. Some people said this was a complete reversal for me.I can't recall just when I switched to tea.Tea's a touchy thing. It's not that good in northern New Jersey, and I'd guess that's because of the water. It's almost always good in London, probably for the same reason. In New York City, and close by, tea can be good.

<p>Twitter and Pownce let us tell our friends exactly what we are doing, or what we will be doing, or have just done - and we can similarly follow what our friends (or followers, fans) are up to.&nbsp; Anyone can get on Twitter.&nbsp; You have to be invited to get on Pownce (I somehow made it on) - it's a very sleek, cool, useful system, created by some of the people who made Digg.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Well, it’s <a href="http://www.travelspeak.org/as/thailand/chiangmai/blog/2007/07/19/panda-poo-a-big-hit-at-chiang-mai-zoo/">back in the news</a> – the Chiang Mai Zoo in <country-region w:st="on"></country-region><place w:st="on"></place>China is making a handsome profile selling … panda droppings.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not hot off the press – dried.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Now, we last heard about the doings of pandas and the good use they could be put to a few months ago, when reports came out that they could and were being made into paper…</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Yes. Paper. A marvelous invention. You can fold up a sheet and easily take it with you. You can bind it&nbsp;in a book, which has the advantage of what I call &quot;reliable locatability.&quot; Even perma-links don't have this. The&nbsp;web site&nbsp;can be down when you need to access the page. But the pages in books are never down - until or unless they're lost or destroyed. The natural state of paper is that what's on page 30 today will be on page 30 tomorrow - and, if not forever, for however long the book lasts.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>You don't even need an energy source to read a book during the day -&nbsp;nice old sunlight works just&nbsp;fine. Even on cloudy days.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Paper was invented way back when - actually by Cai Lun in China in 105 AD - and was in use in the first golden ages of learning by the Chinese, Alexandrians, and Romans. It had&nbsp;its pros&nbsp;and&nbsp;cons in comparison to parchment, papyrus, and similar media. But flimsy paper outlived them all.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In our ecology-conscious age, people sometimes lash out at paper as destructive of the trees from which paper is made. We probably plant enough trees to make up for any damage, but, ok, I like trees, too.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>But now <country-region w:st="on"></country-region><place w:st="on"></place>China has live paper-making machines in pandas…</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Crazy? Well, pandas eat lots of bamboo, so the Chinese figure the paper content that comes out of this process should be pretty good.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>And there's plenty of raw material - pandas apparently produce about 20 kilograms of droppings a day...</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Freud would have had a&nbsp;good time&nbsp;with this - he thought that writing was an anal process. And there's a poetic reunion possibility if you think of one of the other uses of paper.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Come to think of it, panda paper would be particularly fitting for ... publication of nasty reviews.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Hey, I've gotten them, all writers do, and I'm a great believer in the maxim that the worst publicity is no publicity - but if I received a lousy review, it would be especially appropriate, in the&nbsp;greater theme of things, if it was printed on panda paper.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span>How about growing gardens on the tops of skyscrapers as a way of combating global warming?&nbsp; A <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/30020/">Columbia University</a> professor has proposed it.</span></p>
<p><span>This kind of &quot;skyfarming&quot; is not at all pie-in-the-sky, and is precisely the kind of answer I always give to people who say, well, even if global warming were really happening, what could we possibly do to stop or even diminish it?</span></p>
<p><span>The answer is not just using energy more carefully, or in developing further cutting-edge green-friendly technologies. The power of biology itself can also help. Fighting nature - or what we've done to nature - with nature.</span></p>
<p><span>Science fiction - ranging from Damon Knight's &quot;Natural State&quot; in the 1950s to my own more recent novel, <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/paullevinson/books.html#silkcode"><span>The Silk Code</span></a> - has been speculating about the power of the natural world, harnessed to help us, for years.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[How about growing gardens on the tops of skyscrapers as a way of combating global warming?&nbsp; A Columbia University professor has proposed it.
This kind of &quot;skyfarming&quot; is not at all pie-in-the-sky, and is precisely the kind of answer I always give to people who say, well, even if global warming were really happening, what could we possibly do to stop or even diminish it?
The answer is not just using energy more carefully, or in developing further cutting-edge green-friendly technologies. The power of biology itself can also help. Fighting nature - or what we've done to nature - with nature.
Science fiction - ranging from Damon Knight's &quot;Natural State&quot; in the 1950s to my own more recent novel, The Silk Code - has been speculating about the power of the natural world, harnessed to help us, for years. (The Amish seem to understand this better than we do.)
In a nutshell, DNA is more powerful than any computer programmed algorithm. Every living organism is an incredibly successful machine, with a design usually road tested millions or more years.

			<title>Vikings, On a Cloudy Day</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/vikings_on_a_cloudy_day]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span>The Norse - or Vikings - were an amazing seafaring people. They got as far as North America, and played a role in <country-region w:st="on"></country-region><place w:st="on"></place>Russia and the Byzantine.&nbsp; They even used crystals - sunstones - to navigate on cloudy days.</span></p>
<p><span>For most of our recent history, until the 1970s, in fact, many historians doubted that the Vikings ever made it to <place w:st="on"></place>North America. All we had of those trips were myths and legends, whispered in the Norse winds, as flimsy as chilly gusts of air. Then, finally in the 1970s, Norse remains were dug up in <state w:st="on"></state><place w:st="on"></place>Newfoundland, and carbon-dated to 1,000 AD. The time of Leif Ericson's arrival.</span></p>
<p><city w:st="on"></city><place w:st="on"></place><span>Columbus</span><span> had it much better. His son Diego published a pamphlet describing his father's voyage to the New World, and it became a best-seller in <place w:st="on"></place>Europe in 1493. One of the first, in fact, right after the Bible. And printed not only in Latin, but in French, Spanish, and a dozen vernaculars of the day. As I say in my 1997 <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/paullevinson/books.html#softedge"><em><span>The Soft Edge: A Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution</span></em></a>, we have the printing press to thank for the Age of Discovery. Without it, <city w:st="on"></city><place w:st="on"></place>Columbus' voyages might well have amounted to little more than Leif's in the wind...</span></p>
<p><span>And that concerns me, a little, like a chill down my back. You ever wonder about what happened in the ancient world, or even the Dark Ages, that we don't know about? In an age before mass media, lots of important events went unreported and unrecorded. Sometimes, even when they were recorded, they were lost. How many unique copies of scrolls and codices were lost in the burnings of the Library of Alexandria? Such questions make good material for historical fiction - I deal with some of them in the sequel to <a href="http://www.paullevinson.info/books.html"><em><span>The Plot to Save Socrates</span></em><span> </span></a>(which I'm currently at work on). But I also worry about them in our real lives.</span></p>
<p><span>Well, maybe worry is too strong a word. I certainly think about them. What cures for our illnesses were discovered in ancient times and then forgotten? The Bible (Psalm 51) says, &quot;cleanse me with hyssop, and I shall be clean&quot; - hyssops has antibiotic qualities. But we did not discover antibiotics until Fleming was struck by what the mold on his bread did to bacteria in his petrie <span>&nbsp;</span>dish, in the 20th century.</span></p>
<p><span>And trips across the <place w:st="on"></place>Atlantic, around the world? Some people think the Phoenicians made it, long before the Vikings, maybe as long ago as 1500 BC.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span>I mentioned in my <a href="http://paullev.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=228697"><span>Conversation with science fiction author Rob Saywer</span></a> here a few weeks ago that we might have gotten to Mars in 1965.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some further details, as Freeman Dyson laid them out at the Guggenheim in <city w:st="on"><place w:st="on"><city w:st="on"></city><place w:st="on"></place>New York City</place></city> a few months. He might have been on the mission. He helped design it. This isn't science fiction.</span></p>
<p><span>In the immediate aftermath of the Sputnik 1 in October 1957, the door was wide open in <country-region w:st="on"><place w:st="on"><country-region w:st="on"></country-region><place w:st="on"></place>America</place></country-region> for all kinds of projects that might give us a jump on the Soviets in space. No mean goal, since the Soviets obviously had a healthy head-start.</span></p>
<p><span>Project Orion was one of those projects. Use atom bombs not as weapons but fuel for a rocket to the solar system. The rocket would travel fast enough to get us to Mars in two swift months. With a cargo hold as big as an auditorium.</span></p>
<p><span>The project had drawbacks. People were concerned about political fallout that would result from nuclear fallout from the fuel. Of course, in those days - the 1950s and 1960s - nuclear testing was already dumping lots of dangerous radiation into the atmosphere. Orion's contribution to that would have been neglible. But it was too much, politically.</span></p>
<p><span>The project also died of competition from Apollo. Politicians had one-track minds in those days - commitment to one space project was more than enough. Orion got an initial green light in 1958, only to be killed by JFK in the early 1960s - the same JFK who set us on a trip to the Moon via Apollo.</span></p>
<p><span>Is it too late for Orion to be resuscitated? According to Dyson, its time has passed. Nuclear power is still too slow a propellant for trips to the stars. Laser sails are better for that. And although it still takes four times longer to get to Mars by chemically-launched vehicles today than it would have by the nuclear-powered ship Dyson and his colleagues were building, we've mastered the production of our current chemical ships to the point that it wouldn't pay to go back to Project Orion.</span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[A&nbsp;report in last Friday's Washington Post, by way of a BBC translation of an Iranian editorial entitled &quot;Spying Squirrels,&quot; reveals the following -
A few weeks ago, 14 squirrels equipped with espionage systems of foreign intelligence services were captured by [Iranian] intelligence forces along the country's borders. These trained squirrels, each of which weighed just over 700 grams, were released on the borders of the country for intelligence and espionage purposes .... Fixing GPS devices, bugging instruments and advanced cameras in the bodies of trained animals like squirrels, mice, hamsters, etc, are among modern methods of collecting intelligence.Holy cow! I'm not really surprised - in fact, flattered - because that's exactly the scenario of my 2003 science fiction novel, The Pixel Eye! (There are reviews etc here.)Now, according to folks in the intelligence community (I never thought I'd be using that phrase... ), the Iranians frequently do this sort of thing - they make up preposterous cases of spying, to keep their people on edge, and to be able to claim victimhood in the world community.I'm going to talk to my agent about whether I can get the Iranians to send me a royalty .... Now, if I hear that they think we're spying on them via chairs in dining clubs that time travel, I'll know they're really on to me... &nbsp;
In the meantime, here are seven totally true stories about my intersections with squirrels ... 
1. My wife and I were visiting Marshall McLuhan at his Wychwood Park home in Toronto in 1978. He proudly pointed to a black squirrel running around his front door. &quot;We have the only black squirrels in existence, right here,&quot; he said. I nodded - for all I knew then, it was true. I hadn't focused on squirrels too much before then. As soon as we got back home to the Bronx, though, I noticed three black squirrels in under a week.
2. At some point in my study of the Shannon-Weaver model of communication (I can hear 10,000 students groaning), I discovered exactly how they came to devise this model. There were lots of problems with telephone service after World War II, with big increases in the suburban population. S&amp;W were assigned the task of finding out what was causing the problem. In so doing, they came up with the S&amp;W model. And the cause of the problem in service: squirrels chewing up the new overhead wires that the phone co had put in the suburbs.

6. Another student, by the name of Maurizio, once asked me why I prefer birds to squirrels. I think it's because squirrels are usually more arrogant - though, come to think of it, arrogance is a quality I can admire in people.
7. Not to end this on a down note, but in the South, they call squirrels &quot;tree rabbits,&quot; and, well, you get the picture...

            <link><![CDATA[http://paullev.libsyn.com/sea_gulls_and_hermit_crabs]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><font color="#339900">this a sponsored post</font></p>
<p><hr/></p>
<p>We just got back from Cape Cod a few weeks ago. We've been renting a little cottage - Sandpiper - for a few weeks, a month, a few times for a few months during the summer - from the owner since 1982. It's the easiest way to get a piece of paradise.</p>
<p>In our case, that's a quiet beach. You can walk on it for miles on some days, with mostly seagulls and&nbsp;hermit crabs for company.</p>
<p>How much would it cost to buy a place like that? A small fortune. Plus, you have to worry about locking it up for the winter, turning off the electricity and the water, and the possibility of a storm that could wipe it all away.</p>
<p>So, yes, we're believers in vacation rentals from the owner. It's the best combination of continuity, reliability, and minimum expense for the vistas. In our case, my wife's sister recommended this place to us, and she in turn had found out about it about from old friend.</p>
<p>But Vacation Rentals By Owners is a neat resource for getting a vacation rental anywhere in the country. Whether Cape Cod or <a href="http://www.vlbo.com/california/">California vacation rentals</a> - anywhere in the country - you'll find your perfect vacation here.</p>
<p>I'm really tempted to go for another vacation, right now...</p>

<p>Also in this episode: a medley of our music from our podcasts since October (which was the beginning of Light On Light Through), including samples from Idris Elba, Ebony Moore, Jeffrey Foucault, and B J Cunningham - look at the show notes for previous episodes, for details about where to find and hear more of their music.</p>
<p>I'll be back again next week, in 2007.&nbsp; In the meantime, enjoy...</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Happy New Year!&nbsp; And welcome to Episode 15 of Light On Light Through:&nbsp; The Stuff of the Cosmos ... Carl Sagan, who died ten years ago at the end of December, said that, because we come from the cosmos, when&nbsp;we look out at the cosmos with our telescopes, we are but the stuff of the cosmos looking back at itself ... in this New Year's podcast we explore the meaning and impact of Carl Sagan's thought, including his dual pursuit of knowledge and fame ... and we look at the need of our species to get beyond this planet and out into the cosmos, our truest home...
Also in this episode: a medley of our music from our podcasts since October (which was the beginning of Light On Light Through), including samples from Idris Elba, Ebony Moore, Jeffrey Foucault, and B J Cunningham - look at the show notes for previous episodes, for details about where to find and hear more of their music.
I'll be back again next week, in 2007.&nbsp; In the meantime, enjoy...

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Happy holidays! Episode 14 of <font color="#009900">Light On </font><font color="#ff0000">Light Through </font>is mostly about food ... in particular the revolution in convenience and delicious eating being brought about by places like <strong>Trader Joe's</strong> ... I talk not only about the great food you can get there, but about hearing <strong>Wolfman Jack</strong> on the radio while I was shopping at <strong>Trader Joe's </strong>... </p>

<p>Also in this episode ... the Mo' or more is about <em>YouTube </em>again ... <em>Time Magazine</em> picked everyone as its &quot;person of the year,&quot; in large part because <em>YouTube</em> has made video producers of us all ... just as I was talking about in Episode 10, <em>Every Eye's A Camera, Every Ear's A Mike</em> here a few weeks ago ... you can still catch that episode of you like ... and in just the past week, <em>YouTube</em> has demonstrated a different kind of value to the world:</p>

<p>It made almost immediately available the uncensored rendition of <em>Saturday Night Live</em>'s hilarious <em>Special Treat in a Box </em>skit by Andy Samberg and Justin Timberlake from last week. NBC, as per usual, was too afraid of the FCC to play it unbleeped on the air, but once <em>YouTube </em>led the way, nbc.com followed by putting both the bleeped and non-bleeped versions on its web page.&nbsp; Can <em>YouTube</em> be the antidote to the FCC's trampling of the First Amendment? Maybe ... we'll have to see ... let's hope so...</p>

<p>And I'm very pleased to also have in this episode <strong>BJ Cunningham</strong>'s acoustic <em>Still Here With You</em>, as well as his acoustic-guitar rendition of <em>Over the Rainbow</em>...&nbsp; You can get his <em>Frontiers</em> and <em>Acoustic&nbsp;</em>albums on iTunes. &nbsp;His details and other helpful links follow:</p>

<ol><li><a href="http:///">http://cunninghamsongs.com</a> and <a href="http:///">http://www.myspace.com/bjcunningham</a></li><li><a href="http:///">http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/uncensored.shtml</a></li><li><a href="http:///">http://www.traderjoesfan.com/</a>&nbsp;and Trader Joe's at <a href="http:///">www.tribe.net</a></li><li><a href="http://educatedtastes.blogspot.com/">Educated Tastes</a> - my blog about food, drink, restaurants, groceries<br type="_moz"/></li><li>and two old-fashioned print-on-paper references about the importance of food in life and society: <em>Objective Knowledge (p. 37) </em>&nbsp;by Karl R. Popper; <em>Mechanization Takes Command</em> by Siegfried Giedion</li></ol>

<p>Wonderful holidays to everyone!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm talking about the Golden Globe Awards, of course, and I call them &quot;The Gold Plated Globes&quot; in this Episode - lucky #13 - of <font color="#ff9900">Light On </font><font color="#999999">Light Through</font> because of what they missed on television in their nominations for 2006, announced a few days ago.&nbsp; These would be, most outrageously, <em>Kidnapped, Battlestar Galactica, </em>and <em>The Wire</em>.&nbsp; They did get a few things right - that's why I call them goldplated, rather than silverplated, or no-plated - and among the&nbsp;accomplisments well recognized are Michael C. Hall's performance in <em>Dexter</em>, Michael Ealy in <em>Sleeper Cell</em>, Bill Paxton in <em>Big Love</em> - which also received a nom as best show - and of course <em>24 </em>and Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer.&nbsp; A complete list of the Golden Globe nominations for 2006 - including not only television but movies - can be seen at the <a href="http://www.hfpa.org/news/id/42">Hollywood Foreign Press Association</a> website&nbsp;- they're the folks who bestow these awards.</p>
<p>Other sites I mention on the show - not about the Gold-plateds but science fiction - include:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the 10th Episode of <font color="#ff6633">Light On </font><font color="#990000">Light Through </font><font color="#000000">... <strong><em>Every Eye's A Camera, Every Ear's A Mike ... or, How the Cell Phone On YouTube Has Made Movie Stars of Us All, For Better or Worse...</em></strong></font></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I say it's the best show about the real world on television - but is <em>The Wire</em> as good as it was without Stringer Bell?&nbsp; In Episode 5 of <font color="#ff3300">Light On Light Through </font><font color="#000000">I probe the powerful appeal of bad guys with redeeming qualities, and look at the contribution of Idris Elba aka Stringer Bell to <em>The Wire</em>.&nbsp; &quot;The Wire Without Stringer&quot; is a little longer than most episodes of this podcast, because it has a special treat near the end....</font></p>

<p>.... a minute or so of Idris' great new hip-hop soul recording, <em>Johnny Was</em>... move over, Bob Marley</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[I say it's the best show about the real world on television - but is The Wire as good as it was without Stringer Bell?&nbsp; In Episode 5 of Light On Light Through I probe the powerful appeal of bad guys with redeeming qualities, and look at the contribution of Idris Elba aka Stringer Bell to The Wire.&nbsp; &quot;The Wire Without Stringer&quot; is a little longer than most episodes of this podcast, because it has a special treat near the end....

.... a minute or so of Idris' great new hip-hop soul recording, Johnny Was... move over, Bob Marley

Enjoy!
