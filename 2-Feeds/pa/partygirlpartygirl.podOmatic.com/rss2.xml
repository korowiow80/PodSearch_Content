We all know what 'oral' sex is, but what is 'aural sex'? It's all the sounds, moans, sighs, and dirty talk that goes on in the bedroom!

Darlene would like you listen to today's show to hear about just what she is doing to change the world when it comes to Aural Sex, and how you can help.

      <itunes:summary>Darlene has a very special project that she needs you to help with!  We all know what 'oral' sex is, but what is 'aural sex'? It's all the sounds, moans, sighs, and dirty talk that goes on in the bedroom!  While there are lots of resources to learn oral sex, sexual positions, and so on...there is very little out there to teach one how to talk dirty or use sounds to heighten the passion.

So here is where you, the PartyGirl PartyGirl Podcast listener comes in.  Darlene would like you listen to today's show to hear about just what she is doing to change the world when it comes to Aural Sex, and how you can help.  Then head over to http://www.talkdirtyinbed.com and fill out the survey!  That's it!

Is there a difference between the two, and what is it if so?

In today's show Darlene breaks down Sexuality vs Sensuality and gives examples of each.  Do you think it's possible to turn household chores into sensual experiences?  Well, Darlene does!

We also have a brand new feature for the PartyGirl PartyGirl Podcast listeners!  Today is the first of a year-long segment, &quot;Sugar and Spice, 52 weeks of Passion and Romance&quot;!  We'll have one suggestion for the guys, and one suggestion for the gals to treat your lover to a Passionate or Romantic experience this week!  These are from the Passion Parties &quot;52 Weeks of Naughty Nights&quot; and &quot;52 Weeks of Passion&quot;.  Darlene has both available on her site, at http://www.thepartylady.com.

As always Darlene has her Sex Tips, but instead of a Question of the Week, Darlene has a great product review!  It goes well with her Sensual topic!

Thanks so much for listening!  We hope you had a great Valentine's Day!</description>

      <itunes:summary>I'm sure you've heard Darlene use the terms &quot;Sexuality&quot; and &quot;Sensuality&quot; quite often, but what do the really mean?  Is there a difference between the two, and what is it if so?

In today's show Darlene breaks down Sexuality vs Sensuality and gives examples of each.  Do you think it's possible to turn household chores into sensual experiences?  Well, Darlene does!

We also have a brand new feature for the PartyGirl PartyGirl Podcast listeners!  Today is the first of a year-long segment, &quot;Sugar and Spice, 52 weeks of Passion and Romance&quot;!  We'll have one suggestion for the guys, and one suggestion for the gals to treat your lover to a Passionate or Romantic experience this week!  These are from the Passion Parties &quot;52 Weeks of Naughty Nights&quot; and &quot;52 Weeks of Passion&quot;.  Darlene has both available on her site, at http://www.thepartylady.com.

As always Darlene has her Sex Tips, but instead of a Question of the Week, Darlene has a great product review!  It goes well with her Sensual topic!

Thanks so much for listening!  We hope you had a great Valentine's Day!</itunes:summary>

      <title>The PartyGirl PartyGirl Podcast - Episode 51 - Sex Toys for Passion!</title>
      <description>We've changed things up a bit here at the PartyGirl PartyGirl Podcast!

&lt;center&gt;Get ready for some NEW features!&lt;/center&gt;

This week Darlene explains the differences between Vibrators and Dildos.  You'll learn about the many types of each, and which ones may be right for you!

As always, we have our Sex Tips and the Question of the Week as well.

&lt;center&gt;Now onto the new stuff!&lt;/center&gt;

Since we've heard all the Sensual Zodiacs, this week we have an introduction to Celtic Tree Signs - which we'll have sprinkled throughout this year's podcasts.  

AND....

Welcome to Cooking with the PartyGirls!  That's right, we have a special treat for you and your lover cooking up in the kitchen - and we'll share with you how to make it!

This week is 'Heart Dips Duos' - it makes 32 cookies

Here are the ingredients:
3 tablespoons sugar (white or red) 
 (8-ounce) can refrigerated crescent rolls 
1/2 tsp cinnamon 
2 tablespoons butter, melted 
8 ounces melted semi-sweet chocolate 
1 package fresh strawberries 

And how to prepare:
Sprinkle 2 Tablespoons of sugar on a cutting board. 
Unroll crescent roll dough, separate into 4 rectangles, 
Place rectangles on top of the sugared board, 
Seal the center of each rectangle together
press dough into the sugar. 
Brush the top of the rectangles with half of the melted butter. 
Sprinkle with cinnamon and remaining sugar. 

From the long side, roll one rectangle jelly-roll fashion up to the center of the dough.
Then roll the opposite side to meet the first roll in the center.
This will create  heart shaped logs.
Wrap all 4 logs in plastic wrap and refrigerate about 30 minutes to firm up. 

Preheat oven to 375 F.
Line baking sheets with parchment or silicone sheets for best results. 

Remove dough from fridge, unwrap and place on cutting board.
Slice each roll into 8 pieces 
place about 2 inches apart on baking tray. 
Press down to 1/2-inch thickness and pinch the bottom of each slice to a point to form a heart shape.
Brush with remaining melted butter. 

Bake 9 to 13 minutes until golden. Reshape if necessary and let cool. 

Melt chocolate, stirring until smooth. 
Dip crescents halfway into chocolate and place waxed paper 
Refrigerate to harden. 
 
Dip fresh strawberries halfway into chocolate and place on waxed paper
Refrigerate to harden
 
Alternate feeding the Chocolate Duo dips to your love,  with a glass of wine or tea for a wonderful sexy treat</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;On today's episode, Darlene explains a male sex toy! &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/bold&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Gigi - a sleeve that can be used for solo masturbation, couple masturbation play, or as a girl's best friend who will 'finish off' your man dural oral play or simulate anal play.  Gigi can also be modified in a few ways for other uses - Is your man's penis a little to large for you to take in?  Do you need a little 'padding' in your bra?  Gigi can help with both!  You won't want to miss this!

      <title>The PartyGirl PartyGirl Podcast - Episode 12 Masturbation With Your Partner</title>
      <description>&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;On today's show we take Masturbation Month to a whole new level!  &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we have advice on mutual masturbation.  For the men - how to use manual stimulation to pleasure your woman.  For the ladies - how to use manual stimulation to pleasure your man.  &lt;p&gt;We talk about how to become comfortable enough, and secure enough to introduce mutual masturbation into your relationship.  And how to get to that level where you feel comfortable actually masturbating in front of your partner.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As always we have our sex tips, and our question of the week - this week's question dispels a common masturbation myth.  If you enjoyed the list of songs that suggested masturbation last week, you'll love this weeks list of movies that contain masturbation scenes!  And this week's Sensual Zodiac is the third part of the Gemini sign, discussing the sensuality of the Gemini Man.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;We'd LOVE to hear from our listeners!

      <itunes:summary>On today's show we take Masturbation Month to a whole new level!  Today we have advice on mutual masturbation.  For the men - how to use manual stimulation to pleasure your woman.  For the ladies - how to use manual stimulation to pleasure your man.  We talk about how to become comfortable enough, and secure enough to introduce mutual masturbation into your relationship.  And how to get to that level where you feel comfortable actually masturbating in front of your partner.

As always we have our sex tips, and our question of the week - this week's question dispels a common masturbation myth.  If you enjoyed the list of songs that suggested masturbation last week, you'll love this weeks list of movies that contain masturbation scenes!  And this week's Sensual Zodiac is the third part of the Gemini sign, discussing the sensuality of the Gemini Man.
