        <itunes:subtitle>The Best paranormal podcast around</itunes:subtitle>
        <itunes:summary>Strange Frequencies Radio is an internet radio broadcast, airing each Sunday afternoon from 3-6pm Eastern. We aim to cover not only paranormal topics, but also anything that may be considered fringe, or otherwise unique and interesting. This may include, but is certainly not limited to: ghosts and monsters, UFOs, conspiracy theories, unusual hobbies or professions, flat earth proponents, psychic phenomena, urban legends, therianthropes, Young Earth creationism, science, skepticism, and much much more.

    Our goal for each and every episode of Strange Frequencies Radio is simple: to provide 3 hours of informative, opinionated and fun internet talk radio that engages and enlightens both ourselves and our listeners.

Whatever it is, we're here and ready to listen. Email us at StrangeFrequenciesRadio@live.com and tell us what is on your mind.</itunes:summary>

This is where we gab about the latest weird and bizarre news pulled from headlines around the world, get into a discussion about some topic, paranormal or otherwise, and maybe even open the phone lines to get your opinions on the issues of the day.</p>

<p>At 4pm Eastern we'll speak with Stephen Hill. Steve is an old friend of the show and a big proponent of what the paranormal world calls ITC, particularly "ghost boxes;" radios redesigned to allow for direct communication with spirits, or some other discarnate entity. Stephen has written a book about his true experience with a haunting titled "Something Unseen," which is available on Amazon.com in paperback or Kindle form. </p>

<p>At 5pm Eastern we'll talk to Robert McLuhan. Robert is an Oxford educated freelance journalist and longtime member of the Society for Psychical Research. Mr. McLuhan has written a book called "Randi's Prize" which, as the subtitle suggests, takes a look at what skeptics say about the paranormal, why they are wrong, and why it matters.

<p>At 4pm Eastern we'll speak with Gina Lanier. Much like a box of chocolates, when you enter the world of Gina Lanier, you never know what you're gonna get. The last time we spoke with her we talked about ghost hunting, yes; but also explored the taboo topic of sex with ghosts and even heard Gina's own account of meeting the Devil face to face. She's back today with more tales of high strangeness. To find out more about her, check out WWW.GINALANIER.COM</p>

<p>At 5pm Eastern we'll speak with Sherry Shriner. Certainly not one to pull punches, Sherry Shriner is the UFC of internet radio commentators - no holds are barred. Whether discussing the New World Order and Satanism or UFOs as Fallen Angels, you'll get her brand of medicine straight, to the point, and without the metaphorical spoonful of sugar to help it go down.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Strange Frequencies Radio is LIVE this Sunday at 3pm Eastern.  We'll be talking about Dragon*Con, monsters, mayhem…and the 9/11 Truth campaign.  Yeah, that's how we rock here on SFR.</p>

<p>We kick off the show with our free talk segment where we typically ramble aimlessly, talk about weird and bizarre news from recent headlines around the world, and get into a discussion which is sure to get people riled up.  We may even open the phone lines to take your calls.</p>

<p>At 4pm Eastern we'll welcome our first guest, Blake Smith.  Blake is the host of Monstertalk, the free podcast which critically examines the science behind cryptozoological and legendary creatures such as Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, or Werewolves.  Found online at Skeptic.com and iTunes, Monstertalk promises, unlike many mystery-mongering shows, to give skepticism more than just a few minutes of lip service.  Blake can be found online at Facebook and Twitter, and a variety of other places by simply Googling "Doctor Atlantis."</p>

<p>At 5pm Eastern we will speak with Mike Berger.  Mr. Berger is on the website advisory board for 911Truth.org, holder of a degree in Sociology, as well as owning a video production company.

            <itunes:subtitle>Episode 115 - Blake Smith, host of the Monstertalk podcast, stops by to talk about skepticism and, well, monsters! Mike Berger, director of "Improbable Collapse," discusses the 9/11 Truth campaign...and things get a little loud.</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Strange Frequencies Radio is LIVE this Sunday at 3pm Eastern.  We'll be talking about Dragon*Con, monsters, mayhem…and the 9/11 Truth campaign.  Yeah, that's how we rock here on SFR.

We kick off the show with our free talk segment where we typically ramble aimlessly, talk about weird and bizarre news from recent headlines around the world, and get into a discussion which is sure to get people riled up.  We may even open the phone lines to take your calls.

At 4pm Eastern we'll welcome our first guest, Blake Smith.  Blake is the host of Monstertalk, the free podcast which critically examines the science behind cryptozoological and legendary creatures such as Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, or Werewolves.  Found online at Skeptic.com and iTunes, Monstertalk promises, unlike many mystery-mongering shows, to give skepticism more than just a few minutes of lip service.  Blake can be found online at Facebook and Twitter, and a variety of other places by simply Googling "Doctor Atlantis."

At 5pm Eastern we will speak with Mike Berger.  Mr. Berger is on the website advisory board for 911Truth.org, holder of a degree in Sociology, as well as owning a video production company.
