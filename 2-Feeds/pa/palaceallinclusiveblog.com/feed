<p class="MsoNormal">Welcome to the sixth part series about the <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-all-inclusive-resort-tips/" >Cancun Palace</a> All Inclusive Resort.  In this post we will discuss the pool and the beach at the resort.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong></strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_328" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-328" title="Cancun Palace Pool" src="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/cancun-palace-pool-300x200.jpg" alt="Cancun Palace Pool" width="300" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cancun Palace Pool</p></div></p>
<p><strong>The Pool</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The pool is huge and absolutely beautiful. So if you do not go to the beach, you will spend most of your time here. At the pool there are some activities going on but you don’t need to participate. You may always opt to stay to the right side of the pool facing the ocean and you will be quite away from the activity area and you may relax and enjoy the sun, the view and why not a tequila! You will also find plenty of umbrellas for shade and pool chairs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">Needless to day, but when the resort is heavily occupied, the pool can get a bit overcowded.  So going down to the beach instead would be a better sometimes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong></strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_327" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-327" title="Cancun Palace Beach" src="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/cancun-palace-beach-300x198.jpg" alt="Cancun Palace Beach" width="300" height="198" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cancun Palace Beach</p></div></p>
<p><strong>The Beach</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The beach is spectacular with beautiful blue clear water. Depending on the month you visit the <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-all-inclusive-resort-tips/" >Cancun Palace</a>, you may expect some waves (very nice to jump into though) and of course the beach may vary from month to month during the year.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To be fair, Sun Palace Resort has a better beach than the <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-all-inclusive-resort-tips/" >Cancun Palace</a> Resort.  so it would be worth a visit.  So get the palace shuttle for free and go to the Sun Palace beach.  They are very close to each other anyway.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p class="MsoNormal">Thats all for today, and next time we will discuss the night life at <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-all-inclusive-resort-tips/" >Cancun Palace</a> Resort.  Stay tuned.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div id="attachment_313" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-313" title="cancun-palace-tipping servers" src="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/cancun-palace-restaurants-300x200.jpg" alt="cancun-palace-tipping servers" width="300" height="200" /><p class="wp-caption-text">cancun-palace-tipping servers</p></div></p>
<p>Travelers always ask me whether they should tip the servers or not. Although tips are included in the selling price of accomodation at the time of booking, it is up to you to tip them or not.  Normally $1 or $2 is more<br />
than enough.  $1 for the servers is a lot of money since it seems that they are not payed that well.<br />
It is your personal judgement.  If you feel that your server went overboard with his / her duties, I don’t mind giving her $1. Why not? When you give a tip, simply notice their big smile and the gratitude they show you – trust me. As I said for us $1 is nothing but for them is a lot.  And better not leave the tip on the table, but give it to them directly.</p>
<p>If you are also that kind of traveler that leaves the room in a mess every morning, it would be a good idea to tip your room cleaner.  She will definitely appreciates it.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You don’t need to tip to get an excellent service.  You will still get an outstanding service if you do not tip them, but believe me you will find servers who go overboard with their duties to help the guests at the <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com" http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/>Palace Resorts</a>.  I am glad to tip such people as an appreciation for their efforts and excellent service.</p>
<p>I also tip the bellboys.  Once, I was at the Aventura Spa Palace and had 5 luggages extremely heavy since I was on trip for around a month in Cancun. The bellboy did not let us carry any of the luggages.  He had loaded them into the golf car and unloaded them, carried all of them up to the second floor, all down the corridor and into our room.  Of course we immediately felt it was so worth to tip such person.</p>
<p>This takes me to my next point.  All the <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com" http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/>Palace Resorts</a> do not expect you to tip their servers.  Unlike other porters / bellboys who stay at your room door waiting for the tip or charge you a percentage as a service fee as tips in many USA / European restaurants, the servers at <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com" http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/>Palace Resorts</a> do not expect you to tip on any occasion.  As a result of this, guests staying at any of the <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com" http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/>Palace Resorts</a> need to be assured that they will not find any surprises during or after their stay.</p>
<p>In the next post series we will discuss <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-all-inclusive-resort-tips/" >Cancun Palace</a> pool and the beach.  What&#8217;s so special about these?</p>

<p>This post takes us to the 4th part of this series where we are giving valuable tips about <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-all-inclusive-resort-tips/" >Cancun Palace</a> Resort.  These tips should be very helpful and should give you a great indication of what you will find at the resort, what to look for and what to avoid so as you be able to enjoy it to the maximum during your stay.</p>
<p>In this post we will go through the restaurants and bars in <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-all-inclusive-resort-tips/" >Cancun Palace</a>. This is just a short overview of the bars and restaurants at the resort, but keep on reading since I will give you valuable information of how to &#8216;exploit&#8217; the riches found in these restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>In CancunPalace one will find the following restaurants:<br />
<strong>El Mercado</strong> with international breakfast, lunch and buffet dinner.<br />
<strong>Frida</strong>with international lunch, but Mexican dinner a la carte, with outdoor buffet of grilled chicken cuts and fish.<br />
<strong>Miyako</strong> with international breakfast and Oriental a la carte.<br />
<strong>Leonardo</strong> with International breakfast buffet and Italian dinner a la carte.<br />
The Steak with snacks buffet with fine cuts seafood a la carte.</p>
<p>As regards the bars there are four bars (two of them are swim up bars) <strong>Lobby Bar, Pool Bar Contoy, Pool Bar Cozumel and Beach Bar</strong>. They all offer snacks service throughout the day.  There is also the Amphitheater bar open during night shows.</p>
<p>Giving you a list of the bars and restaurants is useless, since you may find this information everywhere - see <a href="http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/palace-resorts/cancun-palace-resort-3.aspx">Cancun Palace fact sheet</a>.  So which are the best restaurants which are worth going to if your time at the <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-all-inclusive-resort-tips/" >Cancun Palace</a> is restricted? Or which best food to look for? The following are my recommendations based on my personal experience during my stay at <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-all-inclusive-resort-tips/" >Cancun Palace</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Restaurants and Bars Tips:</strong><br />
To start with, it is a standard practice at <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com" http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/>Palace Resorts</a> to find abundant food all day long, variety from restaurant to restaurant with a different menu every day.  Bars are also well equipped a good variety of guaranteed genuine drinks.  As regards the service offered, it is always top class and everywhere is well kept and clean – guaranteed. Mind you, you are in an all inclusive resort, so eat and drink how much you want and they will not stop you!</p>
<p>a) To start with, the Leonardo restaurant is extremely recommended for dinner especially if you do not eat Italian food often.</p>
<p>b) Also, if you are into oriental food the MIYAKO Japanese restaurant is highly recommended and reservation is required for teppanyaki tables.  Even if you never tasted Japanese food, give it try. You will be surprised how exquisite it is.  If you do not like it, just leave and find another restaurant – pretty simple isn’t it?!</p>
<p>c) Ask for omelettes in the breakfast – they are simply delicious! If they do not have them ready, they will cook them in front of you. Trust me.</p>
<p>d) The Steak restaurant and Frida, the Mexican restaurant are also delicious and impeccable.  The problem with these is that they are very popular with the guests, hence the restaurants are often busy and the<br />
service is a bit slow. So try to go either early or late to avoid the peak times.</p>
<p>e) Why are these restaurants so popular?  At Frida restaurant in the evening you can enjoy grilled steak, shrimp, ribs, chicken, and a couple of nights lobster! Staying outside it means you can be on a table overlooking the beach area and it will be such a great and memorable atmosphere with all that tasty selection of food and some drinks.</p>
<p>f) Having a snack for lunch at one of the bars is also recommended.</p>
<p>g) Do not be shy to ask for a double drink or get more than one drink in less than 5 minutes.  Just go and ask for your drink whatever it is beer, cocktail, coffee whatever you want!</p>
<p>h) I really like the local beer.  It tastes so good in the sun!</p>
<p>i) Each bar will have a menu of cocktails. Ask for other cocktails even if they are not in the menu and the bar people will simple prepare it for you!</p>
<p>j) Ask the barman to make you the best cocktail that he knows of or which one he recommends. You will be impressed.</p>
<p>In the next post series we will discuss <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-all-inclusive-resort-tips/" >Cancun Palace</a> pool and the beach.whether we should tip the servers (waiters, bellboys, barmen etc. ) for their service or not. And if we want to tip, how much shall we tip?</p>

<p>In Part 1 of this post series about <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-resort/">Cancun Palace Resort</a> we have discussed and have given a general overview of this wonderful resort. In Part 2 <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/cancun-palace-resort/booking-your-free-tours-at-palace-resorts-part-2"/>Booking your free tours at Palace Resorts</a> we have discussed how to book your free tours at any <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com" http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/>Palace Resorts</a>.  Now In Part 3 we will discuss the rooms at <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-all-inclusive-resort-tips/" >Cancun Palace</a>.  So read on</p>
<p><strong>Rooms at Cancun Palace Resort Tips</strong><br />
1) The rooms have very nice décor, very clean and extremely comfy.  For two people the room has plenty of space but for four people with all your personal belongings may get a bit small.  So if you plan to stay in the room watching TV on the nice LCD screen available in each room, don’t take many things with you.</p>
<p>2) The resort has 601 rooms, 70% are ocean view, the remaining 30% have lagoon view.  How the rooms are allocated is a matter of luck.  However it is possible to swap the rooms if you want Ocean View and ended up in a Lagoon View room or vice versa.  Ask politely the receptionist and if the resort is not full they would normally change the room for you.  If the resort is full, don&#8217;t expect that the room is changed.</p>
<p>3) If height is not a problem for you, try to stay in the top floors.  Reason being that there is live music in the lobby and the sound is load.  I stand to be corrected but I bereave the music goes on till 1am.  You may also find some people which are heavily boozed and may disturb your sleep if these educated people decide to make a lot of noises especially around the pool area. <img src='http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>In Part 4 we will discuss which restaurant at <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-all-inclusive-resort-tips/" >Cancun Palace</a> are a must visit.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>In Part 1 of this post series about <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-resort/">Cancun Palace Resort</a> we have discussed and have given a general overview of this wonderful resort. In this Part 2 of the post series we will discuss how to book your<span> </span><strong>free<span> </span></strong>tours at any Palace Resort.  This way you will<span> </span><strong>make sure</strong><span> </span>that you<span> </span><strong>secure<span> </span></strong>your place for the tours you want to go for during your stay.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Common Sense Advices:</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_265" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 254px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-265" title="Chichen Itza - Wonder of the World" src="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/c__webserv_webs_fundacion_folletos_download_524317526_tours_chichen_chichen-itza2-244x300.jpg" alt="Chichen Itza - Wonder of the World" width="244" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Chichen Itza - Wonder of the World</p></div></p>
<p>1) Palace Resorts right now have the 25th Silver Anniversary Promotion which comes with a number of tours and discounts.   This promotion is combinable with all other Palace Promotions, so you are entitled for it.  Ask your travel agent if you are unsure.  For example if you go to Chichen Itza by yourself, the tickets cost I believe aroun$40 each, so $80 for 2 people and God knows how much is the  transport since it is at least 2hrs - 3 hrs away from Cancun.  So the tours you are entitled for, take them, they are yours.</p>
<p><span>2) Tours vary from resort to another, and come with a number of common sense conditions so check the terms and conditions prior booking your resort.  This way you may stay at the resort that offers the tours that you wish to visit which at the end of the day will save a lot of money as shown above.</span></p>
<p><span>For example Cozumel Palace, Vallarta Palace and Isla Mujeres Palace have different tours available from each other and even from the other resorts.  So if you want to visit Chichen Itza, you can&#8217;t stay at these resorts because common sense - they are pretty far away.  But common sense is not so common sometimes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>More Important Advices:</span></strong><span></span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_266" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-266" title="Isla Muyeres - Around the Island Tour" src="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/c__webserv_webs_fundacion_folletos_download_524317526_tours_isla_mujeres_islamujeres-300x141.jpg" alt="Isla Muyeres - Around the Island Tour" width="300" height="141" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Isla Muyeres - Around the Island Tour</p></div></p>
<p>3) The tours<span> </span><strong>CANNOT</strong><span> </span>be booked<span> </span><strong>PRIOR</strong><span> </span>your arrival, no travel agent can do it irrespective what others say.  The tours can only be booked <strong>AT</strong> the resort once you <strong>ARE</strong> at the resort.</p>
<p><span>4) Furthermore,<span> </span><strong>ON THE DAY OF ARRIVAL AFTER CHECKING IN AND PRIOR</strong><span> </span>going to your room, go and<strong> BOOK</strong><span> </span>the tours that you want to go for.   Ask the reception to guide you to where is the tours booking desk and<span><strong> </strong></span><strong>BOOK YOUR TOURS</strong>.   Why?  Places are limited, and if you go in a busy period, when the resort is nearly fully occupied, then you may find that all the days are booked, leaving you with NO tours.  Hence<span> </span><strong>BOOK IMMEDIATELY</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>5) If you stay for 7 days you have more chance of finding available days for booking the tours you want to go.</span></p>
<p><span>6) Waiting to book your tours is a bit frustrating especially if you are coming after a long flight, since checking in, booking etc. can sometimes take you 2 hours.  But don’t forget, you are in an all inclusive resort, so go and refresh yourself while you are waiting.  There is no point to get angry or frustrated.  Just start enjoying your stay immediately, but book your tours and do it straight away. </span></p>
<p><span>7) The bellboys take care of your luggages, don&#8217;t worry about them since they are in safe hands.  So go and book the tours.  When you are ready, the bellboys will take you to your room.  If you are at Moon Palace or Aventura Palace they will take you with golf car - is cool <img src='http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"> <img src='http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif' alt='8)' class='wp-smiley' /> If you stay at the Cancun / Playa Del Carmen resorts, it is not recommended to go for all the tours.  They offer around 10 tours, and you need days to just get lazy on the beach, by the pool and eat and drink.  You will always find something to do at the resort and do not stress yourself with all the choices that you will have.</span></p>

<p>When you decide to go for a holiday in one of the best destinations in the world - Cancun, at some point you need to decide where you are going to stay.  Are you going for an all inclusive resort, self catering apartment or a villa?  Whatever you choose, there again you face another problem – which one now? Irrespective whether you want to stay in a resort, apartment or a villa, you have a wide selection of choices.</p>
<p>Assuming you decided to stay in an all inclusive resort, which to be honest is very convenient, one of the resorts quite famous between travelers is no doubt the <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-all-inclusive-resort-tips/" >Cancun Palace</a>.

The beauty of <a href="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/all-inclusive-holidays/cancun-palace-all-inclusive-resort-tips/" >Cancun Palace</a> is simply exceptional, and only Cancun itself together with its beaches surpasses the resort.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div id="attachment_252" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-252" title="Beach Palace Resort in Cancun" src="http://www.palaceallinclusiveblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/c__webserv_webs_fundacion_folletos_download_697096067_bp_pool_bp0453_hires-200x300.jpg" alt="Beach Palace Resort in Cancun" width="200" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Beach Palace Resort in Cancun</p></div></p>
<p>The first Palace Resort to open its doors for its guests was the Beach Palace in 1985.  Since the inception of this resort, one could immediately see its uniqueness among other similar resorts in the surrounding area, and was the first one to offer all inclusive services.  It was a hit.</p>
<p>Since then <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com" http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/>Palace Resorts</a> have opened another 10 resorts in the Gulf of Mexico coast (Cancun and Playa del Carmen area), another one Puerto Vallarta which overlooks the Pacific Ocean and their new resort in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic - the Moon Palace Casino Golf &amp; Spa Resort.  All these are all inclusive resorts with exceptional food, drinks, services, activities, amenities and everything that comes with all inclusive package <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com" http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/>Palace Resorts</a> are renowned for.</p>
<p>It is impossible to list what is included in the package in this article since all the information you can find it in an authorized <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com" http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/>Palace Resorts</a> Agents - <a href="http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/">All Inclusive Holidays</a> or the <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com">Palace Resorts</a> official website itself.  Just from my personal experience in my frequent stays at the <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com" http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/>Palace Resorts</a> it is simply exceptional, and worth every dollar that you pay.</p>
<p>This is evident by the amounts of rewards and accolades they have won throughout the years.  They were AAA’s Four Diamond winner in 2007 and 2008. They were also presented the “Best All Inclusive Chain” award in 2006 and the “Best Hotel Chain in Mexico” in 2007 by Travel Weekly’s Reader Choice Awards. They have also been presented with many other awards from acclaimed companies such as Travelers’ Choice, M&amp;C Magazine, and Expedia.  You have to earn these rewards with hard work from all the people involved in each and every Palace Resort.</p>
<p>Although rates are a bit more expensive than other standard resorts found in Cancun area, it is still recommended that at least once in a lifetime you visit any one of the <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com" http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/>Palace Resorts</a>.  Still the difference is not that huge since a standard resort with a double Jacuzzi and private balcony is around $200 per night for 2 people while <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com" http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/>Palace Resorts</a> are around $320 per night for 2 people.  But the difference of what you get back is huge! Believe me!  Just have a look at the tours offered for free, and I can vow for the quality of food, service and drinks.  Mind you, drinks are all authentic.  If you order a JB it is a JB.  Sambuca is a real Sambuca, not a fake like many $200 resorts offer.</p>
<p>And I said that they are a bit more expensive, but right now <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com" http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/>Palace Resorts</a> are offering either $400 free flight from any US airport or 1 or 2 nights free if you are travelling from Europe.  Make your calculations and you will see that it is great offer not to be missed for a holiday to remember!</p>

<p>It is a known fact that the beaches around the world constantly change daily due to tides, seasonally with meteorological changes such as storms and hurricanes, and in the long-term with changes such as a rise in sea level.</p>
<p>Moon Palace beach being one of the largest resort, also have one of the largest beaches in Cancun.  Unfortunately Moon Palace beach has lots of weed, so it may be not that much comfortable to swim in it at the shore.  However it is cleaned often by trucks - I believe every 2 days, or when it is needed.  For sure they won&#8217;t let it there knowing the high quality of service the resort offers to its guests - rest assured on this.</p>
<p>However I won&#8217;t bother much on the seaweed since most people hang out by the marvelous pools at the Moon Palace anyway where you can eat, drink and share a joke at the same time.</p>
<p>If you want the best beach in Cancun and the same excellent service of <a href="http://www.palaceresorts.com" http://www.allinclusiveholidaysworldwide.com/>Palace Resorts</a>, then just stay at Sun Palace instead. They have one of the best beach in Cancun (if not the best). You may still visit Moon Palace (highly recommended) using the resort shuttle for free. They leave the Moon Palace at noon and 2:00 p.m. daily. If you want to stay more (highly recommended) just pick up a taxi which are cheap from the resort itself. The resorts are close to each other and will only cost you around $15.</p>
<p>Moon Palace and Sun Palace have the same rates as well.  Be aware that Sun Palace is couples only resort. Or else do the other way round, stay at Moon Palace and visit Sun Palace beach again with the free shuttle.</p>
<p>Wherever you stay, you will love it.</p>
