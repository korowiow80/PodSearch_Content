      <title>WCRS Broadcast - November 17 - Day Creeper</title>
      <description>Aaron of Day Creeper broke three guitar strings last night as the band banged through an eight-song set for my last show on WCRS. He is a beast! Look for a new Day Creeper album in 2012. What else is going on? Sick Thrills is at Carabar tonight, releasing a 7". Them Labs also have a release show tomorrow night at Oldfield's, with The Wells and Outer Spacists. Catch Alwood Sisters at the Rumba on Black Friday (Nov 25). Dane Terry will be all over town for a brief time, playing with various peoples. Dane wants to do another Terry Xmas show at Electraplay, so look for that in the coming weeks on this humble blog (cuz it won't be on the airwaves).</description>

      <title>WCRS Broadcast - September 8 - The Lindsay</title>
      <description>I failed to mention it on the air, but much thanks to Tony Stewart and James Allison at Electrplay for hosting my show again this week and doing all the technical audio things that I have no clue about. They are awesome. The Lindsay is awesome as well, and they played seven songs last night in the studio and you can hear them right now by clicking on the podcast link below. You have two chances to see the Lindsay this weekend, at Carabar tonight and at the Mega City Music Marathon on Saturday. The Townsmen, You're So Bossy, and The Patsys are also on the bill tonight at Carabar. Every band in the world is playing at the MMM on Saturday. Also tonight at Kobo, Indigo Wild releases If By Sea, their debut ep. Playing with them are their Outer Sounds cohorts, Narrow and the Brights, The Blastronauts, and The Town Monster. </description>

      <title>WCRS Broadcast - August 18 - Maza Blaska</title>
      <description>Sam and Yoni of Maza Blaska are my guests in the first half-hour. We listen to a session Maza Blaska recorded at Electraplay back in April of this year and talk about the beginnings of the band, the pursuit of unique sounds and melodies, and the desire to tell stories on this new record. Indigo Wild, Narrow &amp; the Brights, and Duke Junior and Smokey Boots are also featured, as they are all playing with Maza Blaska at the Storyteller release show tomorrow night at Carabar. Monolithic Cloud Parade's final show is tomorrow night at the Rumba Cafe, and Speed Governor play a show Saturday at the Treehouse, with Flamtronic and In Silent Movies. I finish the show with three classic tunes from Pere Ubu, just because I wanted to hear 'em.</description>
