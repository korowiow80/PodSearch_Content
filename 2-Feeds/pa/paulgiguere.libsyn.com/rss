        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[This podcast explores what it means to live a photographic life. What does it mean to be an artist who uses the medium of photography to express themselves artistically to the world. What subjects do we choose and why? How are we influenced by other photographers, art, and the world in general? You won't find any gear-talk, camera reviews, or Photoshop tips here, but rather, you'll find an exploration of our relationship to photography as we continue to refine our vision, our craft, and our art. ]]></itunes:summary>

            <link><![CDATA[http://thoughtsonphotography.com/to-p-0104-kickstarter-com-haiti-project-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com" target="_blank">Kickstarter.com</a> is a social funding platform for individuals working on creative projects. Using Kickstarter, anyone can pledge money towards a project that they feel is worthy however only projects that reach a certain funding goal within a certain time period will actually result in a pledge being paid out.</p>
<p>I recently launched a new Kickstarter pledge drive to raise funds for a documentary project that I hope to do in Haiti in February of 2011. You can learn more about this project by visiting:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1544246638/ile-a-vache-haiti-a-roadmap-forward" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1544246638/ile-a-vache-haiti-a-roadmap-forward</a><br /><br />Funding any project like this is costly which is why I have turned to using Kickstarter as a way to connect with people (in a light touch sort of way) and hopefully raise the funds necessary to make this project work. In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone who makes a pledge of $50 or more receive a 5&Prime;x7&Prime; (approx. size) archival print from the project</li>
<li>Anyone who makes a pledge of $75 or more will receive an 8&Prime;x10&Prime; (approx. size) archival print from the project</li>
<li>Anyone who makes a pledge of $100 or more will receive an 10&Prime;x13&Prime; (approx size) archival print from the project</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm hoping you will be able to pledge (any amount would be wonderful) but I fully understand if you are unable to assist at this time. Even if you are unable to help support this project, I hope you will check back on my web site in the Spring of 2011 to see the results. The deadline for raising funds is December 31st, 2010 at midnight (EST). Please feel free to email me with any questions or comments regarding the project and please feel free to forward the link to anyone else who think might be interested. Thanks in advance for your interest.</p>]]></description>

Southern California. She began photographing in 2006 and since then has been

in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.humbleartsfoundation.org/">Humble Arts Foundation</a> group show, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.filemagazine.com/">FILE Magazine</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flakphoto.com/">Flak Photo</a>. In
2009, Liz was selected by the Humble Arts Foundation for inclusion in the
Collector's Guide to Emerging Art Photography. Liz&quot;s most recent and on-going
body of work called &quot;California Vernacular” is a perfect example of the social
landscape. Whether the photos are taken in the city, the suburb, or a rural
place, Liz manages to capture the essence of our human existence in the natural
environment. The result is sometimes poignant, sometimes whimsical but always
engaging.

to photography not through the halls of higher learning or by becoming enamored

much the same way as most people do, to record life's events . . . in other
words, he was a snap-shooter. </p>


<p>In 2003 photography became a more central part of Alan&quot;s

            <description><![CDATA[Like many photographers, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.natalieyoung.com/">Natalie Young</a> didn't start out with the intention of becoming a photographer but rather, photography found her. She left a career in finance, married a musician and began living the photographic life. After photographing on her husband's family farm, Young eventually realized that she had not only a body of work but had work that could feed her artistically. As with the farm series, Young's approach to photography is usually a reflection of personal life and it is this approach that has given her the success she now enjoys with her photography.<br/>]]></description>

It's no surprise then that Revy's personal fine art work (again mostly of children) captures the essence and personality of her subjects. The different in her fine art work though is that Revy also infuses a sense of place and time that evokes a shared sense of history, nostalgia and time.

            <description><![CDATA[Which is better, black and white or color photography? I've gotten asked this question many times by listeners and I find the question to be kind of strange because it all depends on what you are trying to communicate or accomplish with your photography. Sometimes it comes down to how well you create and develop your photos in one process or another (your skill), sometimes it is a matter of personal preference, and sometimes your subject tells you how to proceed. The bottom line is to follow your instinct and preference and not let anyone (including the marketplace) tell you it must be a certain way.<br/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Although digital cameras have been with us for quite awhile and the quality of images produced with digital cameras can equal or are better than film-based cameras, the issue of film versus digital continues to permeate our photographic discussions. This podcast attempts to re-frame the issue as not one of quality but rather process (or how we like to work). I know this can still be a hot button issue but hopefully my thoughts add, in a constructive way, to the decision-making that some photographers still grapple with when contemplating film or digital in their photographic life.<br/>]]></description>

Their whole approach to limited edition sales of prints involves pricing three different size prints (small, medium, and large) in different quantities (200, 20, and 2 respectively) at varying prices ($20, $200, and $2,000 respectively). This could be a whole new approach to limited editions and pricing in general for most photographers that allows the average person the ability to purchase a photograph based on their budget and their motivation as a collector of photography.<br/>]]></description>

Their whole approach to limited edition sales of prints involves pricing three different size prints (small, medium, and large) in different quantities (200, 20, and 2 respectively) at varying prices ($20, $200, and $2,000 respectively). This could be a whole new approach to limited editions and pricing in general for most photographers that allows the average person the ability to purchase a photograph based on their budget and their motivation as a collector of photography.]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[This podcast explores the concept of &quot;flow.&quot; According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">definition on Wikipedia</a>, flow is a mental state of operation in which the person is fully immersed in what
he or she is doing, characterized by a feeling of energized focus, full
involvement, and success in the process of the activity. In photography, flow can be used to help achieve a sense of heightened creativity with your photography.<br/><br/>As a reference for this podcast, here is a simple chart that explains the four levels of flow:<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">Level 1</span><br/>Low Skill - Low Challenge = Typically breeds apathy<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">Level 2</span><br/>Low Skill - High Challenge = Typically causes frustration and anxiety.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">Level 3</span><br/>High Skill - Low Challenge = Can bring about contentment and can build confidence but the challenge must increase to encourage true engagement.<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">Level 4</span><br/>High Skill - High Challenge = Desired focused state where flow is attained,<br/><br/><br/>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://thoughtsonphotography.com/to_p_0012_how_to_price_your_photographic_prints]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[In this podcast, I discuss how to arrive at a price for your photographic prints regardless of whether you sell your work in unlimited or limited editions. Below is a simple formula that I discuss in the podcast for determining the price:<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">Art Fair Pricing (unlimited)</span><br/>Step 1: Determine the cost of your materials for a single print. For example:<br/><br/>- 13x19 paper<br/>- inkjet print<br/>- bag and board<br/>- add framing costs if applicable<br/><br/>$10 for materials X 33% = $13.30<br/><br/>Step 2: Multiply the result from Step 1 by 3. This is the price you could charge for your print (and probably sell it). For example:<br/><br/>$13.30 X 3 = $39.90 (round up to $40)<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exhibition/Gallery Pricing (limited)</span><br/>Step 1: Determine what level you are at as a fine art photographer with regards to your reputation and experience exhibiting and/or publishing and then multiply an hourly rate by 33%. For example:<br/><br/>Beginner - $100/hr X 33% = $133<br/>Emerging - $200/hr X 33% =$266<br/>Established - $300/hr X 33% = $399<br/><br/>Step 2: Multiply the result from Step 1 by 3. This is the price you could charge for your print (and probably sell it). For example:<br/>&nbsp;<br/>$133 X 3 = $399 or $400 (exhibition)<br/>$266 X 3 = $798 or $800<br/>$399 X 3 = $1197 or $1200<br/>]]></description>
