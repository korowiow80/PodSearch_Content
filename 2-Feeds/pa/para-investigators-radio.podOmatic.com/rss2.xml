      <title>Kathy Machowski - MN Beyond the Veil</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1171426/600x600_4592829.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this episode of PIR Radio we have founder of MN Beyond the Veil Kathy Machowski on with us.

About the group:

We are a small group of people investigating claims of haunted locations.  Though it is rare, we have found in some cases the spirit lingers on after death. Proving that the grand spirit of the people of Minnesota still lives on even after death.

 We investigate various locations, such as homes, business, historical sites, churches, and cemeteries.  We even had a few people call us to check out a home they plan to buy, they liked the house, but they felt something not quite right about it.

There is never a fee for our services.

We help people who think they may have a haunting. All of our members have experienced spiritual activity and is sensitive to the needs of our clients. Regarding this, our group is very discreet. We are not flashy and none of our cars are marked. When we come over we look like company coming for a visit.  

We record and document each location, and will either revisit or e mail each client our findings.  Many of our clients are pleased with the information we gather for them. With some, we are able to find a natural explanation for what is happening to them, with others, we show them proof that they do have a haunting, and suggest things that they can do.

With the addition of our sensitive, Linda, we have had success with helping the spirits cross over. This is done only with the client&#8217;s approval as many of our clients once knowing that they do have a spirit in their home do not wish for the spirit to leave.

Either way, our clients' minds are put at ease.

About Kathy:

Raised in a house that had spiritual activity, I was always interested in spirits. At a young age they frighten me, but as I grew older I wanted to know the rules that the spirits obey. As a teenager, I studied on and off about ghosts, reading everything I could and trying various experiments hoping to capture a voice or image of a spirit. In my 20&#8217;s I collected various stories and started lightly investigating locations.  I enjoyed field work and after my separation from my x, I was able to commit more time into investigating cases in NY. After Moving to Minnesota, I started Minnesota&#8217;s Beyond the Veil. I came up with that name because of my earlier studies. I was told that spirits dwell &#8220;beyond the veil&#8221; and

Psychic&#8217;s are able to pierce this veil to contact the spirits beyond. I and my group may not be psychic (with the exception of Linda) but with our equipments help we are able to look &#8220;beyond the veil&#8221; and catch glimpses of the spirit world.

      <title>NPI - Darryl and Nikki</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1171426/600x600_4519736.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this episode of PIR Radio we have Darryl and Nikki on from Northern Paranormal Investigations from British Columbia, Canada.

Here is more about Darryl and Nikki:

DARRYL PEARSON, FOUNDER  
Darryl was born and raised in Ontario, Canada, and is the youngest of three children. He has lived in British Columbia for over 20 years and has been a welder-fabricator for most of that time.

Before that he lived in various places throughout Ontario and moved a lot. Darryl also came from a split family, but always had the support of both his parents. He started investigating the paranormal as a result of his drive to discover the truths and/or untruths behind the causes of paranormal activity, also having had a few experiences that put him on course with the paranormal.

Darryl is what some people call &quot;sensitive&quot; and has been known to see and feel things in ways others may not. He uses both his senses and technical equipment to investigate, and help people understand what they are experiencing; hopefully supply answers. As the founder of N.P.I.  Darryl brings a positive, professional, enthusiastic energy to the group, which is an asset to all our investigations.

Darryl has been doing investigations into the paranormal for more then a year now and has gained a lot of experience in the field having been both a member and a lead investigator of another group. He feels with himself and his team&#8217;s knowledge that N.P.I. will be a group to look to for help and answers when needed. 

NIKKI PETERSON, LEAD INVESTIGATOR
Born and raised in Langley BC, Nikki has always lived in the lower mainland, and now resides in downtown Vancouver.  Nikki has been interested in the paranormal since she was a little child when an elderly woman would come and sit in her room at night and sing to her, comfort her.  As Nikki grew into adolescence, the paranormal activity around her grew in frequency and intensity.  At this time, she was also introduced into the metaphysical realm.  This is when she found out for sure about her &#8220;sensitivities&#8221; and telekinesis. By the time she was a young adult, she had already won one battle with a demon.  To this day, she does not fear ever facing one again. Nikki comes with a resume including working with a few other investigative paranormal teams and brings with her the knowledge learnt with each one.

Every place Nikki has lived, she has had ghosts follow. Almost daily, things will be moved around, sounds made, unexplainable happenings, being touched and even on occasion she will actually see her visitors. Despite all of her personal experiences, she faces every moment as a skeptic first.  She will never assume that any off thing happening is paranormal, no matter how weird it may seem.

When Nikki isn&#8217;t expanding her knowledge of the mysterious and unknown, you can usually find her at a coffee shop or the beach with a coffee and a good book. Her other hobbies include 8-ball, photography, videography, and poetry. When not working in her capacity as a paranormal investigator she is an administrative clerk for a large heavy construction/ engineering company. She loves her job and is thankful that she can work with such wonderful people. Nikki is also very close to her supportive family for who she can&#8217;t thank enough for all the love and guidance they have given her throughout the years.

When the opportunity came for Nikki to join Northern Paranormal Investigations, she knew it was the right thing for her to be  doing and is happy to be living one of her dreams.

Almost daily, things will be moved around, sounds made, unexplainable happenings, being touched and even on occasion she will actually see her visitors. Despite all of her personal experiences, she faces every moment as a skeptic first.  She will never assume that any off thing happening is paranormal, no matter how weird it may seem.

When Nikki isn&#8217;t expanding her knowledge of the mysterious and unknown, you can usually find her at a coffee shop or the beach with a coffee and a good book. Her other hobbies include 8-ball, photography, videography, and poetry. When not working in her capacity as a paranormal investigator she is an administrative clerk for a large heavy construction/ engineering company. She loves her job and is thankful that she can work with such wonderful people. Nikki is also very close to her supportive family for who she can&#8217;t thank enough for all the love and guidance they have given her throughout the years.

When the opportunity came for Nikki to join Northern Paranormal Investigations, she knew it was the right thing for her to be  doing and is happy to be living one of her dreams.

      <title>Searching for Bigfoot with Tom Biscardi</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1171426/600x600_4512870.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this episode of PIR Radio we have Big Foot Hunter Tom Biscardi on with us.

Here is some info about Tom: 

You can [Join Tom Biscardi On Expedition To Find America's King Kong - Bigfoot]?Create.

Biscardi's first company relating to Bigfoot research was &quot;Amazing Horizons Corporation&quot; in 1971. Tom talks about how he got into Bigfoot research:

&quot;I was watching John Carson in 1967, and I saw the first 8mm footage that Roger Patterson took of the Bluff Creek incident. I said to myself, 'How the hell can we send a man to the moon, but we can't find this creature'.&quot;

&quot;I went to the library and researched my predecessors, to see what kind of mistakes they had made, so that I could do better. I then started my own Bigfoot research company to stage expeditions to find the creature.&quot;

&quot;The recent Burney Mountain sighting of Bigfoot is the fifth time I've seen Bigfoot in 32 years. I've always had the love for the myths, the unknowns, and mysteries. When I entered into my freshman year of high school, a guidance counsellor asked me what I wanted to be. I said 'A palentologist of course, I love the study of fossils and bones.'&quot;

Tom Biscardi's favorite Biscardism is:

&quot;Positive Attitude&quot; Must Be Followed By &quot;Positive Action&quot; to Achieve....

Says Bicardi, &quot;There are two types of people, one finds a way,... one finds an excuse. I am the type of person who goes over, under, and around or through any obstacle that stands in my way!!! I can.. I will... I am going to!!! When the going gets tough, the tough get going! Every day and every way by the grace of God I am getting better and better!! I feel happy... I feel healthy... I feel terrific! After all, the mark of a person is not how far he runs from his problems, but how well he meets, faces and deals with those problems. That is truly the mark of a real human being. I can... I will... and I am going to succeed today!!!&quot;

Another great Biscardisms is: &quot;Excuses are tools of incompetence to build monuments of nothing....&quot;

      <title>Stephen Hill Author of &quot; Something Unseen&quot;</title>

About the book:

Stephen Hill takes you on a spine tingling journey into the mysteries of the afterlife and what awaits us on the other side. A mysterious voice captured on the audio of his camcorder during a local cemetery visit causes him to question his perception of reality, religion and even his own sanity. These questions lead him back to the cemetery in an attempt to find answers to questions that he cannot even begin to comprehend. He soon realizes that something has followed him home from the graveyard, something that wants to make it's presence known. Yes Something Unseen! This gripping tale of one man&#8217;s journey into the other side will keep you on the edge of your seat. Stephen Hill went into the graveyard that day to do a little genealogical research. He walked away with more than he bargained for. What happens when we die? Is that it, or is there more? After reading this book you may never look at the afterlife the same again!

About Nick:


Nick Corey
Founder/ Lead Investigator/EVP Specialist/Author/Spiritual
Medium

Nick has been drawn to the paranormal since he was young and
had many unexplained things happen to him as a child.

As he grew older the fascination  with the paranormal was still
there.

In 2004, while working along side hospice caring for his dying

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1171426/600x600_4170588.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this episode of PIR Radio we have Jeffrey Kimball from NPRS on with us.

About Jeff and NPRS:

We are a Paranormal research group in the center of New Hampshire.  We have worked and spent much of our time in paranormal research and understanding on how things in our everyday lifestyle can effect or be effected by them.  Northern Paranormal staff are not new to the spirit world, we started trying to understand about the paranormal in the later part of 1998 when i  had paranormal introductions of my own.  And so began the journey to find others like myself with the interest in the paranormal.  I formed the organization in 1999 with 5 members and it has just grown from there.  I have  not only formed this group for us, but for others in whom we try to help in the understanding of the paranormal.  This is more then just curiosity.....this is a quest, a quest to see if there really are things out there trying to talk to us or asking for help to move on.  We understand the doubters and the non-believers in the paranormal field but we are not just a group to help with seing or believing but also to disprove bumps in the night to be a settling house or pinging in the basement to be air in the pipes.  We help everyone.  There is always an answer........just where in the spectrum does it lie.

With that said i decided that investigating was not enough, so i began my studies and became certified and well versed in much of the equipment used today such as EMF Detectors, Thermal Imaging Equipment, and the lighting of IR and Full Spectrum.  Now with the knowledge comes the teaching.  We hold workshops and seminars all over New England to help teach other people who have the drive and excitment we have on an investigation, to learn what we know in hopes they will teach people what THEY know.  I deal in Parapsychology and am facinated in the spirtual world and hope i can help others in the field to.

      <title>BioSync Healing's Vivian Scott and Gabbie Chase</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1171426/600x600_4091591.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this episode of PIR Radio we have BioSync Healing's Vivian Scott and Gabbie Chase.

About BioSync Healing, Inc.

Our goal is to bridge the conscious reality with the spiritual mind.  Our main focal point is the five levels of the soul/mind. We believe that freedom from the constraints of socialized thinking will give use spiritual oneness and replace the negative way of thinking and living with a freedom within our mind, body and soul. Chase is a psychic medium, guest lecturer, and instructor. At a very young age she had three near-death experiences that intensified her abilities to communicate with those who have passed over. She is considered an expert in Instrumental Trans
Communication using ITC, EVP, and quantum theory&#8217;s as a means to gather information from a distance regarding time sensitive projects.

 Communication is a vital part of her psychic medium business and after many years studying the paranormal and parapsychology, she has found that quantum mechanics is a very strong and clear method of communication when documentation is vital. It is a highly effective method when used in combination with her medium skills. Calling herself &#8220;The Scientific Psychic&#8221;  Gabbie has now co-founded BioSync Healing, located in Richmond, Va.

&#8220;It is my life&#8217;s work to become more acute in finding and utilizing communication as a tool not only for readings and allowing others to hear and see those who have passed over, but is very important to have data to study to help further the possibilities.&#8221; 
 
 &#8220;This project has become a great success and continues to give us (BioSync Healing Team) such information as: weather, current events, personal events, and thoughts of others. Alternative communication can warn us about an upcoming natural disaster, security issue, help find a missing person, or track down a criminal. The possibilities are endless.

About Trisha:

Trisha Ryan, along with Ghost Hunters International star Barry Fitzgerald, is the co-author of the recently released book The Influence. She has been a member of the paranormal community for over five years, but has always had a fascination for trying to understand what lies on the other side.  She has just recently stepped down from The Rolling Hills Asylum team, where she worked as a guide, to allow herself time for other projects.

As a master dowser and Vice-President of the Genesee Valley dowsers, her interest has recently been drawn to geomancy and specific ley lines in the earth and with how they may have an effect on haunted locations.

Her current work not only includes working on several new books, but also writing articles for Intrepid Magazine, along with working on a documentary about the Dragon&#8217;s Track (also known as the St. Michael Apollo Axis) and how it runs through the Eastern part of the United States.

      <itunes:summary>On this episode of PIR Radio we have Trisha Ryan as our guest.

About Trisha:

Trisha Ryan, along with Ghost Hunters International star Barry Fitzgerald, is the co-author of the recently released book The Influence. She has been a member of the paranormal community for over five years, but has always had a fascination for trying to understand what lies on the other side.  She has just recently stepped down from The Rolling Hills Asylum team, where she worked as a guide, to allow herself time for other projects.

As a master dowser and Vice-President of the Genesee Valley dowsers, her interest has recently been drawn to geomancy and specific ley lines in the earth and with how they may have an effect on haunted locations.

Her current work not only includes working on several new books, but also writing articles for Intrepid Magazine, along with working on a documentary about the Dragon&#8217;s Track (also known as the St. Michael Apollo Axis) and how it runs through the Eastern part of the United States.

      <title>Petro Photoglyph Research with Laser Les</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1171426/600x600_3995540.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this episode of PIR Radio we discuss Petro Photoglyphs with Laser Les.

*In the year 1994 I discovered a collection of small inscribed stones capable of projecting streams of video images.

*I labeled these stone artifacts 'petro photoglyphs'...properly defined as  photographic recordings scribed onto stone surfaces.

*Petro photoglyphs illustrated within this research website were surface samples discovered in the mid-western United States.

*A petro photoglyph will project streams of photo images defined as a hologram (whole recording) forming a visual language.

*A process method I formulated using modern technology...records and translates the Petro Photoglyphic Image Projections.

*The technology required to develop and decipher the stone inscriptions defines them as 'Time Capsule Messages'.

*Ancient image projections...deciphered using our knowledge database of history, mythology, religion and astronomy.

*Images from the 'petro photoglyphs' developed for this research website are 'The Oldest Photographs Known to Humanity'.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1171426/600x600_3959875.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this Episode of PIR Radio we have with us Erin Hamilton from Maritime Paranormal.

Erin has been interested in local accounts of the paranormal since her childhood. She is now a practicing Speech Language Pathologist with a Masters in Science, including course work in Linguistics and Acoustics. Erin hopes to apply her educational background to the paranormal field, specifically in the areas of Electronic Voice Phenomena, ITC, and RTSC Research.

Erin is also a developing intuitive who has been featured on para-x.com&#8217;s live radio broadcasts (a US-based online paranormal community). Joining her friends from para-x, she undertook her first serious paranormal investigation at Waverly Hills Sanatorium in May 2009 (alleged to be one of the most haunted locations in the US) and returned again to investigate at Waverly the following year.

Her recent inventory of paranormal personal experiences has grown significantly, along with her desire to assist others who may be intimidated by the paranormal or their own sensitive abilities.

      <title>ParaTom Lynch</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1171426/600x600_3927675.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this episode of PIR Radio we have special guest Para Tom Lynch.

Tom Lynch is the founder and lead investigator of ParaTom.com. He is a  freelance paranormal investigator working out of New England. 

Tom Lynch is an internationally known and well respected freelance Paranormal Investigator based in New England and travels across the country to help his clients uncover the truth about what they believe to be paranormal activity. Tom also conducts lectures and workshops throughout the year.

When Tom was young, his grandparents would take him to Concord and Lexington, Massachusetts in the spring time to visit the Olde North Bridge, Grave of the Unknown British Soldiers, and The Olde Burying Grounds. Tom was fascinated by the artwork carved upon the old slate gravestones.

&#8220;I remember during one of my many visits there, finding a grave stone belonging to a boy of about 8 years old. He had died in the 1700's and I can remember lagging behind my family, bending and whispering to the patch of land beneath my feet. &#8221;Are you here? If you are not happy here, you can come home with me.&#8221;  That evening, I slept with my eyes wide open, afraid the boy was going to appear! I would call that my first attempt to communicate with the other side!&#8221;

Tom has been visiting and photographing colonial graveyards most of his life. This qualifies him as a lifelong taphophile. A person who loves cemeteries.

Tom prides himself on the tools he brings to the investigation and is very knowledgable with every piece in his kit. Tom started with a film camera and added a mini cassette recorder to his kit. This was back in 1986. His tool kit has been growing and changing ever since.

Tom has had the pleasure of investigating along side of some of todays foremost respected and talented people in the paranormal field, such as Medium Julie Williams, John Zaffis (A Haunting in Conneticut), Dustin Pari and Barry Fitzgerald of Ghost Hunters International, and other great talents.

Tom has been a guest on many radio prograo inforr norems airing in the United States, Europe and Australia!
Tom travels across the country as he gets requests to participate in or conduct investigations for groups and home or business owners.

Tom is well known for training many groups in the methods and theories of paranormal investigations.
He teaches groups and individuals the proper techniques from the client interviews to the presentation of his findings. Tom is available to help you with your paranormal concerns. Please contact us at juliewilliams@paratom..com for information about our workshops and guest appearances

Be sure to check out Tom's new book &quot;ParaTom'.s Guide To Paranormal Investigations&quot; due to be released February of 2011.
