	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Issue 89 - See You In Heaven, 2011!!!The entire gang - with the exceptions of Cally, Nate, and Jim - get together for a fond look back at the comics and great times of 2011. Tears are shed, laughter is shared, remembrances are remembered, cities are built (you'll get it later), and auld langs are syne'd. (It increases their value, by the way)We discuss some news, including some really moving tributes by Spencer to some recently and dearly departed comic book creators (R.I.P.). Ryan then shares some news that will make his 2012 be the greatest year ever (until the world ends next December, of course). Mark, Spence, and Ryan all share their top 6-14 comics of the year, even though Spence has to dip out to get yelled at for a little bit. This fortunately allows Ryan and Mark to talk about their special bond -&nbsp; a bond so moving and intimate that no one else can understand! (especially Spence!!!)Hope to see you all next year, everyone! (or this year because the show was out a little late... oops.

Nice to see you again. It's been a while since the TPB gang has graced your earholes with some audio delights, so let's party like it's 2003!!! Spence, Mark, Jim and Ryan take a little while to warm up to their old podcasting ways, so they talk about other podcasts they could start, reminisce about Condorman, and share some exciting (and some not-so-exciting) news from NYCC. (No offense meant to you, Mark Bagley!) After reviewing a whole slew of things - including books from old pals/TPB alums Mike Raicht, Kirk "Manly" Manley, and Jamie S. Rich - , the boys talk about comic book shows and movies that exist, and some that don't! The TPB gang also realizes a sad universal truth - most orphans are probably pretty depressed.

We also wag our finger at greedy comic stores! Mark gets some Lemire love-time, and Spence gets to talk about Liefeld! That's a Win/Win, folks.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A cool breeze gently blows by. Fading sunlight beautifully transitions into twilight. Laughter is shared amongst dear friends. Far in the background, children play and enjoy their carefree youth. This is the best of times.</p>
<p>That's right folks.......... Cally is on vacation! It's just Mark, Jim, Spence and Ryan tonight!</p>
<p>We begin with some news - including Spence's stalking of a significant comic artists - and some discussion of the new Thor movie - eat your words, Ryan! Even though the gang loves the movie, they still talk about their nerdy issues with it. (That's the whole goddamn point of the internet and podcasts, isn't it?) Then Spence gives us a great review of the action-packed and sexy "The Ride" (volumes 1 and 2) by local writer Doug Wagner. We also then have a discussion of the preview of "My Maker &amp; I" by our pal Owen Johnson from the fantastic gentlemen at Accent UK!</p>
<p>We then snuggle up to each other and spoon while talking about this week's review! We hope that you can feel our tenderness and love.</p>

			<title>Episode 81 - Comic Book Movies with Jamie S. Rich</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://parentsbasement.libsyn.com/episode-81-comic-book-movies-with-jamie-s-rich]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hello Basementeers!! Guess who dropped by the basement again?? Jamie S. Rich, and we are delighted! We even straightened the place up a bit. Jamie is a hell of a fun guy to talk to and knows a lot about comics and film. He has written some of our favorite books such as "You Have Killed Me," "Spell Checkers," and "12 Reasons why I Love Her." Although the primary reason he showed up this time is to discuss with us the topic of comic book movies which seem to be all the rage lately. He had the chance to get an early showing for the new Marvel film, "Thor," and he shares his opinions on it.</p>
<p>Check Jamie out at his blog <a href="http://confessions123.com" title="http://confessions123.com">http://confessions123.com</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>After, the guys get down to their usual nonsense. We&nbsp;embarrass Ryan by reading his letter which caused Superman to stop by our hometown of Ogden, UT. We also review two great books by Boom Studios: Peanuts - Happiness is a Warm Gun and Planet of the Apes #1.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The lights were dimmed, the candles lit, and the pants removed. Sounds like it's time for another sexy episode of TPB!</p>
<p>What do we have in our boudoir for you fine listeners?</p>
<p>We tenderly ease tons of news into your ears and brain. Geoff Johns is a swinger with more and more comics, Showtime gets some oral action with Chew, Marvel flashes their new creative teams for Punisher and Daredevil, and Rob Granito is a douchebag. Ryan professes his love for Amy Adams - and hate for Lois Lane - even while his microphone (a Garth Ennis fan) tries to commit suicide from boredom. Cally tells horrible jokes that need to be explained. Jim fields awesome questions for Cally from Twitter, and Mark uses his sexy voice.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a damn good time. And we hope that you had one too!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to issue sixty-nineteen! All of our listeners in France will get it. For the rest of you, this is issue #79.</p>
<p>We're honored to have the ever-clever Claire Douglas start us off and join us for a little superhero talk. Then Cally ruins everything by swearing in front of her. The rest of the crew tackles Spence to try and maintain his rage, but to no avail. Spence shoots Cally in the face with a .45. This is America folks; that's how we roll. Mark sits back with a cigar and a sifter of scotch and laughs at the whole scene.</p>
<p>That's all fabricated, unfortunately. Cally is still alive and babbles through the rest of the episode. And Mark doesn't smoke.</p>
<p>Ryan bombards the crew with a bunch of news on everything, which forces us to mention Brendan Fraser, not once, but TWICE! Jim "toots his own dick" during his Emerald City Con report, and Ryan drops an atomic bomb on the crew with his announcement of discontinuing his Thor holds (great Odin's eye! Is he serious?!?).</p>
<p>Reviews:</p>
<p>VENOM #1</p>
<p>STUFF OF LEGEND #4</p>
<p>Closing song: JEG FALLER by Burzum</p>]]></description>

<p>Hello again, Basementators! Nice to see you all again. You look great!<br /> <br /> In order to accommodate Ryan stuffing his fat F'ing face with   pancakes, the gang rushes through this episode in record time! But that   doesn't stop us from Bring(ing) The Noise (and by "Noise", I mean   "News") with lots of talk about the Fantastic Three, Batman and Superman   movie casting info, Spider-Man movie stuff (including discussion of  the  pics of him being banged by some dude), Captain America movie news,   2010's best selling comics, Tony Moore's artwork being stolen, and  much  more! <br /> <br /> Cally gets made fun of - especially by Ryan, who  needs pancakes to  be happy - and then proceeds to do a Cold Storage,  with great musical  accompaniment! <br /> <br /> Hey! Please be good buds  and give us ratings on  iTunes - and the Eagle awards! (While there, be  sure to hook up our  brothers in arms at Accent UK) Go here to be cool  forever:<br /> <br /> <a href="http://www.eagleawards.co.uk/voting/" target="_blank">http://www.eagleawards.co.uk/voting/</a><br /> <br /> Reviews for this week:  Doctor Strange: From The Vault #1 and Shazam #1<br /> Musical Selection: Con Clavi Con Dio by Ghost</p>]]></description>

			<title>Issue 77 - Ben Templesmith Interview!!!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://parentsbasement.libsyn.com/issue-77-ben-templesmith-interview-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Artist extraordinaire, writer, and all-around snappy dresser Ben  Templesmith drops by The Basement to unleash his razor-sharp wit upon  us! You know Ben from his work on <em>30 Days Of Night, Choker, Fell, Wormwood: Gentleman Corpse, Criminal Macabre</em>,  and much much more. Mr. Templesmith is crazy-busy, but he graciously  let us talk to him about his comics, Macs vs. PC's, thumbing his  app/ass, Jim in a dress, vacationing in Barrow, free (?) sketches, and  drawing balls. Enjoy his verbal decimation of us and our sad attempts at  comebacks in this awesome interview!<br /> <br />If comic books bottom out and cease to exist, fear not about Ben  Templesmith - he would make a killing as a stand-up comedian. Dude is  truly funny as hell.<br /> <br />Check Ben out at:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.templesmith.com/faze3/" target="_blank">http://www.templesmith.com/faze3/</a><br /><a href="http://bentemplesmith.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://bentemplesmith.blogspot.com/</a><br /> <a href="http://ben-templesmith.livejournal.com/" target="_blank">http://ben-templesmith.livejournal.com/</a><br /> <a href="http://twitter.com/templesmith" target="_blank">http://twitter.com/templesmith</a><br /><br />and then go BUY HIS STUFF!<br /><br />Thanks again, Ben - we really appreciate it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the interview, Jim and Ryan had to leave and we talk some comic news. We are joined by Nate of the late "Nate's Corner." Cally, as usual, makes an absolute fool of himself</p>]]></description>

			<title>Issue 75 - Jocks vs. Hot Dicks</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://parentsbasement.libsyn.com/issue-75-jocks-vs-hot-dicks]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone! It's been a while since we had the whole gang back  together, and so there is much rejoicing (but not from Spence) as we are  joined again by Cally and Mark (Nate is still M.I.A., sadly...). We get  right into it by talking about "hot dicks" much to the discomfort of  Spence's wife. There is news aplenty as we discuss Fables 100, Amazon's  Top 10 graphic novels, Cap vs. Spidey, live Batman action (with promised  singing from Ryan), the Firebreather cartoon, and more. We have a  heated discussion about sports vs. comics (or more appropriately, Cally  vs. Jocks) that forever drove a wedge betwixt Cally and Jim, Twitter  trash talk, and then discuss the Walking Dead TV show. Mark says  "Y'all", Cally makes a three-way joke, Spence mispronounces words to  comedic effect, and then we move on to regular reviews with a bonus  Superman: Earth One review by Jim, and a Cold Storage (with piano  accompaniment) from Cally! <br /> <br />Pardon the sincerity for a moment, but honestly, thank you for  listening to us. We're just comic fans like you, and so it means a lot  that you would choose to listen to us. We may not be the most  professional unit around, but we'll always be fans, and that's why we  will continue to do it - we love comics, plain and simple. <br /> <br />Reviews for this week: Atomic Robo Vol. 5 #1 - The Deadly Art Of Science and Strange Science Fantasy #5<br />Musical Selection: Beneath The Surface - Belphegor</p>]]></description>

			<title> Issue 74 - Skottie Young Interview!!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://parentsbasement.libsyn.com/-issue-74-skottie-young-interview-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Ladies  and Gentlemen! We are very pleased to welcome to the basement, the very  talented Skottie Young, artist of Marvel's Oz adaptations. You may have  also seen his amazing cover work he does for Marvel. He does a hell of a  job, and we were literally gushing over him the whole time. Our Co-host  Cally gets on the mic at one time, and Skottie puts him in his place  which no other creator has done yet. We hope this marks the beginning of  a tradition of Cally's favorite creators pointing out his idiocy.</p>
<p>Skottie  was cool enough to walk us through his artistic process. He is very  good about sharing his techniques. If you go check out his website at<a href="http://www.skottieyoung.com/"> http://www.skottieyoung.com</a> you can find many step by step looks into his artistic techniques.</p>
<p>Check him out there and you can also find him on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/skottieyoung">twitter.com/skottieyoung</a>. He is a hell of a guy and very fun to talk to!</p>
<p>After  that, Ryan joins us and we talk about comics. We review a new comic  from AccentUK, "Fall of the Wolfmen." Seriously people, Listen to us!  You cannot say we didn't tell you so. Do yourself a favor and go to  their website and check them out and then get your hands on a copy of  "Fall of the Wolfmen," ASAP! We also talk about "Warlord of Mars,"  "Locke and Key," and much more....</p>]]></description>

			<title>Issue 73 - Guy Davis Interview!!!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://parentsbasement.libsyn.com/issue-73-guy-davis-interview-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>That's  right, it is issue 73, even though Cally calls it issue 72 on the show!  We are extremely blessed to have on of the coooolest people on earth on  the show this week - and he just so happens to be one hell of a comic  artist! Guy Davis stops by the basement this time for a little chat. Guy  has done work for Marvel, DC and other publishers but has seriously  exploded at Dark Horse. He has been doing work for the Hellboy spin-off,  B.P.R.D and has quickly made it his own with a unique visual style and a  story telling ability that is perfect for this universe.</p>
<p>Guy  tells us a little about how he got into comics to begin with, and then  how he got hooked up with Mike Mignola to be an artist in the hellboy  universe. We learn how he went from being the artist that was known for  drawing hats really well to the guy who can draw monsters. Guy tells us  about his process and techniques he uses to come up with the amazing  stuff that we see on the page.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis also tells us about his  ongoing creator owned project called the marquis. He started this all  the way back in 1997 and has released several volumes with more to come.  It is amazing! You should pick that up from dark horse comics  yesterday!</p>
<p>You can find news, info and much more on Guy Davis at his website <a href="http://www.guydavisartworks.com/">www.guydavisartworks.com</a></p>
<p>Thanks so much Guy!</p>
<p>After  the show, Jim, Cally and Spencer continue on without some of the other  regulars on the show and prove that they no longer need the others. We  have all of our regular segments this time including "Cold Storage," and  "Spence's Sack." This week we review Uncanny X-Force #1 and Batman:  Hidden Treasures #1. Also, We don't want to spoil anything, but we  stumled into comedy gold this issue. You don't want to miss the greatest  thing that has ever happened to this show since its inception (other  than our amazing creator interviews, of course). So keep listening after  the interview!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Mark, Cally and Ryan bash out a show without the stern and  dictatorial guiding hand of Spence and professional PR skills of Jim.  (Will it stand the test of time? Email us in about 10 years and let us  know, okay? Kthnxbye! )<br /> <br />Tons of comic news this week including a new Wonder Woman tv show,  Deathstroke/Col. Tigh on Smallville, Emma Stone (bless her cutie heart)  in the new Spider-Man movie, the sure-to-be-awful Spider-Man musical  (including a bad Bono joke from Ryan and an awesome Wolverine song from  Mark), Comic Con staying in San Diego for now, and the upcoming Avengers  cartoon.</strong> <strong><br /><br />We then review Z Girl &amp; The 4 Tigers (please check out </strong> <strong><a href="http://zgirlandthe4tigers.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://zgirlandthe4tigers.blogspot.com/</a> for more information!), and Ryan slips in a Star Trek: The Next  Generation reference for all you Trekkers out there (but mostly for  himself). Ryan then proves he doesn't know shit about geography and then  makes a bad Cally-esque racist joke about Nigeria. Sorry Nigeria! <br /> <br />Cally then reviews some stuff he's been reading and talks about his  hatred for STD-giving robots in his new segment "Cally's Science  Segment!" (this will probably be the first and last of this segment).

			<title>Issue 70 - The Return Of Francis Manapul!!!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://parentsbasement.libsyn.com/issue-70-the-return-of-francis-manapul-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>What's this?!?! Artist extraordinaire and TV co-host Franics Manapul actually agreed to be on our show again?!?!? Indeed! <br /> <br />Taking time out of his crazy schedule, Francis is kind enough to  grace The Basement once again. We get to talk to him about his comic  work (of course) as well as his exciting new job co-hosting the exciting  new SyFy network show "Beast Legends"! Juggling his work on The Flash  and traveling around the world researching mythological (or are  they?!?!) beasts has been exhausting, and Francis gives us the lowdown  on how he managed that, how he got the TV gig, his beast sketches, doing  scary/crazy stuff in the name of entertainment, fighting his co-host  scientists for more awesomeness, and much much more! <br /> <br />Mr. Manapul is one of the nicest dudes we've had the pleasure to  talk to, and it means a lot to us to have him on the show again. He's  insanely talented, extremely nice, and has great hair. Please make sure  to watch "Beast Legends" on the SyFy channel!<br /> <br /><a href="http://www.syfy.com/beastlegends/" target="_blank">http://www.syfy.com/beastlegends/</a><br /><br />And check out Francis here!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.francismanapul.com/" target="_blank">http://www.francismanapul.com/</a><br /><a href="http://manapul.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://manapul.blogspot.com/</a><br /> <a href="http://twitter.com/francismanapul" target="_blank">http://twitter.com/francismanapul</a><br /><br />Thank you again, Francis Manapul! (and Ryan apologizes for his "Manapul-ly" joke!)</p>
<p>After the interview Jim, Spence and Ryan power-trio it out (Blue  Cheer-style) and talk about all sorts of stuff! Lady Gaga and Lady  Justin Beiber get pissed at Bluewater Comics, Ziggy Marley does a  "Marijuanaman" comics (Jim is stoked), our pals at Accent UK go  Brazilian, and more Banimon craziness! Plus, the gang talks about the  recent hubbub about Alan Moore calling out other comic book writers. All  this plus reviews!<br /> <br />Thanks for joining us again!<br /><br />Reviews for this week: Sixth Gun #4 and Invaders Now! #1<br /> Musical Selection:&nbsp; &ldquo;A Kid Named Flash&rdquo; by Grandmaster Flash</p>]]></description>

We get to talk to him about his comic  work (of course) as well as his exciting new job co-hosting the exciting  new SyFy network show "Beast Legends"! Juggling his work on The Flash  and traveling around the world researching mythological (or are  they?!?!) beasts has been exhausting, and Francis gives us the lowdown  on how he managed that, how he got the TV gig, his beast sketches, doing  scary/crazy stuff in the name of entertainment, fighting his co-host  scientists for more awesomeness, and much much more!  Mr. Manapul is one of the nicest dudes we've had the pleasure to  talk to, and it means a lot to us to have him on the show again. He's  insanely talented, extremely nice, and has great hair. Please make sure  to watch "Beast Legends" on the SyFy channel! http://www.syfy.com/beastlegends/And check out Francis here!http://www.francismanapul.com/http://manapul.blogspot.com/ http://twitter.com/francismanapulThank you again, Francis Manapul! (and Ryan apologizes for his "Manapul-ly" joke!)
After the interview Jim, Spence and Ryan power-trio it out (Blue  Cheer-style) and talk about all sorts of stuff! Lady Gaga and Lady  Justin Beiber get pissed at Bluewater Comics, Ziggy Marley does a  "Marijuanaman" comics (Jim is stoked), our pals at Accent UK go  Brazilian, and more Banimon craziness! Plus, the gang talks about the  recent hubbub about Alan Moore calling out other comic book writers. All  this plus reviews! Thanks for joining us again!Reviews for this week: Sixth Gun #4 and Invaders Now! #1 Musical Selection:&nbsp; &ldquo;A Kid Named Flash&rdquo; by Grandmaster Flash]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>Issue 68 - J.H. Williams III Interview!!!!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://parentsbasement.libsyn.com/issue_68_j_h_williams_iii_interview_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Holy smokes! How did we get this interview?!?!?! (We honestly have no idea...)<br /><br />We  can't believe our good fortune as modern master and (multiple) Eisner  award winner J.H. Williams III joins us for a chat in The Basement! One  of the greatest artists in the world, we talk to J.H. about his  groundbreaking work in Promethea, Detective Comics, Desolation Jones,  and more!<br /> <br />We discuss with him the awesome rumor about Hank Williams, J.H.'s  break into the comic business (with some help from some fella named  HOWARD CHAYKIN!), his process, choice of artistic styles for different  moods/scenes, and about how DC should (hopefully) give him a little  breathing room! We get the requisite Alan Moore question out of the way,  and also talk about his upcoming work on Batwoman (in which he will be  co-writer as well). <br /> <br />You've all seen his work on Detective Comics, so you now how incredible it is. So go buy <em>Batwoman: Elegy</em>,  the hardcover collection of the Detective Comics run. The colors, the  art - the presentation - is so much more incredible in this collection  than it was when it was published. Can you fathom such a thing!?! It's  true. Check it out.<br /> <br />We can't thank J.H. enough. We had some technical difficulties  (imagine that), and we had to call him back and reschedule the interview  for another time, and J.H. was cool as a cucumber about the whole  thing. He didn't have to be, and we really appreciate it. What a pro,  and what a talent. Thank you, J.H.!<br /> <br />And sorry folks, no regular episode after that! You'll have to tune in next time for our idiocy. <br /><br />Musical selection: "The Hardest Part" by Blondie</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Once again, the TPB gang is forced to leave the basement! Squinting at  the sunlight, screaming in fear at flies and bugs, vainly trying to keep  a fire going - it's back to the great outdoors! In our second annual  camping episode we - minus the sadly absent Cally - broadcast from next  to the fire as we talk about HORROR comics! As if being outdoors talking  about scary stuff wasn't spooky enough, it was Friday the 13th when we  recorded! We were even by a large-ish body of water - not quite Crystal  Lake, but it was enough for us. (And mutant creatures were even reported  to be in there by Spence's wife! Yiiiiiiikes!)<br /> <br />Once again Ryan waxes nostalgic for old comics, Spence provides fine  historical background info, and Jim loves X-Files/ 30 Days Of Night! We  talk about all the horror out there for you, the discerning  reader/listener. Whatever kind of horror you are into, we talk about it!  <br /> <br />Thanks for our fine pals at Darkhorse, we were able to review two  new awesome titles - B.P.R.D. : Hell On Earth - New World #1 and Buzzard  #3. (Cally, you missed out!) After that, Ryan (with some help from  Spence) does a very rushed Cold Storage - with a few new intros! Then, something awful happens. It is a true horror story. Listen to see if the boys make it out alive.<br /> <br />We had a wonderful time, despite being outdoors. Sadly, we didn't  get yelled at by Santa Claus this year, and there was no "Boner Anus"  like last time - but we did at least have an offensive hot  dog/marshmallow roaster! We hope you enjoy it, cuz we ain't leaving the  house till next year!<br /> <br />Reviews for this week: B.P.R.D. : Hell On Earth - New World #1 and Buzzard #3<br />Cold Storage Review: Creepy #1<br />Musical Selection:&nbsp; "Where did you sleep last night" by Lead Belly</p>

			<title>Issue 66 - Martin Flink Interview!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/parentsbasement/TPB_Issue_66.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Wonderful writer/artist/gentleman Martin Flink drops by the basement  for a quiet chat in this episode! (Good thing our basement is so close  to Denmark....) We talked/gushed about Martin's new book "The Man Of  Glass" - from our wonderful pals at Accent UK&nbsp; - a few issues back, and  the gushing continues as we talk to Martin about "Man Of Glass" as well  as his past work including Utopia, The Troll and much more! We also get  soft and sentimental as we discuss children and how they affect you, and  how this plays into "Man Of Glass". We are then treated to a small  description of Martin's upcoming work "Lizard", which promises to be  awesome.</p>
<p>We've said it before, and we'll say it again: Do yourself a favor and  go to your local comic shop and demand that they order "The Man Of  Glass". It's a simple story, but it is beautiful, heart-breaking, and it  will haunt you - not in a bad, creepy way, but in a way soul-searching  kind of way. You won't regret it.</p>
<p>Thanks Martin! We appreciate it!</p>
<p>After the interview, Cally, Ryan, and Spence power-trio it out,  old-school style. First of all we talk about comic news...... depressing  comic news. More Bendis rage from Ryan (Ryan, shut up already!), Red  Hulk, Kevin Smith hate, Thunderstrike returns and more! The news picks  up with some goodness about our pal/TPB alumni Francis Manapul! Hooray!</p>
<p>After that, we get a Comic-Con recap from Spence, our  man-on-the-scene! He talks costumes, being crop-dusted by fat nerds, the  Boom party, our boy Dan Fraga, and our other boy Brian Churilla! (Give  him $5, you stupid nerds!) Spence met tons of folks, and then talks  about a few! Ryan does a Cold Storage review of Oni Press's great book  "Love Buzz" because he's a big fat softie, and then Spence does Nate's  Corner! What the?!?!?!?! It's true! (Somebody has to do it.....)  Luckily, the Nate's Corner segment gives us a chance to gush about  Joelle Jones, which you know we love to do.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>John Siuntres is a legend. Godfather of comic podcasting, amazing  interviewer - John is <em>The Man</em>. We are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">extremely</span> proud to  present to you our interview with Mr. Siuntres. In this great  discussion, we get to talk to John about his radio days, sports,  podcasting in general, Al Williamson, and a variety of other topics. <br /> <br />We usually are quite verbose in our descriptions of our interviews  (look at any past interview on our site to see) - but we're just kind of  speechless about this interview. Just listen to it for yourself and see  why.<br /> <br />John has been an inspiration to us all since day one. He is truly  the best in this business. Like Spence mentioned to us, it was like  having our iPods talk back to us after all these years...it was really  quite amazing.<br /> <br />It was a great honor to talk to John. He's the absolute best at what  he does - and what he does is kick ass. Thank you so much, John. <br /><br />Check  out the great John Siuntres at:<br /><br /><a href="http://wordballoonpodcast.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">http://wordballoonpodcast.wordpress.com/</a><br /> <a href="http://wordballoon.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://wordballoon.blogspot.com/</a><br /><a href="http://twitter.com/johnwordballoon" target="_blank">http://twitter.com/johnwordballoon</a><br /><br />After  the wonderful interview, we try to keep the awesome ball rolling.....  and fail miserably, of course. We talk about movies, some comics news  including the Green Hornet, surprising comic sales numbers and The Phantom for Dynamite, and the Jonah  Hex movie. <br /> <br />Spence single-handedly saves this portion of the show with an  amazing review of the amazing Asterios Polyp by David Mazzucchelli, Ryan  does the Indie 500 segment about the good folks at Corrosive Comics,  and then we move onto reviews! <br /> <br />We hope you enjoyed yourselves! We sure did.<br /><br />Reviews for this  week: Joker's Asylum - Mad Hatter #1 and New Avengers #1</p>]]></description>

Spence single-handedly saves this portion of the show with an  amazing review of the amazing Asterios Polyp by David Mazzucchelli, Ryan  does the Indie 500 segment about the good folks at Corrosive Comics,  and then we move onto reviews!  We hope you enjoyed yourselves! We sure did.Reviews for this  week: Joker's Asylum - Mad Hatter #1 and New Avengers #1]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[<b>Phil Hester is a REAAAAAAALLY busy guy. (Don't believe us? Check this

 ) That's why it was so awesome that he would take a few minutes and 
talk to us! The Eisner-nominated Mr. Hester is a very very talented man -
 he's not only a helluva writer but a tremendous artist as well! We chat
 with him about The Anchor (with our pal Churilla), Black Terror, his 
run on The Darkness, Gen13, Swamp Thing, Firebreather, his relationship 
with Kevin Smith, being a writer vs. being an artist, Green Arrow AND 
Green Hornet, and much more. <br>
<br>We get some info on his upcoming work, his dream job, Cartoon 
Network, and him dissing Cally with the most awesome book dedication 
EVER. As you will hear, Phil is an extremely nice guy and he loves his 
comics. Like we mentioned, he's an extremely busy and prolific guy - so 
do yourself a favor and go pick up some of his stuff! He rules.<br>

impressions! Hooray! Then Spence talks about Batman #700, and him and 
Cally go back-and-forth with Mike Mignola love/hate. (Well, pretty much 
all love and some anger about his career decisions - that's a more 
accurate description, I guess)<br>

amazingly-talented Eisner-nominated artist extraordinaire, Fiona Staples! 
If you listened to our podcast at all during 2009 you heard us gushing 
about her beautiful art in Wildstorm's "North 40", and we get to talk to
 her about upcoming projects, artistic process, favorite drinks, 
influences, the delightful Aaron Williams, DV8, The Mystery Society, 
Northlanders, and much much more! Check it out!<br>
<br>We're all big fans of Fiona, and it was really cool to be able to 
talk to her. Even cooler, this is the second time we've talked to her!

			<title>Issue 57 - The Return of Dan Fraga!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/parentsbasement/TPB_Issue_57.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the show's best and oldest friends returns for Round 2! (Technically Round 3, but that's a long story...) Dan Fraga marks his triumphant return to our show by hanging out with us for the whole damn show! We start off with a discussion of Dan's current gigs in the movie and TV industry. (Watch out for Fury - with Samuel L. Jackson - Marvin The Martian, and The Hard Times Of RJ Berger on MTV - among others!!!) Check out what he's working on here:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm1683464/" target="_blank">http://imdb.com/name/nm1683464/</a> <br /> <br />Dan also gives us a "Dan The Man On The Scene" report of Wizard Con - in which he met Jim MotherF'ing Kelly! (a hero to Dan, Ryan, and Jim - and all children everywhere). He also shares a crazy story about meeting John Byrne, his future comic work, his opinion on our review, and talks about our Cold Storage! Plus Dan and Spence dish on their love of their iPads!<br /> <br />Plus, there is tons of news! Our other show BFF Brian Churilla lands a bad-ass gig at Marvel doing a new version of Infinity Gauntlet! Marvel takes on Diamond, Joss Whedon ruins Ryan's life by taking over a whole bunch of Marvel movies, Jim Lee does a fun Treasure Hunt at C2E2, and much more!<br /> <br />Please check out Dan at:</p>

			<title>Issue 56 - Tom Fowler Interview!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/parentsbasement/TPB_Issue_56.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We are very excited to present to you, dear listener, our interview with the wonderful Tom Fowler! If you will recall, a few episodes back we gushed about the zaniness and insanity of the awesome <em>Mysterius The Unfathomable</em>, put out by our friends at Wildstorm. Not only did Mr. Fowler magically illustrate the awesome madness in that book, but he's done lots of great work with Mad Magazine, Green Arrow, Batman, and much more! (We also get the lowdown on two characters that we will hopefully see in further installments of <em>Mysterius</em> - Baby Ponce De Leon and the CBGB's Troll! ) Tom also fills us in on some major influences, Geoffry Rush, and Spence gets some tasty information about his art style and tools of the trade!<br /> <br />As you will hear from our interview, Tom is hilarious and extremely cool. It was a pleasure to talk to him. Don't forget to do your laundry, Tom!<br /><br />Please check out Tom's wonderful work at:<br /><br /><a href="http://bigbugillustration.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://bigbugillustration.blogspot.com/</a><br /> <br />and please go buy <em>Mysterius The Unfathomable</em>!!! We promise you will never read anything like it!<br /><br />After the interview, the gang talks about what comics - namely Nemesis, You Have Killed Me, and others - and Spence tells us all about the glory of the iPad. All this, plus our regular reviews and Cold Storage by Cally! Plus, Ryan eats his words about an artist that he's been bad-mouthing for a long time! We hope that you will find this episode as "Elegant and Beefy" as we did.<br /> <br />Reviews for this week: Flash: Secret Files and Origins #1 and Turf #1</p>

Holy crap, we all read lots of stuff!<br /> <br />Also, pay close attention - you may be able to experience an EVP  phenomenon as we are attacked by some sort of hobo ghost!

We can't seem to  recall...) Mark does a Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths dvd review, and  then Jim and Ryan do a review of Mysterius The Unfathomable, from the  kind folks at Wildstorm. Spence shows his softer side in an I Kill  Giants review, and then it's on to more reviews, including a Cold  Storage review! Holy crap, we all read lots of stuff! Also, pay close attention - you may be able to experience an EVP  phenomenon as we are attacked by some sort of hobo ghost! Exciting times  in our TPB studio.Reviews for this week: First Wave #1 and  Green Hornet #1

			<title>Issue 51 – Nektarios Chrissos and George Martzoukos Interview!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/parentsbasement/TPB_Issue_51.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back everybody! Oh boy, are you in for a treat! We start things off with a bang with a racist Asian joke, and then things get worse from there.</p>
<p>The gang talks about the Planet Hulk dvd and then some more Marvel news when we discuss the upcoming Heroic Age. Please note how excited and stoked Ryan is for this&hellip;&hellip; this is the exact moment someone needs to point out to him in the future when he is completely underwhelmed and disappointed in that event.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s this?!?!?! Yes folks, it&rsquo;s a Luke McBain/Trace Adkins review! Sean Phillips &ndash; artist extraordinaire &ndash; is lovingly discussed, and then&hellip;&hellip;.it happens. Horrible domestic abuse&hellip;.. on our show! Spence FINALLY lashes out at Cally!</p>
<p>After the cops leave, we have the opportunity to talk to Nektarios Chrissos and George Martzoukos! These great gentlemen are all the way from Greece and have just published the very interesting comic APOSPEROS: MERCHANT OF SOULS, from Visionary Comics! Aposperos is a Soul-Merchant, when someone sells their soul to the Devil, Aposperos collects the debt. But when he is confronted by a selfless sacrifice, his conscience awakens and sets him on a journey that will turn him against his old masters and reveal the horrible truth behind the soul-trade. A sophisticated thriller with secret societies, mysteries and intrigue! Listen as they describe their process and how this fine book came to fruition.</p>

<p>We talk to them about the comic, the European comic market vs. the American one, their influences, their artistic process, their accents, and much more!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In what might be the shortest episode in our history (due to the majority of the episode being lost due to technical difficulties), the gang gets together to review one of comicdom's most respected and highly sought after books. Before that, we talk about Daniel Johnston, peeing superheroes, and Gumby (R.I.P.)  Cally subjects us to a horrible 2Pac impression, and then we get down to business with some Nemesis talk. There is also some Green Lantern chat, and then some more glowing love for Hunter and Darwyn Cooke - with a little slander about Ryan thrown in as well!  Some comics are hated upon, and then glowing praise is lavished upon Sloth #4 in our review segment! There's a little talk about Invincible, and then more cool discussion about some of the incredible work of our pals Dave West and Brian Churilla.   Enjoy please!  Review for this week: Sloth #4</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&hellip; the gang goes almost racist as we talk about movie casting and fast food! We also move onto other non-racist news topics like Spider-Man, the Walking Dead tv show, Deadpool/Blackest Night stuff, and 2009 top publishers. Will we be on the list for 2010? I guess you&rsquo;ll have to wait and see! <br /><br />Spence and Ryan also talk about the Blackest Night Weird Western Tales tie-in, and have a slight disagreement. One thing that everybody agreed on are the reviews! Love is all around as we talk about two new titles. (Plus, we all love the $1 for #1 issues thing that Vertigo is doing, and you guys, of course!) We also discuss all the people we&rsquo;re going to bully and sleep with at Emerald Con in March. Good times!<br /><br />There&rsquo;s no Cold Storage or Spence&rsquo;s Sack as the gang is too damn busy! Making a comic is tough business, you guys!<br /><br />Reviews for this week: Joe The Barbarian #1 and Siege #1<br /><br />Music Selection: Heroes and Villains by Brian Wilson</p>]]></description>

We talk about how Dave got involved in comics and started Accent UK,
Eleanor Rigby, wives that don't like comics, our anthology that we're
working on (that Dave is really helping us out with), his art, comic
availability in the UK, conventions, and more! We also reveal how Dave
has been helping us on our comic!!! <br/>
<br/>
We love Dave, and we TRIED not to kiss his ass too much during this
interview. But honestly - the guy is extremely talented and bloody
brilliant. <br/>
<br/>
Keep track of him here!<br/>
<br/>
http://www.accentukcomics.com/<br/>
<br/>
Dave rules, and we'll never be able to pay him back for all his
kindness. How can YOU help him? Please go to your local comic book
store and ask them to order &quot;Whatever Happened To The World's Fastest
Man?&quot; WE GUARANTEE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!<br/>
<br/>
After the interview, we are joined by uber-relgious Mark, and we all
talk about the Boom Studios vs. Diamond distribution controversy, and
then share our Top 3.... which turns us into simpering softies and
makes us talk about comics that made us cry. Then things get dark, as
Spence talks about abusive fathers, and we all talk about &quot;prison
prom&quot;, Beantown, and Spence and Ryan argue about the art in Lone Wolf
And Cub! Dark times... but then we get treats! Spence's cool wife Heidi
and awesome daughter brought us delicious deserts! Hooray! <br/>
<br/>
All this great stuff, plus a Spence's Sack and a Cold Storage review!<br/>
<br/>
We hope you enjoy this issue as much as we enjoyed the good eats.<br/>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/parentsbasement/TPB_Issue_44.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Check this out: Brian Churilla - hot off the success of his awesome book The Anchor - drops by The Basement for an interview! Sweet! The Anchor is one of our favorite new books, but Brian has done outstanding work in many other comics including We Kill Monsters, The Engineer, and more! We talk to Brian about his books, and also about his start in comics, loving Phil Hester, monsters, the mystery of D.B. Cooper, and of course talk about some sweet sweet metal! (much to the chagrin of Spence)<br/><br/>Brian was super-duper cool, and we were very pleased that we got to talk to him! Thanks, Brian!<br/><br/>Brian rules hard, and you can check out his work here:<br/><br/>http://www.brianchurilla.com/<br/><br/>After the interview, the gang attempts to undo the negativity we put out in the last episode by naming our favorite creators who are both writers and artists! It's all rainbows and sunshine... until Ryan starts talking about the newest Conan issue. What the?!?! Insanity reigns as the new FrankenCastle story is discussed, and nostalgia is evoked in the new segment Spence's Sack! (Please note: this segment may be renamed in the future to make it sound dirtier)<br/><br/>Reviews for this week: Conan The Cimmerian #16 and The Punisher #11

			<title>Issue 42 - Royal McGraw Interview!!!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/parentsbasement/TPB_Issue_42.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[No, seriously! For reals! <br/><br/>For 25 episodes, we have been making fun of this wonderful man's name (due to a review of his work in Issue 17), but Royal was kind enough to forgive us and let us interview him! Fresh off his recently published work in Batman Confidential #36, we talk to Mr. McGraw about his past Batman work, his award winning (literally) screenplays, his work in the video game business, his graphic design background, and his appearance in a R.E.M. video! We also get the lowdown on his upcoming projects, and in a Karmic beatdown for making fun of his name for so long, the gang at TPB Inc. is taken to school by Royal as our trivia of DC characters (and credibility in general) is flushed down the toilet! D'oh!&nbsp; (We'll study and be better next time, Royal - we promise!)<br/><br/>Royal is a great writer, and a hell of a nice guy! Thank you so much, sir!<br/><br/>Deeply shamed by our lack of knowledge, the gang bravely tries to carry on after the interview. We talk about some comic news, including making fun of Joss Whedon and talking about the 5 creepiest sex scenes in comics! <br/><br/>We discuss another Top 3 list, review some comics (with everyone vs. Spence on one of them), and a Cold Storage review where Ryan comes across as more of a pervert than usual.

            <link><![CDATA[http://parentsbasement.libsyn.com/issue_39_aaron_williams_interview_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Join us as we interview the wonderful Aaron Williams, writer of one of
this podcast's favorite comics - North 40 for Wildstorm comics! The
extremely humorous and affable Aaron Williams got his start making
comics for fantasy and RPG magazines, and from there his work has grown
to include the comical tribulations of Nodwick, the fun superhero
school of PS238, and much more! We get the lowdown from Aaron about the
awesome Superman story he'd <i>like</i> to write, and even a little
information about his future project with Wildstorm! Embarrassing fan
encounters at conventions, mocking movies, corpse-eating robots, duct
tape....... this interview has it all!<br/>
<br/>Aaron is a delightful gentleman, and you can follow him here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.nodwick.com/" target="_blank">www.nodwick.com</a><br/><br/>Pick up North 40 and Aaron's other stuff - it rules! Thanks, Aaron!<br/><br/>After
the great Mr. Williams interview, things unfortunately go straight to
hell as Mark, Cally and Ryan are joined by Spence and Nate who were
just - in their own words - &quot;BF'ing&quot; each other. Cally talks about his
bleeding nipples, and even tries to talk with a French accent, which
leads to Cally and Spence having a contest to see who can do the <u>worst impressions of all time</u>. Who's the winner, you ask? Certainly not you, the listener! <br/>
<br/>But we also talk about some comic news, RIBE Liefeld, Hellboy,
Ryan's &quot;Disappointment of the Week!&quot;, more of Cally ranting about The
Watchmen and douches, and many other things. We even get around to
reviewing comics! Spence review's Darwyn Cooke's Parker, Cally takes on
the House of Mystery Halloween special, and Ryan does a Cold Storage
review. <br/>

			<title>Issue 38 - Mike Allred Interview!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/parentsbasement/TPB_Issue_38.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[In
this very special episode, we are joined by none other than Mike &quot;Doc&quot;
Allred, artist and writer extraordinaire. You know Mike (and his
wonderful wife Laura, who beautifully colors most of his work) through
his ground-breaking work on Madman, X-Force and X-Static, Red Rocket 7,
The Golden Plates, Metamorpho (with Neil Gaiman, for DC's Wednesday's
Comics) and much more! Mike is a distinctive and original voice in
comics, and he has not only enjoyed great success in indie/creator
owned comics, but major company success as well!<br/>

<br/>Mike is kind enough to share with us his beginnings in the comics
field and how the death of Gwen Stacy, and discovering rock and roll
and chicks, almost turned him off comics forever! Fortunately for us,
Mike was again exposed to comics later on and rediscovered his love for
them! Mike also shares how rock and roll exists in comics, and how the
two are completely intertwined for him. <br/>

<br/>Cally shares an embarrassing encounter he had with Mike at a comic
convention, plus we get the lowdown on some of his equipment, how he
thinks it's awesome to work with his wife, and Mike talks about his

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[In
this very special episode, we are joined by none other than Mike &quot;Doc&quot;
Allred, artist and writer extraordinaire. You know Mike (and his
wonderful wife Laura, who beautifully colors most of his work) through
his ground-breaking work on Madman, X-Force and X-Static, Red Rocket 7,
The Golden Plates, Metamorpho (with Neil Gaiman, for DC's Wednesday's
Comics) and much more! Mike is a distinctive and original voice in
comics, and he has not only enjoyed great success in indie/creator
owned comics, but major company success as well!

Mike is kind enough to share with us his beginnings in the comics
field and how the death of Gwen Stacy, and discovering rock and roll
and chicks, almost turned him off comics forever! Fortunately for us,
Mike was again exposed to comics later on and rediscovered his love for
them! Mike also shares how rock and roll exists in comics, and how the
two are completely intertwined for him. 

Cally shares an embarrassing encounter he had with Mike at a comic
convention, plus we get the lowdown on some of his equipment, how he
thinks it's awesome to work with his wife, and Mike talks about his
personal project of the Book Of Mormon comic adaptation The Golden
Plates. All this, plus a major ass-kissing by Cally! Good stuff.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>What the
what?!?!?! In an informational beat-down worthy of Albert Einstein or
Alex Trebek, Cally proves us all wrong with his knowledge that they are
INDEED making a Trace Adkins comic book! Who's Trace Adkins, you say?
You don't need to know. But Cally DOES know, and he also knows that
Trace wants them to &quot;make his pubic hair bushier&quot;!</p>


<p>Besides that, the Basement gang chats about public domain rights,
Spider-Man rape, an awesome Two-Face Harley (of a crappy version of
Two-Face, unfortunately) and the ultimate fate of Sodam Yat. Who the
heck is Dial H For Hero? Do him and this Trace Adkins person hang out
or something? Listen to our reviews and find out!<br/>

a whole lot of news going on, and we actually talk about some - after
Cally talks about Kenny G vs. Warren G. Join us as we talk about DC
Comics becoming DC Entertainment (big whoop), Wonder Woman postcards,
Wonder Woman love/hate with Ben Caldwell, Walking Dead on AMC, and more!<br/>

<br/>The Top 3 list makes a half-assed return, we manage to make fun of
bisexuals (so add them to our list of people we've offended), and we
coin yet another gross sexual phrase - all hail FELLATIO FISH! Plus, we
have a Nate's Corner review of Supermarket (the IDW book by Brian
Wood), a slightly disturbing and sexy Cold Storage review by Spence, and the first official (the other was
unrecorded) appearance of the phrase &quot;Boner-Anus!&quot; <br/>

			<title>Issue 35 - Norm Breyfogle Interview!</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://parentsbasement.libsyn.com/issue_35_norm_breyfogle_interview_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[In this special episode we're delighted to bring you an interview with
a hero of ours, Norm Breyfogle! Norm is probably best known for his
groundbreaking and influential run on Detective Comics and Batman (from
the late 80's to early 90's), and helped create such iconic characters
as The Ventriloquist / Scarface, Anarky, and Victor Zsasz. But Norm has
had a long and interesting career, and we at The Basement were very
excited to hear about what he has been up to lately. From a fallout
with DC Comics, to technical manuals, work with Malibu comics, his new
work with Archie Comics, and becoming a writer, Norm was gracious and
open enough to discuss everything we threw at him. <br/>
<br/>You can keep up with Mr. Breyfogle at:<br/><br/><a target="_blank" href="http://www.normbreyfogle.com/">http://www.normbreyfogle.com/</a><br/><br/>And check out his impressive comic resume here:<br/><br/><a target="_blank" href="http://www.comicbookdb.com/creator.php?ID=739">http://www.comicbookdb.com/<wbr/>creator.php?ID=739</a><br/>
<br/>It was a true pleasure to talk to one of our favorite creators!<br/><br/>After
the interview, things unfortunately return to normal with the Basement
gang. Adorned in Black Lantern rings that Cally lovingly gave us, we of
course talk about the huge news (that's right - a News segment again!)
of Disney buying Marvel, what this could mean for both companies (and
BOOM studios), and the pros and cons involved. Ryan goes off his meds
for a few minutes for a rant about advertising, but is thankfully
tranquilized by one of the stunned onlookers. (Don't worry folks - Ryan
was later released back into his natural habitat) <br/>
<br/>As if that wasn't enough, our special guest Kenneth - aka The
Comics Dilettante - does a review of the new comic &quot;Kill Audio&quot;, plus
we have more jokes about handicap abuse, a talk about the new &quot;Batman:
Arkham Asylum&quot; game, and a fun Top 3 List! <br/>

about comic news!!!! Holy crap! And then - oh my goodness, what's

again worthwhile as we bring back our long-dormant Top 3 List section.
This time we talk about our favorite artists and writers, so snuggle in and

			<title>Issue 31 - Interview with Dan Fraga</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://parentsbasement.libsyn.com/issue_31_interview_with_dan_fraga]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[We are delighted to present to you our interview with the one-and-only Dan The Man, Mr. Fragga-Boom himself, Dan Fraga! Dan is the best sport in the world, and was kind enough to email us after our bashing (but mostly Spence's bashing- haha) of one of his books in a past episode. We were truly delighted to chat with him, as he shared awesome stories of his start in the comics business, his artistic influences, and what lying and thieving bastards (our words, not his) certain fellow comic book people can be! Dan's career has taken him into many exciting new areas of entertainment, including music, music videos, and movies. But Dan also informs us that he is returning to comics soon, and gives us some details about his upcoming projects: 45, Switch, and The Grave! 

But there's more! Dan himself does the Cold Storage review! Pulling an old favorite from his comic vaults, Dan makes us all jealous (and then run to Ebay to buy it for ourselves) with his review of the amazingly-drawn (and influential) Doctor Strange #55.

Seriously - from the bottom of our hearts, we mean this - Dan couldn't have been any nicer. He was an amazing sport about everything, and we think he's one of the coolest mothertruckers around. Thanks a lot, Dan!

After our interview, we get a special Comic Con report from our Convention Correspondent, Spence - who generously brought us all gifts! We all loved them very much..... except Mark, who didn't get anything. Plus Cally tells more lame jokes, Ryan gets all PMS-ey about his comics this week, Jim and Spence talk about the new Green Lantern animated movie, and Accent UK gets more love. Join us for these treats, plus our normal reviews! Wonderful!

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[We are delighted to present to you our interview with the one-and-only Dan The Man, Mr. Fragga-Boom himself, Dan Fraga! Dan is the best sport in the world, and was kind enough to email us after our bashing (but mostly Spence's bashing- haha) of one of his books in a past episode. We were truly delighted to chat with him, as he shared awesome stories of his start in the comics business, his artistic influences, and what lying and thieving bastards (our words, not his) certain fellow comic book people can be! Dan's career has taken him into many exciting new areas of entertainment, including music, music videos, and movies. But Dan also informs us that he is returning to comics soon, and gives us some details about his upcoming projects: 45, Switch, and The Grave!

            <description><![CDATA[Our co-founder and CEO Spence was on assignment this week, spending quality time with his family...... and then ditching them to go to Comic Con for a day! (We'll get his full report next time - so as our brother Snoop would say "so just chill, till the next episode!")

Free from the imposing masterful shadow normally cast by Spencer, Mark and Nate talk more than they ever have! With Cally and Ryan there as well, the gang valiantly attempts to record the best podcast ever. (Did they succeed? YOU be the judge!) Lots of penis jokes from Cally, more gushing of love for our pals at Accent UK from Ryan - and later from Nate, but with a more even-handed review during Nate's Corner of their new anthology "Western" -  and one of the best, most heart-warming (and incredibly stupid) Cold Storage Reviews ever! Love of Eric Powell abound, Marvel once again confounds and displeases Ryan, and the merits of Major vs. Indie comic companies are once again debated. Who'll win? Tune in and find out!

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/parentsbasement/Tales_Issue_29.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[In this very special episode, we all left our parents basements to go somewhere we've never been.......... OUTDOORS! We all joined together (except the sadly absent Jim) and decided to go camping. To make it even more scary, we decided to sit around the campfire and review scary comics! Join us - and many awesome special guests - as we wax nostalgic about horror comics, talk about the dark side of Geoff Johns, and roast marshmallows! Cally steps up his quest to be offensive to everyone with his most racist joke ever (which may or may not be in this podcast)! <br/><br/>Please note: Cally's opinions and jokes in no way represent Tales From The Parents Basement, the other contributors of the show, or that of any of Tales From The Parents Basement's subsidiary companies. <br/><br/>We also profess our undying love for Wednesday's Comics, Accent UK, and Dan Fraga. After the podcast, as the cold mountain air enveloped us, cries of &quot;Boner Anus!&quot; and &quot;10 Sack&quot; filled the air - and eventually we were yelled at by Santa Claus. (Long story) More scary stories were told, and things were burned in a vain attempt to keep warm. As the we gradually drifted to our tents, our yelling and laughing was eventually replaced by the loud snoring of one of our special guests - who shall remain nameless. In the morning, we ate awesome pancakes made by our very own Nate! It was a tremendous evening, and we hope to do it again.<br/><br/>Reviews for this week: Creepy #1 and Blackest Night #1<br/><br/>Musical Selection: Fire At Midnight, by Jethro Tull (the album Songs From The Wood)]]></description>

are viewed from inside and outside the comic industry. Plus, we even
talk about shoes and My Little Pony for all you gals out there (and
Ryan).<br/>

			<title>Issue 26 - Jake Black Interview</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/parentsbasement/TPB_Issue_26.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>We often joke about getting exclusives here on TPB, but this time we're serious - we have BREAKING NEWS that you can only find here on TPB!
On this episode we have our very first interview ever with the great
Jake Black. We talk to him about his new comic Ender's Game: Recruiting
Valentine (out now from Marvel - go pick it up!) and some of his other
work. Jake drops a news bombshell for us, telling us that... </p>

					
					<center><p>KEVIN EASTMAN AND PETER LAIRD ARE REUNITING to design a print that will be sold to help Jake out with his medical bills!</p>
</center><p>You heard it here first, folks - this is a BREAKING NEWS EXCLUSIVE!!!
This is the turtle's creators' first work together in around 15 years
or so, and this is the only collaboration they will be doing to
celebrate the TMNT 25th anniversary. There will also be another poster
done by a few of the Turtles artists of the past whose proceeds also go
to help Jake!</p>


					<p>We
also talk to Jake about his other work with the author Orson Scott
Card, including his adaptation of Wyrms, and the colossal Ender's Game
Encyclopedia (coming out in November). Jake goes into his past (and
future) work with Smallville, the aforementioned Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles, the Twilight trading cards, DC figures for Eaglemoss
(unfortunately not easily available here in the States - they're
awesome) and much more!</p>

					
					<p>Jake
has recently been diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and like we
mentioned, the fine folks at Mirage Publishing will be helping Jake out
with original TMNT prints - including an original and new EASTMAN AND
LAIRD TMNT COLLABORATION! These will be available soon, and you can
help out and keep track of Jake and his current projects through his
website, which is</p>

					
					<p>www.jakeblack.com</p>

					
					<p>His
Twitter, Facebook, and Myspace links are all on there as well. Jake is
a great guy and very cool fellow, so please help out! We hope you enjoy
the interview - and hopefully we'll be able to see his Heroes In A Half
Cell story!!!</p>

					
					
					<p>We then do a semi-surprising review of the new Captain America issue, 
					  have a live Nate's Corner in which a lot of love is tossed around, and 
					  we share our embarrassing and insulting meetings with comic creators 
					  that we love and admire.</p>

		  			
					<p>Enjoy!</p>

It was a fun time for all except for some of our own who couldn't make it. Thanks Nichole! We are joined by a few of our fans though who add some great commentary...PLUS, we had a real live girl in studio! Needless to say, we had a hard time concentrating.Reviews for this week: Batman and Robin #1 and Chew #1

crummy vacation with his family! To fill in his mighty absence we are
once again joined by the illustrious and infamous guests Jim and Nate,
and we cover for his normal perversions by lots of jokes about German
porn and other gentle-talia jokes. Join us as we also discuss the shaft
that companies have given comic creators over the years, Jim goes
scholastic on ya'lls asses with a discussion of Chinese literature and
comics form, and Nate gives a positively scathing review of &quot;Wanted&quot;!<br/>
<br/>Plus, we have 3 (and a half) calls from our beloved Cally, the
dapper Comic's Gentleman, and the creepiest call we've ever gotten (and
that's saying a lot, folks!) from the new and mysterious he/she Joey!&nbsp;
(we think it was &quot;Joey&quot;)<br/>
<br/>All that, plus the normal news and reviews - and more free offers
than you can shake a stick at! Come on everybody, take us up on it and
get some free (and potentially tasty) swag!!!<br/><p>Reviews for this week: Green Lantern #41 and The Last Days Of Animal Man #1<br/>

review) that you won't
believe! (Let's just say that hopefully there will not be legal action
involved - fingers crossed!)<br/><br/>The gang disagrees on one review,
and joins together to shower praises on another. There's a live Nate's
Corner, lots of feud talk, and another amazing call from the Comixxx
Virgin/Cucaracha! (Like sands through the hourglass, so are the days of
his life) Plus, mini reviews of Unwritten, JSA, The Goon, Skaar, and
more!<br/>

            <description><![CDATA[In Issue 15 we are joined by Mark again, as well as Nate (who gives another live review, this time of BKV’s Pride of Baghdad) for a whole bunch of Watchmen discussions and assorted tomfoolery. Join us as we all really hate on one comic review and are split about the lameness/awesomeness of another. Plus, Ryan is shocked and touched deeply as Mark and Spence make a startling and astounding admission (which also threatens his very existence on the podcast). <br/><br/>Also, please enjoy new calls from the Comic Book Virgin (HOORAY!) as well as a threatening phone call to Cally from one of the thugs on Spence’s other inferior podcast (BOOO!), and of course reviews, Top 3 Lists, some boob talk, and etc…<br/><br/>Programming note: This podcast will also go down in history as the greatest podcast recording session ever because Spence’s awesome wife Heidi baked some excellent cookies for us during the recording.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[In Issue 15 we are joined by Mark again, as well as Nate (who gives another live review, this time of BKV’s Pride of Baghdad) for a whole bunch of Watchmen discussions and assorted tomfoolery. Join us as we all really hate on one comic review and are split about the lameness/awesomeness of another. Plus, Ryan is shocked and touched deeply as Mark and Spence make a startling and astounding admission (which also threatens his very existence on the podcast). Also, please enjoy new calls from the Comic Book Virgin (HOORAY!) as well as a threatening phone call to Cally from one of the thugs on Spence’s other inferior podcast (BOOO!), and of course reviews, Top 3 Lists, some boob talk, and etc…Programming note: This podcast will also go down in history as the greatest podcast recording session ever because Spence’s awesome wife Heidi baked some excellent cookies for us during the recording. Boo-yah!Reviews for this week: Battle For The Cowl #1 and Ghost Rider #33Cold Storage Review: Howard the Duck #1]]></itunes:subtitle>
