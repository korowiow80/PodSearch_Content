      <title>Ten Coins, One Lost, $150,000 Found</title>
      <description>I lost the money. It was true. But it would not be the last time I ever made a mistake. And when the money was returned, oh -- the rejoicing I had in my heart. Plus, the fact that I'd get to keep my job.

Take this woman in Luke 15, who had 10 coins, she lost one and went on a frantic search. And when she found it, she rejoiced with all of her friends!

In this same way, Jesus rejoices as do the angels in heaven when one person turns from sin.

Jesus longs to find each of us, despite our mishaps, mistakes and blunders!</description>

      <title>Phoebe, Walking Shoes of Faith</title>
      <description>I drop things. Make messes. Break stuff. But since God made me, I can walk in the shoes that fit my feet and trust Him.
                
                I can serve. I can carry the message like Phoebe and deliver Good News.
                
                Who do you think of when you think of a woman who serves? Are you this woman, one who lives a reverent life?
                
                God can take us, fix us and use us. He's in the fixing business, then again -- it is the carpenter in Him, I suppose.

      <title>Drusilla Rejects the Message?</title>

I believe that if she had, her story along with that of her husband Felix -- that their conversions would have made history and would have been in God's Word.

She heard about Jesus for two years when Paul was in jail. And her husband Felix was hoping for a bribe from Paul, but Paul's faith was not for sale.

Yes, for me -- Drusilla is the prodigal poster girl. Many hear, many listen and some never respond to the tug on their hearts. 

Will you?</description>

      <title>Rhoda Sees Peter, after His Prison Escape!</title>
      <description>Rhoda wasn't crazy! She saw Peter at the front door of the house, and at the very moment -- the others were praying for his safety and release from prison, God had performed the miracle.

They did not believe her, thinking she was seeing things. But Rhoda saw Peter, the first to witness his great escape from prison.

Rhoda was seemingly unimportant, but God used her.
She was the first to witness the miracle!

      <title>Mary at Bethany</title>
      <description>Mary gave her best, would you?

She poured perfume on Jesus' feet, worth a year's salary. The most expensive things she probably owned - and Judas complained about her choice.

When did you last give Jesus your best? What would it cost you?

The sweet smell of perfume is like the sound of bird singing -- it will touch your heart when you give your best to the Lord!!!</description>

      <itunes:summary>Mary gave her best, would you?

She poured perfume on Jesus' feet, worth a year's salary. The most expensive things she probably owned - and Judas complained about her choice.

When did you last give Jesus your best? What would it cost you?

      <title>Tabitha Lived the Way Christians Should</title>
      <description>What would happen if you died? Would your friends mourn? Would they celebrate? Or would they send for Peter so he could pray for you?

Tabitha died, and her friends sent for Peter -- he prayed and she came back to life. She cared for so many, helped the poor and widows. She was a great example of how we can show our love for others.

Can you say the same?</description>

      <title>Let's Go Camping with Priscilla</title>
      <description>Have you ever gone camping? Do you know how to put up a tent?

Do you know a tent maker - personally?

If not, then meet Priscilla, she has a tent ministry and she's telling others about Christ. She took God to the people right where she lived, committed to sharing the gospel with people.

Are you as committed? Do you serve with all you have, all the time with the right attitude? We can do the same - as Priscilla - stitching believers together for God's kingdom.</description>

      <title>Ten Virgins, Foolish and Wise - Which are you?</title>
      <description>Are you foolish or wise?

How would you know? 

Do you live in such a way you are ready to meet Christ? 

In our parable, ten virgins all have lamps, but not everyone has enough oil to keep them lit into the night. So when the bridegroom comes, five are out shopping for oil - would that be you?

Live ready - to meet your Lord!</description>

      <description>Mary sits at Jesus' feet - her sister Martha gets too busy to hear what God is saying - or wants to say to her.

Do you need to slow down? Do you spend time in quiet devotion with Jesus?

      <title>Anna Sees Jesus, Will You?</title>
      <description>Anna spent her life devoted to God, to the Temple. She was committed to service. Will we be able to say the same? Are we as devoted? 

Do you serve now? Is your motive pure? Will you see Jesus face to face? 

Will he say well done thy faithful servant?

This woman is an example for me, let her be one for you too!

Just as a squirrel devotes himself to the safety of this tree, let God be the safe haven for you. You can find him at the temple with Anna.</description>
