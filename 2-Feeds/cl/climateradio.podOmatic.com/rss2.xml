      <title>Ep. 38. Climate Action Summit + more</title>
      <description>Aired on 15th January 2009

More anti-logging protesters have been arrested in Tasmania's Florentine Valley. Police moved in on the two year camp early last week and began dismantling it. Most protesters left the camp, but some remained in tree sits at the camp and were arrested. Supporters of the protest held a rally on Hobart's parliament house lawns on Tuesday. Ali Alishah is a spokesperson for Still Wild, Still Threatened. He spoke with the Third Degree's Nick Hollins.

This week's Guest: As governments continue to endanger us with weak targets, lots of talk and little action, people are taking action on climate change into their own hands! Wenny Theresia is a climate campaigner with the Nature Conservation Council and longtime student activist. We caught up with her about Australia's Climate Action Summit, happening in Canberra from January 31 until February 3. Over the course of the summit, climate action groups and other concerned people will be joining together to develop a strategic national climate campaign and make connections with other grassroots campaigners from across the country.

The RTA are planning an upgrade to the pacific highway through Bulahdelah. Although there are 5 route options available, Option E has been chosen - even though the local community is opposed to it because of the Environmental and Cultural damage it will cause. The proposed upgrade will pass through a sacred creation site, as well as destroying threatened flora and fauna and local cultural heritage. Robert Corowa is a Traditional Owner and Environmental Activist from Bunjalong country in northern NSW. He spoke with Third Degree's Hannah Walters.

      <title>Episode 37. Pulp mill, resource wars + more</title>
      <description>Pulp Mill
Earlier this week Environment Minister Peter Garrett confused us all when he announced that the Gunns Limited pulp mill had failed to win approval from the government as it needed to meet 3 marine impact requirements. However later it was confirmed that the pulp mill can actually begin construction as the construction works were approved after environmental assessment.  Meanwhile, Gunns has just served another writ on 13 more activists for an action that occurred at the Triabunna woodchip mill in December last year. Third Degree's Libby King spoke with Ula Majewski, one of the activists who has been served a writ by Gunns, and also Paul Oosting, who has been campaigning against the pulp mill with the wilderness society.


This week's Guest: Antony Loewenstein is a journalist and author of My Israel Question and The Blogging Revolution. He joins us to talk about world shortages in resources such as oil, coal and water, and the impact this is having on global politics and the environment.

      <title>Ep. 36. New Year's Day Special!</title>
      <description>Aired on 1 January 2009.

10 000 Riel and a Case of Wine
Equivalent to around $2.50 - a paltry payout to displaced indigenous landholders in Cambodia, and also the name of a new documentary by a young Sydney film-maker. The documentary spolights some of the big players behind land-grabs in Cambodia; some transnational corporations fetching up to 100 million hectraes of land for aluminium smelters, logging and the like, leaving local communities without their livelihoods - but they're not going without a fight.

SCAG and Direct Action Penalties
The Chair of the Ministerial Council on Energy has asked the Standing Committee of Attourneys General, 'SCAG', to undertake a review of penalties that apply to unlawful disruption of energy facilities. The request emphasises, as a matter of urgency, the importance of protecting energy infrastructure and preserving energy security for &quot;the Australian economy and way of life&quot;. This request comes alongside the Government's release of their 5% emissions reduction target and the expected demonstrations against what many are calling an inadequate response to climate change. NSW MP Lee Rhiannon spoke with The 3rd Degree's Libby King.

Emissions Trading Schemes
Following on from the release of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme White Paper, we take a closer look at the merits of an emissions trading scheme, and paint what international context we can expect for 2009. Is an ETS essentially 'privatising the air'? What does it mean for global trade agreements? Will it further increase international inequalities?

This Week's Guests: Tim Frewer, Sydney student and maker of '10 000 Riel' talks us through some horrifying Cambodian and international land and environment politics; Adam Wolfenden from the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network (AFTINET) talks about discriminatory trade agreements and emissions trading schemes.

And we all battle with hangovers. Happy New Year :)

      <title>Ep. 35. Christmas Special!</title>
      <description>Aired on 2SER 25 December 2008.

Peats Ridge Festival
As we roll up to a new year in a polluted world, what better way to kick it off than a sustainability festival? We hear how Peats Ridge steps lightly on the local environment. From the Land of Hopeless Utopians to geodesic domes to fertiliser-harvesting toilets - the festival is about people coming together, having fun and imagining a better world.

Christmas Lunch
It's the biggest meal of the year! How can you make it more sustainable? We're advised to stay away from meat, stay in season and rethink what the 'local' Coles means -  Plus a few hot ideas for very last minute earth-friendly pressies, and some ideas for true food resolutions!

Mitigation Gap Report
Last week Kevin Rudd announced a 5-15% reduction in Australian emissions by 2020 as part of the release of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme White Paper. This is low - but the Mitigation Gap Report, published by the Global Climate Network, states that even the higher targets suggested internationally are also too low. The 'Mitigation Gap' is the disparity between diplomatic targets and the targets science tells us we need. The Third Degree's Libby King speaks to Andrew Pendleton from the Institute for Public Policy in London, and is coordinator of the Global Climate Network.

This Week's Guests: Claudia Santangelo, arts producer of the Peats Ridge Festival; Tim Barker, founder of Regenerate and member of the Figure8 sustainable production collective; and Renata Field from Alfalfa House, a community food co-operative in Enmore.

      <title>Ep. 33 Poznan, White Paper, International Day of Human Rights + more</title>
      <description>Aired on 2ser 11th December

This week the final round of climate talks before the Copenhagen agreement next year is happening at the moment in Poznan, Poland.

The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) - which include countries most at risk from climate change impacts - has made a plea for the world to commit to a strong action plan on climate change at the United Nations talks currently underway in Poznan, Poland. Yesterday Australia was awarded first in the &quot;fossil of the day&quot; awards for countries which attempt to undermine the progress of the negotiations. Third Degree's Jessica Minshall speaks with John Hepburn, Climate Campaigner with Greenpeace.

This week's guest: Owen Pascoe from the Australian Conservation Foundation breaks down the figures and targets that Australia should be aiming for at Poznan, in the White Paper (to be released next Monday 15th December) and at Copenhagen next year. He shares the latest information from climate campaigners in Poznan for the talks.

The NT Intervention is still being rolled out in the NT, despite a recent review and Rudd's election promise to replace the &#8220;emergency&#8221; legislation with genuine consultation with Aboriginal communities. The Intervention involves the suspension of the racial discrimination act, which is a blemish of Australias human rights record. Wednesday was the International Human Rights Day celebrating the 60th anniversary of the UN Declaration of Human rights. Third Degree's Hannah Walters spoke with Alison Vivian from the Jumbunna Indigenous House of Learning.

      <title>Ep. 32. Poznan, Olympic Dam, Off-shore CCS + more</title>
      <description>Aired on 2ser 4th December

Poznan Climate Negotiations
The Kyoto Protocol, which was signed in 1997, was a first step for international climate negotiations. Last year, on the back of the world&#8217;s first climate election, the Rudd government went to Bali pushing for strong targets. This week, Minister for Climate Change Penny Wong will enter negotiations in Poland without having set any domestic targets at all.
Libby King speaks with Jane Holden, the new Executive Director of the Climate Action Network Australia who is in Poland.

Guest Nicky Ison from Australian Students Environment Network and the Institute for Sustainable Futures - talks about International Climate Conferences and Australia's position on feed-in tarrifs for the renewables.

Olympic Dam Mine
Last week mining giant BHP Billiton hold its annual shareholder meeting attracting a large number of protestors outside the Melbourne venue. The company walked away from its bid to take over Rio Tinto but it was the proposal to expand the Olympic Dam mine 500 km north of Adelaide that caused the protest. Under the new 20 billion dollar expansion, BHP Billiton will continue to starve the water reserves of the Great Artesian Basin and increase the mining of uranium.
Anne von Fehrn speaks with Jim Green of Friends of the Earth Australia.

CCS Bill passes the Senate
A few weeks ago, a bill passed through the Senate, making Australia the first nation to legislate on carbon capture and storage, otherwise known as &#8216;clean coal&#8217; technology. This involves burying carbon underground, more specifically offshore beneath the ocean floor.

Phil Freeman, Climate Campaigner at the Australian Conservation Foundation, speaks here with Nick Hollins.

      <title>Ep. 24 Alice Springs Convergence and more</title>
      <description>Ep. 24 Alice Springs Convergence, Greens Radioactive Waste Dump legislation, Carben Offset watch and Green Jobs.

Aired on 2ser October 9th

This week's guest is Hannah Walters who reports-back on the convergence in Alice Springs against the NT Intervention.

Greens Dump legislation
With the ALP election promise to repeal the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act, you'd be forgiven for thinking that debate over a nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory is no longer relevant.
However nearly a year into the Rudd government's term, the act is still in place. Two weeks ago the Greens senator Scott Ludlam introduced a bill to repeal this act. The Third Degree&#8217;s James Hitchcock spoke with Senator Ludlam.

Carbon Offset Watch
You may ride a bicycle to work and have switched to GreenPower at home, without realising there are other ways you can reduce your carbon footprint.
More than 50 carbon offset schemes exist, but how do you find what project is sustainbable for you.
&#8216;Carbon Offset Watch&#8217; is a website that ranks Australia&#8217;s carbon offset retailers and Anne von Fehrn spoke to one its founders, Dr Chris Riedy from the Institute for Sustainable Futures.

Green Jobs
Workers in the U.S. are swapping jobs in polluting industries for new &#8216;green-collar&#8217; jobs in the emerging clean economy.
And in Australia, several pilot programs have started which focus on youth in coal-affected communities like the Hunter Valley.
This feature is produced by Jessica Minshall and Holly Creenaune. We speak to program co-ordinators, young workers and hear from researchers exploring the potential for green employment.

      <title>Ep. 23 -  NSW coal expansion and more</title>
      <description>Aired on 2ser Oct 2nd

This week's guest is Bev Smiles from the Mudgee District Environment Group, who provides an overview of current coal mining in NSW, and in particular Xstrata's record.

The burning issue is Garnaut:
The federal government's chief climate advisor, Professor Ross Garnaut handed his final report over to Kevin Rudd on Tuesday, and received some very mixed reviews from global warming experts.
Featured in story: Bob Brown - Australian Greens leader, Anna Rose &#8211; GetUp climate campaigner and Roger Jones - Principal research scientist of CSIRO
Produced by Michelle Watts.


NT Intervention uranium and rally
On Tuesday it was revealed that Uranium mining company Cameco has been granted a uranium exploration license for Angela - Pamela, a site located just 25km from the heart of Alice Springs. The federal government&#8217;s decision has incensed many locals who believe uranium mining could pose a direct threat to the safety of the community and its water supply.
Dr Hilary Tyler from Medical Association For the Prevention of War, is at the convergence at Alice Springs protesting against the continued NT Invervention and the impact it&#8217;s having on the communities there.
The 3rd Degree&#8217;s James Hitchcock spoke with her about the license approval.

Polluting environmentalists
Recent research in the UK has found people who feel they lead the most sustainable lifestyles are actually causing the most environmental damage.
According to a survey of 200 people done by Exeter University, people who regularly recycle and save energy at home are also the most likely to take frequent long distance flights.
Dr. Phil McManus is a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney Geography department. He has been doing related research into the tensions between discourses of sustainable cities and the practices of Neoliberalism. He spoke with the third degree&#8217;s Libby King.

Rising Tide meets with K RUDD
A Community Cabinet session was held in Newcastle this week, giving the locals a chance to voice concerns to the federal government. And, as ever, there were climate change demonstrations. A few people had short meetings with Kevin Rudd and the Minister for Climate Change, Penny Wong.
The 3rd Degree&#8217;s James Hitchcock spoke with Georgina Woods from Rising Tide Newcastle about her meeting with the PM Kevin Rudd.

      <title>Episode 21. Climate Camp Germany and UK, ethical investments and more</title>
      <description>Aired on 2ser 18th Sept 2008
-This week's guest is Renata Field from Friend's of the Earth Sydney. She reports back on the joint Anti-Racist and Climate Camps held last month in Hamburg, Germany.

- The UK has just had their third climate camp at Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in Kent, aiming to highlight how dangerous it is to be building new coal-fired power stations in the middle of the current climate crisis. Steve Milligan was a participant in all three UK Climate Camps. He speaks to the third degree's Libby King.

-A corporate watch report has found that only two out of all so-called 'ethical' investment funds do not invest in uranium mining. The 3rd degree's James Hitchcock called his super fund to ask how his super is being invested. He spoke with David St John - Chief Investment Officer for UniSuper.

-A Survey released last week suggests that delaying action on Climate Change may not be that popular after all. The 3rd Degree&#8217;s Andy Small spoke to Jordan Louvier, Executive Director of the Research Centre at UTS, about key findings of the survey, and their political implications.

      <description>This week:
-Damien Lawson, climate justice coordinator from Friends of the Earth joined us in the studio to talk about international carbon, why its not going to help us reduce emissions and its effects on developing nations under the kyoto protocol clean energy mechanism. There will be film screening happeing on tuesday on the topic 'The Carbon Connection' (see below for details).
Click here to make a submission to the governments Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Rising Tide Australia have a form letter to help out here. Submissions are due to 10th September.


-Our 'Burning Issue' of the week is the coal exploration and expansion of the Gunnedah plains regions. The China Shenhua Energy group was last week given rights to explore land adjacent to BHPbillitons licesne area in Caroona. Jessica Minshall talked with Tim Duddy from the Caroona Coal Action Group about the expansion and taing direct action.


-A global food crisis is threatening humainity. The cost of staple foods has risen by an estimated 83% over the past three years, and there are many factors contributing to the price surge. These include finaical speculation, the use of grain for bio-fuels, and the ising demand for food combined with eclining agricultural yields. The 3rd Degree's Nick Holins spoke with Julian Cribb, Ajunct Professor of Science Communication at UTS, to get his view on the crisis, and what Australia should be doing about it.

      <itunes:summary>This week:
-Damien Lawson, climate justice coordinator from Friends of the Earth joined us in the studio to talk about international carbon, why its not going to help us reduce emissions and its effects on developing nations under the kyoto protocol clean energy mechanism. There will be film screening happeing on tuesday on the topic 'The Carbon Connection' (see below for details).
Click here to make a submission to the governments Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Rising Tide Australia have a form letter to help out here. Submissions are due to 10th September.


-Our 'Burning Issue' of the week is the coal exploration and expansion of the Gunnedah plains regions. The China Shenhua Energy group was last week given rights to explore land adjacent to BHPbillitons licesne area in Caroona. Jessica Minshall talked with Tim Duddy from the Caroona Coal Action Group about the expansion and taing direct action.


-A global food crisis is threatening humainity. The cost of staple foods has risen by an estimated 83% over the past three years, and there are many factors contributing to the price surge. These include finaical speculation, the use of grain for bio-fuels, and the ising demand for food combined with eclining agricultural yields. The 3rd Degree's Nick Holins spoke with Julian Cribb, Ajunct Professor of Science Communication at UTS, to get his view on the crisis, and what Australia should be doing about it.


-My power is one of many groups cycling around Australia right now to promote sustainability, They're in the Northern Territory at the moment. The 3rd Degree's Andy Smal caught up with Mareki from the MyPower team after their visit to Mataranka Primary School.

      <title>Ep 17. De-carbonising our Energy Systems</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1136405/600x600_1174875.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James caught up with Dr Mark Diesendorf from the Institute of Environment Studies, University of NSW and Author of the Book ' something' about de-carbonising our electricity system. Diesendorf tells us from now until 2020,  energy efficiency measures and solar hot water can reduce our demand by around 50%. This can be coupled with wind and biomass energy. After 2020 Mark suggests solar thermal and pv, as well as geothermal can potentially supply all our energy needs. He also calls for a moratorium on new coal fired power.</description>

      <title>Ep 17. Toxic Pollution in Blue Mountains</title>
      <description>Pollution has severely reduced aquatic biodiversity in rivers in the Blue Mountains World Heritage area. New tests have shown the water contains toxic levels of zinc, and the population of some water fauna have been reduced by as much as half. The pollution is believed to be caused by run-off from an abandoned mine. Libby King spoke to Dr. Ian Wright, a researcher at the University of the Western Sydney.</description>
