<p><span class="drop_cap">H</span>appy New Year! I wish all of you a healthy and prosperous new year, free from undead outbreaks, zombieism infections and any chaos in general that might be caused by the end of the world (which may or may not happen this year, depending on whom you listen to). My sources tell me that while the apocalypse is well on its way, we still have a little time left, so I hope to make this year count!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a sneak peek concept sketch of one of the projects I&#8217;m working on right now&#8230; I&#8217;ve been thrilled to work with the amazing Dede Putra, who has rendered a scene from an upcoming story that involves some characters you might already know, plus some new ones from the same world. It&#8217;s all actually related to the music project I&#8217;m working on, that includes producing and remixing music from FETIDUS. Yes, the music album is really going to be released this year, and it will be worth the wait! (For those that have wondered what I&#8217;m up to, as is usual with me, this started out as a small project, but has grown and evolved to include other musicians and even artwork like the image above.)</p>
<p>For now, I hope you enjoy this concept sketch of one scene from the upcoming project. More on all this later! And again, Happy New Year! May the hair on your toes never fall out! (No, wait, that&#8217;s the wrong universe. Well, the sentiment is the same&#8230;)</p>
<p>Warmest Regards, James</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Happy New Year, my friends! I hope you all have an incredible, amazing, profitable, peaceful, healthy, joyful and otherwise kick-a$$ year ahead! I&#8217;m psyched up for all the exciting things planned for this coming year &#8212; and the most immediate exciting news is that the long-awaited FETIDUS finale &#8212; the monster-sized Episode 20 &#8212; will go live on 1-11-11!</p>
<p>Now that the holidays are wrapping up, all the craziness is behind us, computers are humming, and my little boy is no longer sick (and thus can go back to school on Monday, yahoooo!), all systems are go, Go, GO to wrap up this insane finale episode! Those that have been waiting have waited long enough, and now I can give a solid release date for this final beast of beasts.</p>
<p>This epic episode is &#8212; surprise, surprise &#8212; far longer than I thought it would be&#8230; so long, in fact, as I sit here looking at the gazillions of little parts and files, my jaw has just dropped to the floor. I can now wrap my brain around  this episode and laugh heartily at my prior foolish, mortal plans.</p>
<p>Episode 20 is currently clocking in at NEARLY TWO HOURS, with tons of dialog and action, music and sound design, that it makes my head spin. I&#8217;m <em>trying</em> (emphasize the word &#8220;trying&#8221;) to trim it down to 70-ish minutes, which would still make it the longest, most beastly episode yet&#8230; the perfect way to wrap up this journey. I could seriously split it into THREE solid episodes without a problem. But no, this was meant to be ONE giant episode, so that&#8217;s how I have to deliver it.</p>
<p>So barring an actual apocalypse (now watch Murphy jump in and oblige me), this monster episode is going out the door on 1-11-11!</p>
<p>Thank you all for joining me on this lengthy journey &#8212; but this is really just the beginning. Also coming in the weeks after the finale, will be a follow up discussion podcast where I&#8217;ll talk about plans, a post-mortem analysis, play promos for some of my podcasting friends (yes, I haven&#8217;t forgotten!), and generally shoot the proverbial breeze. So stay tuned after the finale for much more. For now, though, you can set your sights on Tuesday, January 11th, 2011 and join with Art Blanchard as all the final pieces fall into place in this wild and twisted story!</p>
<p>With Warm Regards and Bright Wishes in a New Year,<br />
James</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>The epic finale to this twisted tale is coming soon, my friends! I should be wrapping up production on Episode 20 in the coming week, and what a week it will be! I&#8217;ll update this post as I get closer to the finale&#8217;s release.</p>
<p>And yes, I&#8217;m feelin&#8217; a bit sentimental on this Thanksgiving weekend&#8230; dammit, I admit it, I&#8217;m a bit stunned and amazed at everything (and by that, I mean, everything) that&#8217;s happened since I originally launched this project over two years ago! I&#8217;m short on words for the thanks I feel for those that were there from the beginning&#8230;</p>
<p>I had no idea what I was really getting into &#8212; despite the wisdom and advice from some brilliant podcasting friends like Matt Selznick and P.G. Holyfield. Truly, the biggest surprise has been getting to know some of the incredible FETIDUS listeners and supporters. You all have been more awesome than I could have imagined. But more on that later&#8230; for now, my heart-felt thanks!</p>
<p>So prepare yourselves&#8230; for in roughly one week, you can take a final trip into this story, into the dark, fetid corridors of post-apocalyptic, undead-infested DC, with our good friend, Art Blanchard&#8230; yes, the huge, dramatic, edge-of-your-seat finale episode of <em>FETIDUS: The Damned Heir</em> will be upon you soon.</p>
<p>Yours truly, deep in the forges of production, James</p>
<p><strong>Update 12-8 &#8211; 11:11am:</strong> About ten years ago, I suffered my first catastrophic hard drive failure. It was devastating, to say the least. I didn&#8217;t have a consistent backup routine at the time, and a vast chunk of irreplaceable data was forever lost. It set me back quite a bit on an album project, and affected me creatively for a long time. Among the lost data were some extemporaneous and what I consider inspired and maybe even genius recordings from a good friend and brilliant guitarist. The data was totally unsalvageable, even by advanced data recovery methods. From that day, I made sure to back up *everything*, very consistently.</p>
<p>A few years later, I experienced <em>another </em>catastrophic system failure, but this time I lost not only the source material, but some of the backups as well! Now that  just stunned me. I had good procedures in place, but alas, not good enough. That one cost me dearly. I had some client work in that collection of data, so it cost me both time and money to recreate. It was a painful lesson. So I learned the hard way to have <em>backups of  backups</em>!</p>
<p>Fast forward to today &#8212; this last little while has been crazy. I have seen TWO battery backup systems flat out die on me due to some wicked brownouts (or gremlins), crashing computers left and right, with one hard drive dead, one server badly crashed, another hard drive corrupted, one router dead, another router insane and now unreliable, another computer with more hard drive errors (failure imminent, need to replace, note to self), one KVM switch completely dead&#8230; what else?  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m missing some more goofy IT things. I&#8217;ve been running around dealing with these lovely surprises &#8212; two days ago, for example, I made at least 5 trips to Best  Buy, MicroCenter and Guitar Center! Very annoying waste of my life.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, through all this (and the resulting unplanned expenses replacing parts/gear), guess what?! I have <em>backups of backups</em>! Woooo-hoooo! As my main file server started throwing up errors AGAIN this morning just to spite me, I smiled confidently, sipped my deliciously perfect coffee and decided not to let some f*cking hardware problems kick my a$$ today. I will not go gently into the IT nightmare!</p>
<p>I just had to think back to ten years ago and remember the sinking, depressed feeling I had back then &#8212; after all my efforts and money spent &#8212; when I realized there was no way I&#8217;d ever recover those precious recordings. That was then&#8230; but today, I have <em>backups of backups</em>, baby. Oh yeah. In more and more cases I now even have <em>backups of backups of backups </em>PLUS<em> offsite replication.</em></p>
<p>In fact, most of my important data could survive a zombie apocalypse, which is just what might happen once I finish Episode 20! <img src='http://www.fetidus.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Decades from now, as our descendants pick through the ruins of our civilization they&#8217;ll find some of my data, and all will be well. <img src='http://www.fetidus.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>So please hang in there, folks, I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; through this little speed bump and when I&#8217;m all done, we&#8217;ll all breathe a sigh of relief from this wild ride! Check this space in the the days ahead for updates.</p>
<p>Yours in IT madness, preparing for a data apocalypse, James</p>
<p><strong>Update 12-13 &#8211; 10:05am:</strong> Things are coming together, guys! Getting very excited. My IT nightmare is mostly behind me now&#8230; those backups have come in handy! I&#8217;m gearing back up for the final hard-core production push, and I&#8217;ll update you with news in the coming days. This is turning out to be quite a December. Even my son&#8217;s flu can&#8217;t stop this episode from rolling <strong></strong>forward! He&#8217;s been pretty damn sick with a fever all weekend, but he and I have a cool system set up now (I&#8217;ve got him all day), where I have a laptop streaming a skype video session down to my office so I can monitor him. He&#8217;s upstairs resting, watching <em>Osmosis Jones</em> of all things&#8230; nothin&#8217; like a little Bill Murray and Chris Rock when you&#8217;re sick. More news in the next few days, and  I&#8217;ll respond to posts as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>Update 12-17 &#8211; 11:20am:</strong> Hi guys! Still chipping away at the epic-sized beast that is Episode 20! I&#8217;m running behind (as you can obviously see), but every day I inch closer to the finish line!</p>
<p>My pace has dropped off this week, though, due to my son&#8217;s continued sickness. What we thought would be a &#8220;nasty weekend flu,&#8221; turned into an 8+ day (and counting) detour into Sickville. We are waiting for some test results from the doc to know what&#8217;s really up, although last night my son showed some solid improvement&#8230; yay! He is finally getting better! He&#8217;s been out of school for over a week now, which has kind of dropped a nuclear bomb on a lot of our plans, from getting behind in normal &#8220;work&#8221; to holiday cheer. FETIDUS production was not part of the original holiday game plan! Haha! But who better to spend the holidays with than Art Blanchard?</p>
<p>So we hit a rough low yesterday, I&#8217;ll admit, when we realized our holiday plans were pretty much toast. My son suggested we have a pillow fight to cheer us up, and the gloomy Grinch inside me almost said, &#8220;I&#8217;m too tired, son.&#8221; But no, I fought the gloom and ultimately said, &#8220;yes!&#8221; to the pillow fight. Then he proceeded to kick my a$$ with every pillow-fight trick in the book. That cheered us all up, and, thankfully, he actually slept all the way through the night last night. <img src='http://www.fetidus.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  I&#8217;m still sleeping on the floor in his room (damn! I miss my mattress!), while he has my bed (my wife takes better care of him in the middle of the night). But I&#8217;m confident things will get back to normal soon.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m taking it one day at a time, and want to thank you for your patience. Some of you are used to waiting! All well-deserved, friendly jibes pointed my direction aside, I don&#8217;t want to make anyone wait one more second than I have to. I&#8217;m so excited to share this final episode with you all, and will keep you updated as things progress!</p>
<p>Warm regards on a cold Winter day, James</p>
<p><strong>Update 12-23 &#8211; 3:28pm:</strong> Well, my little boy is getting better, and things are starting to get back to normal for us just in time for the holidays! Wooo-hooo! He&#8217;s been out of school for what, two weeks now? And that during a period of intense activity for my wife, which means there was a lot of Daddy time. <img src='http://www.fetidus.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  We&#8217;re still keeping an eye on his cough, but each day, he&#8217;s been getting better and stronger. It&#8217;s a huge relief, and I&#8217;m feelin&#8217; great about the next couple of weeks. This has been one of those surreal months of life and you just have to go with those as they come along.</p>
<p>Now that my son is on the mend, I&#8217;ll be spending the next few days trying to have a &#8220;normal&#8221; holiday (note the quotes around the word &#8220;normal&#8221; &#8212; interpret how you will) with my family, then back to work on the finale. Thank you guys for hanging in there! I&#8217;ll update you in the coming days, and I&#8217;ll finally be able to target a release date for Episode 20, so there won&#8217;t be any more guessing.</p>
<p>Until then, I wish you all a safe and happy holiday, and can&#8217;t wait to wrap up this phase of the adventure, both literally and metaphorically. <img src='http://www.fetidus.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Wishing holiday cheer, James</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>The time is almost upon us, my friends &#8212; the finale is almost here! The tension mounts as the drama comes to a nerve-racking boiling point! What will happen with Art, Milla, Sov, Rachel, Leigh and Phil?! Soon, you&#8217;ll have all the answers! I can&#8217;t wait to release the final two episodes! I&#8217;m still going strong on Episode 19 right now, so please check back in the next few days as I wrap it up and release it into the wild! I&#8217;m still reeling from the hungry beast that was Episode 18. (I&#8217;m glad I made it through that one alive and still twitching &#8212; it had the equivalent of two episodes of work in it.) So hang tight with me as I push through the final production phase! Thanks to all for your awesome support! Yours in the depths of shadowy production, James</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 11-17:</strong> I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; there, folks! An intense week with work which combined with the blast of Episode 18 ruffled my evil plans and meticulous scheduling&#8230; and more importantly, I don&#8217;t want to cut corners and give you something that isn&#8217;t just right. Or rather, just wrong&#8230; oh so wrong. So please hang in there, I will definitely get you Episode 19 by Friday the 19th. And then, it&#8217;s all gangbusters here to prep the finale, Episode 20! Your patience will be rewarded! Best, James</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 11-19 &#8211; 9:16pm:</strong> Ahhhh, hell, folks. I think the dastardly undead from Episode 18 did something funky to my main audio/music computer. It&#8217;s been acting very flaky on 19 and I&#8217;ve been crashing left and right. Grrrrr. I&#8217;m trying to diagnose it right now. I also made the foolishly mortal mistake of installing some key software updates in the middle of production&#8230; that&#8217;s a big no-no, and I should have known better. That could be the problem as well&#8230; Yes, foolish mortal me. Anyway, I&#8217;m feeling quite flummoxed, frustrated and bit-busted right now, and deeply apologize for the delay. I&#8217;m so close with EP19 I can taste it&#8230; smell it&#8230; touch it&#8230; so please bear with me while I figure out my technical issues. Yours in undead production, James</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 11-20 &#8211; 6:23pm:</strong> Now up and running again, folks! At least enough to resume mixing on EP19! I wasn&#8217;t able to completely solve my software strangeness, but I stumbled across an old bottle of inhibitors as a workaround, so the zombie infection has been held back from total take-over of my main audio/music computer. I&#8217;ll have Dr. Cornelius Sutton take a good look at the computer next week, but tonight, I&#8217;ll crank back into gear with EP19. So unless the inhibitors have lost their potency and the zombie re-emerges from my computer, I&#8217;m expecting I&#8217;ll have EP19 posted for your listening pleasure by tomorrow,  November 21. Thanks again for your understanding! Yours in non-corporeal anticipation, James</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Hey Everybody, James Durham here! Just a quick update for Friday, November 5th. I&#8217;m still hard at work on the jumbo-sized Episode 18. That&#8217;s how intense and heavy duty this baby is. So I&#8217;m gonna keep plowing through tonight, tomorrow and I&#8217;m thinking maybe even on Sunday as well. So this beast of an episode will definitely be up by Sunday night, November 7th. Now, we&#8217;re heading towards the grand finale two weeks from now with Episode 20! So thank you guys very much for bearing with me. You guys are awesome. Over and out for now, I&#8217;m heading back in to the evil lair, for another round of production&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 11:17pm on Sunday Night:</strong> Well, my friends, I&#8217;m beat. I thought I could pull an all-nighter, but alas, I&#8217;m not so spritely. My eyes just went blurry on me, so I guess that means I better sleep. So many tiny parts my clickers are all clicked out&#8230; I feel like I have a zombie infection in my hands&#8230;. non-corporeal-tunnel syndrome, anyone? But I&#8217;m almost there. I think it&#8217;s a good one, guys. Thanks for your patience. Will definitely be there by tomorrow (Monday) after a decent night of sleep. </p>
<p>Yours in undeath, James</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span class="drop_cap">I</span> have good news to report! We&#8217;re getting close, my friends! We&#8217;re getting very, very close. After months of insanity, strange life events, hard work, an excessive number of visits to Chipotle and all-around poor facial hair grooming habits, I can tell you that I&#8217;m deep, deep, oh-so-deep in the belly of production.</p>
<p><span id="more-625"></span>First, and most importantly, I can announce that I&#8217;ve booked ALL the amazing FETIDUS cast for their final recording sessions! Yes, every last one of them. I&#8217;m happy to announce that at the end of June, I begin a marathon series of recording sessions, day in and night out, to wrap up ALL the FETIDUS episodes. Yes, ALL of them. Not just one episode. Not three. Not five. Not eight. ALL of the remaining episodes.</p>
<p>By the first week of July, all the dialog will be IN THE CAN. RECORDED. WRAPPED. SET IN STONE (or rather, set in tiny magnetic particles on a hard drive, and then carefully backed up). It will then be lovingly edited, finessed, mixed and mastered for your listening pleasure.</p>
<p>And what does that mean? Well, when I have all the dialog recorded, I&#8217;ll be ready and confident to re-launch FETIDUS, knowing that I have all the audio recordings in the bank. You read that correctly. FETIDUS is re-launching very soon. As I get closer to wrapping up the recording sessions, I&#8217;ll announce a specific date, but for now, just know that all of us involved with FETIDUS are looking forward to delivering some great episodes, leading up to the big finale. And what a finale I&#8217;m planning. You will not want to miss it.</p>
<p>To all of you patient (or in some cases not-so-patient) listeners, I say, your wait is almost over. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your investment of time and interest in these characters and this twisted post-apocalyptic world, all in good faith that I would deliver the full journey for your enjoyment. Thank you for being there through an unusual year for my family, and helping to keep the fire burning. Your patience will be rewarded with the re-launch of FETIDUS, starting with a tweaked Episode 1 all the way through to the thrilling conclusion&#8230; with one episode every week.</p>
<p>Re-launch date announcement coming soon.</p>
<p>Yours, Deep in the Belly of Production,<br />
James Durham</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>ime and life have a way of sneaking up on you. At least that&#8217;s how I feel lately. I&#8217;ve been learning some of the subtle points of the &#8220;Art of Bending with the Wind&#8221; over the last year and a half, and I&#8217;ve discovered I&#8217;m not nearly as limber as I thought I was. This has caused profound personal reflection which I hope to put to good use in many areas of my life.</p>
<p>And as it all applies to FETIDUS, I owe you a long overdue update.</p>
<p>First, I want to make sure you know that FETIDUS is alive and well, and I have been dying to release the remaining episodes. Yes, it has been coming along agonizingly slowly, but it is coming along. There is so much more to come, it&#8217;s insane, and I chip away at it one bit at a time. Yes, there have been an unusual number of unpredictable challenges, surprises and bumps along the way, but the good news is that I&#8217;m in the process of recording all 12 remaining episodes and FETIDUS will wrap up in the coming months. Finally.</p>
<p><span id="more-619"></span></p>
<p>At this point, I think it&#8217;s best to roll with the punches and revise/tweak some of my plans that I mentioned in The Unmortem Report #5. I hope you will understand and I gratefully, humbly ask for your patience. I am currently focusing on getting the whole package complete &#8212; I&#8217;ve decided to spend all my FETIDUS-related energy exclusively on wrapping up all the episodes at once, in an extended marathon of production. In the end, it will help speed up the release of the remaining episodes, and make for a much more consistent, sequential experience when all the episodes are ready.</p>
<p>So, I am planning to *re-launch* FETIDUS in the streamlined, Mk-II format that I indicated in The Unmortem Report #5, with all episodes complete! I will announce the re-launch date soon, as the details of the remaining recording sessions are finalized. Then, I&#8217;ll be able to release FETIDUS, starting fresh from the beginning, on a consistent, weekly basis, right through to the climactic ending.</p>
<p>When I started this huge project, I embarrassingly underestimated the level of work involved. It&#8217;s taking quite a while, but I can deal with a huge script, tons of audio production and an all-original music score written just for this story. That was very challenging and would have been fine, except I had no idea that my little family would experience so many surprises on the journey. From a bad car accident to numerous serious health issues to some other big life changes, there have been many times I&#8217;ve honestly been overwhelmed and tempted to just give up.</p>
<p>But I knew I couldn&#8217;t give up, and despite being EPICally behind schedule, waist-deep in the river of life, I knew I just could not cave in and call it quits. At times, I&#8217;ll confess that these delightful life surprises (which I&#8217;ve accepted as &#8220;normal life&#8221; for the time being) have been frustrating to navigate, and have required some tough personal adjustments. If I knew what I know now, I&#8217;d most certainly do things differently. <img src='http://www.fetidus.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>I feel like I&#8217;ve really disappointed many of you who have been so supportive of this project right from the beginning, and there hasn&#8217;t been a day that&#8217;s passed that I&#8217;ve not thought about you. I&#8217;ve attempted to post updates many times, but held back because I felt you&#8217;d get bored rather quickly of what I felt was the same thing. At times I&#8217;ve invited you into my personal life, and I am so grateful for your support and even real-world friendships. But I haven&#8217;t wanted to overload you with that type of thing &#8212; after all, this is supposed to be a channel to share an exciting story of mystery, mayhem and escapism.</p>
<p>To those who have patiently waited for more episodes of the story, I apologize, and sincerely hope you&#8217;ll join me in the re-launch of FETIDUS and follow Art Blanchard on his journey all the way to the thrilling, twisted, edge-of-your-seat end.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said this before, but I&#8217;ll say it again: I&#8217;ve been blown away by you all, by your support and even simply by the number of people that have downloaded FETIDUS episodes. Many, many thousands of people. Just amazing. I deeply appreciate you and thank you from the bottom of my post-apocalyptic heart! And I want to ask once more for your patience as I wrap up with this grand adventure. I&#8217;m producing episodes 9-20 all at once, right now, and it will be worth it. After all, FETIDUS is about making the world a better place, isn’t it? Well, you’ll see.</p>
<p>Yours in post-apocalyptic (and present-day) mayhem,<br />
James Durham</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span class="drop_cap">A</span> quick update to the magnificent listeners of FETIDUS! The gears of the apocalypse turn ever onward! The next episode is nearly, finally, amazingly, almost complete! Yes! Your patience will be rewarded with my never-ending gratitude and of course continued episodes of FETIDUS as we follow Art Blanchard deep into the dark mystery of <em>The Damned Heir</em>!</p>
<p>This episode I&#8217;ve been working on &#8212; this giant beast also known as Episode 8 &#8212; has been the largest, most complex, darkest episode yet! Clocking in at well over 70 minutes, 7500+ words and tons of new, original, thrilling music, it has been a mighty task to complete. But I&#8217;m up to the challenge, my friends. I&#8217;ve managed to trim it back quite a bit, and get it into &#8220;normal&#8221; specs of time and wording, so we are finally nearing the launch of this dastardly episode!</p>
<p>During this round of production, I&#8217;ve had a few surprises come up&#8230; <a href="http://www.fetidus.org/2009/07/quick-update-for-july-2009/">my dear wife in the hospital</a>, <a href="http://www.fetidus.org/fetidus-fan-art-gallery/">awesome fan art coming in</a>, Parsec recognition, and even the <a href="http://95ers.com/" target="_blank">completion of a teaser/trailer for an awesome indie sci-fi film</a> I&#8217;ve been working on (check it out, I wrote the music for it).</p>
<p>In other words, Life, my dear listeners! We all experience it. The good and the bad. And everything in between. For me, what matters is that we move forward, chipping away at the sculpture of our respective destinies. And forward FETIDUS moves with me, into the next thrilling episode which is coming to your inbox or iPod (or Zune) soon. Enough of the cornball  verbosity! Now, I go back to work in my laboratory of creative mayhem!</p>
<p>Forever Your Humble Servant in Apocalyptic Matters,<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Dear FETIDUS Friends and Listeners!</p>
<p>Yesterday, my wife was able to take a walk around the 6th floor of the hospital and we stopped at a window and looked out over the beautiful Maryland sky, after a thunderstorm. We couldn&#8217;t help but take a deep breath in awe when we saw a stunning rainbow.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Val rainbow July 2009" src="http://www.fetidus.org/img/valrainbow0709.jpg" alt="" width="380" height="285" /></p>
<p>As some of you know, my wife has been in the hospital since Monday and I wanted to update you about us and FETIDUS. I felt it was appropriate to take a few minutes to post this, to thank you for your support and give everyone an idea when the next episode will be released. I know, it&#8217;s killing some people! <img src='http://www.fetidus.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>First, my wife seems to be getting better. Yesterday I managed to annoy her, which I took as a good sign that things are looking up. She also noticed my bad breath, so I know her nose is working fine. Today, I plan to annoy her so much that she&#8217;ll chase me around the 6th floor of the hospital, and I&#8217;m sure once she does that, her release will come soon after!</p>
<p>Once my sweetheart is out of the hospital and comfy back at home, getting back on her feet, and after I can catch up with work, etc., I will knock out the last parts of Episode 8! I just have to get one person in here to record his parts, do a little mixing, tweaking and we&#8217;ll be good to go. It will be awesome. The person I have to record will be back from vacation on August 2nd, I believe. (We scuttled his recording session twice this week.) So it should be shortly after that. I will update again if I think it will take much longer than, say, August 5th. But please keep in mind this is a fluid situation. The episode, by the way, is one of my best so far, and it is on track to kick some serious undead ass, and hopefully make you not want to eat for at least a few hours. <img src='http://www.fetidus.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Thank you all for your support and well-wishes! I can&#8217;t say how much it means to us &#8212; the emails, tweets, words and thoughts! We&#8217;ve had more than our share of hospitals and doctors in the last year. My wife&#8217;s bad car accident in November  was a real life-stunner for a while and this current medical issue has been pretty tough for her for a long time. Hopefully this is the last we&#8217;ll deal with it. Ironically, she&#8217;s the &#8220;healthy&#8221; one in the family. I&#8217;d be a crying little baby if I had to go through what she&#8217;s been through. But things are looking up, I believe. This morning, another consult with the docs, and we&#8217;ll know where we stand.</p>
<p>On a random, tangentially-related note, I thought the following words were hilarious, given the situation this past year: My fortune cookie yesterday said, &#8220;You could prosper in the field of medical research.&#8221; LOL! <img src='http://www.fetidus.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Finally, on a really positive note, I just found out that FETIDUS is a <a href="http://parsecawards.com/node/861" target="_blank">Parsec Award Finalist in three categories</a>! Wow! What an awesome piece of news! And what an honor! My wife will be totally thrilled too! (Always looking for positive news to share with her to boost her up this week!) I&#8217;m so excited and humbled that FETIDUS is a finalist in the company of truly amazing podcasts, it makes me restless and thrilled to  get more episodes out to you. I will not disappoint you. The next episodes take you deep into the mystery of the Donners, and deeper still into the fetid backstreets of post-apocalyptic DC of 2034!</p>
<p>Thanks again for your support, and we&#8217;ll be back up and running soon!</p>
<p>Best,<br />
James Durham</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span class="drop_cap">A</span>nd we&#8217;re back with another installment of <em>The Unmortem Report</em> &#8211; #3, the companion update and discussion podcast of <em>FETIDUS: The Damned Heir</em>! Hurry! You&#8217;ve only got a short window of time to enter the <a href="http://www.fetidus.org/2009/06/great-evil-laugh-contest/">Great Evil Laugh Contest</a>! Win immortality and an iPod touch! Entries are due June 21st! The results show will air June 28th! It&#8217;s going to be a great episode and include the top 10 evil laughs! You won&#8217;t want to miss it.</p>
<p>In this episode, I share some updates about the <a href="http://www.fetidus.org/2009/06/great-evil-laugh-contest/">Great Evil Laugh Contest</a>, when the next episode of <em>FETIDUS: The Damned Heir</em> is coming (and oh, baby, it&#8217;s a good one), and I get a chance to read some of the supportive, kind words you&#8217;ve been sending my way! Thank you guys for supporting this project! It just makes me want to deliver better content with each episode.</p>
<p>As a &#8220;mystical magical content block&#8221; in this episode, I talk about audio production &#8212; the type of production that goes into an episode of <em>FETIDUS: The Damned Heir</em>. I briefly talk about basic EQ, compression, reverb&#8230; you know, some cool geekish audio things I could get hung up on for hours&#8230; all in the light-hearted hope that it gives you some idea about some of the cool tools that go into making FETIDUS.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening! If you enjoy this episode, please share it!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>elcome to <em>The Unmortem Report</em> &#8211; #2, the companion update and discussion podcast of <em>FETIDUS: The Damned Heir</em>! This week I get right down to business by interviewing my friend, author and new media trailblazer <a href="http://www.mattselznick.com/" target="_blank">Matt Selznick</a>, who is also a cast member of <em>FETIDUS: The Damned Heir</em> and an Evil Guest Judge of the <a href="http://www.fetidus.org/2009/06/great-evil-laugh-contest/">Great Evil Laugh Contest</a>.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that there&#8217;s one more week to get your evil laugh entry in for the <a href="http://www.fetidus.org/2009/06/great-evil-laugh-contest/">Great Evil Laugh Contest</a>! Win immortality and an iPod touch! Entries are due June 21st!</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s the dilemma I faced this week&#8230; in fact, I confess to a &#8220;grave error.&#8221; <img src='http://www.fetidus.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />   <em>The Unmortem Report</em> is supposed to be 15-20 minutes long, maybe 25 minutes in special cases. And I had forgotten that when Matt and I talk, we end up talking for at least two hours or more! We can&#8217;t help it! The interview portion of our conversation took up most of that. So, true to character, instead of brutally cutting everything, my solution was simply to create two versions of the interview. The &#8220;turbo&#8221; version (25+ minutes) and the &#8220;special extended jumbo&#8221; version (70+ minutes).</p>
<p>The turbo version is here on this website, but if you want to catch the extended version, you have to head over to <a href="http://www.mattselznick.com/blog/sonitotum/2009/06/15/sonitotum-bonus-interview-on-the-unmortem-report-podcast/" target="_blank">Matt Selznick&#8217;s website</a> and get the link there. In the extended version, we talk about his current and future projects, philosophies about new media, even some of his favorite movies and many other things in fascinating detail. Matt will be posting a link to the extended version on his site soon after this version here goes live. [ Edit: <a href="http://www.mattselznick.com/blog/sonitotum/2009/06/15/sonitotum-bonus-interview-on-the-unmortem-report-podcast/" target="_blank">The extended version is now live on Matt's site</a>. ]</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>elcome to the inaugural episode of <em>The Unmortem Report</em>, the all-new mini companion podcast to <em>FETIDUS: The Damned Heir</em>! Tonight is a busy night! This special episode marks the beginning of a new level of the content I&#8217;ll be releasing related to FETIDUS, and it allows me to pick up in between episodes of the podcast novel and share interviews, back story, character profiles, unique content and all sorts of other fiendish goodies, every single week.</p>
<p>To kick off <em>The Unmortem Report</em>, I&#8217;m also announcing the <a href="http://www.fetidus.org/2009/06/great-evil-laugh-contest/">Great Evil Laugh Contest</a>, where you&#8217;ll have the chance to win IMMORTALITY and an iPod touch! And all you have to do to enter is laugh. But not just any type of laugh. It must be an EVIL laugh. See the <a href="http://www.fetidus.org/2009/06/great-evil-laugh-contest/">Great Evil Laugh Contest</a> page for more information!</p>
<p>Along with the Great Evil Laugh Contest, I have to send out a huge thank you to the world-class evil guest judges <a href="http://jchutchins.net/" target="_blank">JC Hutchins</a>, <a href="http://sethharwood.com/" target="_blank">Seth Harwood</a>, <a href="http://www.mattselznick.com/" target="_blank">Matthew Wayne Selznick</a> and <a href="http://midnightpodcast.com/" target="_blank">Corey Graham</a>! They are elevating the contest to a whole new level of evil awesomeness, and I strongly suggest you check out why they are so eminently qualified for the job by visiting their websites.</p>
<p>Besides announcing the Great Evil Laugh Contest, in this episode of <em>The Unmortem Report</em>, I also play an excerpt from an interview I had with <a href="http://www.seattle-geekly.com/" target="_blank">Seattle-Geekly</a>&#8216;s own Shannon and Matt. Those guys have a rocking podcast, so check them out as well!</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s promo is <a href="http://www.guardiansnovel.com/" target="_blank">Kimi Alexandre&#8217;s awesome <em>Guardians</em> podcast novel</a>! I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to the next episode!</p>

<p>Click below for the audio-only promo for the Great Evil Laugh Contest:</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong><em> The original release versions of the audio files for this post have been moved to the <a href="http://www.fetidus.org/episode-archive-original-releases/">Episode Archive &#8211; Original Releases</a>. Please check the homepage for updates on availability of current FETIDUS releases.</em></p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s what the winner will receive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>IMMORTALITY! (In the form of having his or her evil laugh forever embedded in an upcoming episode of <em>FETIDUS: The Damned Heir</em>!)</li>
<li>An awesome iPod touch! Lovingly pre-loaded with all the episodes of FETIDUS up to the date of shipment!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here are the official rules of the Great Evil Laugh Contest:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Your evil laugh audio entry must include the following minimum spoken words, with your name, general location, email address and of course your very best evil laugh filled in:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My name is [ say your name ] and I am from [ say general location ]. My email address is: [ carefully say/spell your email address ]. This is my evil laugh: [ do your very best evil laugh ]. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>Click below to listen to an example entry for the Great Evil Laugh Contest:</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong><em> The original release versions of the audio files for this post have been moved to the <a href="http://www.fetidus.org/episode-archive-original-releases/">Episode Archive &#8211; Original Releases</a>. Please check the homepage for updates on availability of current FETIDUS releases.</em></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> You can only enter once.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Your evil laugh entry must be yours and yours alone.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Your evil laugh must be in your <em>natural voice</em> with little or no audio effects/processing. (A little reverb or compression is okay, but not needed.) We are judging based on the awesomeness of the evil laugh*, not the quality of the audio recording or cool effects. (Please don&#8217;t send me pitch-shifted stuff either, and that means you, Auto-Tune users!).</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Enter by phone (<strong>1-202-470-3471</strong>) or email an MP3 file to <strong>evillaugh@fetidus.org</strong> (preferred but not required) by <strong>June 21, 2009</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> By entering you give me, James Durham, permission to use your evil laugh entry in the podcast/novel/website. I will not reveal your email address, but if I play back your entry on the podcast, I may also play back your name and/or general location. (Trust me, it will be a cool episode!)</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> By entering this contest, you confirm that you are doing so legally for whatever country/state/province/jurisdiction you live in and that I&#8217;m not liable for anything going on with the Internet, your phone, your time, your brain, your wallet, your customs agent, your tax man, your evil laugh muscles or anything remotely related.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> That&#8217;s it! No other rules! Just get your entry to me by <strong>June 21, 2009</strong>! Tune in on June 28, 2009 for the announcement of the winner!</p>
<p><strong>A few words about the Amazing Evil Guest Judges and the Judging process:</strong></p>
<p>The best evil laugh will be chosen by a panel of world-class evil guest judges including <a href="http://jchutchins.net/" target="_blank">JC Hutchins</a>, evil mastermind behind <em>7th Son</em> and <em>Personal Effects: Dark Art</em>, <a href="http://sethharwood.com/" target="_blank">Seth Harwood</a>, evil genius behind <em>Jack Wakes Up</em>, <a href="http://www.mattselznick.com/" target="_blank">Matthew Wayne Selznick</a>, evil visionary behind <em>Brave Men Run</em>, <a href="http://midnightpodcast.com/" target="_blank">Corey Graham</a>, evil high priest of the undead at Midnight Podcast and me, James Durham, just pure evil.</p>
<p>I will personally listen to all the entries. I will then select the top 10 evil laughs and give them to the elite, evil panel of uber-awesome guest judges. They will confidentially vote for their top three favorite evil laughs. Their scores will be tallied. The winner will be determined. In the event of a TIE, I will write the names of those who are tied onto pieces of paper and place them tenderly into my fedora, the very fedora style that Art Blanchard wears in <em>FETIDUS: The Damned Heir</em>. I will then insert my hand and randomly select the winner.</p>
<p><span style="color: #808080;"><em>* What constitutes an awesome evil laugh? Here at the Great Evil Laugh Contest we do not discriminate against one type of evil laugh or another. There are hilarious evil laughs that make us want to laugh out loud ourselves like giddy schoolchildren. Then there are terrifying evil laughs that make us want to cower in teeth-chattering fear under the covers. Then there are creepy evil laughs that make the hair stand up on our necks and our spines tingle. There are so many other types of evil laughs &#8212; we want to hear every kind imaginable. We&#8217;re just looking for the greatest, most memorable evil laugh, no matter what type, and the one that tickles the fancy of yours truly and the prestigious panel of mega-awesome evil guest judges is the one that wins. Give us your best shot!</em></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span class="drop_cap">Y</span>es! We are rocking hard with Episode 4 of <em>FETIDUS: The Damned Heir</em> tonight! This one is a wild ride, so join Art Blanchard as he takes an unexpected detour on his way to the National Museum of American History. Yeah, this is what Washington DC is like in 2034. Sorry to disappoint you if you thought DC would be a blissful utopia by then. <img src='http://www.fetidus.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>This episode was a beast to create, even though it&#8217;s shorter than usual. It&#8217;s loaded with special effects and sound design, plus some new music, of course. I&#8217;m thrilled to bring you this episode.</p>
<p>Originally, it was clocking in at well over 60 minutes, and so I just made the tough decision to break the episode into smaller parts because: A) I never intended to go over 45 minutes per episode, and B) because I love where this version ends. Trust me, it&#8217;s better this way. Jump right in to this lean and mean episode. Your post-apocalyptic DC is waiting for you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>elcome to the world of FETIDUS! Today, October 31, 2008, marks the launch of <em>FETIDUS: The Damned Heir</em> with the release of Episode 1! Come inside, stay for a while, venture in its dark corridors, and meet Art Blanchard, of the DC office of The Foundation for the Ethical Treatment of the Innocently Damned, Undead and Supernatural. This is the beginning of his new twisted case &#8212; a mystery that takes him deep into the science-fiction, post-apocalyptic, politically-charged and grim world of Washington, DC, circa 2034, filled with noir-humor, suspense and horror. And did I mention zombies, vampires, and other shadowy undead?</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the journey in the months to come, and tremble with anticipation with the release of each episode. It has been a thrilling experience to create FETIDUS, and I get the bone-chilling sense that it will be even more thrilling to share it. Please subscribe to the site, visit frequently (if you dare!) to get new episodes, and feel free to share FETIDUS far and wide if you enjoy it! After all, FETIDUS is about making the world a better place, isn&#8217;t it? Well, you&#8217;ll see.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>e&#8217;re getting sooooo close to the launch! Three more days, and Episode 1 will go live! The dark streets of Washington, DC of 2034 await your visit on October 31st.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I want to welcome new website visitors! Take a look around and listen to some of the teasers I&#8217;ve posted, and if any of that strikes your fancy, you can subscribe for <em>free</em> &#8212; either by <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=fetidus" target="_blank">email</a> or by <a href="http://feeds.fetidus.org/fetidus">RSS feed</a>. Or you can just come back to the site to check for new episodes and listen right here by clicking the little play buttons embedded in the posts throughout this site. Did I mention it&#8217;s all <em>free</em>? Yes, all this mystery-loving, zombie-appreciating, politically-thrilling, post-apocalyptic, science-fiction, film-noir-esque goodness is free for your entertainment, pleasure and escapism needs.</p>
<p>And for those of you who ask, what the %&amp;#@ is an RSS feed or podcast? Well, for the technically-minded, Wikipedia has nice articles on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank">RSS feeds</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast" target="_blank">podcasts</a>. Basically, if you have an iPod or a computer or anything remotely similar, chances are all you need is a program called a feed reader, aggregator or &#8220;podcatcher&#8221; and you&#8217;re in good shape. You might already have one. iTunes is a popular podcatcher, for example. Some other options are <a href="http://feeds.fetidus.org/fetidus" target="_blank">listed on this page</a>. Even Google, Yahoo!, and your web browser can track feeds too.</p>
<p>Or, just <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=fetidus" target="_blank">subscribe via email</a> and visit the site often if all that RSS stuff annoys you. Technology can be more irritating than a happy non-corporeal sometimes, at least that&#8217;s what Art Blanchard says&#8230;</p>
<p>So check in again on Halloween and dive in for a while with Art Blanchard as he takes on a new case in the mysterious and stygian world of FETIDUS.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been brewing up a dark, post-apocalyptic world with the care and tender surgical consideration of Dr. Frankenstein, and I can&#8217;t wait to share it exactly one week from today &#8212; October 31, 2008! I hope you and your listeners will enjoy FETIDUS as much as I have writing it.</p>

<p>You see, there&#8217;s a voice in Art Blanchard&#8217;s head that keeps coming back to haunt him. It&#8217;s a voice that calls out to him, a voice that will never let him rest&#8230; and I&#8217;m sure Art wouldn&#8217;t mind if he could find some way to end the nightmare&#8230; and the memories. Perhaps if I share it with you, it might take some of the burden off of his own, charred soul. Help Art Blanchard&#8230; listen to the clip below.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>e now have an official launch date of <strong>October 31, 2008</strong>! What better day to introduce the first episode of <em>FETIDUS: The Damned Heir</em> to the world than on All Hallows&#8217; Eve? We&#8217;re working night in and night out to bring this story to life, and I can&#8217;t wait to share it with you. Not only that, it&#8217;s even more strangely appropriate considering the intense political season! I can&#8217;t think of a more perfect time to share a post-apocalyptic, science fiction world, filled with such creatures as zombies, vampires and who knows what else&#8230; all interwoven within a twisted mystery set in the charged political atmosphere of Washington, DC, circa 2034.</p>
<p>And you&#8217;ll be able to download this story, one episode per week, starting October 31st, for FREE. Sick, isn&#8217;t it? What insanity brought about the creation of this work? Poke around the website and find out. And check back frequently for updates! While you&#8217;re at it, make sure to <a href="http://feeds.fetidus.org/fetidus">subscribe to the feed</a> and/or <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=fetidus" target="_blank">subscribe via email</a> and feel free to spread the word among your friends and undead kindred. I hope that this will be one gripping mystery that will keep you guessing until the final episodes.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
James Durham</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he world of Art Blanchard, Esq. isn&#8217;t exactly pretty, but it is what it is. Washington, D.C. has surely seen better days, and FETIDUS is there to help make things just a little bit better. One zombie at a time. Here is an excerpt from <em>FETIDUS: The Damned Heir</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The night was unusually dark and oppressively humid, even for DC, which was locked in a nasty heatwave. DC in late July was not exactly the most pleasant place to be when the sticky humidity was in full force, even in the evening. It could be as bad as New Orlando in the summer, or worse yet, even Panama City. Still, the night was better than the hellish mid-day. Probably one of the many reasons why I preferred to work late at night.</p>
<p>The stench of old DC was particularly intense this time of year, which was not necessarily a bad thing, depending on how you looked at it. More than a decade of cleaning and rebuilding couldn&#8217;t purge this town of the thick odor that still clung to every surface. Even the new town seemed infused with it. It was an odor that reminded me of an unkempt morgue. I liked it&#8230;.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span class="drop_cap">I</span> just got off the phone with one Matthew Wayne Selznick, master podcaster, author and DIY-advocate extraordinaire, and I had to post a big THANK YOU to him for spending the time to share some of his podcasting wisdom with me.</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Matthew is a pioneer in the podcasting world, and author of <em>Brave Men Run</em>, an awesome coming-of-age alternate history novel set in his Sovereign Era universe, where the characters from <em>X-Men</em> and <em>The Breakfast Club</em> would feel right at home. He was the first author to simultaneously release his novel in serialized podcast/audiobook, e-book and print formats, and knows a thing or two about this exciting new media. Make that a whole lot of things or twos&#8230; <img src='http://www.fetidus.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>He was very generous to take the time to help me navigate some of the pitfalls and obstacles of podcasting my first audiobook, and honestly, it&#8217;s to people like him that all podcasters owe a debt of gratitude. Not only is he an extremely knowledgeable, generous guy, but he&#8217;s a great author too, so make sure to check out his website and novel at <a href="http://www.mattselznick.com" target="_blank">www.mattselznick.com</a> and <a href="http://www.bravemenrun.com" target="_blank">www.bravemenrun.com</a>!</p>
<p>Thanks again, Matthew! May the Sovereign Era flourish!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><span class="drop_cap">M</span>eet Art Blanchard, Esq., of the DC office of FETIDUS, The Foundation for the Ethical Treatment of the Innocently Damned, Undead and Supernatural. Here are a few of the things he has to say about himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Some people thought I was a mean old bastard whom you didn&#8217;t want to cross in a dark alley behind one of the many seedy bars in DC, and they were partially right. It all depended on who you were and why you were there, and what you meant by &#8216;old.&#8217;</p>
<p>Other people thought I was a sick zombie-lover, the sort that marched with the Zombie Outbreak of &#8217;21, and they were partially right too. What they didn&#8217;t know was why I did it.</p>
<p>Still others thought I was once a talented lawyer who had crashed and burned a few years back and now washed up defending back-street blood-sucking scum and the undead because that&#8217;s all I could do now. They were partially right too, but for the wrong reasons&#8230;.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
