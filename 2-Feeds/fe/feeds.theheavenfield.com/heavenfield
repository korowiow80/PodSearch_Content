      <title>Episode 27 - A Taste of Things to Come</title>
      <description>Previously... Events in the Maunsworth Array have led to a resonance in the Standing-Point Field that has hurled Grace and Thomas back into the Heavenfield, but worse, has allowed a terrible creature out into the Array Hall. Stuart Nicks, together with three soldiers, finds himself chasing after the creature in a desperate attempt to prevent it escaping into the Array tunnels, and from there out into the world. Meanwhile, Thomas and Grace have found themselves on the edge of another Heavenfield reality, alone with the Angel, and the approaching armies. The three forces, British, American and Exile, unable to retreat, must defend the open Entry-Point. They cannot allow any more creatures through, and can only dig in and await the inevitable onslaught...</description>

      <description>Previously... Alex has taken Grace and Thomas hostage, forcing them to travel back into the Heavenfield, just as both the American and Exile forces are drawn up to do battle. He leads them to the ruins beyond the valley in a desperate search for the Angel, but Thomas escapes with Sanders, and Alex is recaptured. As they flee, Gutteridge apprehends them, chasing Thomas down into the Angel's tunnels. Thomas finds the Angel, who intervenes just as the Americans and Exiles launch their attacks. It seems as if disaster has been averted, but Alex has chilling news. The horde of Creatures, led by the Demon Girl, may have followed them to Maunsworth, intent on destroying them all...</description>

      <title>Episode 23 - The First Flames</title>
      <description>Previously... The British forces at Maunsworth are concentrating upon building their fighting strength, in response, not only to the Exile cordon around their Entry-Point in the Field, but also towards the increasing political tensions with the Americans (whose policies are fuelled by Speers' paranoias). Grace and Commander James face painful times as they interrogate their prisoner Alex, who reveals some disturbing facts about his past, and also warns of a terrible danger approaching Maunsworth. Meanwhile, since returning from the Field, and his encounters with the Angel, Thomas Sullivan is finding himself increasingly assailed by visions and dreams which, while lending him a unique insight into the true nature of the Heavenfield, threaten to overwhelm him......</description>

      <title>Episode 22 - Storm-Clouds</title>
      <description>Previously... Now that the Americans have their own Array up and running, they have entered into a desperate arms-race to break the siege around their Entry-Point into the Heavenfield. Speers, in charge of the American forces, is still unaware of the attackers' identity, and is mistakenly convinced that it is the British that hold the Field. Meanwhile, Alex, having escaped the Exile fortress, has reached the Maunsworth Entry-Point, and finds himself a prisoner once again, this time to the British. Henschel, having helped Alex escape the fortress has opened it up to the attacking Demon army, sealing its destruction. The British expedition team fight their way back to the Entry-Point and escape to safety, but the Exile forces hold the Heavenfield-side of the Doorway now. The spy within Maunsworth, who has been passing information to Gutteridge and the Americans has been uncovered, and her attempts to destroy the Array averted. For the time-being it seems that all forces face an uneasy stalemate......</description>

      <title>Episode 21 - Survivors</title>
      <description>Previously... At the American Entry-Point, Gutteridge and his covert team infiltrate behind the lines of the Exile blockade and capture an enemy Fieldship. Now they must attempt to fly it back to their Entry-Point. Back in the Exile Fortress, Alex is confronted by a deranged Dr. Henschel, who helps him escape from his cell. Henschel reveals that it has been he, not Alex, under the influence of the Demon Girl, and in a moment of lucidity has destroyed the Exile Array and opened up the Fortress to the attacking Demon army. Alex makes for Hangar 13, where Henschel has a Fieldship waiting to aid his escape. Meanwhile, at the Maunsworth Entry-Point, the expedition is still under attack from the Exile soldiers. Grace and Thomas, separated from the group attempt to hide in the ruins, but Thomas is shot by an Exile soldier and his suit is breached. As he is overcome by the atmosphere of the Field he spies a mountainous figure who comes to their rescue. Thomas awakens to find himself in the company of an angel, who heals his wounds and repairs his suit. Thomas returns to the Field, and finds Grace. Together they head off into the howling sandstorm...</description>

      <title>Episode 19 - A Cruel Angel</title>
      <description>Previously... At the Maunsworth Entry-Point, the British expedition is exploring the strange world of the Heavenfield. While looking over a newly-discovered collection of buildings, they are attacked by a group of Exiles. The main security force, along with Gary Starling and Stuart Nicks, are forced to engage them in a fire-fight. But Grace and Thomas find themselves split from the group, and run further into the ruins in a desperate attempt to evade their pursuers. Meanwhile Speers' American Accelerator Array is complete. His newly-formed army enters the Heavenfield, only to discover their Entry-Point encircled by a force of Exile soldiers. Speers though, ever-more delusional, clings to his belief that it is the British who are attacking. Realising that their adversaries have access to far-superior technology, Speers orders Gutteridge to lead a covert team into the Field in a desperate attempt to capture and return with an enemy Fieldship...</description>

      <description>Previously... Stuart Nicks and Gary Starling return to the Facility after recovering from the horrors of their time in the Heavenfield. The Project appears to be back on track, and plans are made to return to the Field, but work on the new Production Facility adjoining the labs is progressing apace as the military starts producing suits and weapons based upon the captured Exile technology. After a few cautious experiments, expeditions begin again, and soon Thomas Sullivan finds himself on his first journey into the Heavenfield. The American Speers is manipulating fears over the Field in order to fund the creation of an American Accelerator Array, and build an army. His paranoia over his actions towards the Maunsworth Base has led him to believe that it is the British, not the Exiles who are responsible for threats upon Heads of State. Speers is in danger of dragging the Americans into confrontation with the British. And all the while Alexi must endure his incarceration deep beneath the Exile Fortress. His mind is close to breaking, as he endures the visits by Dr. Henschel, who awakens ever-more terrifying nightmares within him...</description>

      <description>Previously... Grace's suspicions over the investigations into the Maunsworth Research Facility are aroused as she speaks to Aubrey Wilson. He has been sent by the government to oversee the troubled Project. She sets the brilliant but eccentric Thomas Sullivan the task of studying the plane crash data, and he makes some startling discoveries. As well as proving that the experiments couldn't have caused the crash, he also uncovers traces of a virus planted on the labs' computers. Armed with this information, Commander James appeals for the reinstatement of the Standing-Point Project, and upon seeing the threat now faced from the Heavenfield, the government agrees upon a whole new level of investment. But to Grace's dismay, the research into the Heavenfield appears to be taking an ever-more military direction...</description>

      <description>Previously... The Maunsworth Research Facility is still under investigation for the plane crash caused by the American Speers and his clandestine group. His assistant, Gutteridge, working with an unknown agent within the Maunsworth Facility has placed a computer virus on the Base's systems, manipulating the experiment data in an attempt to shut down the Standing-Point Project. Awkward eccentric Thomas Sullivan throws himself into his research, and finds a new friend in Susan Moranne, a librarian working on the Base. Grace Palmer and Commander James struggle to understand the nature of the Heavenfield, while fending off the air-crash investigation, but the future for the Standing-Point Project looks bleak. Alex, having returned to the Heavenfield, and the Exile Fortress, discovers the group are becoming ever-more fanatical. He is forced by their leader, Dr. Henschel, to return to the Maunsworth Base with the intention of murdering Grace and Thomas, thus destroying the British Research Project. He and his companions fly back through the Heavenfield in one of the prototype FieldShips. They infiltrate the Facility, but Alex is overwhelmed by visions and cannot bring himself to harm his targets. He retreats back into the Field, but two of his companions are lost – Krisz is killed by Thomas' bodyguard Sanders, and Yuri is shot, perishing back in the Field. Amidst the chaos of the Heavenfield, Alex is once again visited by the Demon Girl, but escapes, and makes his way back to Petre's FieldShip. They take off and head back for the Exile Fortress...</description>

      <title>Episode 10 - The Haunted Place</title>
      <description>Previously... Using the very plane crash which Speers destroyed in a seemingly insane attempt to kill Alex, he and Gutteridge continue their desperate plans to shut down the Maunsworth Research Facility. Their operative inside the Base has planted a virus on the labs' systems, falsifying the Standing Point reports. Now all evidence relating to the cause of the plane crash will point to Maunsworth. Meanwhile, Grace has realised (with the intervention of Commander James), that there may be more to Thomas Sullivan than meets the eye, being commended for his theories on Standing Point by some of the greatest scientific minds in the field. Thomas, by contrast, is struggling to come to terms with life on a busy military base, and craves to learn more of the history of the Project. But a chance meeting with Saul Davisson makes him think again about the dangers he may be heading for, as he heads deeper towards unlocking the secrets of the Heavenfield...</description>

      <description>Previously... Alex has escaped, back into the Heavenfield. He has been picked up by three companions, and now must make the long journey back to the place they call The Fortress. Back at the Maunsworth Research Facility Grace attempts to question Saul Davisson about his experiences in the Field. But he and the team are deeply traumatised, and Grace, carrying responsibility for the accident, is close to breakdown. She finds some solace in the company of Thomas Sullivan, the awkward eccentric, as she attempts to drink away her sorrows. Meanwhile, the mysterious Speers, having been unable to capture Dragor Millovich alive, turns his attention to Maunsworth. For reasons unknow he is attempting to shut down the Facility and the whole Standing Point Project. To this end he sends Gutteridge to hand over a package to a contact working for them within the Facility, the contents of which, Speers believes, will shut down Maunsworth, and put an end to the Heavenfield Project...</description>

      <description>Previously... Alex has escaped from Gutteridge and his men, but Dragor is lost. He heads for a hotel where Dragor has hidden a transmitter which will enable Alex to contact a place he has called The Fortress. But time is against Alex, and his exposure to the Heavenfield is causing strange visions of dark creatures which threaten to engulf him. Meanwhile, the expedition team, trapped in the Heavenfield, and lost in an impenetrable sandstorm, are beset by terrifying apparitions. Saul Davisson, his suit breached, is dragged by his companions, forced to witness the horrific events, paralysed and helpless. When all hope is lost, and the team's air supplies are almost gone, Saul hears the familiar voice of Grace Palmer, and realises they are saved...</description>

      <description>Previously... Grace Palmer's suspicions prove correct, as she finds proof of foul play in Pattie's medical records, and determines to cut short the expedition into the Heavenfield. But the Accelerator Array brings back only one body – Pattie's. Her contact with the atmosphere in the Heavenfield has had disastrous consequences. With her death, the fantastic landscape has reduced to dust and a howling sandstorm engulfs the four remaining team members. But the storm also heralds the arrival of a terrifying entity – some devil-like creature. Saul Davisson and Gary Starling flee into the dust clouds, running direction-less until they fall from exhaustion. As the scientists at the Maunsworth Research Facility prepare again for the return of the team, an act of sabotage by Dan Earl leads to an explosion within the Accelerator Array that could strand the team in the Heavenfield...</description>
