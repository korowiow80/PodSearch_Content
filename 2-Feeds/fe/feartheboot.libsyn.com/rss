<p>Or not.</p>
<p>Either way, leave Chris alone about it. He&#8217;s suffered enough&#8230; okay, who am I kidding. He was made to suffer. It&#8217;s his lot in life.</p>

<p>* (2:00) Stuart&#8217;s participation in the one-page dungeon design competition.  The mental exercise of paring content down to just what&#8217;s really needed.  The virtue of succinctness in the face of bloated games.</p>

<p>* (15:45) Capturing a character in just ten traits, taking up an area smaller than a standard playing card.</p>
<p>* (19:38) The choice to exclude a detailed setting and an explanation of what an RPG is.  The increasing exposure people have to the concepts of RPGs.  The use of implied setting to make the game bigger than the text itself.</p>

<p>* (43:31) What the phrase &#8220;old school&#8221; means to Stuart and why he feels it applies to his game.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNwxv6TgsuU">The G.I.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, a note on what this is:</p>
<p>My kids love games.  My family has a weekly board/card game night that myself, my wife, and my kids all take part in.  On top of that, my kids have, with some help from parents, organized a gaming group that has a regular rotation and gives everyone a chance to get together and share new games with friends.  As a result, they&#8217;ve played a lot of games.</p>
<p>Recently, the idea came up of the kids starting a game review column.  This is the first installment.  Hopefully it will be helpful for those of you out there searching for good games to play with your own clans.  The first installment of what I hope will be an ongoing series is Oz Fluxx.</p>
<p><span id="more-2500"></span></p>
<p>With no further ado, on with the reviews.</p>
<p><em>First up is Shiloh, age 15.</em></p>
<p>Oz Fluxx, a game full of funny references and wild actions, was a mix between excitement and a small let down. After playing Zombie Fluxx, Martian Fluxx, and Fluxx with all of the additional packs, Oz Fluxx was cute, but lacked new rules and interaction with the other players.</p>
<p>You start off with the basic rules, draw one, play one. The game is filled with the original rules, such as keeper limits, plays and draws. In fact, it seemed like that was all the game contained. I felt as if the rules were much more dull than I expected.</p>
<p>However, the keepers were cute and all Oz themed. You had the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and Dorothy. You also had Keepers that were the silver slippers, the yellow brick road, and the Hot Air Balloon. They kept the game Oz themed, and not just like the original game.</p>
<p>There were a few particular rules that were Oz themed, such as, “Green Spectacles” which allows people who are wearing glasses or green clothing to draw and play an extra card. Another special rule is, “Magic Shoes” This allows players to click their heels three times and gain a card and play it. It would not count as one of the draw or play actions. While these are all fun, there are only a small number of Oz-themed special rules in the deck.</p>
<p>The actions were mostly general. Some had different names that went along with the Oz theme. One is, “It&#8217;s a Cyclone!” This action allows you to gather up all the keepers and creepers from the table and the discard pile and deal them out, starting with yourself. There&#8217;s another action with the name of “Ozma&#8217;s Decree”. This action allows all players to choose a “New Rule” from their hand and set them in front of you. You get to choose one, and discard the remainders. These are fun to play, when they come up, but the most actions that come up are the ones that are in other editions of Fluxx.</p>
<p>The Goals are all Oz themed, of course. They hold different goals you must reach, such as having Dorothy and Kansas (No Place Like Home), or having the Scarecrow and the Artificial Brain (The Smartest Dummy), or having Kansas and the Hot Air Balloon (Next Stop: Kansas!). They all are fun to read, and have very cute pictures to see.</p>
<p>Finally, the creepers are cutely Oz themed. You have “The Fighting Trees”, “The Wicked Witch Of The East”, “The Wicked Witch Of The West”, and “The Flying Monkeys”. Of course, if you have one of these, you cannot win, unless the goal says otherwise.</p>
<p>My final opinion on this game varies. It is very fun to play, and while the game does not last long, it has many cute references and different strategies. This is a very good take-along game if you have a few people to play with. It&#8217;s conveniently short. However, it does not hold so many Oz themed Actions and Rules. It was quite interesting and fun to play, though. I would suggest this game to any buyer.</p>
<p><em>Next in line is Eowyn, age 11.</em></p>
<p>OZ Flux is a game that always changes.</p>
<p>How do you play? Well, what you do is you start with a basic card. The card will say, “draw one play one”. That is what you begin with, but in the deck there are lots of “New Rules”. The new rules have different rules you may use.  Other than New Rules there are Actions, Keepers, Goals, Creepers, and Surprises. The actions are actions you can do with your cards. You use them once, then you put them in the discard pile. You do not need them to win, unlike keepers. I would say the game makers did a good job on the pictures for these cards. How you use these cards is: when you play a keeper card you set it in front of you and hope it will help you win. The next thing you would ask is: how do you win? How you win is some of your keepers could mach a goal. If you have the right Keepers or Creepers you win. Normally you can not win with Creepers but on certain goals you can. Then the last type of card is the surprise cards. There are four of these cards in the game. There is the one that will help you with actions. The one that will help you with keeper cards. There is one that helps with new rule cards and the one that helps with goal cards. These cards unlike other cards can be played at any time.</p>
<p>I think they did a good job making the game. I really think it is a fun game. You can play it really often because it only takes about half a hour and some times only fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><em>Finally, a succinct review from Xander, age 6.</em></p>
<p>This is a fun game!</p>
<p><em>Each of them also gave numeric ratings for the game, as follows:</em></p>
<p>Art: (Shiloh 5) (Eowyn 10) (Xander 5) &#8211;<strong>Average: 6.7</strong></p>
<p>Style: (Shiloh 7) (Eowyn 7) (Xander 6) &#8212; <strong>Average: 6.7</strong></p>
<p>Gameplay: (Shiloh 8) (Eowyn 6) (Xander 10) &#8212; <strong>Average 8</strong></p>
<p>Overall: (Shiloh 8) (Eowyn 7) (Xander 10) &#8212; <strong>Average: 8.3</strong></p>
<p>I hope some of you found this helpful.  If you have comments or suggestions, feel free to email us at familygamereview@gmail.com.  Also let us know if there&#8217;s a specific game you&#8217;d like to hear a review of.  Our family game nights run the range from Agricola to Uno, and we always like to try out new ones!</p>

* (23:14) How dead-end games can jade players on character creation.  Whether character creation itself is an enjoyable task.

* (29:48) Why we no longer trust casinos that operate outside of state oversight.

* (31:46) Setting bloat.  Elements that are useless to building your own story.  When too much detail is provided, leaving no room for creativity.  Organizing setting material.  Facing down an intimidating stack of setting and history books that have piled up over the long life of an RPG.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In episode 261, I made passing reference to a commentary by Ryan Dancey about the content of RPG products, specifically with an eye to new players.  At the time I didn&#8217;t recall where it was from, but after the show&#8217;s release I tracked it down to private communication.  I sent Ryan an apology, as quoting private conversations (even when unintentional) does not fit within the ethical framework of this show.  Being the great guy that he is, he not only laughed it off but was gracious enough to allow me to post the entirety of his comments.  So with my thanks to Mr. Dancey, here ya go!</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that most of the time someone in our industry tries to do an &#8220;intro&#8221; product, they&#8217;re really much more likely to be making a &#8220;switch from another TRPG&#8221; or a &#8220;play a TRPG again like you haven&#8217;t since you were a kid&#8221; product.</p>
<p>A product like Mouseguard, for example, has intro product potential but the way it is presented in terms of being a book, at a certain price, with a certain set of assumptions about the creative experiences of the potential players and GMs, would have a very hard time succeeding at bringing new players into the hobby.</p>
<p>A product like the Pathfinder Beginner Box is a bit closer to the mark, and I have hopes that it will work as intended.  I fear for its size, complexity and price though.</p>
<p>Things I learned while watching kids struggle to self-teach themselves TRPGs from behind one-way mirrors:</p>
<p>1:  They&#8217;re not patient.  They can&#8217;t easily connect information that comes at them from several different pages of a book, plus a chart or graph, plus a character sheet. They are so excited to &#8220;just play&#8221; that you can&#8217;t get them settled enough to process the complexity of most TRPG products.  More than 2 sources of information is overwhelming.  They&#8217;ll just tend to remember the last 2 things you showed them and forget the rest.</p>
<p>2:  They already know how to roleplay.  You tell them &#8220;you&#8217;re a knight going out to fight monsters&#8221;, and they get it.  They&#8217;ll happy speak in character and try to live up to their idea of what such a character would do.  Unfortunately, most game systems are more about saying &#8220;no&#8221; than saying &#8220;yes&#8221;, so their creative spark gets damped real quick.  Rather than giving them a way to process an adventure as a game with rules, the rules actually become a barrier between their innate sense of storytelling and the adventure they&#8217;re trying to have.</p>
<p>3:  Some kids need to be given a space to act that is protected.  In other words, you need to establish a way for each kid to speak and be heard without being overwhelmed by the noisiest, pushiest members of the bunch.  Some kids need to be given &#8220;permission&#8221; to do what they want to do.  They&#8217;re looking for an adult to validate their decision so they don&#8217;t &#8220;do the wrong thing&#8221;.  An encouraging attitude that reinforces that they&#8217;re doing just fine helps them overcome the fear of looking stupid, or acting &#8220;wrongly&#8221;.  And some kids need to be pulled aside and given a stern talk about sharing, being polite, and respecting others, and they may need to have a few &#8220;time outs&#8221; issued along the way to reinforce that those words will be enforced.</p>
<p>4:  Death is a Big Scary Thing.  It&#8217;s much, much better to have characters &#8220;fall down&#8221; or &#8220;be knocked out&#8221; rather than die.  Some kids will get paralyzed and have trouble participating because they self-identify with their characters very strongly and don&#8217;t like the emotions they have when they, or their friends &#8220;die&#8221;.  Make sure they know that &#8220;running away&#8221; is sometimes the right thing to do, and don&#8217;t let the other kids make that feel like being a &#8220;coward&#8221;.  Also don&#8217;t surprise them with catastrophe.  A failed save out of the blue that results in Bad Things is really jarring.  It&#8217;s much better to give them a framing statement like &#8220;that door looks mighty dangerous, it might be trapped&#8221;, so that they&#8217;re prepared for the potential that something could happen that will hurt their characters.  If you don&#8217;t do this, some kids will react by treating everything in the virtual environment like a bomb with a hair trigger.</p>
<p>So what happens when you take an experienced game designer who is:</p>
<p>A:  Used to asking players to integrate material from a matrix of sources<br />
B:  Paid to create mechanics that manipulate the virtual world<br />
C:  Expecting that each player will assert themselves when they want to act<br />
D:  Using shock tactics, random violence, and surprise against the players</p>
<p>You get a designer making a game that isn&#8217;t going to work as an introduction to the hobby.  Why would we expect anything else; all the other products they&#8217;re paid to work on and passionate about do A-D.  What you need is a designer (ideally a design team) willing to approach the task with a very open mind, to be humble about watching kids test their work, learn from what they see and hear, and incorporate that into iterations of the design which are then tested again, and so on.  They need to learn about developmental psychology and how different ages understand and process different things.  And they need to see that the success of their work can&#8217;t be judged by what random internet reviewer says on <a href="http://rpg.net/" target="_blank">RPG.NET</a>or ENWorld, but instead on the basis of how effective the product is at taking a kid who doesn&#8217;t know how to play a TRPG and converting that kid into one who does, and who seeks out additional TRPG gameplay experiences.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>* (0:44) It feels good to be back, though Chris is sorry for calling Chad names.</p>
<p>* (3:25) A big thanks to Wizards of the Coast columnist, Tracy Hurley, for mentioning us in an <a href="http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4news/20120120">article on Gamer Resolutions</a>!</p>
<p>* (4:56) At <a href="http://www.fearthecon.com">Fear the Con V</a>, Chris Ings will be running <a href="http://www.conplanner.com/ActivityView.aspx?c=71&amp;a=590">a Bloodname tournament</a> for the surname, Badass.</p>
<p>* (8:22) Announcing the contestants for the Power 16 III!  Voting will start in a few weeks.</p>
<p>* (14:05) Introducing an online game the hosts will be playing using Pathfinder rules and the Forgotten Realms setting.  We&#8217;ll be using this to help us understand each other&#8217;s game styles and (more importantly) try to apply our own ideas to build and maintain a game.  Whether this succeeds or fails, we hope it will serve as a great object lesson.</p>
<p>* (18:26) To start things off, Johann asks some questions about the intended level curve of the game, which leads Dan to ask why that&#8217;s important to his character.</p>
<p>* (34:28) Bringing together the cultures of different gaming groups and merging them into a new, mutually enjoyable culture.</p>
<p>* (37:10) An invitation to the audience to not only observe but also participate in our little experiment.</p>
<p>* (38:46) Lacking the time to develop our next topic, we spin down the episode.  However, we kept recording, so Chad&#8217;s question gets a thorough exploration in the episode coming next week!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>* (0:12) Johann is an audio freak of nature.</p>
<p>* (1:17) Introducing our new game, <em>Naughty or Nice to Chris</em>.  We setup the background topic, explain the rules, and have an tangent on &#8220;sentient&#8221; versus &#8220;sapient&#8221;.</p>
<p>* (7:42) Chris restarts the episode.  I&#8217;m not sure why, but he&#8217;s in control.</p>
<p>* (9:12) We discuss player contribution to the game.  To what extent should players be allowed to add things to the game &#8212; even if they seem out of place &#8212; for the sake of their own enjoyment?  We start by jumping back to the contributions that break immersion for each of us.  The show goes completely off the ranch from there, and I don&#8217;t think we ever answered the original question.</p>
<p>Hosts: Chad, Chris, Dan, Johann, Pat, Wayne</p>

		<itunes:summary>* (0:12) Johann is an audio freak of nature.

* (1:17) Introducing our new game, Naughty or Nice to Chris.  We setup the background topic, explain the rules, and have an tangent on &quot;sentient&quot; versus &quot;sapient&quot;.

* (7:42) Chris restarts the episode.  I&#039;m not sure why, but he&#039;s in control.

* (9:12) We discuss player contribution to the game.  To what extent should players be allowed to add things to the game -- even if they seem out of place -- for the sake of their own enjoyment?  We start by jumping back to the contributions that break immersion for each of us.  The show goes completely off the ranch from there, and I don&#039;t think we ever answered the original question.

<p>* (0:30) Welcoming Adam from <a href="http://kickedinthedicebags.libsyn.com/">Kicked in the Dicebags</a>.</p>
<p>* (1:40) The March of Dimes charity auction &#8212; with prizes sponsored by <a href="http://www.gnomestew.com/">Gnome Stew</a> &#8212; is still in progress.  Be sure to <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=200660282647">get in your bids</a>!</p>
<p>* (2:03) Show transcripts are still being made for our episodes.  Links will be given a few days after each episode releases.</p>
<p>* (2:21) The site for Fear the Con 5 is live!  <a href="http://www.conplanner.com/fearthecon5">Get signed up and join us in St. Louis in May of 2012</a>!</p>
<p>* (5:28) Custom fangs have become too cheap for Wayne&#8217;s taste.</p>
<p>* (7:09) The loss of a dropship in our Battletech game serves as the catalyst for a discussion on defeat in a roleplaying game.  We talk about its capacity for adding drama, realism, and emotion to the game, while conversely being able to discourage or drain the players.</p>
<p>* (20:00) Wayne commenting on <a href="http://www.feartheboot.com/ftb/wp-content/uploads/resources/209_WhatsReallyGoingOn.pdf">some old gaming notes</a> leads into Dan describing the collection of documents he typically uses when running a game.  With our usual disclaimer for potentially offensive content, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTwtAJt1JAs">here is a link</a> to the pimp&#8217;s prayer.</p>
<p>* (26:20) Getting a brand new player up to speed on the hobby of roleplaying, their first setting, and a system &#8212; without overwhelming them in the process.</p>
<p>* (52:16) The video game giveaway will be ending on October 23rd with the winners drawn on October 24th, so this is your last chance <a href="http://feartheboot.com/giveaway.aspx">to get entered</a>.</p>
<p>Hosts: Adam, Chad, Dan, John, Pat, Wayne</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been rolling around in my head for a while that falls between editorial and advice.  Over the past year, I&#8217;ve seen the popularization of a variety of crowd funding websites.  For anyone not familiar with the phrase, &#8220;crowd funding&#8221; means asking individual supporters to pledge money toward your project.  For example, John recently set out to create the Pathfinder compatible product, <a href="http://www.bloodmoongoblins.com">Bloodmoon Goblins</a>.  However, he lacked the funds to pay for its art, layout, and printing, so he went to our fans asking for financial support.  Enough people wanted to see it completed &#8212; and said as much with their donations &#8212; that he got the necessary cash to make the project happen.</p>
<p>The most popular sites for crowd funding are <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> and <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com">IndieGoGo</a>, though I&#8217;ve been told there are many others.  Depending on the site, a project may need to reach its entire funding before anyone gets charged, or conversely, be allowed to cash out shy of the goal.  Typically, rewards are offered to thank people that donate at varying amounts.  For example, you might get to contribute to the setting, receive an autographed copy, or even get a personal visit from the producer.</p>
<p>Let me start by saying I think this is a wonderful thing.  Podcasting allowed us to get out content that no radio station would have ever picked up.  And in the same way, crowd funding allows people to get the cash they need in the absence of a major financial backer.  Fans can suddenly open their wallets and enable the things they want to see, often through an aggregation of very modest donations from many people.  Publishers get a chance to see their ideas come to fruition and, by observing donations, get an early sense of how the product might do in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;m seeing several problems start to emerge.</p>
<p>First and most importantly, I fear that too many people are picking up on this.  The first Kickstarter project I remember seeing was Mikey Mason&#8217;s <a href="http://mikeymason.bandcamp.com/album/impotent-nerd-rage">Impotent Nerd Rage</a>.  Since then, I&#8217;ve seen many, many more.  The bulk of them are great ideas, and I have nothing but the utmost support for the people doing them.  But with an ever-increasing number of people kicking these projects off, how long before funding fatigue starts to set in and Kickstarter projects become background noise no different than the billboards along a highway?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to find truly academic numbers on this sort of thing, but most estimates I&#8217;ve found say that only between 30% and 40% of crowd funded projects reach their goal.  And of those that fail, apparently a significant percentage don&#8217;t even raise a single dollar.  In an economy of finite currency, contributing cash is a lot harder than clicking &#8220;Like&#8221; on Facebook.</p>
<p>Second, I think many fundraisers outpace themselves.  When John first brought up using Kickstarter for Bloodmoon, we sat down and thought pretty hard about the goal.  How much will this project cost?  Where can we trim the budget?  Sure, we have an established fan base of a reasonable size, but how much money are we actually likely to get?</p>
<p>I think the situation is even worse for people that have a great idea but no public presence.  Outside of family and friends, projects end up with no contributors and fall embarrassingly short of the goal.  If the site requires full funding, that means you don&#8217;t see a single dime.  If the site allows partial funding, you&#8217;re left trying to explain what you&#8217;ll do with the money in your pocket that&#8217;s less than you need to meet your original promises.</p>
<p>With the dreary part out of the way, I want to offer some advice.  I&#8217;m sure it will be neither perfect nor exhaustive, but at least it&#8217;s better than stating the problem and walking away.</p>
<ol>
<li>People are giving you their money, and they want to know how it will be used.  Talk openly about what you&#8217;ll be producing, what features your product will have, and generally how donations will be spent.</li>
<li>Set a budget.  Research what it will cost to take your idea from inception to publication.  Ask people in the industry to look over your flowchart to see if you&#8217;ve missed an expense.</li>
<li>Review your budget and decide if it&#8217;s a realistic goal.  Sure, your friends love your homebrew game, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the public will front $20,000 for you to make it.  Ask yourself honestly how much you can raise with the people you have access to.  If this is your first time out, maybe it&#8217;s better to try for a few hundred bucks, build a following from that project, and get more ambitious later.</li>
<li>Be prepared to find some wiggle room in that budget!  How can you get the amount down to something you&#8217;re likely to raise?  Maybe it&#8217;s time to consider a little less art or purely electronic publication.  The specifics are for you to decide, but make the financial and product goals align.</li>
<li>Before selling the product, you have to be able to sell the idea of <em>funding</em> the product.  How are you going to find people that are interested in the idea and likely to support you with a contribution?  And once you&#8217;ve got their attention, what sort of text or video message will you use to get them to commit?</li>
<li>If your project falls under its funding goal, have a plan already in place for the amount you raised.  I don&#8217;t recommend announcing that plan early (why give the impression you don&#8217;t believe in your project?) but know what you&#8217;ll say if you fall short.  Those people want something for their money, so maybe you can put together a less ambitious version of the original idea or maybe you&#8217;ll let contributors vote on a charity it goes to.</li>
<li>Be equally ready for the reverse situation.  If you happen to go over your goal, what are you going to do with the extra money?  Make the intended product better?  Put it toward another project?  Donate it?</li>
</ol>
<div>I want to stress that crowd funding is a wonderful idea and likely to be around for a while.  But if you really want to see your idea make it, know how to set yourself up for success that&#8217;s genuinely within your reach, particularly when the field is getting more crowded by the day.</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to give you guys an update on the current hosting situation on Fear the Boot.  Let me start by saying that no one is leaving the show, nor is anyone new joining.  However, if you take the six regular hosts (Chad, Chris, Dan, John, Pat, and Wayne) along with our alternates (Johann and Karla), that&#8217;s obviously eight total people.  Putting that many people on a single episode would be impractical to record and a nightmare to listen to.</p>
<p>The way we&#8217;re going to address this is by returning Fear the Boot to the description it&#8217;s carried in the RSS feed since Episode 1.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fear the Boot is an irreverent, round table discussion of tabletop role playing games. In this weekly show we debate game-related issues, offer advice for improving your game, and poke fun at the hobby. Our cast changes a little from show to show, but we always assemble a group of dynamic individuals with divergent views, guaranteeing you will hear several perspectives on everything we discuss.</p></blockquote>
<p>For each show, we will have 3 &#8211; 5 hosts present, drawn from the list given above.  That flexibility accomplishes two things.  First, we can make sure we&#8217;ve tapped the hosts with the most interest or expertise on a given subject.  Second, it allows the remaining hosts to take some weeks off to spend with family or pursue other projects, such as Fear the Con, <a href="http://www.skiesofglass.com">Skies of Glass</a>, <a href="http://www.epochofrysos.com">Epoch of Rysos</a>, and <a href="http://www.bloodmoongoblins.com">Bloodmoon Goblins</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect this change to have any significant impact on the show.  All of the hosts will still be appearing on the show and active on the forums.  However, I wanted to explain in advance why the staffing will shift in seemingly random fashion from week to week.</p>

<p>* (3:42) We kick off the interview by asking Ken about his rather unusual education and how it affects his work in the game industry.</p>
<p>* (6:51) Ken gives us his observations on the state of RPGs.  He also answers some questions about the rise of story-driven games.</p>
<p>* (15:19) A question about how Ken got started in GURPS leads to a discussion of professionalism (or more accurately, the lack thereof) in the RPG industry.</p>
<p>* (23:05) Ken begins settling long-running FtB marital disputes.  Chris kicks this one off with the GM screen, and then Dan asks about social mechanics.  Fortunately, Chris gives this some genuine purpose by questioning whether the way a person runs games affects how they write them.</p>
<p>* (30:54) Dan asks Ken for some tips on running horror games.</p>
<p>* (41:43) Following the suggestion of Ryan Dancey, we begin The Ken Hite Three Word Game!</p>
<p>* (48:49) Ken&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Hite">past, current, and upcoming work</a>, including <a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/?p=1081">Night&#8217;s Black Agents</a> and Star Trek.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First and foremost, I want to give many thanks to all of the Fear the Boot listeners that attended the convention and joined us for a dinner, game, or even just a quick handshake.  You&#8217;re what make this podcast worth doing.  And I want to give an even bigger &#8220;THANK YOU!&#8221; to the TOFTBCH network &#8212; headed up by Christian &#8212; who did the hard work of getting us reservations and keeping everyone in-the-know on our social events.  The lasting memories I have from this con wouldn&#8217;t have been possible without you.</p>
<p>If you were at Gen Con, you obviously know what the convention has to offer and have likely made up your mind about going back in the future.  However, if you&#8217;ve never been, I really can&#8217;t recommend the event strongly enough.  It&#8217;s one heck of a spectacle, and it&#8217;s also nice to have one weekend in the year where geeks take over a town, letting you know loud and clear that you&#8217;re not the only one that&#8217;s into the things you love.  I hope more of the hosts are in attendance next year, so we can provide coverage of the extraordinarily diverse events the con has to offer.</p>
<p>Last of all, to make up for our inability to cover all of the bases with half of the crew, we partnered with <em>This Just In&#8230;From Gen Con!</em>, helping finance their coverage of the con.  If you want some great interviews in podcast form, <a href="http://thisjustinfromgencon.com/">be sure to check their site</a>!</p>
