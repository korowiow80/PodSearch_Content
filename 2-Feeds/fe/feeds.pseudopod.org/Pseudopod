<p><strong>A MOTHER OF MONSTERS by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_de_Maupassant">Guy De Maupassant</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Henri René Albert Guy de Maupassant (1850 – 1893) was a popular 19th-century French writer, considered one of the fathers of the modern short story and one of the form&#8217;s finest exponents.  He delighted in clever plotting, and taking his cue from Balzac, he wrote comfortably in both the high-Realist and fantastic modes; many of his short stories (notably &#8220;Le Horla&#8221;) describe apparently supernatural phenomena.   However, the supernatural in Maupassant is often implicitly a symptom of the protagonists&#8217; troubled minds, as Maupassant was fascinated by the burgeoning discipline of psychiatry.  In his later years he developed a constant desire for solitude, an obsession for self-preservation, and a fear of death and crazed paranoia of persecution, that came from the syphilis he had contracted in his early days. On January 2, in 1892, Maupassant tried to commit suicide by cutting his throat and was committed to a celebrated private asylum at Passy, in Paris, where he died on July 6, 1893.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>by <a href="http://smallbeerpress.com/not-a-journal/2011/01/20/100-years-of-unease/">Thomas Owen</a></strong>
<br /></br>
<strong>Translated by <a href="http://www.edwardgauvin.com/blog/">Edward Gauvin</a></strong></p>

<p>This story first appeared in the 1972 collection <strong>LA TRUIE</strong> (<strong>THE SOW</strong>). This translation appeared in late February in the first issue of <strong>The Dr. T.J. Eckleburg Review</strong> (formerly <strong>The Moon Milk Review</strong>).  It can be read <a href="http://thedoctortjeckleburgreview.com/2012/02/25/the-women-who-watch-by-edward-gauvin/">here</a></p>

<p><strong>Thomas Owen</strong> (real name <strong>Gérald Bertot</strong>) (1910-2002) worked all his life in the management of the same flour-milling factory. He held a doctorate in criminology, and a side career in art criticism under the pseudonym <strong>Stéphane Rey</strong>. Spared service in World War II, he turned to writing mysteries for money, with the encouragement of <strong>Stanislas-André Steeman</strong>, a celebrated craftsman of Belgian noir. In <strong>TONIGHT AT EIGHT</strong> (from 1941), he introduced the police commissioner Thomas Owen—a character whose name he liked so much he later took it as his own when he embarked on what he has called his true calling, his career as a fantasist.  An existential dread, one that <strong>Thomas Ligotti</strong> correctly identified (in a blurb where he name-checked Owen) as “the nightmare of being alive”, emanates from Owen’s oeuvre of several hundred stories - the best word for Owen’s fiction is unsettling.  The 1984 volume <strong>THE DESOLATE PRESENCE</strong> draws from six of Owen’s seven major collections for its 22 tales, and was the only current English translation of Owen&#8217;s work available, and is currently out of print.  Both of those details may soon change.</p>

<p>Edward Gauvin is the winner of the <strong>John Dryden Translation prize</strong>, a Clarion graduate, he has received fellowships from the NEA, the Fulbright Program, and the American Literary Translators&#8217; Association. His volume of Georges-Olivier Châteaureynaud’s selected stories, <strong>A Life on Paper</strong> (Small Beer, 2010) won the <strong>Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Translation Award</strong>. Other publications have appeared in <strong>F&amp;SF</strong>, <strong>Podcastle</strong>, <strong>Postscripts</strong>, <strong>Conjunctions</strong>, <strong>Subtropics</strong>, and <strong>Tin House</strong>. He translates comics for <strong>Top Shelf</strong>, <strong>Self-Made Hero</strong>, <strong>Archaia</strong>, and <strong>Lerner</strong>. He also writes a monthly column on “the Weird in translation” for the <a href="http://weirdfictionreview.com/by/edward-gauvin/"><strong>VanderMeers’ Weird Fiction Review</strong></a>. He would also like to mention this graphic novel, <a href="http://www.archaia.com/archaia-titles/billy-fog/"><strong>Billy Fog and the Gift of Trouble Sight</strong></a> for lovers of the macabre “I think of it as Edward Gorey meets Calvin and Hobbes. If you like it, sequels are forthcoming!”.</p>

<p><br /></br>
<em>&#8220;&#8216;Do you know that woman?&#8217; he asked the waiter.</p>

<p>&#8216;What woman?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The one in the corner just now.&#8217;</p>

<p>The waiter gave the man a look as if he were joking, and assured him no one had been sitting there. He seemed sincere, and gave no reason to believe he’d been in cahoots with the woman.</p>

<p>Of course something had to burst his bubble. At the foot of the abandoned chair, he spotted the forgotten shopping bag. Out peered the green of leeks, wrapped in newspaper.</p>

<p>The man didn’t insist. He was too happy to have escaped the evil spell.&#8221;</em></p>

Translated by Edward Gauvin

This story first appeared in the 1972 collection LA TRUIE (THE SOW). This translation appeared in late February in the first issue of The Dr. T.J. Eckleburg Review (formerly The Moon Milk Review).  It can be read here

Thomas Owen (real name Geacute;rald Bertot) (1910-2002) worked all his life in the management of the same flour-milling factory. He held a doctorate in criminology, and a side career in art criticism under the pseudonym Steacute;phane Rey. Spared service in World War II, he turned to writing mysteries for money, with the encouragement of Stanislas-Andreacute; Steeman, a celebrated craftsman of Belgian noir. In TONIGHT AT EIGHT (from 1941), he introduced the police commissioner Thomas Owenmdash;a character whose name he liked so much he later took it as his own when he embarked on what he has called his true calling, his career as a fantasist.  An existential dread, one that Thomas Ligotti correctly identified (in a blurb where he name-checked Owen) as ldquo;the nightmare of being aliverdquo;, emanates from Owenrsquo;s oeuvre of several hundred stories - the best word for Owenrsquo;s fiction is unsettling.  The 1984 volume THE DESOLATE PRESENCE draws from six of Owenrsquo;s seven major collections for its 22 tales, and was the only current English translation of Owen's work available, and is currently out of print.  Both of those details may soon change.

Edward Gauvin is the winner of the John Dryden Translation prize, a Clarion graduate, he has received fellowships from the NEA, the Fulbright Program, and the American Literary Translators' Association. His volume of Georges-Olivier Chacirc;teaureynaudrsquo;s selected stories, A Life on Paper (Small Beer, 2010) won the Science Fiction #38; Fantasy Translation Award. Other publications have appeared in F#38;SF, Podcastle, Postscripts, Conjunctions, Subtropics, and Tin House. He translates comics for Top Shelf, Self-Made Hero, Archaia, and Lerner. He also writes a monthly column on ldquo;the Weird in translationrdquo; for the VanderMeersrsquo; Weird Fiction Review. He would also like to mention this graphic novel, Billy Fog and the Gift of Trouble Sight for lovers of the macabre ldquo;I think of it as Edward Gorey meets Calvin and Hobbes. If you like it, sequels are forthcoming!rdquo;.


Your reader this week is Pete Milan who does a lot of voice work with Pendant Audio, on their fan shows (we do a series of DC Comics-based audio dramas) and originals (I'm a writer and performer on their sci-fi serial, The Kingery, among others)...


"'Do you know that woman?' he asked the waiter.

'What woman?'

'The one in the corner just now.'

The waiter gave the man a look as if he were joking, and assured him no one had been sitting there. He seemed sincere, and gave no reason to believe hersquo;d been in cahoots with the woman.

Of course something had to burst his bubble. At the foot of the abandoned chair, he spotted the forgotten shopping bag. Out peered the green of leeks, wrapped in newspaper.

The man didnrsquo;t insist. He was too happy to have escaped the evil spell."

<em>&#8220;Dmitri laughed in my face. &#8216;Who is going to stop me? I do what I want.&#8217; He looked out into the drizzly evening. &#8216;I can get you out of here. Do you want to go?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What? Out of the camp? How?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How do you think?&#8217; He nodded toward the gray forest that crowded the perimeter, where the electrodes got too weak to keep it out. &#8216;Through that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Through the forest? I thought it was impossible.&#8217;</p>

<p>Dmitri tilted his head up. Beneath his jaw were tattoos of two men’s heads, done with red and black ink. Their faces were contorted in an expression of horror; their eyes closed. He pointed to them. &#8216;Do you know what they mean?&#8217; he asked. I shook my head. &#8216;I’ve gotten through it twice. The only man in New Russia. I’ll take you.&#8217; He paused, looking me up and down. &#8216;It’s probably a lost cause. I don’t think you’ll make it. But if you’re interested, come to my hut tonight.&#8217;</p>

<p>I looked back out at the forest. It wavered in and out of focus in the rain, gray and silent. When I turned back around, Dmitri was already gone.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>This story was first published in <strong>Arcane</strong> Magazine (later renamed <strong>Arcane Sampler)</strong> in March of 2011.  Jaelithe Ingold is a dark fantasy writer living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  She used to prepare fossils for display at the Carnegie Museum and is now a retail manager.  Her work has appeared in <strong>Shock Totem</strong>, <strong>Abyss &amp; Apex</strong> and <strong>Dark Recesses</strong>.</p>

<em>&#8220;The roof of the gingerbread house has long been gone, and green mold covers the sides like a copper patina, but the air surrounding it is still sweet. Sugar gone bad with the passage of time and the death of its caretaker.</p>

<p>Last week, Gretel vanished from our home. She’s been lured away, I think, by something bad, for this is the only reason she would willingly leave me.</p>

<p>Has she come here lately? That’s the question at the forefront of my mind. We don’t talk about it, but I know she’s been here before. Many times since the witch’s death. And I haven’t always been able to resist either. The sweet rot of the place both rumbles and turns my stomach, yet still it calls to me.</p>

<p>We haven’t been children for a very long time, but if I remember hard enough, the sensation remains. The taste still melts on my tongue.&#8221;</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- guidelines start --><strong>Pseudopod </strong> is always looking for quality fiction to feed our listeners. If you&#8217;re a writer with a short horror story that you&#8217;d like to hear narrated by one of our talented performers, we&#8217;d like to see it. Probably.</p>

<h3>What We Want</h3>

<p><strong>Pseudopod</strong> is a genre magazine in audio form.  We&#8217;re looking for <a href="http://www.horror.org/horror-is.htm">horror</a>:  dark, weird fiction. We run the spectrum from grim realism or crime drama, to magic-realism, to blatantly supernatural dark fantasy. We publish highly literary stories reminiscent of Poe or Lovecraft as well as vulgar shock-value pulp fiction. We don&#8217;t split hairs about genre definitions, and we do not observe any taboos about what kind of content can appear in our stories.  Originality demands that you&#8217;re better off avoiding vampires, zombies, and other recognizable horror tropes unless you have put a very unique spin on them.  What matters most is that the stories are dark and compelling.</p>

<p>Since we&#8217;re an audio magazine, our audience can&#8217;t skim past the boring parts, so stories with beautiful language at the expense of plot don&#8217;t translate well. We&#8217;re looking for fiction with strong pacing, well-defined characters, engaging dialogue, and clear action. It can be beautiful too, if you&#8217;ve got all those other bases covered.</p>

<p>Dark humor is just fine, and we run it on occasion; but we are more interested in tragedy than comedy, and comedy is better received the more sick and morbid it is.  Above all, we want stories that make us think, that stick with us, that make us catch ourselves checking the locks a second time before bed.</p>

<p><a href="http://pseudopod.org/guidelines/tips-for-writers/">More tips here.</a></p>

<p>Holiday-themed stories (regardless of which holiday) are ideally submitted 4-5 months prior to the holiday in question.  The same guideline applies if you have a book coming out soon and want to publish a short story with us to coincide with its release, and we&#8217;re always happy to delay publishing if the resulting timing is better for author promotion.  (Although for a sure bet, you can always just grease our palms with a sponsorship two months beforehand &#8212; contact amanda@escapeartists.net.)</p>

<h3>Length</h3>

<p>We&#8217;re primarily interested in two lengths of fiction, which we&#8217;ve somewhat arbitrarily dubbed &#8220;short fiction&#8221; and &#8220;flash fiction&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Short Fiction:</strong> This is the heart of our weekly podcast.  We want short stories <u>between about 2,000 and 6,000 words</u>; we are quite hesitant to produce stories any longer than that, so anything longer than that will not be considered at all.  (You are almost certainly better off cutting it down to 6,000 or less, even if it has been published previously at a greater length.  The longer a story is, the more brilliant it needs to be to sustain audience interest in audio, and Pseudopod stories in particular tend to be no longer than 5,000 words as a rule.)  We currently pay <strong>$100</strong> for short fiction at this length.</p>

<p><strong>Flash Fiction:</strong> We sometimes podcast short five-to-ten minute &#8220;bonus&#8221; pieces between our weekly main episodes. For this we&#8217;re looking at fiction <u>under 1,500 words</u>, with a sweet spot between 500 and 1000 words. Yes, that&#8217;s really really short. That&#8217;s the point. Our flash pieces are frequently quirkier and more experimental than our weekly features. We pay <strong>$20</strong> for flash fiction.</p>

<p>If you have a story between 1,500 and 2,000 words, we&#8217;ll make a judgment call, based on whether we think the story would work better as a featured story or a bonus.  But most of the time we&#8217;ll buy it as flash fiction.</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Reprints&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>We do not discriminate between previously published and unpublished works. We’re an audio market, and we buy nonexclusive rights, so it doesn’t hurt us if a story has previously appeared in another market. In fact, we encourage new authors to send their work to other markets first, and then send it to us for audio rights after the story has appeared. You’re welcome to give us first dibs on anything you like, but consider: if your story’s good enough for us to buy it, it’s probably good enough to sell to another market first. Why not try that, and get two audiences and two checks?</p>

<p>If the text of the work is currently available online for free, that&#8217;s great!  Let us know in your cover letter so we can link to it in the web post if we publish your story.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple and Simultaneous Submissions</strong></p>

<p>We do <b>not</b> accept multiple submissions. Please, one story at a time! Unless you&#8217;re specifically told otherwise, this is the rule at every fiction market.</p>

<p>We do consider simultaneous submissions (a story sent to us as well as one or more other markets at the same time), but we appreciate being advised that the story is under consideration elsewhere. In the event it is accepted by us as well as the other market(s), you&#8217;ll just need to let the editor know in response to your acceptance letter what other market(s) are slated to publish it and when.  That gives us the chance to mention the fact in the intro to the story.  We will also try to delay publication so as not to &#8220;scoop&#8221; the other market(s) before the publication date over there, but it will be up to you to communicate with the other market(s) to find out whether they insist on this or not.  Unless you tell us so, we will consider delaying publication to be optional on our part.  (In our experience, since we use audio format most other markets don&#8217;t seem to care one way or the other, and even appreciate it if we go live with it around the same time or sooner because it acts as publicity for them.  But you never know, and should always check.  For our part, though, we have no strong preference either way.)</p>

<p>The only exception to this is simultaneous submission of a single story to multiple Escape Artists podcasts (<a href="http://escapepod.org">Escape Pod</a>, <a href="http://podcastle.org">PodCastle</a>, and <a href="http://pseudopod.org">Pseudopod</a>), which we ask that you avoid.  When submitting to one Escape Artists podcast, please wait to hear back about it before submitting the same story to another.</p>

<h3>How We Want It</h3>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<hr/>

<pre>From: Edgar Allen Poe
Date: Dec 13, 1889
Subject: Submission: The Pit and the Pendulum
To: submit@pseudopod.org

Dear Pseudopod:

I would like to submit my horror story "The Pit and the Pendulum" for
your podcast.  My work has appeared in numerous online and print venues
including _The Norton Anthology of Literature_, the Project Gutenberg
Web site (http://www.gutenberg.org), and _The Simpsons Halloween
Special_.   This particular work is in the public domain since it was first
published over a century ago, and all rights are available.  It has 
previously been adapted into a shockingly strange movie by Roger 
Corman.  Thank you for your time and consideration.


Edgar Poe

The Pit and the Pendulum
By Edgar Allen Poe

I was sick -- sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at
length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses
were leaving me. The sentence -- the dread sentence of death -- was the
last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the
sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy
indeterminate hum.  It conveyed to my soul the idea of _revolution_ --
perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a mill-wheel.
This only for a brief period; for presently I heard no more.  [. . .]
</pre>

<hr/>

<p>We accept stories in plain text pasted into the body of an email, sent to the address <a href="mailto:submit@pseudopod.org">submit@pseudopod.org</a>. We don&#8217;t want Word files, PDF files, scanned images of a book, or sound files of you reading the story. Messages with any such attachments will probably get bounced. We will accept messages that are HTML formatted, but if you know how to turn it off, we greatly prefer plain text. Send it from the email address to which you want us to send correspondence to you!</p>

<p>Please be sure to include the word &#8220;submission&#8221; AND the title of the story in the Subject: line of the message. Most of our workflow involves bouncing your email message from one folder to another, and we use the email subject to identify the story. A subject like &#8220;story submission&#8221; doesn&#8217;t tell us anything we don&#8217;t already know.</p>

<p>In the body of the message, we want:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Your name. (Your real name. The story can have a different byline, and we&#8217;ll credit that byline in public, but we need to know who&#8217;s legally offering us this story and to whom the check should be written.)</li>
    <li>A cover statement briefly giving us your publication credits (your top five or six publications at most), and in particular telling us whether this story has been published before or adapted into audio. If there&#8217;s anything we need to know about available rights, tell us that too.  If the full text of the story is available online, that&#8217;s great &#8212; let us know what the URL is so we can link to it.</li>
    <li>The word count of the story, rounded to the nearest hundred words. Don&#8217;t go nuts over which word count method to use, or whether to round up or down. We pay flat rate; we really don&#8217;t care. We just want a ballpark.</li>
    <li>The title of the story.</li>
    <li>The story&#8217;s byline.</li>
    <li>The text of the story. Use single spacing, with blank lines between paragraphs and _underscores_  or *asterisks* (or whatever) for emphasis.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once again, that address is <a href="mailto:submit@pseudopod.org">submit@pseudopod.org</a>. Any stories sent to any other address will be trashed, most likely without a response.</p>

<hr />

<h3><i>(The rest of these guidelines are basically just legalese.)</i></h3>

<p>By sending us your story you understand and agree that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You are the original creator of the work submitted to us;</li>
    <li>You are the copyright holder of the work;</li>
    <li>You are not prohibited by any prior agreement from the transfer of non-exclusive electronic and audio rights to the work;</li>
    <li>All information in the contact and cover sections of your email is accurate and truthful;</li>
    <li>You accept sole responsibility for any false statements or encumbrances upon rights not disclosed to us.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we buy your story we&#8217;ll send you a contract, and you&#8217;ll be bound to all of the above.</p>

<p>Oh, and in case you&#8217;re wondering whether you have audio rights to your stories: unless you&#8217;re doing work-for-hire for a game company, all reputable speculative fiction magazines of which we&#8217;re aware acquire serial print rights, often with non-exclusive electronic or anthology options. Some online markets may insist on electronic exclusivity for a certain period of time, and if so, you can&#8217;t publish it with us until after that period ends.  However, we know of no regular short fiction market that contracts for exclusive audio rights. That doesn&#8217;t mean it can&#8217;t happen; always check your contracts.</p>

<h3>What We Do With It</h3>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve sent us your story, we will review it and respond to you via email in about two months. If it takes longer than that, please query.</p>

<p>If we decide we&#8217;d like it for our podcast, we&#8217;ll send you a contract as a PDF file in email. You will sign it and send it back to us either via email (after scanning it), fax, or postal mail. Then we&#8217;ll pay you via check or PayPal, whichever you indicated on the last page of the contract, and we&#8217;ll start producing.</p>

<p>During the production process we may contact you with questions about the story, its background, or pronunciations. We hope and expect that you&#8217;ll be available to help us, as a good performance makes all of us look good. Unfortunately, as everything we do is on a somewhat fluid schedule, we usually can&#8217;t give you an accurate timetable of when your story will appear in the podcast.</p>

<h3>What the World Does With It</h3>

<p>The audio files Pseudopod produces are released under a Creative Commons license. Specifically, we use the <a target="_blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 3.0</a> license. Briefly, this means that the entire world has permission to distribute the podcast for free, provided they give credit for it, don&#8217;t try to make money off of it, and don&#8217;t change it in any way. Transcribing it, extracting portions from it beyond fair use, and mashing it up are all prohibited. This license applies only to our audio performance of your work, for which we&#8217;ve contracted and paid you. It does not apply to your story itself; you retain your copyright and all rights to any other use of the story.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve had some questions about this from the writing community, so we&#8217;d like to make our reasoning clear. We know that Creative Commons licensing is scary to many writers, and it&#8217;s certainly a radical break from traditional rights that expire after a period of time. Our take is this: when we create a podcast, we are putting an MP3 file on the Web. That MP3 file is going to get downloaded and copied onto thousands of hard drives, CDs, iPods, and other portable devices across the world. That&#8217;s the point. We want people to listen to it. But once you&#8217;ve done that, you can&#8217;t take that file back. There is no way to delete the file everywhere it exists. There are some highly fallible ways to lock things down, but DRM sucks, and even if we believed in it it&#8217;s too complicated for us to implement.</p>

<p>So from a purely practical perspective, we can&#8217;t make our content expire. And we can&#8217;t stop people from copying our files, nor should we. Given that reality, why not give our listeners the full legal right to do what&#8217;s totally natural for an audio file (copy it, share it with people, and listen to it whenever they want), but make equally clear to them what they can&#8217;t do (share the story outside the podcast, or alter it in any way at all)? That&#8217;s our reason for the Creative Commons license. We&#8217;re not trying to plant a philosophical flag in the ground here; we&#8217;re just trying to reflect reality.</p>

<p>We hope you&#8217;ll agree with our reasons and choose to share your story with us. If you don&#8217;t, then we&#8217;re deeply sorry, but we feel it&#8217;s better that you know this now, before you make the decision to submit.</p>

<h3>Any questions?</h3>

<p>If you have questions, comments, suggestions, or criticism (but not stories) send them to our staff at <a href="mailto:editor@pseudopod.org">editor@pseudopod.org</a>. We&#8217;ll do our best to get back to you within a few days.</p>

<p>Thanks very much for your time, and we look forward to reading &#8212; and hopefully speaking &#8212; what you&#8217;ve got! <!-- guidelines end --></p>

<p>This story originally appeared, simultaneously in French and English, at <a href=http://onirismes.com/issues/001/prophet.php>Onirismes.com</a> in Spring 2011 (still available at the link). Sybaris was a real city, a wealthy Greek colony founded in Italy in the 8th century BC, destroyed by flood in the sixth century when its enemies diverted a river through the city&#8217;s streets in retribution for its citizens&#8217; greed. From whence the word &#8220;sybaritic&#8221;, a very fine synonym for &#8220;self-indulgent&#8221;, has descended into modern English.</p>

<p>Michael J. DeLuca attended the <strong>Odyssey Writing Workshop</strong> in 2005, helps run the indie ebook site <a href="http://weightlessbooks.com/">Weightless Books</a>, has volunteered at <a href="http://smallbeerpress.com/">Small Beer Press</a> for longer than he cares to admit, and is a member of the <a href="http://homelessmoon.com/">Homeless Moon</a> writers&#8217; cabal. His short stories have appeared in <strong>Interfictions</strong>, <strong>Apex</strong>, <strong>Clockwork Phoenix</strong> and <strong>The Future Fire</strong>. If you like this story, you might try his series of centaur westerns, which are similarly Classics-infused and brutal, and can be found in the archives (some in audio form) at <a href="http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/author.php?a=22">Beneath Ceaseless Skies</a>.

<em>&#8220;&#8221;Do you wonder, my brothers in service of death, what powers the prophet takes with her on her voyage down the Acheron? We all do, I suspect: all of us from Sybaris who felt the lash of her tongue. She told many bleak fates.

<p><em>But less than a year later, when Lord Galen returned home from a hunting trip, he discovered four of his guards torn limb-from-limb, his bedroom window broken in from the outside, monstrous claw marks on the second floor balcony and, of his beloved, no trace.  Most disturbing of all was what he beheld graven into the wall above her bed: a monstrous blue sigil in the form of a six-lobed eye.  No earthly implement could have rendered the perfectly aligned delineations of that unmentionable shape; nor could any earthly ink have provided its hateful color which glimmered balefully even in total darkness.</p>

<p>Terrible was Lord Galen’s grief, but even more terrible was the thing which grew by degrees within him: his wrath.</em>

With a fine bone knife I make my incision, cutting back the sticky membrane of Our Tjeng&#8217;s hull. I slip my hand inside and carefully widen the tear until it&#8217;s big enough for me to step through. Our Tjeng has blessed Kae and me with gills to breathe within his walls.

<p>This story was originally published in 1897 in <strong>THE SECRET ROSE</strong>.  It is available to read online in a number of spots including <a href="http://www.americanliterature.com/WilliamButlerYeats/SS/TheCrucifixionOfTheOutcast.html">here</a></p>

<p><strong>Yeats</strong> (1865-1939) was winner of the <strong>Nobel Prize</strong> and Ireland&#8217;s greatest poet and dramatist. The son of a renowned Dublin artist, he was educated partly in Ireland and partly in London and during this time formed an interest in occultism. Later, drawing on his experiences with his relatives in Sligo, he began to write on folklore, the first results being published in 1893 as <strong>THE CELTIC TWILIGHT</strong>.  This title was subsequently used to label a school of writing that attempted a renaissance of ancient Irish culture. Yeats&#8217; style in prose - like in his poetry - is gloriously varied: from light, beautiful tales of unworldly fantasy to grim and horrifying parables of death and cruelty.</p>

<p><br /></br>

<em>&#8220;His eyes strayed from the Abbey tower of the White Friars and the town battlements to a row of crosses which stood out against the sky upon a hill a little to the eastward of the town, and he clenched his fist, and shook it at the crosses. He knew they were not empty, for the birds were fluttering about them; and he thought how, as like as not, just such another vagabond as himself was hanged on one of them; and he muttered: &#8216;If it were hanging or bowstringing, or stoning or beheading, it would be bad enough. But to have the birds pecking your eyes and the wolves eating your feet! I would that the red wind of the Druids had withered in his cradle the soldier of Dathi, who brought the tree of death out of barbarous lands, or that the lightning, when it smote Dathi at the foot of the mountain, had smitten him also, or that his grave had been dug by the green-haired and green-toothed merrows deep at the roots of the deep sea.&#8217;&#8221;</em></p>

<p>This story is previously unpublished. The story is also available to read online at The Repository forum of  <a href=http://www.ligotti.net/showthread.php?p=77386#post77386">Thomas Ligotti Online</a>.</p>

<p>The anthology <strong>Werewolves &amp; Shapeshifters:  Encounters With The Beast Within</strong> includes Nicole’s short fiction (alongside stories by <strong>Neil Gaiman</strong> and <strong>George R.R. Martin</strong>). Her work also appears in the <strong>Cemetery Dance</strong> Richard Laymon tribute anthology <strong>In Laymon’s Terms</strong>.</p>

<p><br /></br>
Your reader this week is Jonathan Sullivan, who regularly reads for <strong>ESCAPE POD</strong>.</p>

<p><br /></br>
<em>&#8220;It&#8217;s another cool April morning in Hell, and the hanging trees (just saplings, really) are starting to sprout fleshy, strangled buds that look like choking fetuses caught up in tiny, umbilical nooses.</p>

<p>Their embryonic faces haven&#8217;t yet developed features, but I know as the days get longer their lips will grow into a grimace; their eyes will ooze agony. I have already been warned that their first cries (when they can utter them) will be those of breathless suffering. Their first words, pleas for help. The curses will follow shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>But right now, as fetus-flowers, they only emit shrill, staccato mews. But even this meager vocalization makes me shudder. I lower my glance from the entire orchard, feeling disgust for the day ahead. I whistle a tune to distract myself from the noise of thousands of semi-sentients who exist in a state of more-or-less continuous suffocation; those to whom full-sentience will bring only misery.</p>

<p>I am not, after all, a monster – even if I am in the employ of Hell. Even if (as my fellow laborers predict) some of the fruit will grow up to call me “Demon”, this is an absurd epithet. I do not want to be in this position. But my cares, my wants, my sense of being an individual with free will – these are things of the past. Shams more easily harbored during a lifetime marinated in the sweet sauce of ignorance.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;Two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo.… Let us, then, be introduced to the actors in a placid way; let us see them going about their ordinary business, undisturbed by forebodings, pleased with their surroundings; and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head, unobtrusively at first, and then more insistently, until it holds the stage.  Another requisite, in my opinion, is that the ghost should be malevolent or odious: amiable and helpful apparitions are all very well in fairy tales or in local legends, but I have no use for them in a fictitious ghost story.&#8217;&#8221;</em></p>

<h3><strong>DOG</strong></h3>

<p><strong>By Stephen Hodgkinson</strong>.</p>

<p>Stephen lives &amp; works in Manchester, United Kingdom.  He is working on a collection of short stories that he hopes to publish by Summer 2012.</p>

<p>Read by Eve Upton, who previously starred as the mushroom in <a href="http://pseudopod.org/2011/05/27/pseudopod-231-tipplers-bane/">&#8220;Tippler&#8217;s Bane&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;The girl stared out of her bedroom window.  Her neighbour, the little boy was playing alone in his garden.  She hated him, she hated his constant happiness, and she hated the confident way he dealt with his own company.</em></p>

<p><em>She hated him and she was very lonely.</p>

<p></em></p>

<p><em>“You could kill him” said a tiny voice lurking somewhere in the room.&#8221;</em></p>

<h3>THE DROWNER</h3>

<p><strong>By <a href="http://peadarog.livejournal.com/tag/welcome">Peadar O Guillin</a></strong></p>

<p>Click his name to sample some <strong>FROZEN STORIES</strong>.  Random House published his first novel, <strong>THE INFERIOR</strong>, in 2007 (2008 in North America). The translation rights have since been sold to ten different markets. A sequel called <strong>THE DESERTER</strong> will be appearing in the U.S. and Canada in March 2012. He is also the author of numerous short stories, the most recent of which is &#8220;Heartless&#8221; over at <strong>BENEATH CEASELESS SKIES</strong> (December 2011), &#8220;Fairy Gold&#8221;, due out in <strong>LORE</strong> in March 2012 or &#8220;The Dowry&#8221; in the next issue (#16) of <strong>BLACK GATE</strong>.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;As they sank together, Sean continued to stare into the strange white face of the Drowner. It hadn&#8217;t decayed too badly. The hair must have kept growing after he&#8217;d been lost.

DOG

By Stephen Hodgkinson.

Stephen lives #38; works in Manchester, United Kingdom.  He is working on a collection of short stories that he hopes to publish by Summer 2012.

Read by Eve Upton, who previously starred as the mushroom in "Tippler's Bane".

"The girl stared out of her bedroom window.  Her neighbour, the little boy was playing alone in his garden.  She hated him, she hated his constant happiness, and she hated the confident way he dealt with his own company.

She hated him and she was very lonely.



ldquo;You could kill himrdquo; said a tiny voice lurking somewhere in the room."

ANNOTATIONS

by Brady Golden.

Brady lives in Oakland, California with his wife and daughter.  Click the link under his name to visit his website and find him on Twitter at @bradiation.

Text read by David Michel.

Numbers read by 
Melissa Bugaj.  Click her name to hear her host original children's stories at the Night Light Stories podcast.

"There are any number of books containing illustrations of the runes to be inscribed at the ritual's onset. Some exist only in the private collections of reclusive eccentrics, while others are as close as your local library, misfiled at the ends of dimly lit aisles that smell like public toilets."

"Annotations" uses this chime sound from Freesound.

THE DROWNER

By Peadar O Guillin

Click his name to sample some FROZEN STORIES.  Random House published his first novel, THE INFERIOR, in 2007 (2008 in North America). The translation rights have since been sold to ten different markets. A sequel called THE DESERTER will be appearing in the U.S. and Canada in March 2012. He is also the author of numerous short stories, the most recent of which is "Heartless" over at BENEATH CEASELESS SKIES (December 2011), "Fairy Gold", due out in LORE in March 2012 or "The Dowry" in the next issue (#16) of BLACK GATE.

Read by Cian MacMahon. Click the link under his name to visit his blog.

"As they sank together, Sean continued to stare into the strange white face of the Drowner. It hadn't decayed too badly. The hair must have kept growing after he'd been lost. Bits of twig lay tangled there and tiny fry swam in and out of it as the walls of the island's roots kept rising away from them. The eyes were whole too and Sean fancied he saw a flicker of recognition in them as well as a slight, shy smile on the rotted lips."

<h3>KING</h3>

<p><strong>By <a href="http://ankorsabat.blogspot.com/">C. Deskin Rink</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Mr. Rink has previously appeared on Pseudopod with episode #186 - <a href="http://pseudopod.org/2010/03/19/pseudopod-186-ankor-sabat/">&#8220;Ankor Sabat&#8221;</a>.  A sequel to it, &#8220;The High Priest&#8221;, appeared as episode #35 of the  (<a href="http://www.castmacabre.org/2011/03/cm35-high-priest-by-c-deskin-rink.html">Cast Macabre podcast</a>).  He has an upcoming story, &#8220;Kingdom of Sorrow,&#8221; in the <a href="http://ericjguignard.blogspot.com/">Dark Tales of Lost Civilizations</a> anthology.</p>

<p><strong>Read by V.O. Bloodfrost</strong>, who previously read the Podcastle Miniature #65 <a href="http://podcastle.org/2011/07/24/podcastle-miniature-65-blood-willows/">&#8220;Blood Willows&#8221;</a>.  He can be contacted at his Twitter @VBloodfrost.
<br /></br></p>

<p><em>&#8220;The first time I beheld my King was amidst the arcades and columns of Babylon beneath an aching, cerulean firmament.  From the uppermost heights of the hanging gardens he descended, taking each megalithic tier in a single stride until his final step cracked wide the world itself.  His bloodshot eyes stared out at me from beneath his golden crown: wide and perfectly round – bereft of lids, lashes or flesh.  &#8220;Hail!&#8221; I cried out, &#8220;Hail!  Our King is descended from on high to rule the Earth!&#8221;"</em></p>

<p><br /></br></p>

<h3>NUMBER 21 RUE LE SUEUR</h3>

<p><strong>By Edward McDermott</a></strong></p>

<p>While the story is fiction, the events it describes are all real: Dresden, 84 avenue foch, 93 Rue Lauriston, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Petiot">Number 21 Rue le Sueur
</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Read by Ben Phillips</strong>.
<br /></br></p>

<p><em>&#8220;&#8221;We had received several reports about a doctor in Paris who was part of the resistance. Dr. Eugene of the resistance cell code named Fly-Tox. He was one of many, and we were told to concentrate on the Red Orchestra, that was the Communist spy system and resistance system in France. Your British and American agents were simply not that important.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, Robert Jodkum of IV-B4, the Jewish Affairs Department of the Gestapo, learned from an informer that a &#8220;Dr. Eugène&#8221; was helping Jews get out of France and flee to Argentina. Jodkum was a bit of martinet, and the thought of anyone escaping drove him into a rage. The informer led him to the barbershop of a lowlife called Raoul Fourrier, who was directing people to the ‘escape route’. Jodkum arrested Doctor Marcel André Henri Félix Petiot.  We held him in Fresnes prison south of Paris for several months.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnson looked bored.</p>

<p>&#8220;The problem was that Fourrier knew nothing, and Petiot wouldn’t talk. There was no proof of any escape line. We tracked several people who supposedly used this line to disappear, and disappear they did, but they never turned up anywhere else.&#8221;</em></p>

Read by V.O. Bloodfrost, who previously read the Podcastle Miniature #65 "Blood Willows".  He can be contacted at his Twitter @VBloodfrost.


"The first time I beheld my King was amidst the arcades and columns of Babylon beneath an aching, cerulean firmament.  From the uppermost heights of the hanging gardens he descended, taking each megalithic tier in a single stride until his final step cracked wide the world itself.  His bloodshot eyes stared out at me from beneath his golden crown: wide and perfectly round ndash; bereft of lids, lashes or flesh.  "Hail!" I cried out, "Hail!  Our King is descended from on high to rule the Earth!""



NUMBER 21 RUE LE SUEUR

By Edward McDermott

While the story is fiction, the events it describes are all real: Dresden, 84 avenue foch, 93 Rue Lauriston, and Number 21 Rue le Sueur
.

Read by Ben Phillips.


""We had received several reports about a doctor in Paris who was part of the resistance. Dr. Eugene of the resistance cell code named Fly-Tox. He was one of many, and we were told to concentrate on the Red Orchestra, that was the Communist spy system and resistance system in France. Your British and American agents were simply not that important.

"However, Robert Jodkum of IV-B4, the Jewish Affairs Department of the Gestapo, learned from an informer that a "Dr. Eugegrave;ne" was helping Jews get out of France and flee to Argentina. Jodkum was a bit of martinet, and the thought of anyone escaping drove him into a rage. The informer led him to the barbershop of a lowlife called Raoul Fourrier, who was directing people to the lsquo;escape routersquo;. Jodkum arrested Doctor Marcel Andreacute; Henri Feacute;lix Petiot.  We held him in Fresnes prison south of Paris for several months."

Johnson looked bored.

"The problem was that Fourrier knew nothing, and Petiot wouldnrsquo;t talk. There was no proof of any escape line. We tracked several people who supposedly used this line to disappear, and disappear they did, but they never turned up anywhere else."

<p><em>&#8220;‘Cormorant, from the Latin for “sea-raven”. The Tudors saw the bird as a symbol for gluttony: Shakespeare refers to hungry Time as a cormorant. It may have gained this reputation because of its proficiency at catching fish. Milton, however, invested the bird with a dark glamour: he likened Lucifer sitting in the Tree of Life to a cormorant, no doubt because of the bird’s habit of standing with its black wings spread out to dry. The satanic image stuck. The occultist and poet Ludovic Horne wrote of his “Cormorant days/dark and sleek”. The atheist essayist Llewellyn Powys refers to the birds as “satanic saints” in Parian niches on the chalk cliffs of Dorset, but he celebrated them too as manifesting the ecstasy of the moment, as they plunge into the sea after the silver-scaled fish of their dreams. Conan Doyle alludes to an untold Sherlock Holmes case of “The Lighthouse Keeper and the Trained Cormorant”. Isherwood cites them in a nonsense poem. Folklore about them is much barer than the literary record.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>&#8220;I recovered myself with difficulty. I was in my mentor’s house. I stood here uninvited but nevertheless I stood here.

People might think this insane—I had after all worked closely with my mentor for a decade and a half, giving him my poems for his unsparing critiques, listening and agreeing to his thoughts on literature, attending his seminars and readings, making his friends my friends. I still was not good enough. I had never published anything but I kept at it. I was poor and I wrote about poverty. “You are poor,” my mentor would say, “but you have not suffered.” I was lonely and I wrote about loneliness. “Yes, you are lonely,” my mentor confirmed, “but loneliness is not suffering.” Gradually this became the sum of his critique. At the bottom of each returned poem he scribbled: “You still have not suffered.” I felt I would never understand. I looked about this room now as if it would tell me how to feel the anguish that clearly my mentor felt, the despair that made him so superior a poet. How could his kitchen tell me more about him than his verse, which was so confessional, so full of agony and torment, like a man imprisoned in his own flesh?

"'If you were seeing the fence for the first time, you'd likely wonder at the straightness of it, the way in which the concrete posts had been planted at ten yard intervals deep into the rock.

NO TRESPASSING, they say. MILITARY LAND.

That could strike you as a little strange, perhaps, because you might have believed that most of the marked-off areas were down over in the moonscapes of Nevada, rather than up here at the quiet Northeast corner of Washington State.

<p>“The girl just has a way with tests,” her teachers repeated. “She knows how to prepare.”</p>

<p>And Lynette was tall. She towered past six feet by the time she reached eighth grade. And her long black hair that she rarely brushed only made her seem taller when it fell down over her wide shoulders; she was heavy-set, truly big-boned, more muscle than fat.

<p><i>It had been some time since we had last been called to a meeting of the White Street Society and all of us yearned to quench the thirst for the strange that these meetings had fostered in our souls, which is why the three of us – Drake, Lewis and myself – finally abandoned formality and stopped by the clubhouse uninvited, fully expecting Augustus to be absent, overseas perhaps, investigating some mysterious mystery. Instead, we stood frozen in surprise and dripping with February rain in the doorway of the clubroom, watching our old friend sitting by the fire and reading the papers, as cool as an oyster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Augustus,&#8221; cried Drake. &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where&#8217;s Charles?,&#8221; said Lewis, as an unfamiliar manservant helped him off with his overcoat. </i>

Read by Alasdair Stuart

It had been some time since we had last been called to a meeting of the White Street Society and all of us yearned to quench the thirst for the strange that these meetings had fostered in our souls, which is why the three of us ndash; Drake, Lewis and myself ndash; finally abandoned formality and stopped by the clubhouse uninvited, fully expecting Augustus to be absent, overseas perhaps, investigating some mysterious mystery. Instead, we stood frozen in surprise and dripping with February rain in the doorway of the clubroom, watching our old friend sitting by the fire and reading the papers, as cool as an oyster.

"Augustus," cried Drake. "What are you doing here?"

"And where's Charles?," said Lewis, as an unfamiliar manservant helped him off with his overcoat.

<p><i>A creak of the flooring caught my attention and I turned sharply, expecting to find my guide creeping up behind me with a jackblack in her hand and murder in her Irish eyes. Instead, I beheld a waif with a waxen pallor, protruding bones and papery skin, crouching just inside the doorway. Her furtive creeping was arrested when she saw me. Rising up to her full height she fixed her watery eyes on me and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Harry don&#8217;t like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as I was about to strike her for her insolence, her face slackened and she swooned. I stepped forward to catch her, then noticed spittle running from her mouth, and stepped back so as to avoid soiling my clothes.</i>

<p><i>&#8220;When I was your age, I ran away from school all the time. The tribal police would gather all us kids up from the hogans and the cabins, haul us to the boarding schools, cut our hair, tell us not to talk Navajo, feed us flour with bugs in it. All that crap you hear about now in documentaries. I ran away to my auntie&#8217;s house near Canyon de Chelly. She was a seer and a hand trembler. The Navajos around there, if they couldn&#8217;t sleep or they were sick, they sent a runner to my auntie and she came with her rock crystal and her corn pollen and went over their home until her hand trembled like she was holding on to an electric fence. And she saw things. Visions no one else could see. The sort of visions you&#8217;re seeing now. The things that cause sickness. Death. Things that have to be dealt with. Things that have to be sung and prayed over, so the person can be healthy again.&#8221;</i>

<p><em>&#8220;&#8216;When the train arrived, it was jammed with commuters: students, salarymen, and office ladies.  I squeezed into the last car, and more bodies pushed in behind me.  My stomach churned, assaulted by cloying perfume, stale cigarette smoke, and sour sweat.</em></p>

This story originally appeared at <a href="http://dailysciencefiction.com/science-fiction/science-fiction/liz-argall/a-study-in-flesh-and-mind/">DAILY SCIENCE FICTION</a> on Friday, May 20th, 2011.  Liz&#8217;s work can be found in a range of publications, including, <strong>Strange Horizons</strong>, <strong>Meanjin</strong> and will be in <strong>Machine of Death 2</strong>.  Related to this story, she supported the Parisian Life Models Strike of 2008, details on which can be seen <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/world/nude-models-naked-fury-sticks-out-a-mile-20081216-6zs5.html/">here</a> and <a href="http://business.highbeam.com/437587/article-1G1-191209189/pay-per-view-gains-model-citizens/">here</a>.
<br /></br></p>

<p>Read by <a href="http://www.pjballantine.com/">Philippa Ballantine</a> who appeared here last in <a href="http://pseudopod.org/2011/06/24/pseudopod-235-flash-on-the-borderlands-viii-warped-love/">&#8220;In Memoriam&#8221;</a>.  Her website is currently sporting the covers of her new books, at the link under her name.</p>

<p><br /></br></p>

<p><em>&#8220;&#8216;Try to observe closely,&#8217; says the Great Teacher, not really looking at her fresh pose, tapping the baton in his palm and smirking at the short-skirted student. &#8216;It&#8217;s like this.&#8217;</p>

<p>The model observes his new stance, the way his right hand grasps his hip, the left held in the air. She mimics his pose exactly, although she keeps her face carefully blank and does not include his sneering expression.</p>

<p>The Great Teacher snorts in disgust, shakes his head and rolls his eyes. She swiftly finds a new pose, a mangled combination of the previous three, fighting down anger and a hint of panic. She has no idea what he wants and she will not survive at this school without his recommendation.”</em></p>

This story originally appeared at DAILY SCIENCE FICTION on Friday, May 20th, 2011.  Liz's work can be found in a range of publications, including, Strange Horizons, Meanjin and will be in Machine of Death 2.  Related to this story, she supported the Parisian Life Models Strike of 2008, details on which can be seen here and here.


Read by Philippa Ballantine who appeared here last in "In Memoriam".  Her website is currently sporting the covers of her new books, at the link under her name.



"'Try to observe closely,' says the Great Teacher, not really looking at her fresh pose, tapping the baton in his palm and smirking at the short-skirted student. 'It's like this.'

The model observes his new stance, the way his right hand grasps his hip, the left held in the air. She mimics his pose exactly, although she keeps her face carefully blank and does not include his sneering expression.

The Great Teacher snorts in disgust, shakes his head and rolls his eyes. She swiftly finds a new pose, a mangled combination of the previous three, fighting down anger and a hint of panic. She has no idea what he wants and she will not survive at this school without his recommendation.rdquo;

<p><em>&#8220;Saint Nicholas looked just like he did in the picture stories: tall and thin, with a grand white beard that flowed to his waist. He wore a red-fur trimmed coat, a tall bishop’s hat, and clutched a gold staff. He smiled and said something, but Greta wasn’t listening. She hid
behind her elder sister Heike and stared at the saint’s demonic assistant, Krampus.</p>

<p>A wooden mask covered the demon’s face, a wicked smile carved into it that did not shift. Krampus tilted his horned head, his black pupils focused on Greta through the eye slits. His dark coat of damp furs smelled of decay, and he was wrapped in chains that he shook at the children.</p>

<p>They’d come every year to her house, the saint and his assistant, but back then Greta’s father had been there to protect her.</p>

<p>Krampus brandished a long, thin switch and hissed.</p>

<p>Heike put a hand on Greta’s shoulder and whispered, “Don’t be scared. You’ve been good, right?”&#8221;</em>

"Saint Nicholas looked just like he did in the picture stories: tall and thin, with a grand white beard that flowed to his waist. He wore a red-fur trimmed coat, a tall bishoprsquo;s hat, and clutched a gold staff. He smiled and said something, but Greta wasnrsquo;t listening. She hid
behind her elder sister Heike and stared at the saintrsquo;s demonic assistant, Krampus.

A wooden mask covered the demonrsquo;s face, a wicked smile carved into it that did not shift. Krampus tilted his horned head, his black pupils focused on Greta through the eye slits. His dark coat of damp furs smelled of decay, and he was wrapped in chains that he shook at the children.

Theyrsquo;d come every year to her house, the saint and his assistant, but back then Gretarsquo;s father had been there to protect her.

Krampus brandished a long, thin switch and hissed.

Heike put a hand on Gretarsquo;s shoulder and whispered, ldquo;Donrsquo;t be scared. Yoursquo;ve been good, right?rdquo;"
