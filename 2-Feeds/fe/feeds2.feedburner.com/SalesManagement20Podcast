<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Enchantment</em> should be on the reading list of every salesperson and sales manager in every industry around the world&#8230;it&#8217;s that good.  The basic principle is to begin to practice the art of changing not only the minds of those you lead, but their hearts and actions as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That might sound a little soft at first blush, but Guy makes a compelling case for mastering this skill.  After all, in today&#8217;s age of easily and abundantly accessible information, engagement isn&#8217;t enough; you need to be able to create commitment among your clients and loyalty to your brand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sales organizations that want to win in today&#8217;s competitive market need to start by creating enchantment among their sales people.  Of course, that all starts with sales managers and leaders who embody the ability to enchant their people.  A good manager can get results, but an enchanting manager gets results and commitment, which in turn creates a better customer experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Salespeople, too, need to be cultivating the ability to enchant prospects and clients.  Imagine a sales culture where prospective buyers line up in the dark to be among the first to buy your product.  Sound impossible?  Just have a look at <a title="Apple Computers, Home of the iPad 2" href="http://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Guy&#8217;s former employer, Apple</a>.  You can create that kind of enchantment, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having Guy on the podcast was a real privilege, and we&#8217;d like to thank him again for stopping in.  We&#8217;re glad to be back, and talking to Guy was definitely a great way to get back into the swing of things.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Sharon Drew (don&#8217;t you dare call her just plain &#8220;Sharon&#8221;!) is the visionary and thought leader behind Buying Facilitation®, the new sales paradigm that focuses on helping buyers manage their buying decisions. She is the author of the NYTimes Business Bestseller <a title="Selling With Integrity by Sharon Drew  Morgen - Available on Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Selling-Integrity-Reinventing-Through-Collaboration/dp/0425171566/ref=pd_sim_b_4" target="_blank">Selling with Integrity</a> as well as 5 other books and hundreds of articles that explain different aspects of the decision facilitation model that teaches buyers how to buy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Her latest book, <a title="Dirty Little Secrets by Sharon Drew Morgen - Available on Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0964355396?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwnewsalespa-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0964355396" target="_blank">Dirty Little Secrets: Why Buyers Can&#8217;t Buy and Sellers Can&#8217;t Sell and What You Can Do About</a>, is destined to be a game-changer&#8230;for those salespeople who are ready for it.  Sharon Drew contends that salespeople spend all of their time working out a solution to the potential customers need, but little to know time considering the system that the need developed in.  Without that understanding, she says, there is no possible way for the salesperson to influence the final decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Rather than focus on problem-solving or &#8220;solutions&#8221; selling, Sharon Drew encourages salespeople to learn about the subtle (and not-so-subtle) issues that are occurring in the background on the prospect&#8217;s end of things.  Politics, rules, assumptions, values, relationships&#8230;all come into play in every decision that gets made in a company, and salespeople ignore these issues at their peril.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sharon Drew says that the average success rate of salespeople, which currently hovers around 7% across all industries, is abysmal, and that if sellers would learn to not only understand what is happening for the buyers they encounter but learn to help those same buyers navigate their buying decisions, that success rate would jump to nearly 40%.  That&#8217;s an increase in effectiveness that the sales profession can no longer ignore!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Make no mistake: Buying Facilitation® is not sales training.  Rather, it&#8217;s a revolutionary approach to relating to your customers and guiding them through the sometimes treacherous waters of making a buying decision.  Grab a copy of the book, read it with an open mind, and be prepared for an eye-opening look into the world of the buyers you deal with every day!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_328" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 140px"><a href="http://podcast.salesmanagement20.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/alex-rogers.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-328" src="http://podcast.salesmanagement20.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/alex-rogers.jpg" alt="" width="130" height="98" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jerry and Alex Rogers, owner of ARRC Technology and Chartec, Inc.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a title="Alex Rogers on Facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1169920509&amp;ref=ts" target="_blank">Alex Rogers</a> is one of those guys who tells it like it is.  He&#8217;s the owner of <a title="ARRC Technology - Bakersfield IT Consultants" href="http://www.arrc.com/" target="_blank">ARCC Technology</a> and <a title="Chartec Inc. - HaaS Provider - Technology as a Service" href="http://chartec.net/" target="_blank">Chartec, Inc.</a> in Bakersfield, CA, and his goal is to be supplier of choice for IT consultants around the country.  It&#8217;s a pretty ambitious goal for a guy who started with a $300 investment, and he&#8217;s well on his way to achieving it.  So what is it that sets Alex and his team apart?  Alex says it all comes down to one word: differentiation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">And Alex isn&#8217;t just talking about product differentiation, either; he believes that everything about you needs to be different, from the way your sales people sell to the process they follow to get new clients.  If you can truly set yourself apart from the pack, you can focus on what really matter in sales: <em>finding out what your prospects want to buy!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">If you can be the salesperson who takes the time to ask the right questions and really dig down to find your prospects&#8217; hot buttons, you have a much better chance of building rapport.  That rapport is the foundation of a successful sales process.  You can learn so much about what a potential client wants to buy if you take the time to listen.  Listening is just one of the qualities that will make you different from your competition, who are too busy pitching and closing to have a conversation with their clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">How does Alex make this message clear to his team?  Practice, practice, practice!  Alex shared that one thing he feels truly sets his sales team apart is the fact that they are constantly rehearsing customer interactions until they have them down pat!  And for those of you thinking that excessive practice and rehearsal makes you sound like a robot, think again.  This kind of preparation makes you better able to handle any questions or potential roadblocks that might get thrown at you during your presentation.  Better to prepare now than fumble later!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We really enjoyed our conversation with Alex, and we&#8217;re sure you will, too.  Have a listen, take a few notes, and be sure to leave your feedback in the comments section.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Thanks for listening!</p>

Alex Rogers is one of those guys who tells it like it is.  He&#8217;s the owner of ARCC Technology and Chartec, Inc. in Bakersfield, CA, and his goal is to be supplier of choice for IT consultants around the country.  It&#8217;s a pretty ambitious goal for a guy who started with a $300 investment, and he&#8217;s well on his way to achieving it.  So what is it that sets Alex and his team apart?  Alex says it all comes down to one word: differentiation.
And Alex isn&#8217;t just talking about product differentiation, either; he believes that everything about you needs to be different, from the way your sales people sell to the process they follow to get new clients.  If you can truly set yourself apart from the pack, you can focus on what really matter in sales: finding out what your prospects want to buy!
If you can be the salesperson who takes the time to ask the right questions and really dig down to find your prospects&#8217; hot buttons, you have a much better chance of building rapport.  That rapport is the foundation of a successful sales process.  You can learn so much about what a potential client wants to buy if you take the time to listen.  Listening is just one of the qualities that will make you different from your competition, who are too busy pitching and closing to have a conversation with their clients.
How does Alex make this message clear to his team?  Practice, practice, practice!  Alex shared that one thing he feels truly sets his sales team apart is the fact that they are constantly rehearsing customer interactions until they have them down pat!  And for those of you thinking that excessive practice and rehearsal makes you sound like a robot, think again.  This kind of preparation makes you better able to handle any questions or potential roadblocks that might get thrown at you during your presentation.  Better to prepare now than fumble later!
We really enjoyed our conversation with Alex, and we&#8217;re sure you will, too.  Have a listen, take a few notes, and be sure to leave your feedback in the comments section.
Thanks for listening!

<p style="text-align: justify">This week was a special treat: we got to talk to <a title="About Dave Crenshaw" href="http://www.davecrenshaw.com/dave-crenshaw-story.php" target="_blank">Dave Crenshaw</a>, author of <em><a title="Dave Crenshaw - The Myth of Multi-Tasking" href="http://www.amazon.com/Myth-Multitasking-Doing-Gets-Nothing/dp/0470372257/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1" target="_blank">The Myth of Multi-Tasking</a></em> and <em><a title="Dave Crenshaw - Invaluable: the Secret to Becoming Irreplaceable" href="http://www.amazon.com/Invaluable-Becoming-Irreplaceable-Dave-Crenshaw/dp/0470553235" target="_blank">Invaluable: The Secret to Becoming Irreplaceable</a></em>, which was just released yesterday.  Dave was a great guest, and he had a lot of insights to offer to listeners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Of course, we couldn&#8217;t resist the opportunity to chat with Dave about multi-tasking, a favorite topic on <a title="Brad and Jerry Discuss the Myth of Multi-Tasking" href="http://podcast.salesmanagement20.com/2010/03/brad-and-jerry-discuss-the-myth-of-multi-tasking-episode-28/" target="_blank">this podcast </a>and on <a title="Multi-Tasking is a Myth | The Motivation 101 Blog" href="http://jerrykennedy.com/category/multitasking/" target="_blank">Jerry&#8217;s blog</a>.  Dave shared the term &#8220;switch-tasking&#8221; to describe what takes place when a person tries to toggle back and forth between different tasks simultaneously, what we normally refer to as multi-tasking.  Dave calls it switch-tasking because that&#8217;s what our brains actually do: they switch back and forth between the different tasks, and every time they do that, there is a switching cost.  That switching cost is what gets us into trouble.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Every time your brain has to switch between tasks, there is a reassignment of resources that takes place, similar to what takes place in a computer processor; one task is put on hold while the brain works on the other, then has to shift back when we switch our attention to the other task.  It may not seem like much is involved, but the cumulative cost of switch-tasking could literally be costing you hours a day.  It&#8217;s no wonder that Dave recommends total focus on a single task until it&#8217;s complete before moving on to the next task.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We also had an opportunity to talk to Dave about his latest book, <em>Invaluable</em>.  <em>Invaluable</em> is a business parable, the story of a young man named Jason who is dissatisfied with his position at work.  He seeks advice from his grandfather, a World War II Veteran who helps him to appreciate what it takes to become an irreplaceable employee in an organization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Dave&#8217;s strategy for becoming invaluable is simple: focus on the task you&#8217;ve been assigned, become the master of the system you&#8217;re in charge of, and expand your sphere of influence.  If you&#8217;re the person that everyone asks about a certain system, the chances of you being let go are pretty slim; if, on the other hand, you never exert yourself to develop your abilities as a great employee, you&#8217;ll never get the chance to become a leader.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We really appreciated having Dave as a guest, and we hope you enjoy this episode as much as we did.  Please leave your comments and feedback in the comments section, and we&#8217;ll see you next week!</p>

This week was a special treat: we got to talk to Dave Crenshaw, author of The Myth of Multi-Tasking and Invaluable: The Secret to Becoming Irreplaceable, which was just released yesterday.  Dave was a great guest, and he had a lot of insights to offer to listeners.
Of course, we couldn&#8217;t resist the opportunity to chat with Dave about multi-tasking, a favorite topic on this podcast and on Jerry&#8217;s blog.  Dave shared the term &#8220;switch-tasking&#8221; to describe what takes place when a person tries to toggle back and forth between different tasks simultaneously, what we normally refer to as multi-tasking.  Dave calls it switch-tasking because that&#8217;s what our brains actually do: they switch back and forth between the different tasks, and every time they do that, there is a switching cost.  That switching cost is what gets us into trouble.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" style="margin: 10px" src="http://danwaldschmidt.com/wp-content/themes/pixel/images/about-dan2.png" border="0" alt="Dan Waldschmidt, Entrepreneur Extraordinairre" width="128" height="171" /><br />
Since birth, Dan Waldschmidt has been refusing to accept business as usual.  Sure, he had a paper route, but he turned his into a money-making machine (though he opted not to tell his mom about his increased profits).</p>
<p>He ran track like plenty of other kids, but he pushed himself to break his high school’s mile record. He got the usual entry-level job right of college, but then he changed the sales process, earned millions of dollars for the company, and became CEO by the time he was 25.</p>
<p>These days, Dan is partner in a private equity technology accelerator and a former technology CEO. He is an early-early-early adopter of game-changing technology. He blogs regularly on his motivational selling blog <em>Edge of Explosion</em>. He is husband to a cute gal named Sara and father to two energetic boys.</p>
<p>He’s just an ordinary dude who happens to have an outrageous vision: he wants to change the world…</p>
<p>That&#8217;s <a title="Who is Dan Waldschmidt?" href="http://danwaldschmidt.com/about" target="_blank">Dan Waldschmidt</a> for you: a rock-star entrepreneur with an infectious attitude of positivity and a lust for life you won&#8217;t find in many people.  We first got acquainted with Dan through his participation in the <a title="Dan Waldschmidt on the Sales Bloggers Union" href="http://www.salesbloggers.com/author/danielwaldschmidt/" target="_blank">Sales Bloggers Union</a>.  He writes some pretty powerful stuff, including an article we came across on his blog called <a title="The Edge of Explosion Blog" href="http://danwaldschmidt.com/2009/10/how-to-succeed-when-your-life-life-kicks-the-out-of-your-sales-life/" target="_blank">&#8220;How To Succeed When Your Life Life Kicks the @$%*# Out of Your Sales Life&#8221;</a>.  With a title like that, how could we not ask him to join us on the podcast?</p>
<p>Dan had a lot to share, not the least of which were his thoughts on the subject of pain as it relates to business.  Dan believes that many business owners fail in the final stretch because they just can&#8217;t push through the pain, and that you sometimes have to dig really deep to find the strength and courage to go on in spite of overwhelming odds.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s easy to say, but sometimes not so easy to do, right?  We&#8217;re reminded of Wesley&#8217;s comeback to Buttercup: &#8220;Life is pain&#8230;Anyone who tries to tell you differently is trying to sell you something.&#8221;  In other words, you&#8217;re going to have to learn to deal with it at some point; why not start now?</p>
<p>Dan shared some strategies for listeners to use when the going gets tough, and we outlined some of the basic components of the proper mindset.  This really was a great episode, and we covered a lot of ground.  Of course, no episode is complete until we have your feedback, so please leave a comment and share this one with your friends.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>

<p>Ralph is a passionate advocate for better written communication skills in the sales profession.  Ralph&#8217;s company, <a title="Allora Communication Official Website" href="http://www.alloracomm.com/index.html" target="_blank">Allora Communications</a>, has been serving clients as a consulting resource specializing in marketing strategy, promotions and creative services.  Ralph is the author of <a title="Winning Sales Letters - From Prospect to Close by Ralph Allora" href="http://www.alloracomm.com/book.html" target="_blank">&#8220;Winning Sales Letters &#8211; From Prospect to Close&#8221;</a> and a proponent of <a title="TRAY Creative - Social Change Marketing" href="http://www.traycreative.com/" target="_blank">&#8220;social change marketing&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Ralph joined us to discuss the importance of good writing skills to a successful sales career.  The value of being able to craft a great sales letter can&#8217;t be overemphasized, according to Ralph.  He says that the letters you write convey a lot about you to the person you&#8217;re writing too, and we agree wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>When you write a bad sales letter, think of the impression you make: here is a piece of communication, documented for posterity, that in many cases looks like it was written by a fifth grader.  Wait, scratch that: most fifth graders are better writers because they have to be in order to become sixth graders.</p>

<p>Taking the time to learn to write well can have a huge impact on your level of success as a salesperson.  Give this episode a listen with a notebook and pencil handy.  Make notes of the suggestions, and apply them the next time you need to write a winning sales letter.  You&#8217;ll be glad you did!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a  brief hiatus (OK, 139 days&#8230;but who&#8217;s counting?!), the Sales Management 2.0 Podcast is back!  We&#8217;ve missed the podcast, and we&#8217;re committed to getting it back on track with the best content about sales and sales management we can dig up, and this week is no exception.</p>
<p>In this episode, we discuss (and debunk) the myth of multi-tasking.  The idea from the episode came from a blog post Jerry wrote called <a title="Chasing the M-Myth on The Motivation 101 Blog by Jerry Kennedy" href="http://jerrykennedy.com/2010/01/07/chasing-the-m-myth/" target="_blank">&#8220;Chasing the M-Myth&#8221;</a>, which in turn was born from a discussion over beers with a couple of really smart guys (see that post for more details).  The gist of the discussion was basically this: <strong>there is no such thing as multi-tasking! </strong></p>
<p>No matter how gifted you may be, it&#8217;s literally impossible for your conscious mind (the part that handles all your thinking) to do more than one thing at a time.  Don&#8217;t believe us?  Just try grocery shopping while you&#8217;re on the phone; we guarantee it&#8217;ll take twice as long as it would otherwise.  Why?  Because you can&#8217;t simultaneously carry out both functions at once.  You have to stop doing one in order to do the other, because both require the participation of your conscious mind.</p>
<p>So why the emphasis lately about the importance of one&#8217;s ability to multi-task?  Why is it listed in some companies as a job requirement?  We think it&#8217;s due to a fundamental lack of understanding of the damage that multi-tasking can do to your interactions with your customers.</p>
<p>Think about it for a minute: do you recall the last time<em> you </em>were &#8220;multi-tasked&#8221;?  You probably do, and chances are pretty good that you didn&#8217;t enjoy the experience.  Why?  Because you want to feel like you&#8217;re getting the full attention of the person you&#8217;re talking to, especially in a customer service setting, and you feel slighted when you don&#8217;t get it.  Why would you ever want to make your customers feel that way?</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the answer?  We say do one thing at a time and do it well.  Forget about multi-tasking, and instead concern yourself with learning to focus like a laser.  You&#8217;ll be more effective, and your customers will appreciate the change.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to be back in the saddle, and if you have any suggestions or would like to participate in a future episode, please use the comments section or the contact form.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, what&#8217;s the deal with Sales 2.0? Is it enough to have a Facebook or Twitter account, or to use LinkedIn to connect with prospects?  How about using new software applications to track your CRM data?</p>
<p>Well, according to this week&#8217;s guest, <a title="Christian Maurer's Blog - The Ultimate Sales Executive Resource" href="http://ultimatesalesexecresource.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Christian Maurer</a>, Sales 2.0 is much, much more than that.  You might recognize Christian&#8217;s distinctive accent, as <a title="The Sales Management 2.0 Podcast - Episode 13" href="http://podcast.salesmanagement20.com/2009/06/episode-13-christian-maurer-on-training-in-a-sales-20-world/" target="_blank">he is a returning guest to the SM 2.0 Podcast</a>.  We were certainly glad to have him back.</p>
<p>So what is Sales 2.0?  Christian says (and we agree) that Sales 2.0 is primarily an attitude.  As we wrote in the [download id="1"] e-book (click that link to download the full e-book for free), approaching your clients with what is of interest to them is the essential ingredient.  As Christian says, you&#8217;ll never get any benefit from social media and Web 2.0 applications if you don&#8217;t put your customers first.  In other words, it&#8217;s all about them.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in adopting Sales 2.0 for many traditional organizations is the handing over of the brand to the customer.  Many companies are hesitant to lose control of their marketing message, and they fear that entering the social media space will cause that to happen.  Well, we hate to be the ones to break it to them, but the truth is that social media has already created a world where the customer owns the brand.  The only thing companies avoid by staying out of social media is the opportunity to participate in the conversation their customers are already having about them!</p>
<p>Christian also touched on an incredibly important topic: the &#8220;frenemy&#8221; relationship between marketing and sales.  Traditionally, sales departments have been kept in the dark and not allowed to participate in the marketing process until marketing is ready to hand over the leads they&#8217;ve created.  This is another place where Sales 2.0 is causing traditional systems to break down and be replaced by new, more effective ways of getting things done.</p>
<p>For example, what happens when a prospect finds your company&#8217;s website using Google?  Does your company have an effective way for your sales department to get in touch with that prospect while they are still thinking about what they saw on your website, maybe even while they&#8217;re <em>still on</em> the website?  If not, you may be missing out on a golden opportunity to strike while the proverbial iron is hot!</p>
<p>Sales 2.0 is changing the way business gets done. Are you keeping up? If not, it&#8217;s time to start paying attention.  Give this episode a listen, and leave a comment below to share what you&#8217;re doing to put the tools of Sales 2.0 to work!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was a special episode for us, as it marked the return of sales coach and author <a title="TerriLevine.com" href="http://www.terrilevine.com/" target="_blank">Terri Levine</a>.  Terri was here to discuss her book <a title="Sell Without Selling" href="http://www.terrilevine.com/orderinformation.htm" target="_blank">&#8220;Sell Without Selling: Lessons From the Jungle for Sales Success&#8221;</a> and to raise awareness about <a title="Reflexive Sympathetic Dystrophy" href="http://www.rsds.org/index2.html" target="_blank">Reflexive Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD)</a>, a devastating disease that causes excruciating pain in its victims.  Not only is Terri donating all the proceeds from the sale of her latest book to support a child suffering from RSD, she&#8217;s matching the sales, dollar for dollar, out of her own pocket.  Talk about a HERO!</p>
<p>Terri struck a chord with us by talking about learning how to be &#8220;in rapport&#8221; with prospects and clients, in other words, taking into account their human side and really connecting with them.  As we&#8217;ve discussed many times in the past, this means being genuine, authentic and in integrity at all times.  The most important question you should be asking yourself is &#8220;How can I be of service?&#8221;, NOT, &#8220;How can I make the sale?&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Terri, the lack of trust on the part of consumers toward salespeople is rooted in the fact that many salespeople have forgotten this fundmental principle.  The whole point of Terri&#8217;s book is to encourage salespeople to stop using traditional selling techniques that are manipulative and pushy.  Consumers no longer want to be talked down to; buyers want to be an active part of the decision-making process, not be told by a salesperson what they should do.</p>
<p>The key word Terri wants people to get is &#8220;authentic&#8221;.  Letting people into your life can seem scary at the beginning, but it is well worth the reward.  Being human is a skill we seem to have forgotten, but if we focus on building relationships with other people, we&#8217;ll get everything we want.</p>
<p>Be sure to get your copy of &#8220;Sell Without Selling&#8221; today, and remember that your total purchase goes to help children with RSD, and that Terri is making matching donations.  Go to <a href="http://www.terrilevine.com/orderinformation.htm">http://www.terrilevine.com/orderinformation.htm</a> to get your copy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was a great episode for us, as we had the chance to catch up with a true thought leader in the sales profession: <a title="Randy Illig's Blog Posts" href="http://www.nf5.com/blog/author/Randy%20Illig.aspx" target="_blank">Randy Illig</a>.  Randy has over 25 years experience in business, ranging from accomplished salesperson and general manager to successful entrepreneur (CEO) and board member.  He is currently CEO of <a title="ninety five 5 website" href="http://www.nf5.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">ninety five 5</a> and is a member of the leadership team at <a title="The Sales Performance Group" href="http://www.salesperformancegroup.com/" target="_blank">The Sales Perfomance Group</a>, a division of <a title="FranklinCovey.com" href="http://www.franklincovey.com/" target="_blank">FranklinCovey</a>.  Randy has received the <a title="Ernst &amp; Young EOY Award" href="http://eoyhof.ey.com/MemberProfile.aspx" target="_blank">Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award</a>, the <a title="Ernst &amp; Young" href="http://www.ey.com/US/en/Home" target="_blank">Ernst &amp; Young </a>&#8220;CEO under 40&#8243; award for innovative management philosophy and leadership, and the Arthur Andersen Strategic Leadership Award.  Randy is a sales practitioner, not an academic.</p>
<p>Randy is the co-author (with Mahan Khalsa) of the new book &#8220;Let&#8217;s Get Real or Let&#8217;s Not Play: Transforming the Buyer/Seller Relationship&#8221;, and our discussion focused on the main idea presented in the book: creating true &#8220;win/win&#8221; buying situations by helping your customers find an exact match for their need.  Randy is a true believer in the philosophy that selling is nothing more than helping clients succeed.</p>
<p>Randy states that intent is far more important than technique in a sales situation.  In other words, when a seller&#8217;s intent is anything other than creating an ideal solution for the customer, the customer&#8217;s defenses go up and the presentation is basically over.  We all have a built-in &#8220;salesperson radar&#8221; that warns us when the person across the table is pursuing their own ends instead of ours, and we shut down the minute we sense it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when a salesperson is truly looking out for the best interest of the prospective client or customer they&#8217;re dealing with, the game fundamentally changes.  Creating high-trust/high-integrity relationships is based on understanding the client&#8217;s needs, and the only way to understand a client&#8217;s needs is to ask questions and engage in conversations with them.  One of the best ways to get other people talking is to <a title="Jerry Kennedy on why humility is essential in sales" href="http://jerrykennedy.com/2009/06/11/why-be-humble/" target="_blank">demonstrate a little humility</a>.  Only when we do this can we expect to get to a solution that exactly meets the clients need.</p>
<p>Randy was an inspiring guest.  If you haven&#8217;t read it yet, get your copy of <a title="Let's Get Real or Let's Not Play on Amazon.com" href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=let%27s+get+real+or+let%27s+not+play&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;index=aps&amp;hvadid=1102644221&amp;ref=pd_sl_32y9rew06f_e" target="_blank">&#8220;Let&#8217;s Get Real or Let&#8217;s Not Play&#8221;</a> today.  You&#8217;ll find a practical, step-by-step &#8220;how-to&#8221; guide to creating winning relationships with your clients.  Enjoy!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> This week, we had the chance to catch up with <a title="Alejandro Reyes on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/Successfool" target="_blank">Alejandro Reyes</a>, aka the <a title="Alejandro Reyes-Successfool.com-Social Media Rock Star" href="http://successfool.com/" target="_blank">Successfool</a>.  Alejandro is a social media rock star, and he&#8217;s been on the scene since 2006 (an eternity in the online world).   Alejandro&#8217;s drug of choice is people; he gets really excited about helping people follow their passions and making a great living using social media and the internet.  Alejandro&#8217;s big question for salespeople is simple: how can you use social media and personal branding to differentiate yourself from your competition?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it: in today&#8217;s economy, there is a lot of competition for every piece of business out there.  As a salesperson, you need to be using social media tools to enhance your reputation and open more doors of opportunity so that you can stay ahead of your competitors.</p>
<p>As Alejandro says, social media has leveled the playing field to the point that a new saleperson has the opportunity to keep up and even surpass a more established but less internet savvy competitor.  At the same time, you have to be sure to go at it the right way.  In Alejandro&#8217;s words, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be annoying!&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like networking in person, networking and making connections on social media sites requires that you show respect for the person you&#8217;re talking to.  Coming at them with a canned greeting and a slick sales pitch is going to get you branded as a moron pretty quickly, and people will un-follow you faster than you can say &#8220;Tweet&#8221;.</p>
<p>Alejandro&#8217;s best advice is really simple: be yourself and do what you love with a lot of passion and you&#8217;re going to be successful in the long run.  Having 80,000 followers on Twitter means little if you can&#8217;t get them to do anything.  So how do you become a &#8220;person of influence&#8221; in the social media world?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: Take your passion and build your brand around that.  While you&#8217;re at it, be genuine, sincere, interested in other people and always look for ways to provide massive value to your audience.</p>
<p>Thanks again for listening!</p>
<p>Brad and Jerry</p>
<p>P.S. Please pardon the feedback between minutes 7 and 8&#8230;we did our best to get rid of it, to no avail.  Sorry about that!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, what&#8217;s the difference between coaching and training anyway?  That was the topic of our conversation with Master Coach, CEO and entrepreneur <a title="Terri Levine - Coaching" href="http://www.terrilevine.com/" target="_blank">Terri Levine</a>, The Guru of Coaching and owner of <a title="Terri Levine - Coach Institute - Coach Training" href="http://www.coachinstitute.com/" target="_blank">The Coach Institute</a>.  And what was the answer?</p>
<p>According to Terri, <a title="Coaching - Wikipedia Article" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaching" target="_blank">coaching</a> has the intent of inspiring and improving the recipient, as opposed to training, which in Terri&#8217;s mind is an activity that involves teaching and instructing (in other words, telling).  And Terri contends that sales coaching can take place in a group environment just as effectively as in a one-on-one setting.</p>
<p>When coaching in a group, Terri has found the interaction to be more inpsiring and energizing; she also observes better interaction and even mentoring between team members.  And when team members begin coaching each other, synergy happens.  Team members naturally begin to cooperate and make up for each other deficiencies, as well as to hold each other accountable.  This, of course, leads to bigger and better results for the team as a whole.</p>
<p>Terri talks about the seven facets of effective coaching: the art of coaching, inspiration, energizing, facilitating, performance, learning and development.  Each of these facets contributes to the overall effectiveness of the coaching effort.  For example, how do you help a coach develop the ability to energize their teams?  First off, you have to look at what&#8217;s working now.  This creates positive thinking that is focused on solutions, not problems.  This kind of examination makes us think differently and creates huge results.</p>
<p>If you want to be an effective coach, you have to coach your team on a regular basis and help the people you are coaching to be able to find solutions on their own.  That, coupled with great communication and bonding, makes for lasting improvement on a team.  Coaching, when it works, makes for great sales teams.</p>
<p>Thanks to Terri for joining us, and thanks to you for listening!  Don&#8217;t forget to email Terri (<a href="mailto:coachingguru@gmail.com">coachingguru@gmail.com</a>) and tell her you listened to the podcast to receive your free gifts (a copy of one of Terri&#8217;s books and a free coaching session).</p>
<p>Brad and Jerry</p>
<p>P.S.  After a brief hiatus, we&#8217;re back! It&#8217;s been one crazy summer, but things have quieted down and we&#8217;ll be resuming our regular schedule of at least one new episode per week.  Thanks for your patience while we&#8217;ve been sorting things out, and we look forward to being a regular part of your week again!</p>

<p>What motivates sales people?  How do great sales managers keep their teams motivated in tough economic times?  Those were the topics we discussed with<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jimkeenan" target="_blank"> Jim Keenan</a> in this episode.</p>
<p>Jim Keenan is the Regional Sales Leader for Emerging Service Providers at <a href="http://www.avaya.com/usa/" target="_blank">Avaya</a> and author of the popular sales blog <a href="http://asalesguy.com/" target="_blank">asalesguy.com</a>.  He&#8217;s also the former CEO of CreateBuzz, the 2007 runner-up of <a href="http://mashable.com/openwebawards/home/" target="_blank">Mashable&#8217;s Open Web Awards</a> for Best Niche Social Network.  Jim has been a sales guy from an early age; Jim uses the same people skills today that he used to get out of trouble as a self-proclaimed &#8220;wild child&#8221;.</p>
<p>Managers have a choice when it comes to motivating their teams: they can do so in a positive way, using support, encouragement and rewards, or in a negative way, using threats, coercion and the dreaded write-up.  Jim considers writing someone up to be a failure on his part, a failure in the hiring process, the vision process or the support process.  In other words, if you hire the right people, give them a clear understanding of your vision for the results you expect them to achieve and provide them with enough support and encouragement along the way, there is no need to resort to the negative tactics.</p>
<p>Jim suggests that managers need to do two things when it comes to motivating their teams.  First, you need to find out <em>what</em> motivates your people, then you need to find out <em>why</em> it motivates them.  That knowledge will help you to have the critical conversations with your people that will keep them focused and motivated to stay on task, no matter what the economic climate.</p>
<p>Jim makes the bold statement that the only way businesses are going to get out of the current crisis is to have highly motivated teams of people who are confident they are not in danger of being laid off.  While recognizing the need for the tough business decisions that need to be made in times like this, Jim recommends that sales leaders do their best to create alternative solutions that will meet the needs of the company and at that same time take into consideration the human element of the concerned employees.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that people in fear for their jobs, not to mention their homes and 401(k)s, are far less effective  their jobs.  In order to sell effectively, your people, in particular your top performers, need to be confident that they are not going anywhere, no matter how bad things get.  Jim is one sales executive that we are proud to know.  Heck, he may even be a <a href="http://www.businessheretics.com" target="_blank">Business Heretic</a>!</p>
<p>Give the episode a listen, then post a comment or start a discussion.  And definitely check out <a href="http://asalesguy.com/" target="_blank">Jim&#8217;s blog</a> and follow him on<a href="http://twitter.com/heykeenan" target="_blank"> Twitter</a>.  He&#8217;s a great guy to know!</p>

What motivates sales people?  How do great sales managers keep their teams motivated in tough economic times?  Those were the topics we discussed with Jim Keenan in this episode.
Jim Keenan is the Regional Sales Leader for Emerging Service Providers at Avaya and author of the popular sales blog asalesguy.com.  He&#8217;s also the former CEO of CreateBuzz, the 2007 runner-up of Mashable&#8217;s Open Web Awards for Best Niche Social Network.  Jim has been a sales guy from an early age; Jim uses the same people skills today that he used to get out of trouble as a self-proclaimed &#8220;wild child&#8221;.
Managers have a choice when it comes to motivating their teams: they can do so in a positive way, using support, encouragement and rewards, or in a negative way, using threats, coercion and the dreaded write-up.  Jim considers writing someone up to be a failure on his part, a failure in the hiring process, the vision process or the support process.  In other words, if you hire the right people, give them a clear understanding of your vision for the results you expect them to achieve and provide them with enough support and encouragement along the way, there is no need to resort to the negative tactics.
Jim suggests that managers need to do two things when it comes to motivating their teams.  First, you need to find out what motivates your people, then you need to find out why it motivates them.  That knowledge will help you to have the critical conversations with your people that will keep them focused and motivated to stay on task, no matter what the economic climate.
Jim makes the bold statement that the only way businesses are going to get out of the current crisis is to have highly motivated teams of people who are confident they are not in danger of being laid off.  While recognizing the need for the tough business decisions that need to be made in times like this, Jim recommends that sales leaders do their best to create alternative solutions that will meet the needs of the company and at that same time take into consideration the human element of the concerned employees.
The basic idea is that people in fear for their jobs, not to mention their homes and 401(k)s, are far less effective  their jobs.  In order to sell effectively, your people, in particular your top performers, need to be confident that they are not going anywhere, no matter how bad things get.  Jim is one sales executive that we are proud to know.  Heck, he may even be a Business Heretic!
Give the episode a listen, then post a comment or start a discussion.  And definitely check out Jim&#8217;s blog and follow him on Twitter.  He&#8217;s a great guy to know!

<p>So, you wish you had a magic pill for turning cold calls into warm leads? Well, we just may have found the answer for you.</p>
<p>Meet Scott Anderson and Chris Heggem from <a href="http://leadengine.salesmanagement20.com" target="_blank">MyWay Interactive</a>.  <a href="http://www.salesmanagement20.com/profile/ScottAnderson" target="_blank">Scott Anderson</a> is the VP of Business Development at MyWay.  He spent 28 years managing commercial channels at Hewlett Packard.  Chris Heggem is the Marketing Manager at MyWay.  Chris is a public speaking and persuasion trainer, an award-winning debater and a social media marketer for B2B startups.  What did these two experts have to say about the power of Sales 2.0 to bridge the gap between cold calls and warm leads?</p>
<p>Scott and Chris began the discussion by acknowledging the fact that customers and sales people alike <em>hate</em> the unprepared cold call.  You know the one: &#8220;Hi Mr. Customer!  This is Joe from XYZ&#8230;I was just calling to follow up!&#8221;  We all know that those calls are painful to make, as well as to receive.  At the same time we know that, as selling professionals, at some point we&#8217;re going to have to pick up the phone and talk to someone we don&#8217;t know and who is not currently buying our product and talk to them.  How can we make these calls less awkward and more valuable to prospective clients?</p>
<p>Enter social media.  Social media has fundamentally shifted the kind of interactions we can have with our prospects.  It provides us with powerful tools to learn about the people we want to talk to and, eventually, sell to.  The information we can gather about our prospects online is virtually unlimited!  In addition to information gathering, we can begin to build great relationships with prospects all over the world.  Those social media relationships, if properly maintained, will eventually lead to business relationships for salespeople who know how to make the transition appropriately.</p>
<p>How can we make the salesperson&#8217;s job even easier?  You&#8217;re absolutely going to love this one.  MyWay Interactive and Sales Management 2.0 have teamed up to bring you <a href="http://leadengine.salesmanagement20.com">The Lead Engine</a>.  This incredibly powerful social media/Sales 2.0 tool is now available at <a href="http://leadengine.salesmanagement20.com" target="_blank">http://leadengine.salesmanagement20.com</a> and it absolutley rocks!  The Lead Engine is a worldwide, collaborative lead exchange tool that salespeople can use to work together to build incredible value for their networks.  This is permission-based lead trading at its best.  In addition, The Lead Engine is a cloud-based CRM software where you can manage all of your contacts in one place.  Best of all, Sales Management 2.0 is offering this tool absolutely free of charge.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for?!  <a href="http://leadengine.salesmanagement20.com" target="_blank">Click here to access the most powerful CRM and lead-exchange tool you&#8217;ve seen yet</a>.  Thanks to Brad, Scott and Chris for creating this incredibly powerful engine to drive your business to the next level.</p>

<p>As many sales executives are starting to realize, managing Gen Xers and Millenials (also known as Gen Y) presents new challenges that didn&#8217;t exist a decade ago.  That was the subject of Brad&#8217;s discussion with Tom Schaber, a sales management consultant who specializes in helping sales managers deal with the complexities of this situation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/tomschaber" target="_blank">Tom Schaber</a> is the owner of Selling Dynamics , a sales management consulting company specializing in helping business owners hire and develop sales people.  Selling Dynamics also coaches owners and sales managers in the art of managing sales people.  Tom has spent about 35 years in the selling profession: ten years as a field sales rep in the medical device industry, managing five states and growing business on average 30% per year, then sales manager, national sales manager and VP of sales &amp; marketing for medical device companies. He has built entire sales organizations, from interviewing and hiring new reps to skill development, creating targets and sales territories and conducting sales training.  He&#8217;s also the author of <a href="http://totalsalesmanager.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">The Total Sales Manager</a> sales blog, and the books Managing Those Who Make You Money: Taking the Mystery Out of Managing Salespeople and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592981992?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=salesmanag20-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1592981992" target="_blank">The Road Warrior&#8217;s Guide to Sales Management</a>.</p>
<p>So what do managers need to take into consideration when working with the new crop of selling professionals?  Two things: genuinely care about them as people and be transparent in your communication.</p>
<p>If anything characterizes Gens X and Y, it&#8217;s a desire for genuine, transparent relationships.  Gone are the days of manipulation and coercion as management tactics: anyone still using them is a dinosaur on the way to extinction.  Why? Because the selling professional of today wants to be respected and, if they don&#8217;t get that respect, they will seek employment elsewhere.  It&#8217;s really that simple.</p>
<p>In order to effectively manage these folks, you need to really build solid, trusting relationships. Personally, I feel this is the best way to manage people of any generation. I don&#8217;t think any of of know people who do not prefer to be treated with respect and dignity. The primary difference with Gen x and Y is they will not stick it out someplace they are unhappy because of a paycheck or some perceived sense of security or loyalty to the company.</p>
<p>While we may be thinking these kids need to learn to suck it up and learn to work in the real world it is important to remember that Gen X is moving up the corporate ladder, Gen Y is on its way and the baby boomers are quickly retiring. This IS the real world now and we will all need to make some adjustments. Companies who manage this well will retain top talent and these who don&#8217;t will experience high turnover and the costs associated with it.</p>

<p>Kevin Cook is Director of Business Development at Target Teams, a Cambridge, Mass. organization that creates performance improvement solutions applicable for use with individuals, teams and executives.  Kevin has 15 years sales management experience with both startup and <a class="zem_slink" title="Fortune 500" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500">Fortune 100</a> companies.  He’s interviewed hundreds of salespeople over the course of his career, and has, by his own admission, made every mistake possible when it comes to hiring.  He is always looking for ways to help sales executives make better hiring decisions.  Kevin joined us on this episode to discuss how using assessment tools can do just that.</p>
<p>Making great hiring decisions is no easy task, and it can be even more difficult when hiring managers “fly by the seat of their pants”.  Kevin first encouraged managers to slow down in the interview process and not be in such a hurry to get a body in place that they overlook indicators of a possible bad fit.  He recommends a focus on the needs of the particular position and the of the stake holders (i.e. peers, managers, customers, etc.).  He asks managers to consider where they would rather spend their time: in the hiring process to make sure they get a great candidate, or in the re-hiring process when the person they hired too quickly falls out?  The choice is clear.</p>
<p>With an acknowledgement that gut feelings and intuition are important to the hiring process, Kevin recommends an approach that also includes a clear, unbiased assessment of the character traits and behavioral styles of the candidate.  In other words, you want to pay attention to <em>how</em> the sales rep is going to get the job done.  This can be difficult to determine in the hiring process; after all, we’re talking about interviewing salespeople, people who build relationships and rapport for a living.  That certainly increases the difficulty of the task!</p>
<p>One of the best pieces of advice Kevin offers is to <strong>slow down</strong>, take your time, and not rush into hiring decisions.  Always remember: no breath is better than bad breath in a territory.</p>

<p>Shaun Priest has been a successful sales person and sales manager for over 15 years. He is currently Sr. VP of Sales for a technology company. He is often asked by executives and sales people for assistance with managing, deals, and career advice, so he decided to start a blog, <a title="CloserQ Blog" href="http://closerq.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">CloserQ.com</a>, for business people to post questions and get advice and opinions from Shaun and other selling professionals.  Shaun is also the author of <a title="Decisions: A Sales Novel" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0981794238?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=salesmanag20-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0981794238" target="_blank">Decisions</a>, a novel about a sales guy with a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Shaun has the distinction of being our first podcast guest to provide a PowerPoint to accompany his episode you can download it here to follow along: <a href="http://podcast.salesmanagement20.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/WinningSalesStrategies-Shaun-Priest.pdf" target="_blank">WinningSalesStrategies-Shaun Priest</a>. The PowerPoint does a GREAT job of leading you through the ten best tactics for working through the objections and questions your prospects might present during the sales process.  The beauty of Shaun&#8217;s approach is that it takes the subject of objections and deals with it in a straightforward, ethical way, much as we discussed last week, and does so in a structured, well-planned way.</p>
<p>Shaun encourages salespeople to become familiar with the most common objections presented by prospects in their industry, to listen attentively to prospects concerns, and to tap into the power of &#8220;<strong>Feel, Felt, Found</strong>&#8221; as they guide prospective customers through the buying process.  He also discussed the choices salespeople have to make along the path, whether they will use their power of influence for the prospect&#8217;s good or their own.</p>
<p>Shaun&#8217;s perspective on working with prospects and helping them come to conclusions that are truly in their best interest should help salespeople work more effectively with potential customers.  Put these ten suggestions into practice in your career, and you&#8217;re sure to see immediate and lasting results.</p>

<p>Steven Bachert is an accomplished executive and leader in the software industry with a 20-year track record of executive sales and <a class="zem_slink" title="Operations management" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_management">operations management</a> success. He has driven large and smaller/start-up organizations to superior performance. His executive management experience covers multiple functional areas. He has a proven track record of building, developing and leading successful professional service, channel/alliance, sales and marketing teams, developing strategic plans, and executing field operations plans domestically and internationally.</p>
<p>So why would a senior sales executive ask salespeople to stop <a href="http://www.salesbloggers.com/2008/10/why-overcoming-objections-is-wrong-and-how-to-do-it-right/" target="_blank">&#8220;handling&#8221; objections</a>? Steven believes that the best, most effective way to sell to clients is to engage them in real conversations targeted at discovering their needs and then crafting presentations that meet those needs.</p>
<p>Think about it: do you enjoy having <em>your</em> objections &#8220;handled&#8221;? Most of us don&#8217;t. In fact, it&#8217;s one of the reasons we find being sold to so unpleasant.  But when the pressure is on and we can feel we&#8217;re getting close to a deal, we sometimes forget how much we hate it and switch into full-on &#8220;closer&#8221; mode. When that happens, objections beware! We will do or say anything to make sure the sale happens, no matter how it makes the customer feel.</p>
<p>But what happens when we slow down and really listen to what the prospect or customer is saying? Two things: first, we remove the adversarial component from the buyer/seller relationship and second, we find out where we may have missed discussing something that was critical to the prospects buying criteria. So what should we do instead of &#8216;handling&#8217; objections? Build relationships!</p>
<p>The intent of the sales process is (or at least it should be) to forge a relationship with your prospect. Once you have a meaningful, trusting relationship with someone who needs your product or service, you are almost guaranteed to make the sale.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to thank Steven for joining us and discussing this important topic, and thanks again to you for listening.  If you&#8217;d like a little more information on this topic, check out Brad&#8217;s related blog post &#8220;Why We Shouldn&#8217;t be &#8216;Handling&#8217; Objections&#8221;.  As always, if you like what we&#8217;re doing or have something to say, leave a comment in the Feedback section and tell a friend about us!</p>

<p>Joel D Canfield is an author and award-winning speaker on how customer-centric thinking is your primary tool to achieve your goals. He has written two business books, <a href="http://commonsenseentrepreneur.com/ce/49cbo_book.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic">49 Commonsense Business Observations</span></a>, <span style="font-style: italic"><a href="http://commonsenseentrepreneur.com/ce/" target="_blank">The Commonsense Entrepreneur</a> (</span>which more fully explores these commonsense business observations), and a mystery, <span style="font-style: italic">Through the Fog</span>, which takes place in the Irish countryside. Joel writes, speaks and consults with small businesses to show how customer-centric thinking is accelerates the achievement of your business goals.</p>
<p>Joel discussed the need for all business people, but salespeople in particular, to remember that they are dealing with other people.  Too often we get lost in the transactional side of business and forget the really important things: the relationships.  How often have you been to a networking event and met someone who seemed to be interested in you and your business, only to find out later that their one and only desire was to sell you something and put money in their own pocket?  Joel offers some great suggestions to help you make sure that you don&#8217;t treat others that way and to make your netoworking efforts more effective.</p>
<p>Joel also discussed the need to understand the Golden Rule: doing to others as you&#8217;d have them do to you.  As Joel explains, this isn&#8217;t so much about treating others as <em>you&#8217;d</em> like to be treated as it is finding out how <em>they</em> want to be treated and acting accordingly.  What could treating your customers like that do for your business?  You would almost instantly begin to turn your customers into friends, friends who&#8217;d refer business to you in a steady, constant stream.</p>
<p>We really encourage you to head over to <a href="http://www.commonsenseentrepreneur.com/ce/ce_book.asp" target="_blank">The Common Sense Entrepreneur&#8217;s</a> website to pick up your copy of Joel&#8217;s book.  While you&#8217;re at it, if you are local to northern California, you can catch Joel live at <a href="http://www.commonsenseentrepreneur.com/ce/ce_book.asp" target="_blank">The Time Is Now 11:59</a> workshop series, which also features SM 2.0&#8242;s own Jerry Kennedy.  Visit the website for more details.</p>

Joel D Canfield is an author and award-winning speaker on how customer-centric thinking is your primary tool to achieve your goals.

<p>When Brad was in the hospital with his wife while she was giving birth to their second daughter, Jerry had the chance to chat with <a href="http://www.salesmanagement20.com/profile/ColleenStanley" target="_blank">Colleen Stanley</a> about how to build a high performance sales team.</p>
<p>Colleen Stanley is president of <a href="http://www.salesleadershipdevelopment.com/" target="_blank">SalesLeadership, Inc.</a> She is a monthly columnist for national Business Journals, co-author of <em>&#8216;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0967932912?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=salesmanag20-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0967932912" target="_blank">Motivational Selling</a>&#8216;</em> and author of <em>&#8216;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0977837505?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=salesmanag20-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0977837505" target="_blank">Growing Great Sales Teams: Lessons from the Cornfield</a>.&#8217;</em> Colleen is a popular speaker for <a href="http://www.vistage.com/" target="_blank">Vistage International</a>, <a href="http://www.womensleadershipexchange.com/" target="_blank">Women&#8217;s Leadership Exchange</a> and was the featured speaker on sales for the 2006 New York Times Small Business Summit. She is on the board of directors for <a href="http://www.childabuse.org/" target="_blank">The Tennyson Center for Children</a>, <a href="http://chapters.acg.org/global/default.aspx" target="_blank">Association for Corporate Growth</a> and <a href="http://www.nsaspeaker.org/">National Speakers Association</a>.</p>
<p>Collen&#8217;s advice was simple and clear.  She advises sales executives to hire the right people, have a solid sales process in place and develop leadership ability through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553378589?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=salesmanag20-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0553378589" target="_blank">emotional intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to hiring the right salespeople, Colleen suggests that sales organizations get really clear on their core values and hire only people who align with those values.    This kind of alignment leads to a more harmonious workplace and better results for the organization.  Managers need to be aware of the talents, behavior styles and workplace motivators of the candidates they are considering hiring.</p>
<p>When it comes to a good sales process, Colleen encourages organizations to quantify their lead generation efforts.  Going to network?  How many times per month?  Going to cold call?  How many per day?  Going to work with referral partners?  How many referrals are you going to send to them?</p>
<p>Once your prospecting efforts have resulted in a qualified lead, what do you do next?  Colleen recommends that all sales organizations spend some time developing their emotional intelligence skills, such as empathy and assertiveness.  These EI skills are crucial to success in today&#8217;s market, and sales organizations must begin training these skills if they hope to survive.</p>
<p>We look forward to reading your comments and feedback on this topic, and, as always, if you enjoyed the episode please share it with your friends, co-workers and peers.</p>
<p>Thanks again for listening!</p>

When Brad was in the hospital with his wife while she was giving birth to their second daughter, Jerry had the chance to chat with Colleen Stanley about how to build a high performance sales team.
Colleen Stanley is president of SalesLeadership, Inc. She is a monthly columnist for national Business Journals, co-author of &#8216;Motivational Selling&#8216; and author of &#8216;Growing Great Sales Teams: Lessons from the Cornfield.&#8217; Colleen is a popular speaker for Vistage International, Women&#8217;s Leadership Exchange and was the featured speaker on sales for the 2006 New York Times Small Business Summit. She is on the board of directors for The Tennyson Center for Children, Association for Corporate Growth and National Speakers Association.
Collen&#8217;s advice was simple and clear.  She advises sales executives to hire the right people, have a solid sales process in place and develop leadership ability through emotional intelligence.
When it comes to hiring the right salespeople, Colleen suggests that sales organizations get really clear on their core values and hire only people who align with those values.    This kind of alignment leads to a more harmonious workplace and better results for the organization.  Managers need to be aware of the talents, behavior styles and workplace motivators of the candidates they are considering hiring.
When it comes to a good sales process, Colleen encourages organizations to quantify their lead generation efforts.  Going to network?  How many times per month?  Going to cold call?  How many per day?  Going to work with referral partners?  How many referrals are you going to send to them?
Once your prospecting efforts have resulted in a qualified lead, what do you do next?  Colleen recommends that all sales organizations spend some time developing their emotional intelligence skills, such as empathy and assertiveness.  These EI skills are crucial to success in today&#8217;s market, and sales organizations must begin training these skills if they hope to survive.
We look forward to reading your comments and feedback on this topic, and, as always, if you enjoyed the episode please share it with your friends, co-workers and peers.
Thanks again for listening!
Brad and Jerry

<p>Karl is the Sales Evangelist, a startup sales mentor and the host of <a href="http://salesblog.karlgoldfield.com/the-sales-evangelist" target="_blank">Sales Evangelist TV</a>.  He also writes <a href="http://salesblog.karlgoldfield.com/" target="_blank">a blog</a> and is a regular contributor to the <a href="http://www.salesbloggers.com/" target="_blank">Sales Bloggers Union</a>.</p>
<p>Karl is passionate about developing teams for emerging companies. For the past fifteen years, he has shown the ability to deliver beyond expectations through continual innovation. By establishing a plan, then testing the boundaries of that plan, Karl provides methodologies that help to address particular challenges. He delivers strategies that allow startups to mold sales teams from the clay of their own attributes.</p>
<p>Karl’s philosophies stem from planning before execution, sound processes, and educating the evangelists. According to Karl, companies that react to problems as they arise are not as fluid as those that build a plan, train to that plan, and retool the development of their organization to define success. In today’s business world, argues Karl, we need to coach and mentor, not track and manage.</p>
<p>Karl shares some of the key differences between working for a startup and working for a larger firm.  For example, unlike his or her counterpart at a large corporation, the salesperson at a startup is in charge of his or her own marketing and lead generation.  Also,  the resources at a startup are much more limited: expenditures that wouldn&#8217;t cause a blink at a Fortune 500 company can be a real stretch for startups.  Finally, startup salespeople need to be able to think strategically all the time and to be able to manage their own sales without a lot of direction from management.</p>
<p>Whether you are a selling professional thinking of entering the exciting world of selling for startups or a startup company looking to hire your first salesperson, this episode will help you to identify the issues and questions you should address before taking the plunge.</p>

<p>Christian is an independent consultant, trainer and coach with a proven track record of helping to increase the productivity of large, global B2B sales organizations.  For the last ten years, Christian has consulted and coached hundreds of sales executives and managers on how to plan and execute customer centric sales strategies by focusing on <a class="zem_slink" title="Process management" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management">process management</a> rather than trying to manage results.</p>
<p>Prior to becoming a consultant, Christian held management positions on subsidiary and corporate level with a global telecommunications equipment provider.  On the corporate level, he was responsible for the global <a class="zem_slink" title="Strategic planning" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_planning">strategic planning</a> process and the global market, competitive and economic analysis.  In this role, he was also a member of mixed faculties together with professors from well known European business schools for company specific advanced management trainings.  He was also involved in a major initiative to change the <a class="zem_slink" title="Organizational culture" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_culture">corporate culture</a>.</p>
<p>Christian was a fascinating guest (and not only because he has a cool accent!) with a vast knowledge of the sales process and good coaching and training practices.  His advice for sales managers and executives: make sure you are focusing on the right topics with your people, then make sure you follow the training up with great coaching!</p>
<p>Christian encourages a common sense approach to <a class="zem_slink" title="Sales" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales">sales training</a>, helping organizations get &#8220;back to basics&#8221; by stressing a focus on sales<em> processes</em> over sales results.  Taking this approach allows managers to direct their groups more effectively and to forecast more accurately.  This kind of initiative, in Christian&#8217;s view, <em>must</em> start at the very top of the organization and trickle down from there.</p>
<p>The areas we should be focused on training, according to Christian, are prospecting, qualifying, rapport-building and effective presentations.  Trainers should also be helping salespeople and managers remove the guesswork from their forecasts through an accurate appraissal of where prospects are at in the sales process.</p>
<p>Will taking this action, as many sales executives fear, slow down sales?  Not necessarily.  In fact, Christian belkieves it will have the effect of streamlining a company&#8217;s process by identifying those prospects that are truly engaged as opposed to &#8220;just looking&#8221;.  Doing this will allow managers and salespeople alike to better strategize their efforts and prioritize their time and will identify areas for improvement.  He also recommends spending limited training budgets on the executives and managers in an effort to implement new initiatives from the top down, as opposed the &#8220;bottom up&#8221; strategy many companies currently employ.</p>

Have you ever wondered why a sales person can be a superstar at one company, only to fail miserably at another?  That was the topic of this week&#8217;s episode with Lee B. Salz, President of Sales Architects.
Lee B. Salz, is a sales management guru who specializes in helping companies hire the right sales people, on-board them, and focus their sales behaviors. For almost 20 years, Lee has built high-performance sales organizations that sold to consumers, corporations and the government sector for companies ranging from the Fortune 1000 to small firms.

Experienced in both start-up ventures and turnaround situations, Lee works with clients to build high-performance sales organizations using his Sales Architecture® methodology to ensure companies thrive! He has been successful in differentiating seemingly commoditized products and services &#8211; in both complex and transactional sales &#8211; resulting in record revenues and profits.
Lee spoke to us about the need for companies to pay close attention to who they hire, considering every aspect of the relationship between the company, the salesperson and the prospects or clients the salesperson will interface with.  &#8220;The Sales Marriage&#8221; (Sales Gravy Press), Lee&#8217;s second book, teaches companies how to hire the right sales people. Business executives often go on a quest to hire great sales people &#8211; not necessarily the right ones for their organization.

Lee works with companies to help them implement the sales marriage philosophy resulting in skyrocketing revenue and reduced turnover in their sales organization.

<p>We are very excited about this episode!  We got to catch up with best-selling author <a href="http://www.salesmanagement20.com/profile/MarcWarnke" target="_blank">Marc Warnke</a> to discuss his new book &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600376010?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=salesmanag20-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1600376010" target="_blank">ON</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1600376010?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=salesmanag20-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1600376010" target="_blank">O: Options Not Obligations</a>&#8220;.  Marc is the Founder of <a href="http://www.marcwarnke.com/" target="_blank">the Family First Entrepreneur movement</a>, an effort to bring entrepreneurs back in touch with the most important people in their lives: their kids!</p>
<p>Marc offers great advice for entrepreneurs and selling professionals who want to spend more time nurturing their relationships and less time at work.  Marc is teaching business people how to enrich their personal lives by rethinking their financial lives and attain a proper <a title="Work-life balance" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-life_balance" target="_blank">work-life balance</a>. Ono is Hawaiian for delicious, and in his book Marc will show you how to have a truly delicious life.</p>
<p>Marc reminded us that parents only have 936 weeks with their children from the day they&#8217;re born until they leave the nest.  How many of those weeks will you spend with your kids? According to Marc, that depends <strong>not on how much money you make</strong>, but <strong>how much you save and invest</strong>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re ready to have ONO in your life, you need to rethink the way you approach you business life.  How much money do you need to make in order to sustain the lifestyle you desire to live?  Marc encourages all of us to take a second look and see if there is anything we&#8217;re spending money on that we can live without.  If we can learn thriftiness, we can shave years off our ONO timeline.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: whether your desire is to sail around the world with your kids or travel the countryside speaking in front of audiences, you&#8217;re going to need money.  Marc will help you find the amount you truly need to make and how to get yourself on the path to a life of ONO: Options, Not Obligations.</p>
<p>Enjoy this episode; it&#8217;s one that can truly change your life.  Please share it with your friends and associates, and leave us a comment in the feedback section.  We&#8217;d love to hear what you have to say!</p>

<p>So, you&#8217;re company doesn&#8217;t provide enough training?  They won&#8217;t send you to seminars?  Won&#8217;t reimburse you for books and audio programs?  Well, while that <em>is</em> unfortunate (sales managers, what are you thinking?!), we&#8217;re not going to let you off the hook!</p>
<p>In this early episode (we&#8217;ve been saving it for a special occassion) we discussed the need for sales people to take responsibility for and ownership of their own educations.  Whether you&#8217;re an <a class="zem_slink" title="Master of Business Administration" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Business_Administration">MBA</a> selling high-tech software solutions or a college drop-out selling vacuum cleaners door-to-door (or vice-versa), you need to continually improve your mind in order to succeed.  So how can you do it?</p>
<p>First, Brad discusses the importance of creating your own <strong>Automobile University</strong>, a concept recommended by greats like <a href="http://www.jimrohn.com/" target="_blank">Jim Rohn</a>, <a href="http://www.briantracy.com/" target="_blank">Brian Tracy</a> and <a title="Zig Ziglar" rel="wikipedia" href="http://www.zigziglar.com/" target="_blank">Zig Ziglar</a>.  How do <em>you</em> spend the time in your car between calls?  If you&#8217;re not spending at least a little time each day listening to great audio programs, you&#8217;re missing out on a huge opportunity for growth!  Whether it&#8217;s &#8220;<a class="zem_slink" title="Acres of Diamonds" rel="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Acres-Diamonds-Russell-H-Conwell/dp/1604591927%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dsalesmanag20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1604591927">Acres of Diamonds</a>&#8220;, &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785288937?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=salesmanag20-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0785288937" target="_blank">Ziglar on Selling</a>&#8221; or <a href="http://www.motivation101audio.com" target="_blank">&#8220;Motivation 101&#8243;</a>, the knowledge you can gain while driving around is incredible.</p>
<p>Next, Jerry discussed the importance of becoming a reader.  You&#8217;ve heard before that &#8220;leaders are readers&#8221;, but are you taking the time every day to put that principle into practice in your life?  The time to do it is now!  But what if you don&#8217;t have money in the budget to buy new books?  Answer: find your local library and use it.  With all the free information available in books, there is really no excuse for not reading on a regular basis.  It will improve your results dramatically.</p>
<p>Lastly, we discussed learning from your peers.  This truly is one of the best educations you can receive, especially when you surround yourself with other great sales people.  Listen, ask questions and observe the things they do well, then go put them into practice in your own career.  Remember, imitation is the highest form of flattery.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your support.  We appreciate you listening and telling your friends about the Sales Management 2.0 Podcast.  We&#8217;re also enjoying your comments, so please continue to participate in making this podcast even better by sharing your feedback.</p>

<p class="summary">Kim is a seasoned sales and management professional with a diverse background, specializing in:</p>

<p>Over a decade ago, Kim discovered a passion for the art of selling. According to Kim, sales is really nothing short of a way of communicating and relating successfully to others.  He discusses <strong>three key aspects of relationship building:</strong> clear communication, personal integrity and having a <a href="http://searchwarp.com/swa468846-A-New-Breed-Of-Leader-Servant.htm" target="_blank">servant mindset</a>.</p>

<p>I have written many times about how I use &#8220;Automobile University&#8221; to continually expand my knowledge of sales. management, and leadership, but one thing I have never talked about is how the heck do I afford to do it EVERY DAY. Those CD&#8217;s can get expensive right? They can and while I still buy a lot of them I also supplement them with Podcasts. 3 out of 4 Americans have a <a class="zem_slink" title="IPod" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod">iPod</a> or some other MP3 device, and the podcast makes it easier than ever to not only get fresh, current, and timely information on a variety of topics it is also free! All you have to do is add them to your <a class="zem_slink" title="ITunes" rel="homepage" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> library and they will automatically be downloaded and ready for you when you want them! How cool is that? If you prefer though you can also just add the feed to your <a class="zem_slink" title="Aggregator" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregator">RSS reader</a> and listen to them from your browser just like viewing any other blog post by streaming the audio. My intention here isn&#8217;t so much to give a lesson on <a class="zem_slink" title="Podcast" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">podcasting</a> though as it is to share with you some GREAT audio content I think you should have in your iTunes library, or feed reader so here we go!</p>
<p>First off I would feel pretty silly if I did not include a link out to my own <a href="http://podcast.salesmanagement20.com">sales podcast</a>! Did you know that <a href="http://www.salesmanagement20.com/profile/JerryKennedy">Jerry Kennedy</a> and I host a weekly show right here on the Sales Management 2.0 Social Network? Every week we hunt down some of the latest best selling authors, hottest consultants, and interesting sales leaders to share with you fresh information that is bound to give you some new insight into what you currently do or share some new technologies you may not have seen yet. This weeks episode was with <a href="http://www.salesmanagement20.com/profile/Will">Will Fultz</a>, a good friend of mine and fellow member of the <a href="http://salesbloggers.com">Sales Bloggers Union</a>. In this weeks episode Will leads a discussion about what motivates sales professionals, and what companies should do to keep top sales performers motivated. Make sure you listen to <a href="http://podcast.salesmanagement20.com/2009/04/episode-8-will-fultz-on-rewarding-your-top-producers/">Rewarding Your Top Producers</a>!</p>
<p>Next I want to share with you &#8220;<a href="http://www.sellbetter.ca/content/view/145/110/">What’s in Your Pipeline</a>?&#8221;, a podcast from <a href="http://www.salesmanagement20.com/profile/TiborShanto">Tibor Shanto</a> Principal and founder of <a href="http://sellbetter.ca/">Renbor Sales Solutions Inc.</a>. Tibor declares that the pipeline is core to sales success, and as in sports, a strong core allows you to excel in all other areas of your sport. Much like a trained athlete Tibor understands that keeping a strong core or a healthy pipeline is more about discipline and proper execution. In this episode you can here him discuss key elements every sales person can put into practice to ensure a consistently healthy and vibrant <a href="http://www.sellbetter.ca/content/view/145/110/">sales pipeline</a>.</p>
<p>Another favorite of mine, and someone I have had as a guest on my own podcast is <a href="http://www.salesmanagement20.com/profile/SkipAnderson">Skip Anderson</a>. Skip leads the the Selling to Consumers <a href="http://podcasts.sellingtoconsumers.com/2009/04/30/005-the-essence-of-selling/">Sales Podcast</a>. In his latest episode “<a href="http://podcasts.sellingtoconsumers.com/2009/04/30/005-the-essence-of-selling/">The Essence of Selling,</a>” he offers six tips for getting your prospects to make a decision and get off the buying decision fence. GREAT STUFF!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.salesmanagement20.com/profile/IanBrodie">Ian Boradie</a> of <a href="http://www.lighthousebc.co.uk/">lighthouse Business Consulting</a> also had a great episode this week on <a href="http://www.sales-excellence.co.uk/articles/sales-excellence-podcast-lead-nurturing.html">Lead Nurturing</a>. In this episode Ian explains that in most businesses, between 70-80% of your leads are long term. They’re potential clients who pass all your qualifying criteria &#8211; however, they’re just not ready to buy right now. he also explains how you should begin to build a relationship with these potential clients so that when the time is right to buy, you’re in the front of their mind. Unfortunately, most salespeople tend to drop leads the moment they find out they’re not going to close in the short term. This is a huge mistake. Almost all these potential clients will buy from someone in the next 24 months. The role of Lead Nurturing is to make sure that someone is you. Ian does a great job of explaining not only the why but the how! Check it out!</p>
<p>Although it’s not quite from this week, there are some excellent podcasts on sales process management from the team at Symvolli at the <a href="http://www.symvolli.com/podcast/default.aspx">Symvolli Sales Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Finally I know this episode is about podcasters, but I didn&#8217;t feel this post would be complete if I did not mention one of my favorite video bloggers <a href="http://www.salesmanagement20.com/profile/KarlGoldfield">Karl Goldfield</a>who produces <a href="http://tv.salesevangelist.com/">Sales Evangelist TV</a>.The next episode in the Taking your Message to the Street Series will be “Thinking About <a class="zem_slink" title="Thought leader" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_leader">Thought Leadership</a>?” The focus will be on what it means to become a thought leader. To learn more about the benefits of building a reputation as an expert in your industry. Visit Sales Evangelist TV on Wednesday, May 6, 2009 at 7:30pm PST.</p>
<p>I hope I have given you some good info to chew on&#8230; I would love to see you share some of your favorite podcasts in the comments below.</p>
<p>Have a great weekend everyone and happy selling!</p>

<p>This week, we had the chance to talk to <a href="http://www.salesmanagement20.com/profile/Will" target="_blank">Will </a><span class="blsp-spelling-error"><a href="http://www.salesmanagement20.com/profile/Will" target="_blank">Fultz</a> about the importance of rewarding top sales producers</span>.  Will is the author of  <a href="http://www.topsalesblog.com/" target="_blank">Top Sales Blog</a>, a contributing member of the <a href="http://www.salesbloggers.com/">Sales Bloggers Union</a><a href="http://www.salesbloggers.com/"></a>, an Internet marketer, and a practicing salesperson for a <a class="zem_slink" title="Fortune 500" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500">Fortune 500</a> paint &amp; coatings company.</p>
<p>Will has achieved overwhelming success in his sales career, becoming a trusted business advocate to his clients. He has received numerous sales awards for high double-digit sales increases annually, triple-digit sales increases on a monthly/quarter basis, and the ability to obtain large volumes of market share from his competitors in record time by providing solid business solutions to his clients that have increased their bottom line.</p>
<p>We chatted with Will at length about what it means to properly reward the top sales performers in your organization.  He shared some great insights about <strong>what truly motivates salespeople</strong>, beyond just receiving a paycheck.  This is a great episode for sales managers and business owners to consider; after all, how you recognize and reward your salespeople is a big contributor to their motivation and success.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s tumultuous business environment, retaining your best talent is absolutely critical.  How can you do it without breaking the budget?  Will shares some great ideas, from items like plaques and rings in recognition of outstanding results to certificates given at regular intervals when benchmarks are achieved.  Whatever the item, though, Will encourages managers to &#8220;make it public&#8221; by offering commendation in front of the entire team.</p>
<p>Regular praise,<a href="http://www.topsalesblog.com/2009/04/recognizing-your-top-salespeople-is.html"> recognition and rewards</a> will do wonders for your sales team, not only for their morale, but also for their results.  The bottom line is this: <strong>recognition and reward breed loyalty that no paycheck ever could</strong>.</p>

<p>With so many companies using their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_Relationship_Management" target="_blank">CRM program</a> as little more than a babysitting/Big Brother tool, you may find yourself  wondering what the point is.  If that&#8217;s the case in your organization, this first-ever Bonus Episode is just for you! <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/0a3/a91" target="_blank">Ken Rudin</a> the founder of LucidEra is going to show you how to stop using your CRM tool as a babysitter and start using it to drive revenue.</p>
<p>In this episode, we spoke to Ken Rudin, founder and VP of Market Development at <a href="http://www.lucidera.com/" target="_blank">LucidEra</a>.  With an extensive background in <a href="http://www.lucidera.com/blog/index.php/2009/04/21/lucidera-spring09-announced/" target="_blank">sales analytics </a>and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SaaS" target="_blank">software as a service</a> (SaaS), Ken provided great wisdom about the importance of not only collecting sales data for your CRM database, but  taking the time to <em>analyze</em> that data with a view to focusing the efforts of your sales team to achieve maximum effect.</p>
<p>Ken&#8217;s thoughts on the analysis and use of CRM data really hit home with us.  We found the upside potential of applying his analytics staggering.  Imagine if you could increase your overall win rate, shorten your overall sales cycle and maximize the results of your sales force, both individually and as a team!  In fact, Ken is so confident in his process, he&#8217;s offering companies a $1000 guarantee that he can find $100,000 in impact to your company&#8217;s bottom line!</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: whether you are using crayons and construction paper or the most advanced CRM software available to track your sales results, the power of the collected data is dormant until you analyze it and put it to use in your process.  This episode will help you see ways you can accomplish this, starting today!</p>
<p>Enjoy and, as always, thanks for listening.  Please leave your comments, questions and suggestions for future episode topics in the comments section.  If you enjoyed this episode, please share it with your friends, colleagues and managers.</p>

<div style="margin-top: 30px">This week, we had the chance to chat with <a class="zem_slink" title="Craig Elias" rel="facebook" href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=524701507">Craig Elias</a>, the founder of <a href="http://www.shiftselling.com/">Shift Selling</a><span style="color: #000000">. At Shift, they believe the </span>biggest mistake most selling professionals and sales organizations are making is analyzing lost sales versus analyzing won sales and finding or creating the perfect timing. What&#8217;s the difference? Listen and find out, but I can assure you I cannot think anything else so simple that will have such a profound effect on your sales performance.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 30px">Craig Elias is the creator of <a href="http://www.shiftselling.com/the-book/introduction/" target="_blank">Trigger Event  Selling™</a>,<a href="http://www.shiftselling.com/the-book/introduction/"> </a>and the Chief Catalyst of Shift Selling Inc.<span style="text-decoration: underline"><em><br />
</em></span></div>
<p>Craig has used <em>Trigger Event</em> strategies to be a top  sales performer at EVERY company include <a class="zem_slink" title="MCI Inc." rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCI_Inc.">WorldCom</a> where  he was named the <strong>#1 salesperson within six months</strong> of joining  the company.</p>
<p>Craig’s <em>Trigger Event</em> strategies have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Won him a <strong>$1,000,000 prize</strong> in a global “Billion-Dollar  Idea” pitch competition</li>
<li>Earned him coverage on<strong> NBC News,  The New York Times, The National  Post, The Wall Street Journal</strong>, <strong>Sales and Marketing Magazine</strong>, and  <strong>Business 2.0</strong></li>
<li>Earned his last company, the distinction as one of ‘Silicon Valley’s 40  hottest’ and <strong>one of Dow Jones’ 50 most promising companies</strong> in  North America.</li>
</ul>
<p>Craig was a fascinating guest.  His thought-provoking and somewhat controversial viewpoint on the selling process was very insightful.  Best of all, Craig&#8217;s theories are based on real-world results.</p>
<p>As you listen to this episode, we&#8217;re sure you will find yourself with questions and comments about the topic.  Please take a moment to post a question or comment in the comments section and we will try to get Craig in here to answer all of your questions.</p>
<p>Finally, this episode dovetailed so nicely with our interview on sales analytics, with Ken Rudin the CEO at <a href="http://www.lucidera.com/" target="_blank">Lucid Era</a>; that we have decided to release it early as a bonus episode tomorrow&#8230; so be on the look out for it!</p>
<p>Thanks again for listening, and please be sure to pass this episode along to your friends and colleagues.</p>

This week, we had the chance to chat with Craig Elias, the founder of Shift Selling. At Shift, they believe the biggest mistake most selling professionals and sales organizations are making is analyzing lost sales versus analyzing won sales and finding or creating the perfect timing. What&#8217;s the difference? Listen and find out, but I can assure you I cannot think anything else so simple that will have such a profound effect on your sales performance.
Craig Elias is the creator of Trigger Event  Selling™, and the Chief Catalyst of Shift Selling Inc.

Craig has used Trigger Event strategies to be a top  sales performer at EVERY company include WorldCom where  he was named the #1 salesperson within six months of joining  the company.
Craig’s Trigger Event strategies have:

Won him a $1,000,000 prize in a global “Billion-Dollar  Idea” pitch competition
Earned him coverage on NBC News,  The New York Times, The National  Post, The Wall Street Journal, Sales and Marketing Magazine, and  Business 2.0
Earned his last company, the distinction as one of ‘Silicon Valley’s 40  hottest’ and one of Dow Jones’ 50 most promising companies in  North America.

Craig was a fascinating guest.  His thought-provoking and somewhat controversial viewpoint on the selling process was very insightful.  Best of all, Craig&#8217;s theories are based on real-world results.
As you listen to this episode, we&#8217;re sure you will find yourself with questions and comments about the topic.  Please take a moment to post a question or comment in the comments section and we will try to get Craig in here to answer all of your questions.
Finally, this episode dovetailed so nicely with our interview on sales analytics, with Ken Rudin the CEO at Lucid Era; that we have decided to release it early as a bonus episode tomorrow&#8230; so be on the look out for it!
Thanks again for listening, and please be sure to pass this episode along to your friends and colleagues.

<p>His newest book,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385522614?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=salesmanag20-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0385522614" target="_blank"> </a><a href="//tinyurl.com/asstcp&gt;" target="_blank">Greater Than Yourself: The Ultimate Lesson of True Leadership</a>,  has just been published by Doubleday/Random House and was the central topic of this episode.   <em>Greater Than Yourself</em> is a powerful and inspiring story that shows how  the goal of a leader should be to lift others higher than themselves.</p>
<p>Steve shares his insights into what makes great leaders, and he should know: in 1989, after having run his own financial services company, Steve devoted his  professional life to the field of leadership development and has been at it ever  since. He was director of service programs at <a class="zem_slink" title="The Monroe Institute" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monroe_Institute">TMI</a>, an international training  consultancy, and then worked for 6 years as Vice President and Official  Mouthpiece (that’s what it said on his business card) of <a href="http://www.tompeters.com/" target="_blank">The Tom Peters Company</a> where he met several of his mentors including author/gurus <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Peters" target="_blank">Tom Peters</a>, <a href="http://www.bigspeak.com/james-kouzes.html" target="_blank">Jim  Kouzes</a> and <a href="http://www.terrypearce.com/" target="_blank">Terry Pearce</a>. In 2000, Steve established his own company, Extreme  Leadership, Inc. where he is president and CEO. Steve is also the co-founding  director of <a href="http://www.socialprofitleadership.org/" target="_blank">The Center for Social Profit Leadership</a> (part of the Legacy XXI  Institute), a non-profit organization formed to serve the leadership development  needs of social entrepreneurs, and he sits on the Board of Directors of <a href="http://www.upwithpeople.org/" target="_blank">Up With People</a>, a global leadership program for students  from 18 to 29 years old.</p>
<p>Steve was a delightful guest, and the knowledge and inspiration he shares are outstanding.  Give it a listen, then feel free to leave a comment, start a discussion or tell a friend about this episode.  Then get started with your own GTY project.  Like Steve says &#8220;If you want to change the world, I say, have at it!  Just one piece of advice:  Never&#8211;never, ever&#8211;try to do it alone.&#8221;   This discussion will inspire you to do just that! Finally, I would suggest you visit the <a href="http://www.greaterthanyourself.com/" target="_blank">Greater Than Yourself Website</a>, where you can get a much deeper insight into what greater than your self is, and see it in action through a GREAT series of videos.</p>
<p>Thanks again for listening,</p>
<p>Brad and Jerry</p>
<p>P.S. Mad props to Danny Codella for the new intro music he wrote for the show, as well as his incredible production work on this project.  Check out his website <a href="http://www.musicismine.net/" target="_blank">www.musicismine.net</a>, then go buy a few of his band <a href="http://www.polaremusic.com/" target="_blank">Polare&#8217;s</a> songs on iTunes.  If you think Danny&#8217;s good, wait until you hear the whole band!</p>

Steve shares his insights into what makes great leaders, and he should know: in 1989, after having run his own financial services company, Steve devoted his  professional life to the field of leadership development and has been at it ever  since. He was director of service programs at TMI, an international training  consultancy, and then worked for 6 years as Vice President and Official  Mouthpiece (that’s what it said on his business card) of The Tom Peters Company where he met several of his mentors including author/gurus Tom Peters, Jim  Kouzes and Terry Pearce. In 2000, Steve established his own company, Extreme  Leadership, Inc. where he is president and CEO. Steve is also the co-founding  director of The Center for Social Profit Leadership (part of the Legacy XXI  Institute), a non-profit organization formed to serve the leadership development  needs of social entrepreneurs, and he sits on the Board of Directors of Up With People, a global leadership program for students  from 18 to 29 years old.
Steve was a delightful guest, and the knowledge and inspiration he shares are outstanding.  Give it a listen, then feel free to leave a comment, start a discussion or tell a friend about this episode.  Then get started with your own GTY project.  Like Steve says &#8220;If you want to change the world, I say, have at it!  Just one piece of advice:  Never&#8211;never, ever&#8211;try to do it alone.&#8221;   This discussion will inspire you to do just that! Finally, I would suggest you visit the Greater Than Yourself Website, where you can get a much deeper insight into what greater than your self is, and see it in action through a GREAT series of videos.
Thanks again for listening,
Brad and Jerry
P.S. Mad props to Danny Codella for the new intro music he wrote for the show, as well as his incredible production work on this project.  Check out his website www.musicismine.net, then go buy a few of his band Polare&#8217;s songs on iTunes.  If you think Danny&#8217;s good, wait until you hear the whole band!
