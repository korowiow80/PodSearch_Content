ReVerb Spanish is a podcast focused on Spanish verbs that appear to have similar meanings. For example the Spanish verbs SER and ESTAR both mean "to be" but actually can't be used interchangeably in Spanish. This podcast is designed to help you better understand some of the variations and nuances in meanings of common Spanish verbs. There are also audio Spanish verb drills available to help you practice and memorize conjugations of basic Spanish verbs. Visit www.reverbspanish.com for details.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>I originally wrote this for my other blog, <a href="http://spanish-podcast.com/2007/12/29/verbs-like-gustar/" target="_self">Voices en Español</a>. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Gustar</strong></em> is one of the first verbs you learn  when you start studying Spanish. But it’s the type of verb that  frequently trips up English speakers because of the way it is  conjugated. With <em>gustar</em>, the person that would be the subject in English becomes the indirect object in Spanish. So, <em>I like chocolate </em>in English becomes <em>me gusta chocolate</em> (literally, “chocolate is pleasing to me”) in Spanish.</p>
<p>Everyone who takes a beginner’s Spanish course learns this verb and  how it works. But what about all the other Spanish verbs that operate  exactly the same way? There are quite a few. You may already know  several of these verbs but were you aware that they operated like <em>gustar</em>?</p>
<p>Here’s a list of verbs like <em><strong>gustar</strong></em>:</p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><strong>agradar</strong> (to like)</p>
<p><strong> caer bien </strong>(to make a good impression)</p>
<p><strong>caer mal</strong> (to make a bad impression)</p>
<p><strong>convenir </strong>(to suit, to be suitable)</p>
<p><strong>costar trabajo</strong> (to be difficult)</p>
<p><strong>dar asco</strong> (to disgust)</p>
<p><strong>disgustar</strong> (to upset)</p>
<p><strong>doler</strong> (to hurt)</p>
<p><strong>encantar</strong> (to love, to adore)</p>
<p><strong>enfadar</strong> (to get angry)</p>
<p><strong>extrañar</strong> (to surprise)</p>
<p><strong>faltar</strong> (to lack, to be missing)</p>
<p><strong>fascinar</strong> (to fascinate)</p>
<p><strong>hacer falta</strong> (to need)</p>
<p><strong>importar </strong>(to matter)</p>
<p><strong>impresionar</strong> (to impress)</p>
<p><strong>interesar</strong> (to interest)</p>
<p><strong>molestar</strong> (to bother</p>
<p><strong>parecer</strong> (to seem, to appear)</p>
<p><strong>preocupar</strong> (to worry)</p>
<p><strong>quedar</strong> (to have left)</p>
<p><strong>sobrar</strong> (to have in excess)</p>
<p><strong>sorprender</strong> (to surprise)</p>
<p>Rule to remember: What would be considered the subject in English turns into the indirect object (<em><strong>me, te, le, nos, os, les</strong></em>) in Spanish. Therefore, the verb in Spanish <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span></strong> agree with the subject of the sentence, not the indirect object.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>John is fascinated by cars. <em>A Juan, le<strong> fascinan</strong> los coches</em>.</p>
<p>He likes Spaniards. <em>Le</em> <em><strong>caen</strong></em> bien los españoles.</p>
<p>The verbs <em><strong>fascinar </strong></em>and <em><strong>caer</strong></em> are conjugated in the plural because they are connected to the subject of the sentence, which are “coches” and “españoles.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that the Spanish verb <strong><em>SABER</em></strong> has two different definitions?</p>
<p>The first meaning, you probably already know. Yes, <em>saber</em> means “to know.” But there is another meaning to the verb that you may not have learned yet.  <em>Saber</em> also means “to taste. &#8221;</p>
<p>So how do you distinguish between SABER when it means “to know” and SABER when it means “to taste”?</p>
<p>You can usually tell from the context. If the subject is food, then it&#8217;s likely that the meaning is &#8220;to taste.&#8221; But to avoid any confusion, you use a preposition to distinguish the different meanings.</p>
<h2>SABER DE = to know about, to know of<em> </em></h2>
<p>When you want to express the meaning &#8220;to know about, to know of,&#8221; use <em>SABER</em> plus the preposition<em> DE</em>.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">¿Sabes de un buen lugar para estudiar español? Sí, yo sé de un lugar fántastico en Argentina. <span style="color: #000000;">(Do you know of a great place to study Spanish? Yes, I know of a fantastic place in Argentina.)</span><br />
</span></em></p>
<p>There are additional nuances to the verb SABER which I&#8217;ve previously discussed <a title="Conocer vs Saber" href="http://www.reverbspanish.com/conocer-vs-saber/" target="_self">here</a>. Check out the episode entitled  <strong><a title="Conocer vs Saber" href="http://www.reverbspanish.com/conocer-vs-saber/" target="_blank">CONOCER vs. SABER</a></strong> for more insight into the meaning and usage of <em>saber.</em> <em><br />
</em></p>
<h2>SABER A = to taste of, to taste like</h2>
<p>When <em><strong>saber</strong></em> means &#8220;to taste,&#8221; you use the preposition<em><strong> a</strong></em>. That means “to taste of, or to taste like.”</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em> Esta galleta sabe a coco y a mí no mi gusta ese sabor.<span style="color: #000000;"> (</span></em></span><span style="color: #000000;">This cookie tastes like coconut and I don’t like that flavor.)</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">La sopa sabe a ajo. Es un poco fuerte. <span style="color: #000000;">(</span></span></em><span style="color: #000000;">The soup tastes of garlic. It&#8217;s a little strong.) </span></p>
<p>So to sum up<em><strong>,</strong></em> the verb SABER means “to know” or “to taste.” To distinguish between the two meanings, pay attention to the context and remember that at times you’ll have to use the Spanish prepositions A or DE to be grammatically correct.</p>
<h2><em>Extra tip:</em></h2>
<p><strong>The nouns SABOR (flavor) and OLOR (smell)</strong> sometimes require the use of the preposition <em><strong>A.</strong></em> Here&#8217;s what you need to know:</p>
<p>When you are referring to a specific smell or flavor: <span style="color: #0000ff;">s</span><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">abor / olor +<strong> a</strong> + noun.</span><br />
</em><br />
But you don&#8217;t need the preposition &#8220;a&#8221;  if you follow  the noun with an adjective<em>: </em><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>sabor / olor + adjective.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: blue;"> </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em> sabor a chocolate</em></span> (chocolate flavored) but<span style="color: blue;"> <em>sabor dulce</em></span> (sweet taste)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">sabor a cebolla</span></em> (onion flavored) but <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">sabor ácido</span></em> (sour taste, acidic taste)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: blue;"><em>olor a humo</em></span> (smells of smoke, smells smokey) but <em><span style="color: blue;">olor terrible</span></em> (horrible smell)<br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em> </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>olor a canela</em></span> (smells like cinnamon) but <em><span style="color: #0000ff;">olor increíble</span></em> (incredible smell)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Spanis<em>h</em> preposition<em> <strong>A </strong></em>is also paired with the verb<em> </em><em><strong>OLER</strong> (to smell). </em>For example<em>: <span style="color: blue;">Tu pelo huele a tabaco</span>. (Your hair smells smokey, your hair smells of cigarette smoke.)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A funny way to say that something smells awful in Spanish is to say that it <span style="color: blue;"><em>&#8220;huele a tigre&#8221;</em></span> (smells like a tiger). <img title="Grin" src="http://www.notesfromspain.com/forums/images/smilies/grin.gif" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>OLER</strong> is an irregular verb that undergoes a spelling change to the letter &#8220;h&#8221; in the present tense:<em> huelo (I smell) hueles (you smell), huele (he smells)</em>, etc.</p>
<p>&#8212;-              &#8212;&#8211;              &#8212;&#8211;                 &#8212;-</p>

		<itunes:summary>Did you know that the Spanish verb SABER has two different definitions?

The first meaning, you probably already know. Yes, saber means “to know.” But there is another meaning to the verb that you may not have learned yet.  Saber also means “to taste. "

So how do you distinguish between SABER when it means “to know” and SABER when it means “to taste”?

You can usually tell from the context. If the subject is food, then it's likely that the meaning is "to taste." But to avoid any confusion, you use a preposition to distinguish the different meanings.
SABER DE = to know about, to know of 
When you want to express the meaning "to know about, to know of," use SABER plus the preposition DE.

¿Sabes de un buen lugar para estudiar español? Sí, yo sé de un lugar fántastico en Argentina. (Do you know of a great place to study Spanish? Yes, I know of a fantastic place in Argentina.)


There are additional nuances to the verb SABER which I've previously discussed here. Check out the episode entitled  CONOCER vs. SABER for more insight into the meaning and usage of saber. 

SABER A = to taste of, to taste like
When saber means "to taste," you use the preposition a. That means “to taste of, or to taste like.”

 Esta galleta sabe a coco y a mí no mi gusta ese sabor. (This cookie tastes like coconut and I don’t like that flavor.)

La sopa sabe a ajo. Es un poco fuerte. (The soup tastes of garlic. It's a little strong.) 

So to sum up, the verb SABER means “to know” or “to taste.” To distinguish between the two meanings, pay attention to the context and remember that at times you’ll have to use the Spanish prepositions A or DE to be grammatically correct.
Extra tip:
The nouns SABOR (flavor) and OLOR (smell) sometimes require the use of the preposition A. Here's what you need to know:

When you are referring to a specific smell or flavor: sabor / olor + a + noun.

But you don't need the preposition "a"  if you follow  the noun with an adjective: sabor / olor + adjective.
  sabor a chocolate (chocolate flavored) but sabor dulce (sweet taste)
sabor a cebolla (onion flavored) but sabor ácido (sour taste, acidic taste)
olor a humo (smells of smoke, smells smokey) but olor terrible (horrible smell)
 
olor a canela (smells like cinnamon) but olor increíble (incredible smell)
The Spanish preposition A is also paired with the verb OLER (to smell). For example: Tu pelo huele a tabaco. (Your hair smells smokey, your hair smells of cigarette smoke.)
A funny way to say that something smells awful in Spanish is to say that it "huele a tigre" (smells like a tiger). 

OLER is an irregular verb that undergoes a spelling change to the letter "h" in the present tense: huelo (I smell) hueles (you smell), huele (he smells), etc.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Soler</strong></em> is a unique verb in Spanish because it can’t be used in all verb tenses. In linguistics, it’s what is called a defective verb. That means it can’t be conjugated and used in all verb tenses. In the case of soler, its defect is is that it can’t be used in the preterite, future, conditional or imperative tenses.</p>
<p>Another unique aspect of soler is that it has no direct English equivalent. There is no one-word verb in English which has the exact meaning that soler has in Spanish. If you look in an English-Spanish dictionary, you will see &#8220;to be in the habit of&#8221; or &#8220;used to&#8221; or  given as definitions of soler in English.</p>
<p>Here’s all you need to know about soler. It’s a verb that you use in Spanish to indicate that an action is routine or an activity is habitual. In English we would resort to using the adverbs &#8220;usually&#8221; or &#8220;generally&#8221;  to convey the same meaning.</p>
<p>In the present tense, soler is used to refer to current actions which are routine or habitual.<br />
In the past tense, soler is used to refer to past habitual or routine actions.</p>
<p>Also, soler is always, always, always followed by the infinitive of another verb which represents the routine action. (The formula is: SOLER + INFINITIVE of another verb = habitual action)</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #000080;">Cuando Daniel era pequeño, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">solía comer</span> pasteles de barro. Creía que eran chocolate.</span></em></strong> When Daniel was little, he would eat (was in the habit of eating) mud pies. He thought they were chocolate.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #000080;">¿A qué hora <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sueles acostarte</span>? </span></em></strong>What time do you usually go to bed?</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solía acostarme</span> temprano pero ahora <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suelo dormir</span> menos de cinco horas cada noche.</span></em></strong> (I used to go to bed early but now I usually sleep less than five hours every night.)</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #000080;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suelo ir</span> al gimnasio tres veces a la semana y <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suelo dar</span> un paseo en el parque con mi perro todos los días.</span></strong></em> (I usually go to the gym 3x a week and I usually take a walk in the park with my dog every day.)</p>
<p>Soler can also be used  in the subjunctive just like any other normal Spanish verb.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><em><strong>Espero que el tren <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suela llegar</span> a tiempo porque tengo prisa.</strong></em></span> (I hope the train usually arrives on time because I&#8217;m in a hurry.)</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Me sorprende que Antonio <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suela salir</span> con chicas tan bobas porque es un hombre muy culto. </span></strong></em>(It surprises me that Antonio usually goes out with such bimbos because he&#8217;s a very cultured, well-educated man.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong><em>No creo que los famosos de Hollywood <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suelan cenar</span> en este restaurante tan cutre y sucio.</em></strong></span> (I don&#8217;t believe that Hollywood celebs generally dine in this tacky, dirty restaurant.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got a special request from Mike Daye, aka <a href="http://twitter.com/evilpundit" target="_self">@EvilPundit</a>, one of my people on Twitter, for an explanation of the Spanish prepositions EN and SOBRE, so here goes.</p>
<p><em><strong>“EN” </strong></em>is a frequently-used preposition. It can be translated with various meanings in English such as<strong> in, by, at</strong>, or <strong>on</strong>, depending on the context.</p>
<p>Here’s a break down on when to use <em><strong>EN</strong></em> in Spanish. Obviously, there may be exceptions but this will give you some basic guidelines.</p>
<h2>To indicate location</h2>
<p><em>Vivo en una ciudad</em>. (I live in a city.)</p>
<p><em>Busca en ese cajón</em>. (Look in that drawer.)</p>
<p><em>Hoy me quedo en casa porque no me encuentro bien</em>. (Today I’m staying at home because I don’t feel well.)</p>
<h2>To place something in a time frame or time period</h2>
<p><em>Ernest Hemingway nació en el siglo XIX</em>. (Hemingway was born in the 19th-century.)</p>
<p><em>Acabaré en una hora</em>. (I’ll finish in an hour.)</p>
<h2>With movement verbs and modes of transportation</h2>
<p><em>Vine en taxi. (</em>I came by taxi.) <em>Me encanta viajar en tren</em>. (I love traveling by train.)</p>
<h2>To indicate what a topic or subject is about</h2>
<p><em>Pienso en ti. </em>(I’m thinking about you.) <em>Luis es experto en artes marciales</em>. (Luis is an expert in martial arts.)</p>
<p>“EN” is also used in fixed expressions like “en voz alta” (in a loud voice), “en vez de” (instead of), “en medio de” (in the middle of), etc.</p>
<p><strong>The only possible overlap in meaning between EN and SOBRE is with location.</strong> However, sobre is used to indicate a more precise location, a position that is above something else, while en is used with a more general meaning of location.</p>
<h2>Think of <em>“sobre”</em> as the equivalent of<em> “encima de”</em> (on top of).</h2>
<p><em>“Deja las llaves sobre la mesilla.</em>” [ Leave the keys on the nightstand (on top of the nightstand).]</p>
<p><em>Chicos, por favor, no pongáis los pies sobre la mesa.</em> [Guys, please, don’t put your feet on the table (on top of the table).]</p>
<p><em>Las cajas están colocadas unas sobre otras.</em> (The boxes are stacked on top of one another.)</p>
<p><em>Eduardo está muy agobiado. Son demasaidas las responsabilides que recaen sobre él</em>. [Eduardo is very stressed out. He’s got too many obligations weighing him down. (Literal  translation: “…that are falling on top of him.”)]</p>
<p><strong><em>Sobre </em>also has the meaning of “about” in Spanish</strong>. The preposition<em> “acerca de”</em> has the same meaning.</p>
<p><em>Tenemos que hablar sobre lo que pasó ayer.  Tenemos que hablar acerca de lo que pasó ayer</em>. (We have to talk about what happened yesterday.)<br />
<em></em></p>
<p><em> ¿Qué sabes tú sobre este asunto?</em> What do you know about this topic?</p>
<p><em>Sobre </em>can also be used to give an approximation, what we’d translate in English as “around” or &#8220;around about.&#8221;</p>
<p><em> Ayer llamé a tu casa sobre las seis de la tarde. ¿Dónde estabas? (</em>I called you around 6 p.m. yesterday. Where were you?)</p>
<p><em>Sobre</em> is a bit of a weird preposition because in addition to being a preposition, it is also a noun (which means “envelope”), but it’s always obvious, from the context, when it is being used as a noun. <em>Necesito comprar un sobre para enviar esa carta. (</em>I need to buy an envelope in order to send that letter.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How many times have you heard or read a Spanish expression and then consulted a dictionary for its meaning and turned up empty? Maybe you found the answer right away. But perhaps there have been a few occasions where it took a little bit of digging to find the definition.</p>
<p>There is an easy way to uncover the meanings of Spanish idioms and expressions and you can do it by using a monolingual (Spanish-only) dictionary. Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<p>Always look up the meaning of an expression by checking the dictionary entry for the first noun mentioned in the expression. The reason? A Spanish verb is more likely than a Spanish noun to be used in multiple expressions. For example, the verbs <em>dar, estar, ir, tener</em>, are used in plenty of Spanish phrases and expressions. An excellent Spanish dictionary will list expressions that contain those verbs, but if there are numerous expressions, most dictionaries usually only list the most commonly-used ones. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re better off looking for the definition of a Spanish expression by first checking the entry for the main noun mentioned.</p>
<p>Spanish expressions (<em>frases hechas</em>) are combinations of words whose meaning adds up to something very different from their individual parts.</p>
<p>Take, for example, an expression like <em><strong>&#8220;ir al grano.&#8221;</strong></em> The verb<em> ir</em> means &#8220;to go&#8221; while the noun <em>grano</em> can be a seed, a grain of sand or a pimple on somebody&#8217;s face. But when <em>ir</em> is added to <em>grano</em> <em>(ir al grano)</em> the meaning changes from a literal translation to a figurative one.<em> </em></p>
<p>When I checked the dictionary under <em>&#8220;IR&#8221;</em> there was no definition for the expression. But when I checked<em> &#8220;GRANO&#8221;,</em> there was the expression with its meaning<em>. Ir al grano</em> means &#8220;to get to the point.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, to recap, here&#8217;s a step-by-step process you can use to find the definition of a Spanish expression.</p>
<p>Step 1: First, look up the primary NOUN</p>
<p>Step 2: If there is no noun, look up the VERB.</p>
<p>Step 3: If there is no verb, look up the ADJECTIVE.</p>
<p>Step 4:  If there is no adjective, look up the PRONOUN.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you won&#8217;t have to go down that entire scale. You will usually find your definition by first looking up the noun or the verb. Usually the first two steps (checking the noun or the verb listed in the expression) is enough.</p>
<p>By the way, I strongly believe that once you reach an intermediate-level of Spanish, you should start using a Spanish-only dictionary. Why? A monolingual dictionary usually gives a more comprehensive definition. A good monolingual dictionary will also give you examples as well as multiple definitions. The average bilingual dictionary, because it contains two different languages, generally does not have the space, if it is in book form, to offer the same level of detail.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some electronic or online bilingual dictionaries which are excellent, but another advantage to using a monolingual dictionary is that it forces you to think in Spanish. That means less translating in your head, which is a good thing.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my 2010 New Year&#8217;s Resolutions is to expand my Spanish vocabulary. In the past, I&#8217;ve made a mental note or jotted down new, interesting words in my trusty Moleskine notebook. But in recent weeks I&#8217;ve come across some real gems and decided I would start tweeting a Spanish word daily.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll still be tweeting Spanish verbs over <a href="http://twitter.com/reverbspanish" target="_self">@ReVerbSpanish</a>, but now you can add <a href="http://twitter.com/spanishwordz" target="_self">@SpanishWordz</a> to the mix.</p>
<p>Why the spelling “<a href="http://twitter.com/spanishwordz" target="_self"><strong>Spanish Wordz</strong></a>”?</p>
<p>Because <em>“Spanish Words”</em>, <em>“Spanish Word”</em>, “<em>Palabras”,</em> and <em>“Spanish Vocab”</em> were all already taken on Twitter. <img src='http://www.reverbspanish.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>The plan is to tweet Spanish words that hopefully you aren’t too familiar with. I know what you must be thinking&#8230;.ANOTHER Spanish Word of the Day stream on Twitter?! Yes, I know there are already plenty of these &#8220;Spanish Word Of the Day&#8221; tweets on Twitter. But most of them are focused on very basic Spanish words. Perro= dog. Lunes = Monday. Comer = to eat.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s great for beginners or people who need a refresher, but what about those of us who already have the basics down pat and want to keep progressing?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to stretch yourself, especially if you’ve been studying Spanish awhile and are at an intermediate or advanced level. Get out of the habit of using the same basic Spanish words over and over again.</p>
<p>For example, you may use the word “amigo,” even in situations where it may not be the best choice. In English, we have words like colleague, coworker, acquaintance, roommate, neighbor, buddy. Why not learn the Spanish equivalents and deposit them into your Spanish memory bank?</p>
<p>Even if your accent speaking Spanish isn’t perfect, using more sophisticated words in Spanish will go a long way to making you sound more fluent.</p>
<p>There won’t be any overall theme or specific reason why certain words get posted on particular days. They will just be words that strike me as interesting and unusual. Often they will be words that I’ve noticed in the news that I think might help folks expand their Spanish vocab past the usual common Spanish 101 words. If you&#8217;re studying Spanish in college or in high school taking Advanced Placement Spanish, some of these vocab words may come in handy.</p>
<p>I will post at least one Spanish word daily. On some days I may post more than one. But there will always be at least one new word posted everyday. I’m commited to doing this every day for the next 365 days. After that, who knows?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been studying Spanish awhile, you probably already know plenty about  the Spanish verbs SER and ESTAR. But did you know that there are several adjectives that change their meaning, depending on which one of those verbs they’re attached to?</p>
<p>For example, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>estar aburrido</em></span> vs.<strong><em> </em></strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">ser aburrido</span></em> is the difference between being bored or being boring!</p>
<p>The very general rule of thumb is that we use SER + an adjective is for permanent, intrinsic characteristics while ESTAR is for temporary changes or changes that have come as the result of some kind of process. However, there are circumstances where it&#8217;s not 100% clear to non-native Spanish speakers how the meaning of some adjectives change when paired with SER or ESTAR.</p>
<p>For example, <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>estar muerto</em></span> vs. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>ser muerto</em></span>. <em>Muerto</em> means &#8220;dead&#8221; and often English speakers have the tendency to want to use the verb <em>ser</em> with this adjective. However, when referring to the physical state of being dead, of being six feet under, you must use the verb <em>estar.</em> <em><span style="color: #000000;">Ser (un) muerto</span></em> means to be a bore, a dud.  Same deal with <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>estar vivo</em></span> (to be physically alive, as in living and breathing) vs. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>ser vivo</em></span> (to be very clever, mentally bright, etc.)</p>
<p>There are some Spanish adjectives that can be paired with SER and ESTAR and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not change meaning</span>. Interestingly enough, they are adjectives that have to do with one&#8217;s relationship status. Adjectives such as <em>casado</em> (married), <em>soltero</em> (single) and<em> viudo </em>(widowed).  So regardless of whether somebody  <em>&#8220;está casado&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;es casado,</em>&#8221; they both mean the same thing &#8211; that the person is married.</p>
<p>There are a ton of these kinds of adjectives. That&#8217;s why I’ve put together <strong>a list of 33 of these Spanish adjectives</strong>, along with their different meanings, in one handy printout. You can get your copy of &#8220;Spanish Shapeshifters&#8221; by signing up for my email list in the righthand column of this blog. Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s <em>gratis. </em></p>

		<itunes:summary>If you’ve been studying Spanish awhile, you probably already know plenty about  the Spanish verbs SER and ESTAR. But did you know that there are several adjectives that change their meaning, depending on which one of those verbs they’re attached to?

For example, estar aburrido vs. ser aburrido is the difference between being bored or being boring!

The very general rule of thumb is that we use SER + an adjective is for permanent, intrinsic characteristics while ESTAR is for temporary changes or changes that have come as the result of some kind of process. However, there are circumstances where it's not 100% clear to non-native Spanish speakers how the meaning of some adjectives change when paired with SER or ESTAR.

For example, estar muerto vs. ser muerto. Muerto means "dead" and often English speakers have the tendency to want to use the verb ser with this adjective. However, when referring to the physical state of being dead, of being six feet under, you must use the verb estar. Ser (un) muerto means to be a bore, a dud.  Same deal with estar vivo (to be physically alive, as in living and breathing) vs. ser vivo (to be very clever, mentally bright, etc.)

There are some Spanish adjectives that can be paired with SER and ESTAR and not change meaning. Interestingly enough, they are adjectives that have to do with one's relationship status. Adjectives such as casado (married), soltero (single) and viudo (widowed).  So regardless of whether somebody  "está casado" or "es casado," they both mean the same thing - that the person is married.

There are a ton of these kinds of adjectives. That's why I’ve put together a list of 33 of these Spanish adjectives, along with their different meanings, in one handy printout.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The definitions of these two verbs are clear in any dictionary: VER means &#8220;to see&#8221; while MIRAR is defined as &#8220;to look at&#8221; or &#8220;to watch&#8221;</p>
<p>That may lead some English speakers who are studying Spanish to say things like  <em>&#8220;Miro la tele&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;Me gusta mirar películas&#8221;</em> in Spanish. This is incorrect. In Spanish, use VER when referring to the act of watching TV, movies or sports.</p>
<h2>VER</h2>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><em>A Juan le encanta ver los dibujos animados.</em></span></strong> Juan loves to watch cartoons.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em><strong>Me gusta ver el tenís.</strong></em></span> I like to watch tennis.</p>
<p>Of course, VER is also used in the general sense of seeing:</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #008000;">¡Nos vemos pronto!</span></strong> </em>See you soon! (Literally: We see each other soon.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em><strong>Anoche el niño vio una fantasma.</strong></em></span> Last night the boy saw a ghost.</p>
<h2>MIRAR</h2>
<p>&#8230;can also can be translated as &#8220;to watch&#8221; but more in the context of looking at someone or something with intention. Personally, I prefer the translation &#8220;to look at,&#8221; that way you avoid any confusion with VER.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Este café es un buen lugar para mirar a la gente.</span></em></strong> This café is a great place to people watch/to look at people.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">¡Oye! ¿Qué miras? ¡¿Tengo monos en la cara?!</span></em></strong> Hey! What are you looking at?!</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>No, tranquila. <strong>Estoy mirando la araña</strong> que trepa por tu hombro. </em></span> No, calm down. I&#8217;m looking at (I&#8217;m watching) the spider climbing your shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Tener monos en la cara&#8221;</em> is a very funny expression used in Spain. Literally, it means &#8220;Do I have monkeys on my face?&#8221; and it is a testy way of  asking somebody what the heck they are looking at when they are staring at you.</p>
<p>Anyway, regarding MIRAR, it is a bit more literary than VER since it a verb that means to observe or to contemplate. For example, there is a difference in meaning between  <em>&#8220;ves las estrellas&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;miras las estrellas.</em>&#8221; The first phrase <em>(ves las estrellas)</em> references the general act of seeing the stars. You have eyes so you can see the stars. The second phrase <em>(miras las estrellas)</em> suggests viewing with intention or focus or with great interest. You look at the stars&#8230;.leading you to contemplate the vastness of the universe&#8230;.</p>

A). That it is pretty brand new (only about a month old) and&#8230;<br />
B). That I don&#8217;t post entries on it daily.</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, there is a lot I want to share with you about Spanish verbs but some of it really doesn&#8217;t warrant a 400+ word blog entry.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where <a title="ReVerb Spanish on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/reverbspanish" target="_self">Twitter</a> comes in. Twitter is a web site where people can post very short messages on all sorts of topics. It&#8217;s like a blog but with entries that are extremely brief.  There is a 140-character limit per entry, and that includes punctuation marks and spaces!</p>
<p>Twitter is a great platform for ReVerb Spanish because you can get more helpful tips about different Spanish verbs without having to wade through lengthy explanations. In fact, it’s an efficient way for me to address some verbs that are interesting but maybe don’t have enough meat to devote an entire podcast to them.</p>
<p>Wondering what kinds of things I’m putting on Twitter? Here’s a sampling of a few verbs that were the focus in some recent “tweets.” (You&#8217;ll have to visit the <a href="http://twitter.com/reverbspanish" target="_self">ReVerb Spanish Twitter page</a> to get the answers to these riddles.)</p>
<p><em><strong>Armarse un lío</strong></em> vs. <strong><em>Hacerse un lío</em></strong>: They both mean trouble but in different ways.</p>
<p><em><strong>Estar a cargo de</strong></em> vs. <em><strong>Hacerse cargo de</strong></em>: Who’s the boss between those two phrases?</p>
<p><em><strong>Alumbrar</strong></em> vs. <strong><em>Deslumbrar</em></strong>: Shine some light on two similar verbs</p>
<p><em><strong>Callarse la boca</strong></em> vs <em><strong>Cerrarle la boca:</strong></em> It&#8217;s the difference between keeping one’s mouth shut or causing someone to shut theirs! <img src='http://www.reverbspanish.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>As you can see, it’s a little bit of everything. But the focus is solely on explaining to you the nuances of Spanish verbs and verb phrases that are not only useful for you to know but also a lot of fun to use!</p>
<p>I post items over there more frequently than I do on this blog, so if you ever miss me (<em>si me echas de menos</em>) and wonder what I&#8217;ve been up to, you can find me twittering away at <a href="http://twitter.com/reverbspanish" target="_self">Twitter.com/ReVerbSpanish</a>.  If you feel like it, sign up for your own Twitter account and we can also communicate with one another that way.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="western">It may seem odd, but the verb ANDAR, which literally means “to walk” can be used as a replacement verb for ESTAR, which means “to be.”</p>
<p class="western">A common expression in Spanish is <em>¿Qué tal andamos?</em> or <em>¿Cómo andamos?</em></p>
<p class="western">In English that is translated as “How are we doing?&#8221; or &#8220;What’s new?”</p>
<p class="western"><em>“¿Cómo andamos?”</em> is just another way of asking <em>&#8220;¿Cómo estás?”</em></p>
<p class="western">But <span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>¿<span style="color: #0000ff;">Cómo andamos?</span></em></span><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span><em>es muy informal</em>. That means it’s a very casual phrase you would typically use with people you know, like friends and family. It’s not an expression that you would use in a formal setting, for example, on a job interview. You wouldn’t greet the job interviewer with the line <em>¿Cómo andamos?</em> but rather <em>¿Cómo está usted? </em></p>
<p class="western">
<p>So, how do you know when it’s OK to use ANDAR as a substitute for ESTAR? Fortunately, there are some specific rules to this.</p>
<h2>ANDAR + a gerund</h2>
<p>Click <a title="Spanish gerunds vs. English gerunds" href="http://www.reverbspanish.com/spanish-gerunds-vs-english-gerunds/" target="_self">here for an explanation</a> of what a gerund is.</p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western">
<p class="western">Normally, a Spanish gerund is paired with the verb ESTAR. In English, we say, &#8220;I am working&#8221; and, in Spanish that would be “Estoy trabajando.”</p>
<p class="western"><span id="more-295"></span></p>
<p class="western">If we change <em>“estoy trabajando”</em> to <span style="color: #008000;"><em>“ando trabajando,”</em></span> we’re giving an additional piece of information. Why? Because the formula &#8220;ANDAR + a gerund&#8221; is a way to talk about a habitual action. A repeated action. Or you can think of it as an action that has become a custom or something that happens with regularity.</p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western">Consider the following examples:</p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western"><em><span style="color: #008000;">Estoy muy cansada. En las últimas semanas, <strong>ando durmiendo</strong> menos de seis horas.</span></em> (I am so tired. In the last few weeks, I’ve been sleeping less than six hours.)</p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western">
<p class="western"><span style="color: #008000;"><em>¡Qué cómic tan chulo! Voy a comprarlo para mi sobrino que <strong>anda coleccionándolos</strong> desde hace meses.</em></span> (Wow! What a cool comic book! I’m going to buy it for my nephew who has been collecting them for a few months now.)</p>
<p class="western">
<h2 class="western">ANDAR + past participle</h2>
<p class="western">
<p class="western">
<p class="western">Another situation in which ANDAR can be used as a subsitute for ESTAR is when you want to indicate a situation or a state of being that has being going on for a while.</p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western">
<p class="western"><em>¡Mamá! ¿Qué le pasa a Papá? ¿Por qué está tan triste?</em></p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western"><em>Bueno, hija, es que <strong><span style="color: #008000;">anda muy preocupado</span></strong> por la crisis economíca. Cree que va a perder su trabajo.</em></p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western">As you can see with this example, the speaker could also have said <em>“está muy preocupado</em>. The dfference here is that using ANDAR adds another layer of meaning to that state of being worried. The verb<em> andar</em>, in this case, conveys the idea that the person who is worried, <em>la persona que anda preocupada</em>, has been worried for a while.</p>
<h2 class="western">ANDAR + adjective</h2>
<p class="western">
<p class="western"><em>Mira! Desde que le tocó la lotería, Javier <strong><span style="color: #008000;">anda muy contento</span></strong>.</em></p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western">[Wow, would you look at that! Since he won the lottery, Javier is very happy (has been very happy).]</p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western">Again, you could’ve said, <em>Javier está muy contento</em>, in this situation and that would&#8217;ve been 100% correct. But saying <em>Javier anda muy contento</em>, conveys the idea that his state of happiness has become a frequent state of being for Javier. In other words, a habit.</p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western">Ok, well, I think that’s about it for ANDAR vs ESTAR. There are some other cool ways to use ANDAR.</p>
<h2 class="western">Anda, ¡Anda ya!</h2>
<p class="western"><em><strong>Anda</strong></em>, an imperative form of the verb, is used frequently in Castilian Spanish as a way of expressing disbelief, surprise, fear, sarcasm or disgust. It can also be used to encourage somebody.  <em><strong><span style="color: #008000;">¡Anda!</span></strong></em> or <span style="color: #008000;"><em><strong>¡Anda ya!</strong></em></span> have fluid meanings that depend on the tone of voice and the situation. The translation in English can mean &#8220;come on&#8221; or &#8220;yeah, right&#8221; or &#8220;gosh&#8221; or &#8220;gimme a break&#8221;, etc.</p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western"><em>Tranquila, <strong><span style="color: #008000;">¡anda</span></strong>, no llores más! (Calm down, come on, don&#8217;t cry any more!)<br />
</em></p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western"><em><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>¡Anda ya!</strong></span></em> <em>¡No digas tonterías!</em> (Come on! Get off it! Don&#8217;t say stupid things!)</p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western">Other examples con<strong><span style="color: #008000;"> <em>¡anda!</em></span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #008000;"><em>¡Anda que no he tenido que trabajar tanto en la vida!</em></span> (Gosh, I&#8217;ve never had to work so hard in my life!)</p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western"><span style="color: #008000;"><em>¡Anda, que como se entere mi padre!</em> </span>(Oh boy, wait until my dad finds out!)</p>
<p class="western">
<p class="western">
<p class="western">As you can see, the verb ANDAR is very versatile. There&#8217;s one other usage of ANDAR but use it very carefully. <span style="color: #008000;"><em>Andáte con cuidado</em></span> means &#8220;be careful&#8221; but it is generally considered a warning or a threat. So don&#8217;t use this as your closing remark in an email! When you want to be friendly and thoughtful the equivalent of  &#8220;take care&#8221; or &#8220;be careful&#8221;  in Spanish is &#8220;<em>ten cuidado</em>&#8221; (tú)  or <em>&#8220;tenga cuidado&#8221;</em> (usted).</p>

		<itunes:summary>It may seem odd, but the verb ANDAR, which literally means “to walk” can be used as a replacement verb for ESTAR, which means “to be.”
A common expression in Spanish is ¿Qué tal andamos? or ¿Cómo andamos?
In English that is translated as “How are we doing?" or "What’s new?”
“¿Cómo andamos?” is just another way of asking "¿Cómo estás?”
But ¿Cómo andamos? es muy informal. That means it’s a very casual phrase you would typically use with people you know, like friends and family. It’s not an expression that you would use in a formal setting, for example, on a job interview. You wouldn’t greet the job interviewer with the line ¿Cómo andamos? but rather ¿Cómo está usted?

¡Anda ya! ¡No digas tonterías! (Come on! Get off it! Don't say stupid things!)

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Spanish, gerunds are used to refer to an action in progress. There are 3 distinct gerund endings.  I know what I said in the <strong><a title="Andar podcast" href="http://www.reverbspanish.com/andar-vs-estar" target="_self">&#8220;Andar vs. Estar&#8221;</a></strong> podcast but I was trying to keep things super simple. <img src='http://www.reverbspanish.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<h3>The Spanish gerund endings are:</h3>
<p><strong>-ando</strong> (for verbs that end in -ar)</p>
<p><strong>-iendo</strong> (for verbs that end in -er or -ir)</p>
<p><strong>-yendo</strong> (A few -er and -ir verbs use this ending)</p>
<p>A gerund is used in both the present continuous and past continuous tenses. It is a way to emphasize an action that is happening in the moment.<em> <span style="color: #008000;">Estoy leyendo</span> </em>(I am reading). <em><span style="color: #008000;">Estaba leyendo</span></em> (I was reading).</p>
<p>To be more precise, the Spanish phrase <em>&#8220;estoy leyendo&#8221;</em> means &#8220;I am reading (right now)&#8221; while <em>&#8220;yo estaba leyendo</em>&#8221; means &#8220;I was reading (right then, at that very moment in the past).&#8221;</p>
<p>In English, we tend to use the -ing form a lot. In fact, English uses the continuous tense (also called the progressive tense) more frequently than Spanish does. As a result, it is very common for English speakers to use this form excessively when they speak Spanish.</p>
<p><span id="more-281"></span></p>
<p>For example, it is very common and normal to hear someone in English say &#8220;I am learning Spanish.&#8221; The speaker of this sentence is  just making a general statement. He is not necessarily saying that he is learning Spanish in that very moment.</p>
<p>However, in Spanish, it sounds kind of odd to say <em>&#8220;Estoy aprendiendo español&#8221; </em> UNLESS you want to emphasize that you are studying Spanish at that very moment.</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s not the case, it&#8217;s more typical and correct in Spanish to say<em> <span style="color: #008000;">&#8220;Aprendo español</span>,</em>&#8221; which in English can be translated as  &#8220;I learn Spanish&#8221; or  &#8220;I am learning Spanish.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Spanish, the continuous/progressive tense generally implies a longer duration or repetition of the verbal action. In English, however, we tend to use the -ing form when referring to brief actions or things that are going to happen in the near future.</p>
<p>Here are some common examples where it is natural to go with the -ing form in English but in Spanish you would stick with the present tense.</p>
<p>English: Who are you talking to? With whom are you speaking?</p>
<p>Spanish: <em>¿Con quién hablas?</em> (present tense)</p>
<p>English: What are you doing?</p>
<p>Spanish:<em> ¿Qué haces? </em></p>
<p>English: I&#8217;m coming back tonight.</p>
<p>Spanish: <em>Vuelvo esta noche. </em></p>
<p>There are some other key differences between the Spanish gerund and the English gerund. In English, a gerund <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">can also be used as </span>is a noun. For example:  &#8220;Walking is great exercise.&#8221;  The word &#8220;walking&#8221; is a verbal noun.</p>
<p>In Spanish, we create a verbal noun by using the infinitive (the unconjugated form of the verb) not by using its gerund.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Caminar</strong> es excelente para la salud</span> = </em><strong>Walking</strong> is great for your health</p>
<p>NOT <em>Caminando es excelente para la salud</em>.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;">No fumar</span></strong><span style="color: #008000;"> aquí</span><span style="color: #008000;">.</span> (No smoking allowed.)  NOT <em>No fumando aquí.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008000;"><em>Do</em></span></strong><em><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>rmir</strong> es mi actividad favorita</span> </em>(Sleeping is my favorite activity)<em> </em>NOT<em> Durmiendo es mi actividad favorita.</em></p>
<p><strong>Other<em> </em>scenarios</strong> in which the -ing form that we use in English requires the infinitive in Spanish:</p>
<p>With a verb that expresses likes and dislikes: <em>Odio nadar en agua fría</em>. (I hate swimming in cold water.)</p>
<p>With some prepositions: <em>El cocinero se lava las manos antes de hacer la comida.</em> (The cook washes his hands before making the meal.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">But on the flip side, there are times when the Spanish gerund doesn&#8217;t correspond to the English -ing form.</span></p>
<p><strong>TIME</strong> (to show two parallel actions)</p>
<p><em>Estando en España, hablo español</em>. (While I am Spain, I speak Spanish.)</p>
<p><strong>CAUSE</strong> (to indicate a major circumstance)</p>
<p><em>Siendo presidente, Barack Obama tiene más responsiblidades que nunca</em>. (Since he is president, Barack Obama has more responsibilities than ever.)</p>
<p><strong>MANNER</strong> (to show the way in which an action takes place)</p>
<p><em>El perro entra corriendo cuando oye el silbato.</em> (The dog runs inside when he hears the whistle.)</p>
<p>In Spanish, a gerund is typically attached to the verb ESTAR but there are other Spanish verbs that can be paired with a gerund. <a href="http://www.reverbspanish.com/andar-vs-estar" target="_self">This week&#8217;s podcast</a> talks about one of them -  the verb ANDAR. In a future episode, I will mention some other verbs that can replace ESTAR in the continuous/progessive tense formula (ESTAR + a gerund).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everything that I’ve told you about <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">CONOCER</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: #008000;">SABER</span></strong> in <a title="Conocer vs. Saber, present tense" href="http://www.reverbspanish.com/conocer-vs-saber/" target="_self">an earlier post</a> was related to the present tense of these verbs. When you use these verbs in the preterite past tense (<em>el pretérito indefinido)</em> and the imperfect past tense (<em>el pretérito imperfecto)</em> their meanings change once again.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the distinction between the preterite and the imperfect past tenses in Spanish? The preterite past tense is used for  &#8220;terminated actions&#8221; in the past. That means actions that started and ended at a specific point in the past. The imperfect past tense is used for describing actions in the past. This is an extremely simplified definition. There are numerous chapters in grammar books written on the subject of Spanish past tenses, so I don&#8217;t want this one particular 400-word blog entry to get bogged down. Suffice it to say that the imperfect past tense in Spanish is used for descriptions, for narration, for talking about an ongoing state of being or feeling in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Conocer </strong>in the preterite tense generally is translated as “met,” as in the first time you met someone. If you use the preterite with a thing or a place, you&#8217;re emphasizing that moment of initial contact in the past.</p>
<p>For example:  <em><strong>¿Conoces a Miguel? </strong></em>Do you know Miguel?<em><strong> Sí, lo conozco. Lo conocí anoche</strong></em>.   Yes, I know him. (I know who he is. I am acquainted with him.) I met him last night.</p>
<p><strong>Conocer </strong>in the imperfect past tense means &#8220;knew,&#8221; but in the sense of used to know, used to be familiar with someone or something. Conocía ese restaurante cuando vivía en Barcelona. I used to know that restaurant (I was familiar with that restuarant) when I was living in Barcelona.</p>
<p><strong>Saber</strong>, in the preterite tense, means &#8220;knew&#8221; or  &#8220;found out.&#8221;<br />
Let’s say that you’re talking to a friend who asks you if you heard that a mutual acquaintance of yours has gotten engaged. This is old news to you because you heard about the engagement before. So in Spanish you would say, <em><strong>Sí, ya lo sé. Lo supe ayer</strong></em>. (Yes, I already know. I found out [I heard] about it yesterday.)</p>
<p>In the imperfect past tense, <strong>saber</strong> still means  &#8220;knew&#8221; but in a more general, descriptive sense. You can also translate it as &#8220;used to know.&#8221; For example: <em>Cuando yo era niña, sabía tocar al piano</em>.  When I was a kid, I knew how to play the piano. I used to know how to play the piano.</p>
<p>A general rule of thumb that, while not 100% foolproof, will help you out the majority of the time:</p>
<p>If the action of knowing is something that can be pinned down to a specific period of time in the past: Use the preterite tense.</p>
<p>If the state of knowing is being described in the past: Use the imperfect tense.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Both of these verbs mean &#8220;to know&#8221; in Spanish. However they are not exact synonyms. That means they are not verbs that can be used interchangeably.  Since knowledge is power, which one of these verbs is king? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<p><strong>Conocer</strong> is intangible knowledge in the sense of to be familiar with someone or something. Use this verb with people, places and things.<br />
Example:<em><strong> ¿Usted conoce Madrid?</strong></em> Do you know Madridl? <em><strong> ¿Conoces a Felipe?</strong></em> Do you know Phillip? Are you acquainted with Phillip?  <em><strong>¿Conoce usted ese café?</strong></em> Do you know that café? Are you familiar with that cafe?</p>
<p><strong>Saber</strong>, meanwhile, means to know a fact, to have specific knowledge about something.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p><strong><em>¿Sabes a qué hora empieza la película?</em></strong> Do you know what time the movie starts? <em><strong> ¿Sabes el título de la película? ¿Sabe María mi nombre?</strong></em> Do you know the title of the movie? Does Mary know my name?</p>
<p>You can get additional mileage out of <em>saber</em> by adding an infinitive to it. An infinitive is an unconjugated verb. Here is the formula for saying “to know how” to do something in Spanish. <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Saber + infinitve = to know how (in English)</span></strong></p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p><strong><em>¿Sabe cocinar tu compañero de piso? (Does your roommate know how to cook? </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><br />
<span style="color: #0000ff;">Sí, él sabe cocinar. (Yes, he knows how to cook.) </span></em></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Notice that this construction in Spanish doesn&#8217;t require the adverb &#8220;<em>cómo</em>&#8221; (how).</span><br />
</span></p>
<p>So, to summarize, <em>conocer</em> and <em>saber</em> both mean “to know” but with distinct usages.<br />
Use <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>CONOCER</strong></span> when referring to people, places or things that you know or are familiar with. Use <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>SABER</strong></span> when referring to facts, information, specific know-how.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> Here is how to get the most out of the ReVerb Spanish audio verb drills: </strong><br />
1. First listen to the audio of Marie Soleil reading the verb conjugations and repeat the conjugations out loud. While you are doing this, do not read or look at the conjugations written down. The idea is to get your mind accustomed to hearing the sound of the conjugated verb and then saying it aloud without first having to see it written.</p>
<p>2. Once you&#8217;ve listened to the audio drill at least once or twice, then look at the written form of the conjugated verb so that you can see and memorize the spelling. Do the audio drill again, this time reading and repeating the conjugated verb. A good online Spanish verb conjugator is available at Word Reference.com. Just type in the verb you need in the search box and once you land on that verb&#8217;s  page, click on &#8220;CONJUGATOR&#8221; to see a full table of conjugations for that specific verb.</p>
<p>Remember, you have to practice using these verbs for them to stick in your memory. Each audio verb drill is five minutes or less, so it doesn&#8217;t take much time for you to sneak in a little Spanish verb practice every single day. ¡Suerte! and Happy Re-Verberating! <img src='http://www.reverbspanish.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ReVerb Spanish Audio Verb Drills are a simple way for you to practice conjugating common Spanish verbs. For many people, remembering the correct form of the verb in the moment (is it <em>&#8220;yo fui&#8221;</em> or &#8220;<em>yo fue&#8221;</em>?) can be difficult because they don&#8217;t know the conjugations by heart.</p>
<p>Here is the basic format of the ReVerb Spanish audio verb drills:<br />
<strong>Parts 1 &amp; 2</strong>: Listen and repeat the verb conjugations given in the standard order (yo soy, tú eres, él es, ella es, usted es, nosotros somos, vosotros sois, ellos son, ellas son, ustedes son.)</p>
<p><strong>Part 3:</strong> Verb conjugations are given out of order. For example, with the present tense of the verb SER, you may hear a sequence such as <em>vosotros sois, yo soy, ustedes son</em>, etc. Listen and repeat.</p>
<p><strong>Part 4:</strong> Here&#8217;s where you test yourself.  We give you the pronoun and you have to give the correct form of the verb for that pronoun. For example, you&#8217;ll hear the pronoun <strong><em>&#8220;YO</em>&#8220;</strong> and then you are supposed to say the correct form of the verb for that Spanish pronoun. After a brief pause for each pronoun, you will hear the correct response so that you can check your answer.</p>
<p><strong>Part 5:</strong> Spanish audio verb drills for the Spanish subjunctive will include additional audio practice exercises of short phrases and sentences.</p>
<p><strong><em>A full selection of Spanish audio verb drills will be available after May 7, 2009. Subscribe to this blog&#8217;s RSS feed or Email list to get updated on when they are available. </em></strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-119 alignleft" title="reverbspanish_logo2b" src="http://www.reverbspanish.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/reverbspanish_logo2b-150x150.jpg" alt="reverbspanish_logo2b" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>Have you ever used a Spanish-English dictionary to look up a word only to discover later on that the meaning you found wasn’t quite accurate for the situation? In fact, it’s quite common for Spanish-English dictionaries to lead many language learners astray with definitions that are imprecise or misleading.</p>
<p>The classic example are the verbs <strong>SER</strong> and <strong>ESTAR</strong>. Both mean “to be” in Spanish but with a difference. Using these two verbs interchangeably can change the meaning of a sentence even though the standard dictionary says that both verbs are the Spanish equivalent of “to be” in English.</p>
<p>While SER and ESTAR are obvious examples, there are several other Spanish verbs which create similar problems, albeit on a smaller scale, for Spanish learners. For example, the verbs <em><strong>hacerse, ponerse, quedarse</strong></em> and <em><strong>volverse</strong></em> all mean “to become” in Spanish but they cannot be used interchangeably in Spanish. That’s because each one of these verbs has an additional layer of meaning that doesn’t always get explained properly in a typical dictionary.</p>
<p>So, that’s what the ReVerb Spanish blog and podcast are going to focus on – the nuances, the variations in meaning for verbs that appear to synonyms.</p>
<p>Neither the blog nor the podcast will teach you Spanish grammar. That’s not the point of this program. Instead it will be a supplement to your Spanish language studies.</p>
<p>In addition to the blog entries, there are also audio Spanish verb drills available. Listening to these audio exercises are a good way to practice your Spanish verb conjugations. If you’ve ever second guessed yourself or gotten tongue tied when trying to remember the correct form of some basic verbs, listening to these audio drills might help.  I’m only making a few basic verbs available initially. But if I get feedback indicating that there is strong demand for more audio verb drills, I will add more audio verb drills to the current collection.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Have you ever used a Spanish-English dictionary to look up a word only to discover later on that the meaning you found wasn’t quite accurate for the situation? In fact, it’s quite common for Spanish-English dictionaries to lead many language learners astray with definitions that are imprecise or misleading.
