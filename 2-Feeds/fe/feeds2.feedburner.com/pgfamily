&lt;p&gt;Board games have evolved and are much different now than the board games we grew up with.  You will  be surprised at how much fun the entire family will have; kids and adults.  Today we share a little bit of that evolution and how games have become even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made mention of a recent presentation by Liz Danforth and Don Dehm for the &lt;a href="http://azla.org/" title="Arizona Library Association" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona Library Association&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="http://blog.libraryjournal.com/gamesgamersgaming/2010/11/21/starter-kits-for-games/" title="Beyond Rock Band and Monopoly" target="_blank"&gt;Beyond Rock Band and Monopoly&lt;/a&gt;.  We also share a great related video by Scott Nicholson of Board Games with Scott entitled &lt;a href="http://www.boardgameswithscott.com/?p=403" title="Breaking Up the Monopoly" target="_blank"&gt;Breaking Up the Monopoly&lt;/a&gt;.  Even the title is clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s games include &lt;a href="http://mayfairgames.com/game.php?id=87&amp;amp;stock=MFG4104&amp;amp;name=Wacky+Wacky+West" title="Wacky Wacky West" target="_blank"&gt;Wacky Wacky West&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.mindware.com/p/Zenith/44003" title="Zenith" target="_blank"&gt;Zenith&lt;/a&gt;.  Enjoy the show!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stealth Education is the practice of presenting opportunities for learning and growth in a venue of entertainment in a way that makes the participants unaware or distracted from the educational intents.  That is just a fancy way of saying, kids don't know their learning.  They're just playing games.&lt;/p&gt;

This is an exciting game of table-top shuffleboard with a “Sorry” twist.  This is a game of dexterity and strategy that quickly became a hit with our crew.&lt;/td&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Its easy for everyone to go their separate ways after dinner.  Today we talk about the joy of keeping the family at the table with some great family games.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;a href="http://www.blundersmania.com" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/blundersmania_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/blunders.jpg" alt="Blunders" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
After discussion, we introduce you to the board game, &lt;a href="http://www.blundersmania.com" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/blundersmania_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Blunders&lt;/a&gt;.  This one was specifically designed to teach manners and etiquette to young children.  Topics range from table settings to just being nice.  The kids liked the completive nature of the game and came away learning a bit about being polite.






We then play the board game, &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/phalanx/pages/pha6019.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Emira&lt;/a&gt;.  This one is actually for an older crowd and a great one to play with neighbors and friends.  Attract the princesses to your estate that will best compliment your needs.  We had a great time playing with this ancient Middle Eastern Theme.
&lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/phalanx/pages/pha6019.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/emira.jpg" alt="Emira" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;






&lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3300-4499/pages/3303.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/dosrios.jpg" alt="Dos Rios" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Finally, we manipulate the hydrology and everyone effected in the board game, &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3300-4499/pages/3303.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Dos Rios&lt;/a&gt;.  Use your dams to move the river, and try to keep your people next to it.  This one was truly unique and a lot of fun.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of today's games are about apocalypse, but the real theme is about planning. Games encourage forethought and strategy.  This is a skill that has helped us all archive our goals on and away from the game table.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;a href="http://www.peginc.com/games.html" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/peginc_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/sticksandstones.jpg" alt="Sticks &amp;amp; Stones" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Our first look is at the card game, &lt;a href="http://www.peginc.com/games.html" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/peginc_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Sticks &amp;amp; Stones&lt;/a&gt;.  Use the cards in your hand to accomplish your quests.  Its about survival, diplomacy, beasts, shamans, and shiny rocks.  What you don't have yet is the ability to speak, save a few grunts.  This game got a lot of love around the table.






&lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/amigo/pages/asi5753.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Atlantis&lt;/a&gt; is sinking and you have to get your people off the island and carry as much treasure as you can on your way out.  As tiles are removed from the path, you really get the feel of the sinking bridge connecting you to safety.  Create holes for your opponents to cross, maximize every move, and balance that with a safe speed to claim victory.
&lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/amigo/pages/asi5753.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/atlantis.jpg" alt="Atlantis" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;






&lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/amigo/pages/asi5771.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/pompeii.jpg" alt="Pompeii" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
It is said that &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/amigo/pages/asi5771.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Pompeii&lt;/a&gt; was once a thriving city, but it had one fatal flaw.  It was under the shadow of a volcano.  The one that gets the most of their people out of the city wins.   Fist, you must populate the city with as many people as you can to maximize your chances.  The best part that everyone loved about this one is the actually physical volcano that comes with the board game and throwing your opponents pieces into it.






Then we all played with rubber bathtub ducks with the board game, &lt;a href="http://www.apegames.com/duck/duckduckgo.html" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/apegames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Duck Duck Go&lt;/a&gt;.  Use as much forethought and planning as you can, but you are going to be bouncing around the board and off of other ducks in the tub to archive your goal.  The ducks are adorable and collectible.  This one will be a sure-fire hit for many families.

      <itunes:subtitle>A couple of today's games are about apocalypse, but the real theme is about planning. Games encourage forethought and strategy.  This is a skill that has helped us all archive our goals on and away from the game table.     </itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>A couple of today's games are about apocalypse, but the real theme is about planning. Games encourage forethought and strategy.  This is a skill that has helped us all archive our goals on and away from the game table.



(http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/sticksandstones.jpg)
Our first look is at the card game, Sticks &amp; Stones (http://www.peginc.com/games.html).  Use the cards in your hand to accomplish your quests.  Its about survival, diplomacy, beasts, shamans, and shiny rocks.  What you don't have yet is the ability to speak, save a few grunts.  This game got a lot of love around the table.






Atlantis (http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/amigo/pages/asi5753.htm) is sinking and you have to get your people off the island and carry as much treasure as you can on your way out.  As tiles are removed from the path, you really get the feel of the sinking bridge connecting you to safety.  Create holes for your opponents to cross, maximize every move, and balance that with a safe speed to claim victory.
(http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/atlantis.jpg)






(http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/pompeii.jpg)
It is said that Pompeii (http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/amigo/pages/asi5771.htm) was once a thriving city, but it had one fatal flaw.  It was under the shadow of a volcano.  The one that gets the most of their people out of the city wins.   Fist, you must populate the city with as many people as you can to maximize your chances.  The best part that everyone loved about this one is the actually physical volcano that comes with the board game and throwing your opponents pieces into it.






Then we all played with rubber bathtub ducks with the board game, Duck Duck Go (http://www.apegames.com/duck/duckduckgo.html).  Use as much forethought and planning as you can, but you are going to be bouncing around the board and off of other ducks in the tub to archive your goal.  The ducks are adorable and collectible.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you entertain kids with a game, and sometimes you are equally entertained.  Today, we talk about age gaps and how to interpret the ages printed on the box.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;a href="http://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/index.php?section=games&amp;amp;page=game&amp;amp;show=228" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/gamewright_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/ringoflamingo.jpg" alt="Ring-O Flamingo" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
We first flip rings across the table and try to catch them around the necks of some adorable plastic flamingos.  &lt;a href="http://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/index.php?section=games&amp;amp;page=game&amp;amp;show=228" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/gamewright_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Ring-O Flamingo&lt;/a&gt; is a fun one for the kids but we couldn't help but to get a little addicted ourselves.  We certainly weren't at much of an advantage.  The young ones could easily score ahead of us.






We then went to the &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/phalanx/pages/pha0653.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Heart of Africa&lt;/a&gt;.  This one has some fascinating strategy work around auctions, bidding, and value recognition.  Bid for your turn order, manipulate the market, and secure the most valuable goods across the African continent.

We leave the day with a cooperative play board game called &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3300-4499/pages/3309.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Witch of Salem&lt;/a&gt;.  Everyone works together to close portals across the city and keep the monsters at bay.  When you have beaten the last great old one, you can all pat yourselves on the back and count yourselves lucky or brilliant.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few simple game packing tips can make your life a lot easier and reduce the risk of seeing game pieces all over the floor.  Our first few minutes are full of tips to make your games last longer and speed up time-to-play.  I also promised during the show to link the &lt;a href="http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/other.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/flyingbuffalo_com');" target="_blank"&gt;box bands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We first look at a card game that pulls us into the pirate culture.  &lt;a href="http://www.gamewright.com/gamewright/index.php?section=games&amp;amp;page=game&amp;amp;show=142" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/gamewright_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Loot&lt;/a&gt; is an easy to learn game with a healthy dose of strategy.  Seize your enemy's ships and capture treasure.  This game has an excellent team mechanic and packed a surprise for our gaming group.






Derek claimed to have a new favorite in the board game, &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/phalanx/pages/pha6020.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Justinian&lt;/a&gt;.  Influence the counselors in Justinian's court to position them where you need to win the game.  Bluff, read your opponents, push your luck, and take a little risk to claim victory.  This Byzantine themed game is appropriately decorated with beautiful Byzantine art.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Its always a great idea to have some games for your glove box or your travel bag.  Waiting rooms and airports are are always in need of some entertainment beyond the television.  Then, there is of course the obvious tight spot when you need to keep the kids entertained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;a href="http://northstargames.com/games/say_anything/" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/northstargames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/sayanything.jpg" alt="Say Anything" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The first game we look at is &lt;a href="http://northstargames.com/games/say_anything/" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/northstargames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Say Anything&lt;/a&gt;.  Its a fun question and answer game where you get to make up the answers you think the judge will like most.  Its a great way to learn more about your friends and one that anyone can get into.






We then look at &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/73001/pages/73101.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;La Boom&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a quick, simple, inexpensive, and compact game you can take anywhere.  The bomb gets passed quickly around and explodes frequently as determined by the die.  You can get several games in a very short time.
&lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/73001/pages/73101.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/laboom.jpg" alt="La Boom" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

For some more strategy, give &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3300-4499/pages/4105.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Station Master&lt;/a&gt; a try.  Place your passengers on the best trains and offload your bad carriage cars on the other trains.  The combination of strategy and quick math make this a great learning tool.  We had a great time with it.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being in the middle of convention season, the timing just seemed right to talk about it and how it applies to family.  Conventions are a great way to expose yourself and your family to the multitude of games that are available, and they are a lot of fun.  Some conventions we talked about in todays show include &lt;a target="_blank" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/gencon_com');" href="http://gencon.com/"&gt;Gen Con&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/originsgamefair_com');" href="http://www.originsgamefair.com/"&gt;Origins&lt;/a&gt;, and our very own local, &lt;a target="_blank" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/rincongames_com');" href="http://rincongames.com/"&gt;RinCon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/blueorangegames_com');" href="http://www.blueorangegames.com/yamslam.php"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Yamslam" src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/yamslam.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;Our first look was at &lt;a target="_blank" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/blueorangegames_com');" href="http://www.blueorangegames.com/yamslam.php"&gt;Yamslam&lt;/a&gt;.  It is a quick and fun dice game that keeps score in a unique way.  Our first exposure to this game was at a game store – another great place to learn new games.  Its compact, fast, and easy to learn.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;We then took a look at &lt;a target="_blank" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/wunderland_com');" href="http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Traitor/index.html"&gt;Are You the Traitor?&lt;/a&gt; This is a game of deception.  It moves quickly and is expected to move just as quickly off the shelf.  Teams change every turn, as does your role.  Can you figure out who's who before anyone else does?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/wunderland_com');" href="http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Traitor/index.html"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Are You the Traitor?" src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/traitor.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/phalanx/pages/pha6016.htm"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Mesopotamia" src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/mesopotamia.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;Our next stop is &lt;a target="_blank" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/phalanx/pages/pha6016.htm"&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt;.  Delivering a handful of offerings to the temple sounds easy, except for everything it takes to get the job done.  You need resources.  You need mana.  You need to watch out for larger clans.  The variable board and components that come with it make this one an attractive adventure.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Then we play &lt;a target="_blank" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/phalanx/pages/pha0486.htm"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt;.  Bust everyone, but preferably the guilty.  Yea, you'll have a few innocent people behind bars to make your quota, but the best agents will capture the worst criminals.  This is a great exercise of maximizing your score for victory.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/phalanx/pages/pha0486.htm"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="FBI" src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/fbi.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

      <itunes:summary>Being in the middle of convention season, the timing just seemed right to talk about it and how it applies to family.  Conventions are a great way to expose yourself and your family to the multitude of games that are available, and they are a lot of fun.  Some conventions we talked about in todays show include Gen Con (http://gencon.com/), Origins (http://www.originsgamefair.com/), and our very own local, RinCon (http://rincongames.com/).



(http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/yamslam.png)
Our first look was at Yamslam (http://www.blueorangegames.com/yamslam.php).  It is a quick and fun dice game that keeps score in a unique way.  Our first exposure to this game was at a game store – another great place to learn new games.  Its compact, fast, and easy to learn.






We then took a look at Are You the Traitor? (http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Traitor/index.html) This is a game of deception.  It moves quickly and is expected to move just as quickly off the shelf.  Teams change every turn, as does your role.  Can you figure out who's who before anyone else does?

(http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/mesopotamia.jpg)
Our next stop is Mesopotamia (http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/phalanx/pages/pha6016.htm).  Delivering a handful of offerings to the temple sounds easy, except for everything it takes to get the job done.  You need resources.  You need mana.  You need to watch out for larger clans.  The variable board and components that come with it make this one an attractive adventure.






Then we play FBI (http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/phalanx/pages/pha0486.htm).  Bust everyone, but preferably the guilty.  Yea, you'll have a few innocent people behind bars to make your quota, but the best agents will capture the worst criminals.  This is a great exercise of maximizing your score for victory.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Games are a great way to exercise planning and execution.   Today we talk about strategy and tactics, the differences between them, how they are applied in games, and how much fun it is to stay sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first looked at &lt;a href="http://riograndegames.com/games.html?id=313" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/riograndegames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Kids of Carcassonne&lt;/a&gt;.  Its a light version of the popular tile game, Carcassonne, and enjoyed by the entire family.  It is especially pleasing to see eyes light up when the young ones figure out the strategy to beating their parents at this game.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3000-3299/pages/3030.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/candamir.jpg" alt="Candamir" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
We then went on a Catan Adventure with &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3000-3299/pages/3030.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Candamir: The First Settlers&lt;/a&gt;.  This has all the elements of an adventure game without the overhead.  Characters adventure to improve the town and grow with experience.  This one filled the need to explore while staying within a reasonable game time.  Its a definite must-have.






Our Catan Adventure continued with &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3000-3299/pages/3031.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Elusand: The First City&lt;/a&gt;.  This time, we are building a walled city.  Plan and place your buildings wisely to gain the resources you need to win the game.  Pirates will hinder your progress, as will your opponents as they build right over the top of your prized buildings.  This one gave us some exciting conflict to fight through.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we touch on teamwork, something that can't be overlooked in the world of games.  Games range from working together to beat the game, beating another team, or just working together with  an opponent for mutual gain.  All of these are lessons we all do well to learn.&lt;/p&gt;



Our first look is at &lt;a href="http://otb-games.com/backseatdrawing/index.html" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/otb-gamest_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Backseat Drawing&lt;/a&gt;.  We divided into teams and had a pretty even match as we took turns giving basic drawing instructions as the rest of us guessed what was being drawn.  We were very entertained and will get this one out again.
&lt;a href="http://otb-games.com/backseatdrawing/index.html" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/otb-gamest_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/backseat.jpg" alt="Backseat Drawing" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;






&lt;a href="http://shop.bucephalus.biz/catalog/roman_taxi/14" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/bucephalus_biz');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/romantaxi.jpg" alt="Roman Taxi" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
We then played &lt;a href="http://shop.bucephalus.biz/catalog/roman_taxi/14" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/bucephalus_biz');" target="_blank"&gt;Roman Taxi&lt;/a&gt;.  Your making decisions on who to pick up and carry around town.  It was simple, yet had some choices you could make on where to go.  This one appealed to a variety of players and is easy to play with a range of ages.  It was definitely a step up from a lot of traditional games you may be used to.






&lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/0450-0479/pages/0468.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix&lt;/a&gt; is a racing board game like no other.  Your moving not just your cars, but others around the track.  Your decisions were about timing and maximizing your move, but you usually can't get around the track yourself.  This was a real hit for everyone.
&lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/0450-0479/pages/0468.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/grandprix.jpg" alt="Grand Prix" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;






&lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3300-4499/pages/4112.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/barbarossa.jpg" alt="Barbarossa" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Then we got the clay out with &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3300-4499/pages/4112.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Barbarossa&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a sculpture, riddle, and guessing game.  Build sculptures that are abstract enough to challenge your guessing opponents, but don't make them too hard or you will get nowhere.  This one also appealed to a wide range of players and employed a very unique skill.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we dive into spatial analysis.  This topic ranges from fitting furniture through the door to placement relationships and geography.  Many games have a spatial thinking component and give them their own interesting challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



Our first look is at &lt;a href="http://playrooment.com/Default.aspx?tabid=1330" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/playrooment_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Portobello Market&lt;/a&gt;.  You will be placing market stalls in neighborhoods and claiming dominance where you can to increase your ability to move through the town.  Its all about money, but money is all about location, location, location.
&lt;a href="http://playrooment.com/Default.aspx?tabid=1330" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/playrooment_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/portobello.jpg" alt="Portobello Market" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;






&lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3300-4499/pages/3307.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/amazonas.jpg" alt="Amazonas" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
We then take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3300-4499/pages/3307.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Amazonas&lt;/a&gt;.  Your collecting specimens in the Amazon.  To do so, you must find an efficient path through the jungle from village to village.  Make sure to meet visit the villages you need and collect what you can to emerge victorious.






Load your trucks as tightly and as efficiently as you can with &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3300-4499/pages/3308.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Pack &amp;amp; Stack&lt;/a&gt;.  You have an assortment of boxes that you need to transport.  You loose points for extra space left on your truck and boxes left behind.  This one will certainly offer a different experience at the game table.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Board games are often full of maps and a great resource for exploring and learning more about our world.  Before diving into some great games, we visit about some of our experiences with geographically rich games and some educational opportunities they can offer.  We had the additional pleasure of doing some exploring in real life ourselves aboard a &lt;a href="http://gameradventures.com/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/gameradventures_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Gamer Adventures&lt;/a&gt; cruise to the Caribbean.  Some of today's comments were collected during that excursion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="10"&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Our first look is at the board game &lt;a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=33&amp;amp;esem=2" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/fantasyflightgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Ingenious&lt;/a&gt;.  This abstract strategy game is challenging, easy to learn, and full of color.  You have a lot of options to weigh to maximize your score.&lt;/td&gt;

This one is full of geographic principles creating a good fit with today's topic.  There is a real geographic impact on the economy of the game that is fun to explore.  Empire Builder has been repackaged from the earlier edition and promises new popularity with its new found beauty.&lt;/td&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ability to influence other players and their decisions vary widely from game to game.  Sometimes it is in direct conflict and sometimes you don't interact at all.  Whatever you find your tastes to be, there is sure to be something right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;We first take a look at &lt;a href="http://www.asmodee-us.com/games/strategy/formula-d.php" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/asmodee-us_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Formula D&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a great racing game and all about speed management.  If you are going to fast through the corners, you aren't going to make it through the race, if you are going to slow you will get left behind.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.asmodee-us.com/games/strategy/formula-d.php" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/asmodee-us_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/formula-d.jpg" alt="Formula D" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

Jump from ice floe to ice floe and collect as many fish as you can, while cutting your opponents off from their game.  The board is different every time and falls apart as you play leaving penguins stranded and hungry if you aren't looking out for them.&lt;/td&gt;

The influence you spread over the map affects your income and the actions available to you.  Those actions will allow you to build up your culture and your ability to win the game.&lt;/td&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every body loves to pretend, especially while growing up.  There are so many games that spark the imagination and allow you to take on the role of somebody else, or do something you don't have the opportunity to do in real life.  We spend a few moments on these thoughts before going into our selection of spotlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;We first took a look at &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/bellasara_com');" href="http://bellasara.com" target="_blank"&gt;Bella Sara&lt;/a&gt;.  These cards have an online component where you can enter in a code and take care of the ponies you unlock.  Everyone loves ponies.  Hidden City Games has also built in this great positive self image component to remind our girls how special they are.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;&lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/bellasara_com');" href="http://bellasara.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/bellasara.png" border="0" alt="Bella Sara" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;We then played &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/northstargames_com');" href="http://www.northstargames.com/games/cluzzle/index.page" target="_blank"&gt;Cluzzle&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a game of creativity and clay.  Everyone gets to craft something to challenge everyone else with.  You want them to guess it, but not make it easy enough for them to guess on their first try.  This was another hit over the season.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Travel through and take part in history with &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3300-4499/pages/4109.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Monuments&lt;/a&gt;.  There are several ancient wonders you construct while your historians document the activity of everyone else.  This game really took us places and kept us entertained.  I am sure this board game will be coming off our shelf for more play.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;&lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3300-4499/pages/4109.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/monuments.jpg" border="0" alt="Sutter's Mill" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

You maneuver and manipulate a flock of toy sheep to reach different objectives throughout the game.  Sometimes your ewes will be playing tag.  Sometimes you will just be trying to avoid the shearing scissors.&lt;/td&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When looking at many of today's games we noticed most of them had something in common.  They either had printed optional rules, or we made up some of our own.  Optional rules, or your own house rules are a great way to either add some new excitement to the game, or simplify it for younger audiences or easily distracted friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;We had a lot of fun interpreting the ink blots in &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/bucephalus_biz');" href="http://shop.bucephalus.biz/catalog/rorschach/20" target="_blank"&gt;Rorschach&lt;/a&gt;.  We had no idea some of our friends had such a crazy imagination.  While winning the game means picking the right ink blots to answer the random given question, the most fun comes with sharing your interpretive thoughts.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td valign="middle"&gt;&lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/bucephalus_biz');" href="http://shop.bucephalus.biz/catalog/rorschach/20" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/rorschach.jpg" border="0" alt="Rorschach" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

The outrageous stories that come from your family as they explore solutions big problems with mundane items are absolutely hilarious.  Each take turns judging the best stories by whatever criteria they deem appropriate.&lt;/td&gt;

Its not just about digging gold and influencing the town, its about getting out of town before the gold dries up.  The options you explore in this game will entertain you many times over.  We had a blast working around each other to maximize our outcome.&lt;/td&gt;
