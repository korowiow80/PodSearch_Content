<p><strong>Reviewed by Daniel M. Yencich </strong></p>
<p>In <em>Banned Questions about Jesus</em>, Piatt and company seek to tackle some of the toughest, most “keep-you-awake-at-night questions” pertaining to Jesus (1). The questions range from important theological queries of Jesus, his essence, and mission (“Why would God send Jesus as the sacrificial lamb?”) to idiosyncratic and slightly comical questions having to do with the more mundane or every day aspects of Jesus’ life (“Did [Jesus] have sexual fantasies and desires?”). The multiple answers to each question seemed to me to run the gamut of helpfulness, but though I at times found myself scribbling my own disagreements with respondents in the book’s margins, I suppose that was at least in part intended by the contributors. The questions and answers presented in <em>Banned Questions about Jesus </em>are <em>meant</em> to be wrestled with.</p>
<p><span id="more-7513"></span>A great strength of <em>Banned Questions </em>is its “round table” format. The book is comprised of fifty ‘banned’ questions and each question is treated by a handful of contributors. There is typical overlap between responses to a given question, and this is to be expected (for, how many different answers can be given for a question about the Shroud of Turin? Everyone agrees it’s a fake!), but the real strength of the format is shown when the answers to a given question <em>differ</em>. One example of this is found in the answers to “Why did Jesus cry ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’” (49-53). In the four responses, readers are confronted with multiple interpretive options to choose from: perhaps Jesus’ words are meant to give strength to Christians who feel abandoned by God; perhaps God, in Christ, really <em>died</em> on the cross; or maybe the whole thing serves a higher literary and theological function. In emphasizing the plural nature of interpretation in our postmodern world, as those answers exemplify, the contributors to <em>Banned Questions</em> have done their readers a great service. In many cases, there is not simply <em>one</em> answer for what to do with a given biblical text or theological issue; instead, there are many options on the table, and <em>Banned Questions</em> quite often highlights this plurality.</p>

<p>The options presented in the book to various questions range from quite persuasive and helpful to the unpersuasive and at times bizarre (Jesus “possibly” had ‘wet dreams’ – 18). But, just as the world often presents a cacophony of competing voices on a given subject, some of which clarify while others muddy, likewise do the answers in this book present both clarifying and muddying answers – and that is not necessarily a bad thing. Readers will not always come away from questions feeling as though the issues have been finally and fully resolved, but they will walk away knowing that there are different, perhaps even new, ways of talking about the issue available. <em>Banned Questions about Jesus </em>serves as a good entry point into all sorts of Christological issues, and works well as an example of how such discussion should happen: openly, honestly, and in the round. I would recommend this book be read in small groups to further facilitate the discussions that <em>Banned Questions about Jesus</em> really only begins to open up. Christian Piatt and his panel of responders should be commended for beginning discussion(s) and presenting a mostly helpful in-road towards answering the “banned” and taboo questions that concern the central object of Christian faith, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><!-- Mandate to Difference: An Invitation to the Contemporary Church 0664231217 231217 BRUEGGE Walter Brueggemann -->What role should the church play in the world today? This is the question esteemed theologian Walter Brueggeman strives to answer in his work <em>Mandate to Difference: An Invitation to the Contemporary Church</em>. His most recent collection of essays calls the church to &#8220;set itself in tension with the rest of the world.&#8221; Instead of drawing inward, Brueggemann asks the church to publicly choose a different way&#8212;to &#8220;courageously defy political polarization, consumerism, and militarism.&#8221; By demonstrating a different way, the church can lead the world forward &#8220;and adversaries can be turned to allies and to friends.&#8221;Brueggeman is the William Marcellus McPheeters Professor Emeritus of Old Testament at Columbia Theological Seminary, Decatur, Georgia.</td>

In fact, we use the same language to talk to each other and to talk to God. Can our everyday speech, then, be just as important as the words and prayers we hear from the pulpit? Eugene Peterson unequivocally says &#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tell It Slant explores how Jesus used language&#8212;he was earthy, not abstract; metaphorical, not dogmatic. His was not a direct language of information or instruction but an indirect, oblique language requiring a participating imagination&#8212;&#8221;slant&#8221; language. In order to witness and teach accurately in Jesus&#8217; name, then, it is important for us to use language the way he did.</td>

Sweeney -->&#8220;We can show you how to be quiet, how to listen, but only God can show you the other stuff,&#8221; Father Ambrose told Jon Sweeney long ago. &#8220;What stuff?&#8221; he replied. &#8220;You.&#8221;This is just one of the many conversations Sweeney shares in Cloister Talks-a series of glimpses into his decades-long friendships with Cistercian and Benedictine monks in various monasteries across the country. The contemplative way embodied by these communal brothers has been the single greatest source of guidance in Sweeney&#8217;s journey of faith. Here he shares with poignant honesty the wisdom and insight for everyday living he has gained along the way.</p>
<p>Sweeney&#8217;s conversations with monks engage various universal areas of life, including life, death, love, work, play, and spirituality. Readers will emerge with a deeper understanding of this ancient way of Christianity-a much needed antidote to the hurry of contemporary life. The monastics who populate these pages have spent a combined century and a half in their sacred vocation. They hold the keys to many of the things we all yearn for: stillness, solitude, simplicity, contemplation, and clarity of purpose.</td>

<p><strong>Essay: &#8220;Some Aspects of the Grotesque in Southern Fiction&#8221;<br />
</strong>[ Read <a href="http://www.en.utexas.edu/amlit/amlitprivate/scans/grotesque.html" target="_blank">the text of this essay here</a>... ]</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever I&#8217;m asked why Southern writers  particularly have a penchant for writing about freaks, I say it is  because we are still able to recognize one. To be able to recognize a  freak, you have to have some conception of the whole man, and in the  South the general conception of man is still, in the main, theological.  That is a large statement, and it is dangerous to make it, for almost  anything you say about Southern belief can be denied in the next breath  with equal propriety. But approaching the subject from the standpoint of  the writer, I think it is safe to say that while the South is hardly  Christ-centered, it is most certainly Christ-haunted. The Southerner,  who isn&#8217;t convinced of it, is very much afraid that he may have been  formed in the image and likeness of God. Ghosts can be very fierce and  instructive. They cast strange shadows, particularly in our literature.  In any case, it is when the freak can be sensed as a figure for our  essential displacement that he attains some depth in literature.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Reviewed by R. Dean Hudgens.</strong></p>
<p>With the release this summer of a film version of Jack Kerouac&#8217;s <em>On The Road</em> (directed by the phenomenal Walter Salles), as well as the publication of the first issue of the <em>The Beat Studies Journal</em> (May 2012) we are apparently in the midst of a revival of interest in the so-called “beat generation”. Was there a “beat generation”? Allen Ginsberg said no, there was only a bunch of writers trying to get published. To Jack Kerouac the beat generation were those “who <em>really</em> know where we are.”</p>
<p>When one former Beat poet was told of a new book entitled <em>The Philosophy of the Beats </em>she asked “Did the Beats have a philosophy?” Well, yes, but only if the word “philosophy” is interpreted in the broad, non-technical sense utilized in this University Press of Kentucky series <em>The Philosophy of Popular Culture</em> (edited by Mark T Conard). As far as I can tell this is the only volume in that series of twenty-five that is not focused on film, television, or sports.</p>
<p><span id="more-7465"></span>As Ginsberg&#8217;s response indicated, the Beats were primarily a group of young men (and a few fascinating women) who met after World War II and influenced one another, collaborated and published a variety of novels, poems, and essays. As editor Sharin Elkholy indicates in her introduction, the word “Beat” refers to both a literary movement and a lifestyle. There was a New York City nucleus around Kerouac, Ginsberg, and William Burroughs; and a West Coast movement around Lawrence Ferlinghetti and the City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco. The subterranean bohemian currents of American life had been running for a hundred years, but it was during this post-war decade that they broke the surface into national consciousness.</p>
<p>This volume analyzes “beat style” recasting some central Beat themes in a philosophical framework that the authors believe demonstrate their abiding relevance. The sixteen essays are arranged in four sections of four essays each, gathering recent scholarship around Beat history, identities, aesthetics, and politics. The triumvirate of Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burroughs are examined in about half the essays. Two of the more significant essays are on two often overlooked female Beat poets Diane de Prima and Joanne Kyger. Two others look at the work of Gary Snyder, a figure clearly related to the other Beats, but also somewhat distinct. The essays situate the Beats in relation to their own intellectual sources (existentialism, surrealism, Dada, etc) and contemporary philosophical analogues (Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari, French feminism, etc). They provide a comprehensive survey of the current state of Beat studies, introducing the main subjects, themes, and scholars involved. This volume is a nice complement to an earlier set of essays edited by Jennie Skerl entitled <em>Reconstructing the Beats </em>(Palgrave, 2004).</p>

<p>In the 1950s, the Beats were celebrated by few and scorned by most. In post-war America the societal expectation was for hard work, getting married, starting a family, owning a home, settling down, and enjoying the benefits of a growing consumer society. It was the apotheosis of the American Dream. The United States was in a cold war with the Soviet Union, and just as Sputnik represented a threat from abroad, many thought the “beatnik” represented a threat at home – not a violent, terrorist threat, but a more insidious moral, spiritual, and psychological threat. The television character Maynard G. Crebs on <em>Dobie Gillis </em>became the archetypal beatnik: lazy, unemployed, irresponsible, and needing constant supervision. Overshadowed by mushroom clouds and gripped by the slow death of conformity some youth began to march to “the beat” of a very different drummer and in a very different direction – away from the American Dream and towards something more cosmopolitan, spontaneous, and primal.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s curious that in 1956 when Ginsberg was reading “Howl” at City Lights, Martin Luther King was leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott in Alabama, and Billy Graham and Carl Henry were beginning the magazine <em>Christianity Today</em>. All three of these moments were distinctively American expressions of religion and spirituality. There were few (if any) overlap in concerns or involvements between them, except for a common spirit of contestation. All of them believed that something significant was underway in America. All believed that religion was crucial to what was happening.</p>
<p>The evangelicals around Graham and Henry were determined to increase their educational and cultural capital in the wider society and to not lose ground to secularism. Dr. King and the civil rights movement were determined to break the grip of Jim Crow in the South and to obtain the equal access that the Constitution promised, thereby increasing their political and economic capital. Both groups shared a common Christian heritage, a biblical vocabulary, and a desire to be part of mainstream America.</p>
<p>The Beats were trying to “capitalize” on something entirely different – they wanted to escape the American mainstream. The Beats responded to secularism not through retrenchment in traditional Judeo-Christianity, but by becoming the first group in America to be “spiritual but not religious.” They were also largely apolitical (or at most anarchist libertarians) interested more in free speech than voting rights. However, they reveled in black music, language, and style. In fact, without urban black culture there would never have been a beat generation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Beats are still of interest to some young Christians simply because they flagrantly violated so many evangelical taboos. Andreas Seland&#8217;s essay comparing the poet Charles Bukowski and the philosopher Soren Kierkegaard on the dialectics of love opines “the Beat figure, as we know, is a person who throws himself into the cracks of middle-class morality.” Many of the Beats eventually became trapped in solipsism and despair, and that is one lesson that should not be overlooked. “There were many casualities,” noted Gary Snyder. However, in their restlessness with the American Dream, their cynicism about mainstream society, their hunger for spontaneous expression, and the desire to be at home in their own bodies and with the bodies of others, there is a recurring call that many still find difficult to ignore. I don&#8217;t look to the Beats for all the answers, but I sure do find them giving voice to some of the most fascinating questions about embodiment, desire, imagination, poetics, vulnerability, and emotional intensity. These are not topics alien to Christian life but they are topics often foreign to Christian thought and reflection.</p>

</strong></p>
<p>I began to write this review halfway through listening to the audiobook version of <em>Some Assembly Required </em>as I traveled back from a trip to North Carolina. I was pondering the adjectives I could insert to describe the ever profound, yet laughable tales of Anne Lamott. I had waited anxiously for this follow up to <em>Operating Instructions</em> – her journal of her son’s first year. What a joy it had been to come to know the crazy cast of true life characters that made Anne and Sam’s “family” of blood and choice. The vivid illustrations of her first time mothering mistakes were engaging and endearing. How could this book disappoint with Sam, Anne’s son, that baby I fell for in <em>Operating Instructions, </em>co-authoring? Yet, even with the treat of Sam and Anne narrating the audiobook, it did.</p>
<p>The first half of the book lived up to my high expectations. Anne writes from a place of division – devastation and worry about her so young son and his girlfriend Amy (they were 19 and 20 respectively) and their impending parenthood; and her enthusiasm at the notion of becoming a grandmother while wishing the timing were ten years later. She narrates so well the birth of Jax around whom a makeshift family&#8211;including Amy and her parents who would visit from North Carolina – is created. How as Jax enters the world, Anne falls for Amy and after he appears, Sam falls for Jax and of course, the grandparents fall for “the loveliest baby boy.&#8221; Anne describes meeting Jax: “I felt as though I was seeing a river gorge, from way up on high on a bridge, silenced by the vastness of his tiny face, the depth of his brown-black eyes.”</p>
<p><span id="more-7458"></span></p>
<p>Jax and his entourage (Sam, Amy, and the other set of grandparents&#8211;Trudy and Ray) encamp as the “village” at Anne’s house. The usual discomfort of living with those to whom you are not accustomed ensues; yet “through it all, though, the ups and downs, Jax shines like a pearl”. Then Sam and Amy and Jax go home and Nana Anne relates time spent with them at her place and how she desperately misses him between those times. Those true life characters from <em>Operating Instructions</em> and Anne’s spiritual memoirs make appearances in <em>Some Assembly Required</em>. And it’s lovely. And messy. And fraught with humanness. Told in the usual Anne Lamott self-effacing, hysterical way.  But, in the middle of Anne Lamott-ness comes the voice of Sam in the form of emails and “interviews.” And it gets in the way. These bits feel inserted for the sake of placing Sam’s name on the cover and creating a charming description for booksellers. It seems Sam did not write anything (other than the preface) for this book; his parts are lifted from emails or coaxed from him by his mother in interview form. While Sam’s voice does capture the emotion and frustration of his young fatherhood and the father who was absent from his early childhood, I want more. And I don’t get it.</p>
<p>I can deal with the distraction of Sam popping into the narrative here as I had been promised a bit of Sam. The book continues to be about Jax and how he continually changes the lives of Anne, Sam and Amy. But on January 11, Jax disappears. For forty pages. Anne visits India with her friend Bill. Jax is seen in babies around her and she misses him of course, but book shifts from a memoir about being a grandmother to one about her spiritual experience in Dehli and Varanasi; on the Ganges and to the Taj Mahal. This feels like part of another book. A good one indeed, but not one about Jax.</p>

<p>We get back on track from February through July; Anne struggling mostly with her feelings for Amy as she vacillates between staying with Sam in San Francisco and packing up Jax for a move closer to family and friends in Chicago.  And gives us great Jax-getting-bigger stories and some of Sam-on-his-own when Amy and Jax are away. But in July, Anne takes another trip; to Europe this time. This distraction is briefer, but this trip prefaces the last few pages of the book. She does come back in time for Jax’s first birthday party after which Anne realizes Jax has “grown from a helpless newborn to an accomplished and complex human being who is days away from walking. He’s grown me, too; grandchildren grow you.” Then it’s over. That’s it. Oh Annie. Again, I want more.</p>
<p>“You look beautiful in that grandson”, Anne is told by a woman at church. As does <em>Some Assembly Required</em>. It does not “wear” that grandson quite enough to earn the subtitle, “A Journal of My Son’s First Son.&#8221; Perhaps better suited to “a journal that takes place during the first year of my son’s first son (with a few words by my son)”? If you have not read a book by Anne Lamott, don’t start here. If you have read all Anne’s memoirs, it is worth a read and you certainly will gain a few new Annie zingers. From this year, Anne recounts: “I was reminded of the Four Immutable Laws of the Spirit: Whoever is present are the right people. Whenever it begins is the right time. Whatever happens is the only thing that could have happened. And when it&#8217;s over, it&#8217;s over.”</p>
