Tony talks about <em>The Office </em>and<em> Celebrity Apprentice. </em>Lou talks about <em>Pawn Queens, Platinum Hit </em>and <em>Chase.</em><em> </em>Random TV news tidbits after that.</p>
<p>In Movies (~48:00), Tony saw <em>Thor</em> and, due to being sick for a week, started what he&#8217;s calling <em>Tony&#8217;s Classic Film Project. </em>For that, he watched <em>Cool Hand Luke, Network, The Conversation, Out of Africa </em>and <em>The Sting</em>.

<ul>
<li>DC Comics is doing a major reset of 52 of their superhero series, and will also be offering digital versions of their comics day and date with the print releases.</li>
<li>Microsoft has released a video of some of the cool new features of Windows 8. Definitely worth watching. <a title="Windows 8 Preview" href="http://gizmodo.com/5807615/windows-8-and-its-incredibly-cool-new-touch-interface" target="_blank">See it here</a>.</li>
<li>Thanko has a set of sunglasses with a built-in HD camcorder. The lens is in the middle of the bridge, and it can record 720p video at 30fps and store it on a MicroSD card in one of the earpieces. All for about $75.</li>

<li>Scientists are wondering if there might be a massive brown dwarf orbiting in our solar system much further out than the rest of the planets. This would explain why comets enter our solar system in the elliptical orbit that they do.</li>
<li>Apple’s iWork software is now available on the iPhone.</li>
<li>The ISS (aka International Space Station) is finally complete, now that a laser-equipped extension boom for the station’s robot arm has been installed.</li>
<li>The TV Guardian is a $210 set-top box that “removes” bad language from the audio and replaces it with non-naughty text.</li>
<li>Dr. Sarah Parcak of the University of Alabama has used satellite infrared imaging to discover 17 lost pyramids, more than 1,000 tombs and 3,000 settlements in Egypt.</li>
<li>A scientist in India has invented a male birth control injection called RISUG.</li>
<li>As far back as 1965, the U.S. military had a 4-legged “truck” called the CAM, developed by General Electric to help navigate rough terrain and move heavy things out of the way. <a title="CAM video" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMGCFLEYakM" target="_blank">Watch a cool video of it here</a>.</li>
<li>Apple has announced what it’ll be announcing at the WWDC next week, including iOS 5, Mac OS X Lion and iCloud.</li>

<p>We start out this episode with a touch of listener mail, general pleasantries and the like.</p>
<p>In video games, Tony &amp; Lou both talk about finishing <em>Portal 2</em>, woohoo! Tony is also playing <em>L.A. Noire</em>, and Lou&#8217;s played a bit of both <em>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sorcery</em> and <em>Osmos</em>&#8230;both on the iPad. Miscellaneous video game news follows.</p>
<p>In TV (~33:55), the segment starts with the guys talking <em>American Idol</em>, and the <em>The Voice</em>. Tony talks about <em>The Office </em>and<em> Parks and Rec. </em>Lou talks about <em>Stargate: Universe, Episodes, Chuck </em>and <em>Fringe.</em><em> </em>Random TV news tidbits after that.</p>
<p>In Movies (~1:05:50), Tony saw <em>Bridesmaids, The King&#8217;s Speech, Barneys Version </em>and <em>The Dilemma</em>. Lou saw <em>Green Hornet</em>. Miscellaneous movie news follows.</p>
<p>In the Mash-Up segment (~1:28:40) the news this week includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mac malware is on the rise, with a phony anti-malware scam tricking many a Mac user, just like similar malware operates on Windows. ZDNet&#8217;s Ed Bott interviewd an AppleCare support rep, in what is <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/an-applecare-support-rep-talks-mac-malware-is-getting-worse/3342?pg=1" target="_blank">a very enlightening and interesting article</a></li>
<li>There’s a rumor that Amazon has two tablet computers in development that’ll supposedly “blow the doors off of” anything else on the market</li>
<li>Nevada could be the first state to allow self-driving cars, if Google has its way</li>
<li>The U.S. has just released its “International Strategy for Cyberspace” and one of the interesting things in it is this phrase “When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would any other threat to our country.”</li>
<li>The iPhone 4 may have its retina display, with 326ppi, but a company called Ortus Technology has packed a full 1920&#215;1080 image into a 4.8 inch screen, which comes out to 458ppi</li>
<li>Lazy Cakes Relaxation Brownies, sold at gas stations, etc., each have almost enough melatonin in them to make an adult fall asleep. Two will knock most people out cold.</li>
<li>Dell’s Adamo laptop has been discontinued, but they’ve got a new machine in the works that’ll take its place. The product has no name yet, but it’s supposedly going to be 15.6”, have either Core i5 or Core i7 processors, a high-res display and, best of all, be right around $1000</li>
<li>Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 is <em>not</em> super-slim at .67 inches, but it is in fact the thinnest laptop you can buy with a Core i7 processor at this time. It’s got a Gorilla Glass screen and starts at about $1,400</li>
<li>A company called Sheex has just come out with some new sheets, also called Sheex, that are made from the same type of material as performance wear like those made by Nike and Under Armour</li>
<li>A leaked iPhone 5 (probably the iPhone 4S) case shows an edge-to-edge screen and different camera location</li>
<li>Apple’s just proposed a new standard for SIM cards that’s even smaller than the “MicroSIM” they use in the iPhone4 and iPad</li>
<li>The city of New York is deploying a bunch of new LED signs that measure drivers speed and show a familiar crosswalk-style sideways guy with the text “SPEED LIMIT 30”. But if you go over the speed limit, the guy turns into a skeleton and the text changes to “SLOW DOWN”.</li>
<li>Samsung is now starting to make LED light bulbs, which is good news since usually when they do that, prices from other manufacturers tend to drop</li>
<li>The X Prize Foundation is offering $10 million to anybody who can invent a real, working Medical Tricorder like that used on Star Trek</li>
<li>A woman named Annie Jacobsen says that she has proof that Roswell wasn’t a UFO crash, but the crash of a Soviet-made saucer type vehicle, complete with 13-year old kids who’d been genetically modified to look like</li>
<li>Finally, Lior and Vardit Adler, a couple in Israel, have just had their third baby, a little girl, and they’ve named her “Like” after the Facebook Like button. Seriously.</li>
