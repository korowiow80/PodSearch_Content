			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here in Lucidology 101 part 12 you&#8217;re about to find out the 5 most powerful movement-free exit techniques. These techniques are how you convert sleep paralysis into an O.B.E. and separate from your physical body to enter your nonphysical environment. </p>
<p><b>Two Transitions To Success, Not Just One!</b></p>
<p>Recall our two-step strategy for visualization-free O.B.E.s. The first step was to use sleep commands to trick your body into falling asleep. That stage put you in waking sleep paralysis so that your brain enters a theta brain wave and automatically sends you into a subconscious focus without you needing to use visualizations.</p>
<p>The second step is to convert sleep paralysis into an O.B.E using an exit technique.</p>
<p><b>Exit Techniques: We’re Up To Step 4 &#8211; &#8220;Separation&#8221;</b></p>
<p>In this section we&#8217;ll cover this final stage of an O.B.E induction which is the exit stage where you separate your nonphysical body from your physical body.</p>
<p><b>The 3 Basic Problems In Completing The Exit</b></p>
<p>In completing the exit there are 3 basic problems we need to solve:</p>
<p>1.	First, that you can&#8217;t tell physical body from nonphysical body because they&#8217;re overlaid<br />
2.	Second, that you can&#8217;t separate them because they&#8217;re stuck together<br />
3.	Third, if you move and you&#8217;re not ready to exit, you&#8217;ll tense up and ruin your trance</p>
<p>That last problem is a major obstacle. There&#8217;s nothing worse than getting into a decent trance then ruining it because you moved physically instead of separating from your body.</p>
<p>So we need &#8220;movement free&#8221; exit techniques so you can make a bid for an exit and if you&#8217;re wrong and you&#8217;re not quite deep enough, it&#8217;s no big deal.</p>
<p><b>5 Solutions To The 3 Problems: Movement-free Exit Techniques</b></p>
<p>So here are the 5 most powerful movement-free exit methods that I&#8217;ve tested many times and have found to be highly effective. These are:</p>
<p>1.	Open Mouth Exit<br />
2.	Gravity Press Exit<br />
3.	Safety Cap Exit<br />
4.	Focused Awareness With Magnetic Spheres<br />
5.	Salvaging Partial Exits Using Limb Creation</p>
<p><b>Cracking The Safe: The &#8220;Open Mouth&#8221; Exit Initiator</b></p>
<p>The first method is the &#8216;open mouth exit&#8217; and it was discovered by a forum poster named tsunaH. In sleep paralysis 99% of the time even if everything below your neck is paralyzed you can still move your eyes and mouth. </p>
<p>To do this method simply open your mouth and take a few slow deep breaths. Be sure not to breathe too hard or you&#8217;ll break the paralysis. By doing this you&#8217;ll feel yourself start to separate starting at your head. </p>
<p>This method is a very reliable way to get the exit process kick started. It&#8217;s actually more of an &#8216;exit initiator&#8217; than a full exit method because a lot of times it will get you half way out and then you need to switch to another exit method to complete the separation. However a lot of times once you start the separation using open mouth breathing, you&#8217;ll be able to separate completely and get up into your nonphysical bedroom without using any other tricks!</p>
<p>The reason this method works is you&#8217;ve split your focus between physical awareness and nonphysical awareness. In sleep paralysis your body below the neck is still physically focused but your eyes and face have entered nonphysical focus. By creating movement in your eyes and face you draw the rest of your focus in to nonphysical awareness.</p>
<p><b>The &#8220;Gravity Press&#8221; Exit</b></p>
<p>The second movement free exit method is the &#8220;gravity press&#8221; exit. To do this, focus on the feeling of gravity pulling on your body.</p>
<p>In an O.B.E. this will actually cause you to sink through solid objects and you can use this fact to test if you&#8217;re nonphysical without moving.</p>
<p><b>Gravity Press Tips</b></p>
<p>Make sure not to pull yourself down too far because creating too much of a feeling of heaviness can make the resulting O.B.E more dark and lower energy.</p>
<p>If you lay on your back while looking at the ceiling, you can do a &#8216;transparent bed&#8217; reality check:</p>
<p>To do that look at the ceiling and gravity press yourself to the floor.<br />
As long as you keep your sight focused on the ceiling you&#8217;ll see through your bed<br />
This can help you be more sure that you really did a gravity press and you really are nonphysical</p>
<p><b>The &#8220;Safety Cap&#8221; Exit: Gravity-press With A Twist</b></p>
<p>You can build on the gravity press exit to make it more powerful. This brings us to the third movement-free exit method called &#8216;safety-cap&#8217;. With a safety cap bottle, to open the lid you have to press down and then twist.</p>
<p><b>What Does That Have To Do With O.B.E. Exits?</b></p>
<p>The problem with the gravity press method is even if you sink into the bed a few inches you may not be completely sure that you&#8217;ve really separated. What you need is a better &#8220;selector&#8221; to be sure there&#8217;s absolutely no question in your mind that you&#8217;re nonphysical. To fix this, create the feeling of a force that rotates you around on your belly button so that your head swings around 180 degrees and ends up where your feet are. </p>
<p><b>Gravity Press + Twist = Safety Cap O.B.E</b></p>
<p>At that point there is no doubt you&#8217;re in an O.B.E and you can get up without fear of accidentally moving your physical muscles and botching the trance. In other words, you just press down and twist and you have an O.B.E. </p>
<p><b>Major Mistake: The Roll Over Exit</b></p>
<p>Most books on O.B.E.s tell you to roll over on your side to complete the exit. This is a really bad idea because it&#8217;s an all or nothing gamble. Either you succeed and you roll over in to an O.B.E or you move physically and have to start all over again.</p>
<p>On the other hand, because the safety cap exit is also a type of reality check you can first test to see if you&#8217;re actually nonphysical. If either the press or the twist stages don&#8217;t work, then you know to relax a little deeper and your trance is still in tact. </p>
<p>Your success rate will be many times higher when you use safety cap than if you simply try rolling over.</p>
<p><b>Magnetic Spheres</b></p>
<p>Our forth movement free exit method is called &#8220;Magnetic Spheres&#8221;</p>
<p>I know this is supposed to be &#8216;visualization-free&#8217; O.B.E. methods&#8230; but this one is really easy and it will really help with your exits. So I&#8217;m going to sneak it in.</p>
<p>By practicing to focus your awareness while awake, you can better direct your nonphysical body when in an O.B.E.</p>
<p>Imagine a magnetic sphere hovering above your hands. Move the sphere around and feel it pull on your nonphysical body in different directions</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll start to get a feeling of a fuzzy ball of awareness around your hands</p>
<p><b>Magnetic Spheres Multiplication</b></p>
<p>Double the strength of the sphere to get a stronger feeling. After a few moments double it again. Then double it once more after a bit. Keep doubling it every minute or so until you have a very strong feeling of attraction around your hands.</p>
<p>Remember this is the feeling for when you use gravity press and safety cap. When you want to press out or rotate around, create the feeling of the force you want and complete the exit.</p>
<p><b>Using Focused Awareness To Pull Yourself Up</b></p>
<p>Remember with gravity press, one of the disadvantages was that if you press down too far it can make the resulting O.B.E darker and lower energy. One way around that is to use focused awareness to imagine gravity is pulling you up. This is slightly more difficult to do but it actually helps make the O.B.E brighter.</p>
<p>To do this, first put your awareness on the feeling of gravity like normal. Then rotate that feeling around so it&#8217;s pulling you up and you&#8217;ve created inverse gravity.</p>
<p><b>Magnetic Sphere Pulls You Up</b></p>
<p>Another variation is to simply use an imaginary magnetic sphere to overpower gravity and pull you up. Both of these methods work well. I actually am lazy and usually just do gravity press and twist, but you should definitely experiment with creating strange forces and odd angles because they&#8217;re very useful for manipulating the world once you&#8217;ve transitioned to an O.B.E.</p>
<p><b>Focused Awareness Resources</b></p>
<p>Focused awareness is used in many disciplines including qi-gong, tai chi, reiki, and others. It&#8217;s also the basis for Robert Bruce&#8217;s system called N.E.W. (or New Energy Ways) which is used in O.B.E.s. Check out his book &#8220;Astral Dynamics&#8221; for more on NEW.</p>
<p><b>How To Salvage Partial Exits: Limb Creation</b></p>
<p>A lot of times you&#8217;ll make it half-way out of your body but parts will still be stuck. For instance, you might find that you can free your arms but your legs are still glued in place and that even if you use your nonphysical hands to pull your legs out they just won&#8217;t budge. This brings us to the fifth movement-free exit technique called &#8220;Limb Creation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Once you have about half of your body out, instead of trying to get the rest of your limbs out, just imagine a completely new set of legs or arms or whatever is stuck. This is actually much easier than it sounds. You just imagine what it would feel like if your legs were already beneath you and you were already standing on them. Imagine the feeling of pressure on your feet, how your socks feel, and what your toes feel like when you wiggle them against each other. </p>
<p>You&#8217;ll quickly lose awareness of the limbs in your physical body and refocus into the copies of your legs that you&#8217;ve created. This process actually only takes a couple seconds and is a billion times easier than trying to yank your limbs out of your physical body.</p>
<p>The exit is the last stage of an O.B.E induction, but you probably still have some questions. In the next section we&#8217;ll go over the troubleshooting guide. This is the 3 Step System How To You Can Quickly Blow Up Your O.B.E Roadblocks.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here in part 10 you&#8217;ll find out why everything you&#8217;ve read about O.B.E vibrations in books is wrong and you&#8217;ll find out the 3 easiest ways to tell how close you are to an O.B.E.</p>
<p><b>The Top 3 Signals To Tell How Close You Are To An OBE</b></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never done an O.B.E before, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to know if you&#8217;re making any progress until you&#8217;re actually already out of your body or in a lucid dream. What you need are easy to detect signals that you can use like road signs to tell you how close you are to succeeding. In this section we&#8217;ll cover the top 3 most common road signs. These are:</p>
<p>1 &#8211; The sleep paralysis wave<br />
2 &#8211; Pre O.B.E rushing noises<br />
3 &#8211; Vibrations</p>
<p><b>Sleep Paralysis Wave: Your Primary Signal</b></p>
<p>We already covered the sleep paralysis wave in Lucidology 101 part 2. Essentially when your body shuts itself down in sleep paralysis you&#8217;ll feel something like a heavy lead blanket feeling being laid on your body. This feeling is unmistakable and a sign that you&#8217;re very close to success and you can use the exit techniques we&#8217;ll cover in part 12 to turn the paralysis into an O.B.E. </p>
<p><b>Pre-O.B.E. Rushing Noises: The Second Most Frequent Signal</b></p>
<p>The second road sign to watch for are pre-O.B.E rushing noises. When you tune in between stations on a radio you get the sound of random static and<br />
white noise. Once you&#8217;re back on a station again things come in clearly. It&#8217;s the same thing with O.B.E.s. You start out completely focused in your normal waking environment and as you drop into a subconscious focus you pass through a kind of no man&#8217;s land where you&#8217;re not really conscious and you&#8217;re not really subconscious.</p>
<p><b>Rushing Noises Can Sound Like A Tornado Or Freight Train</b></p>
<p>When you&#8217;re tuned to that no-man&#8217;s land frequency you hear rushing noises that sound like random static or a train rushing by.</p>
<p><b>Vibrations: The Most Famous Progress Signal</b></p>
<p>About the same time you hear rushing noises you may feel what are called O.B.E vibrations. Vibrations are probably the most famous phenomenon associated with O.B.E.s and they&#8217;re also the effect that has the most misconceptions. Almost everything to be found in books on O.B.E.s about vibrations is simply wrong and so this is a place where a lot of people get stuck. They reach the vibration stage and then get hung up because they use an ineffective method from bad advice they read in a book.</p>
<p><b>The 3 Critical Vibrations Misconceptions</b></p>
<p>The 3 misconceptions about vibrations are: </p>
<p>1.) What they are</p>
<p>2.) What they mean</p>
<p>3.) How to use them.</p>
<p><b>What Vibrations Are Not</b></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what vibrations are not. Vibrations are not a subjective kind of thing where you it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re &#8220;feeling the vibes, man, far out!&#8221;. Vibrations are much more mundane than that. </p>
<p><b>What Are Vibrations Like?</b></p>
<p>If you make a VVVVV sound, the feeling of vibrations in your lips is very similar to the feeling of vibrations that often appear along with medium stages of paralysis. Sometimes the vibrations can been extremely strong and feel like electricity, other times they are entirely absent. It&#8217;s very rare for vibrations to be strong enough to be painful, usually they just feel like a harmless buzzing in your head and chest area. </p>
<p><b>Types Of O.B.E Vibrations</b></p>
<p>However sometimes they can go throughout your entire body. These can be incredibly loud and feel like you&#8217;re holding on to a chain saw. A lot of people report feeling them in the spine. In one case I woke up into an O.B.E in my bed and it sounded exactly like there was someone with a hedge trimmer outside my window. I realized it was because I had off the chart vibrations that were coming from what I later found to be the L1 lumbar vertebrae in my lower back. I used deep breathing to return myself from the O.B.E because I was running more energy than what seemed safe.</p>
<p><b>Most O.B.E Vibrations Are Harmless</b></p>
<p>That was a very unusual experience and most of the time you actually won&#8217;t have any vibrations at all and if you do it&#8217;s no more powerful than the feeling of a vibrating cell phone.</p>
<p>The basic thing to know is that once you&#8217;ve had vibrations, you will know it. There won&#8217;t be any question in your mind about it because it&#8217;s just a buzzing feeling and noise.</p>
<p><b>Misconception #2: What O.B.E Vibrations Mean</b></p>
<p>The second misconception is that most books will tell you that when you have vibrations you&#8217;re ready to exit into the O.B.E. This is completely the polar opposite of reality. Vibrations mean that you are NOT ready to exit and here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p><b>Double Energy From Two Signals</b></p>
<p>Physical and nonphysical awarenesses are both types of signals that you focus on. During the middle stage of an O.B.E exit you&#8217;re making the transition from one to the other and you experience both physical and nonphysical signals. These signals have energy. When you sum both of these signals together you pass through a phase where you&#8217;re running double the amount of energy you normally would.</p>
<p><b>Double Energy Can Result In Intermodulation Distortion</b></p>
<p>If this energy is more than your system can comfortably handle, you get distortion. The big fancy signal processing name for this is intermodulation distortion. The name is not so important as the fact that this energy hump does not go on forever, it comes and then goes and this is critical to understanding how to deal with vibrations.</p>
<p><b>Vibrations Mean You’re Not Ready To Exit: Wait For &#8220;The Quiet Zone&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Because the excess energy hump comes and goes, you get a &#8216;quiet zone&#8217; once you&#8217;ve focused completely out of physical focus and in to nonphysical focus. So it looks like this: you start out in physical focus with no vibes. You relax into a near O.B.E and get light vibes. You relax almost to the point of separation and get majorly heavy vibes. This is where most people screw it up because of the bad advice in books. The trick is to simply continue to relax deeper and deeper past the vibrations until the vibes have smoothed out completely. Once you&#8217;re in the quiet zone after the vibes, that&#8217;s how you know you&#8217;ve completely shifted into the O.B.E.</p>
<p><b>Unbalanced Tires Analogy</b></p>
<p>The energy hump is like a truck I used to have with unbalanced tires. When it got up to 45 MPH it would start vibrating the entire truck. At 55 MPH it would smooth out again. The range of 45 to 55 MPH was a transition range that caused the tires to vibrate with each other. Pre O.B.E. rushing noises and vibrations are the same thing: you&#8217;re coming in and out of phase with two different physical and nonphysical signals.</p>
<p><b>What About Vibrationless O.B.E.s?</b></p>
<p>Keep in mind that the vibrations only happen when the total energy goes beyond what your nonphysical body is capable of conducting. The more O.B.E.s you do, the more energy you can run without problems and the less vibrations you&#8217;ll have. Eventually almost all your O.B.E.s will be vibration-free. </p>
<p><b>Vibrationless O.B.E.s</b></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll go from waking awareness, with no vibes, all the way to the O.B.E with no vibes which means you&#8217;ll have to rely on other signals that we&#8217;ll cover later to tell if you&#8217;re in the O.B.E. The up side to this is that vibrationless O.B.E.s are much brighter and clearer than O.B.E.s where you have to punch through massive vibrations. </p>
<p><b>Why Vibrationless O.B.E.s Are Brighter And Clearer</b></p>
<p>Why would that be? In a chainsaw, the noise is caused by friction. Vibrations are a form of noise, so vibrations are a form of friction. Friction is waste of energy. Chainsaw noise is a waste of physical energy and so vibrations are a waste of nonphysical energy.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re in vibrations you&#8217;re wasting energy so it&#8217;s a state you want to relax through as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><b>Misconception #3: What To Do With Vibrations</b></p>
<p>The next misconception is what to do once you&#8217;re in vibrations. For instance, Robert Monroe wrote that you should try to &#8216;sweep&#8217; the vibrations up and down your body before separating. Is this good advice or not?</p>
<p><b>Relaxation Is The Only Solution</b></p>
<p>The only way to reduce vibrations is to reduce the pressure that causes friction and that means relaxing.</p>
<p>If you reach vibrations and then try to do something, whether it&#8217;s running the vibrations up and down your body or anything else, then the one thing you&#8217;re NOT doing is relaxing. And relaxing is exactly the one thing that you need to do when you have vibrations because only way to release the friction is to relax. No other solution will work.</p>
<p>This is why vibrations are a major obstacle for more OBEers, because when they try to do something, anything, they are unable to simply relax into the quiet zone.</p>
<p>Definitely do NOT try to force your way out when you&#8217;re in the middle of vibrations. You&#8217;ll almost certainly just get pulled right back into your body since you haven&#8217;t yet matched up with a nonphysical focus.</p>
<p><b>The &#8220;How Close To An O.B.E? Meter&#8221;: Relax Through Vibrations</b></p>
<p>Even if you do manage to muscle your way out, you&#8217;ll have spent so much energy on the exit that the resulting O.B.E will probably be so dark and low energy that you&#8217;ll just stagger around and not be able to do anything fun anyway. It&#8217;s far better to relax through vibrations into the quiet zone and then slip out of body effortlessly.</p>
<p><b>The Sneaky Loop Hole: Photographic Trance</b></p>
<p>By the way, there is a sneaky loop hole that allows you to cheat so you can do O.B.E.s even when you&#8217;re in the middle of vibrations. We&#8217;ll cover this sneaky cheat in Lucidology 102 part 3. The trick is to enter something called a photographic trance which allow you to have O.B.E.s at much lighter levels of trance so you don&#8217;t have to be in full sleep paralysis to separate.</p>
<p><b>Exiting Even In The Middle Of Vibrations</b></p>
<p>This loophole also opens the door to a technique called &#8216;trance recycling&#8217; . Trance recycling allows you to have a dozen or more O.B.E.s in a row and quickly rack up a massive number of O.B.E.s in a single session.

<p>Because many O.B.E.s are completely vibrationless, you need several other road signs to tell how close you are to success. In the next section we&#8217;ll cover the 5 crucial progress signals to tell how close you are to an O.B.E.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of times when you enter an O.B.E you&#8217;ll find that you can&#8217;t see. This is called exit blindness. Here in part 9 we&#8217;ll cover the 3 simplest and quickest solutions to exit blindness to recover your sight as fast as possible.</p>
<p>
<b>The 3 Main Exit Blindness Causes</b></p>
<p>Exit blindness is due to three main reasons:</p>
<p>
1.) First, that your eyes have been sealed shut by some kind of nonphysical glue. </p>
<p>2.) Second that you don&#8217;t have enough energy to open your nonphysical eyes. </p>
<p>3.) Third you don&#8217;t have energy to power your nonphysical eyes.</p>
<p>
<b>Eye Glue Causes Exit Blindness</b></p>
<p>The first problem is that in the O.B.E your eyes sometimes start out with some kind of glue that&#8217;s holding your eyelids together. Strange as it may seem this is a recurring effect that many people have reported and that I have experienced many times.</p>
<p>
<b>Use &#8216;Eye Pry’ To Open Your Eyes</b></p>
<p>The quickest solution to glued eyelids is to use your nonphysical hands to pry your eyelids open. This is called the &#8216;eye pry&#8217; method. Sometimes the glue is very strong and it can actually be painful to pull them open. The glue can also have a kind of magnetic effect so that once you have your eyes open the glue pulls them back together. You have to keep on top of things and keep pulling your eyes open in order to keep your sight turned on. You can also use eye pry in the 2nd case where you have enough energy to power your eyes but not enough to open your eyelids.</p>
<p>
<b>3 Solutions To Blindness From Low Energy</b></p>
<p>In the 3rd case where you don&#8217;t even have enough energy to power your eyes there are 3 main solutions. These are:</p>
<p>1.) Deep breathing</p>
<p>2.) Improving your mood</p>
<p>3.) mental projections.</p>
<p>
<b>Use Deep Breathing To Brighten The O.B.E</b></p>
<p>The first solution is to use deep breathing to power your nonphysical body. This solution is not a cure all but it can definitely improve your sight and make things brighter.<br />
You need to be careful with this method because it can cause your physical body to wake up. </p>
<p>Recall that one way to break paralysis is to simply change your breathing so your body notices you&#8217;re awake. While that does break paralysis, there is also a middle ground where you can breathe deeply to power your nonphysical body but also not breathe so deeply so that your body notices the difference. The only way to know what that feels like is to practice by entering sleep paralysis and seeing how much you can deep breathe without breaking the paralysis.</p>
<p>
<b>Improve Your Mood To See</b></p>
<p>The second main solution is to improve your mood in the O.B.E. Your mood often determines how bright and clear your O.B.E will be. By putting yourself in a very positive frame of mind you can largely avoid dark O.B.E.s and you may never have a problem with blindness in the first place. However this solution isn&#8217;t 100% effective and isn&#8217;t very useful if you&#8217;re trying to recover sight in a lucid nightmare.</p>
<p>
<b>Mental Projections</b></p>
<p>The third solution is what&#8217;s called a mental projection. This is an advanced technique that relies heavily on visualizations. However it&#8217;s also extremely powerful and this is actually what I rely on most because it is 100% effective to cure exit blindness. This is because in a mental projection you&#8217;re able to see without seeing and so exit blindness is not a factor. </p>
<p>A lot of times when I enter an O.B.E I won&#8217;t even bother to get my eyes working and I&#8217;ll just enter a mental projection which gives you all the sensory information you need but without actually seeing anything at all. Lucidology 101 is all about visualization-free techniques. However Lucidology 102 is all about how to use visualizations to dramatically accelerate your O.B.E progress. In Lucidology 102 I&#8217;ll show you exactly how to do mental projections make exit blindness a non-issue.</p>
<p>Up next in part 10 you&#8217;ll find out why everything you&#8217;ve read about O.B.E vibrations in books is wrong and you&#8217;ll find out the 3 easiest ways to tell how close you are to an O.B.E.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a lot of O.B.E.s it&#8217;s really hard to tell what&#8217;s going on and whether you&#8217;re in an O.B.E or not. Here in Lucidology 101 part 8 you&#8217;re about to find out the 4 easiest ways to take the red pill so you know if you&#8217;ve shifted into an O.B.E or not. </p>
<p><b>O.B.E.s Can Be Much More Hyper-Detailed Than Waking Awareness</b></p>
<p>Lucid dreams and O.B.E.s can be extremely realistic. In fact, a lot of times it&#8217;s very hard to tell if you&#8217;re actually awake or if you&#8217;re dreaming. </p>
<p>In fact, sometimes they are actually more realistic than waking awareness. Sometimes after an O.B.E you&#8217;ll find that your physical sight is actually hazy and dream-like compared to the hyper detailed realism of the O.B.E.</p>
<p><b>High Dynamic Range Visuals In O.B.Es</b></p>
<p>For example, a lot of times your vision will have what photographers called &#8220;High Dynamic Range&#8221; or HDR. HDR means that there&#8217;s a higher range between the bright areas and the dark areas. HDR is anything but dream-like and you may not think at first that you&#8217;re actually in an O.B.E because your sight has so much detail. Your sight may also seem like it has a lot more pixels than you have when physically aware. In fact, these O.B.E.s should be called &#8220;high bandwidth experiences&#8221; because of all the extra sensory information you take in</p>
<p><b>First Awake/asleep Cycle Is Usually Kind Of Sloppy</b></p>
<p>This effect is compounded when you use the timer method we covered in Lucidology 101 part 7. Remember that the hypnotic fractionation effect causes you to hover on the awake asleep threshold when you enter and exit trance over and over. The first couple times you wake up and fall asleep, it&#8217;s relatively easy to tell if you&#8217;re nonphysical or physical because it&#8217;s kind of a sloppy cycle and you swing wildly around between being awake and asleep.</p>
<p><b>The Next Awake/asleep Cycle Is Tighter</b></p>
<p>However as the hypnotic fractionation effect kicks in, the cycles start to get tighter and tighter.</p>
<p><b>Eventually You’re Alternating Very Tightly</b></p>
<p>The O.B.E.s start to become more and more realistic. Eventually it can be very difficult to tell if you&#8217;re waking up into your physical bedroom or if you&#8217;re in an O.B.E.</p>
<p><b>False Awakening Loops</b></p>
<p>This is called a false-awakening loop in which you think you wake up but end up in an O.B.E. You wake up again and end up in another O.B.E. It may take a couple tries before you really do wake up in your physical bedroom again.</p>
<p><b>False Awakening Loops From Spiraling Off-center</b></p>
<p>This is because you&#8217;ve started spirally off center toward a nonphysical focus. What you need is a way to know that you&#8217;re in an O.B.E and wake up for real.</p>
<p><b>How To Deal With The False-awakening Loop?</b></p>
<p>Basically you need a way to take the red pill. This is called a reality check. And not just any reality check will do, you need a movement-free reality check so that you can do it without disturbing your trance. </p>
<p><b>You Need Multiple Reality Checks</b></p>
<p>In fact you need a set of reality checks because there is no single silver bullet reality check which is 100% reliable.</p>
<p><b>The 4 Easiest Movement-free Reality Checks</b></p>
<p>Here are the 4 most effective, most reliable and easiest reality tests that you can start using immediately. I have tested each of these many times to see how well they work and what pitfalls to watch for. These are:</p>
<p>1.) The blindfold test</p>
<p>2.) Transparent eyelids</p>
<p>3.) Overlaid sight</p>
<p>4.) The spoon bending test</p>
<p><b>The Blindfold Reality Check: The Simplest Reality Check</b></p>
<p>First is the blindfold reality check. This is easiest reality check of all. </p>
<p>All you do is put on a blindfold and relax into sleep. If at any time you find that you can see the room through the blindfold then you know you&#8217;re in a subconscious dream environment and you&#8217;re looking at the dream version of your room.</p>
<p>The advantages are that it&#8217;s simple and requires no practice<br />
Secondly, once it works, there&#8217;s no doubt in your mind that it really did work.<br />
Also, it&#8217;s an ongoing reality check. It&#8217;s not something that comes and goes in an instant.</p>
<p><b>Secret System For Free O.B.E.s That Require No Work</b></p>
<p>So here&#8217;s way you can use the blindfold test for free O.B.E.s that require exactly zero work.<br />
The fact is you probably are already having many spontaneous morning O.B.E.s but don&#8217;t realize they&#8217;re O.B.E.s because you don&#8217;t have a system to catch these when they happen. All you need to do is get in the habit of sleeping with a blindfold on. Whenever you wake up and are able to see, you&#8217;ll have just gotten a free O.B.E without doing any extra work!</p>
<p><b>Blindfold Reality Check: Disadvantages</b></p>
<p>As good as the blindfold test is, it does have its disadvantages<br />
For instance you may find the blindfold is distracting and that it&#8217;s hard to relax with it on. If you try this method I do recommend getting a padded blindfold  in the $20 to $30 range because I find the cheap ones are too uncomfortable to be of any real use.</p>
<p>The second disadvantage is exit blindness. Exit blindness happens a lot especially for new OBEers. When this happens you enter the dream and find that you are blind and so you can&#8217;t see with or without the blindfold.</p>
<p>Dream blindness happens a lot and there are solutions to it that we&#8217;ll cover later. However, all of these solutions require that you be lucid in the dream so it won&#8217;t help if you&#8217;re trying to use sight as a reality check.</p>
<p><b>Transparent Eyelids</b></p>
<p>One solution is to use the transparent eyelids effect. Transparent eyelids means that you see through your closed eyes into the nonphysical version of your bedroom. </p>
<p>This has the advantage of not wearing a distracting blindfold.</p>
<p>The disadvantage with the transparent eyelids effect is it&#8217;s difficult to feel whether your eyelids are really open or closed.</p>
<p>So the way the transparent eyelids check often works is that it&#8217;s after the fact. You first become lucid, then you notice you can see, and then you open your physical eyes and wake your physical body up.</p>
<p>Another scenario is that you open your eyes twice without closing them in between. You open them in the O.B.E and then open them again when you wake up physically.</p>
<p>In either case you may not know if you were nonphysically focused until it’s too late and you’re already physical again. So it’s very useful to have a check that works immediately as soon as you have a nonphysical focus.</p>
<p><b>Overlaid Sight Reality Check</b></p>
<p>The third reality check to watch for is overlaid sight which happens as soon as you&#8217;re nonphysical. When you&#8217;re nearing a nonphysical focus you&#8217;ll start to split your awareness between your waking surroundings and the dream version of your bedroom. Often you&#8217;ll see your nonphysical surroundings from a slightly different angle than your physical surroundings. This makes it look like you have two sets of sight overlaid on top of each other, like two movie projections. </p>
<p>Overlaid sight doesn&#8217;t last very long, usually you&#8217;ll see your vision flicker back and forth and then stabilize. It&#8217;s also rare to achieve overlaid sight because most of the time when you do O.B.E.s your eyes will be closed. Because of this you need a longer lasting check which brings us to the 4th movement free reality check called the &#8220;spoon bending&#8221; check. </p>
<p><b>Spoon Bending Reality Check</b></p>
<p>This brings us to the 4th movement free reality check which helps fix this. This reality check is the spoon bending check. </p>
<p>To do it, just fall asleep with a spoon in your hand.</p>
<p>When you think you might be in an O.B.E, squeeze the spoon and see if it bends.</p>
<p>As long as you don&#8217;t move any other part of your body, you can move your fingers slowly and slightly and not disturb your trance. So even though you are moving a little bit this still counts as a movement-free reality check</p>
<p><b>Kat Black And Waking Awareness Spoon Bending</b></p>
<p>Kat Black of fork-you.com seems to be able to soften metal in ways that should be impossible.</p>
<p>For example, bending the bowl of a spoon should require more force than a human can physically generate, but she can apparently do it.</p>
<p>On her site she has a tutorial and videos on how she bends metal, I suggest you go check it out. Even if you can&#8217;t bend metal physically like she can, it&#8217;s still good to see what it&#8217;s like for when you do it in an O.B.E.</p>
<p><b>What Spoon Bending In An O.B.E. Is Like</b></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what it will be like when you bend a spoon in an O.B.E. The metal will be extremely easy to bend. It&#8217;s about like bending a wire twist tie.<br />
When you wake up, the spoon will be back to normal</p>
<p>In this section we mentioned exit blindness and how very often in O.B.E.s when you first enter a nonphysical awareness you&#8217;ll find that you can&#8217;t see. In the next section we&#8217;ll cover the most effective and simple ways for fixing exit blindness so you can make the most of each O.B.E. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to do O.B.E.s or lucid dreams in the past but weren&#8217;t able to pull it off and you were left wondering if there was something you were missing, maybe there was some secret missing piece and if you only had that missing piece that things would be a lot easier, well here it is. In this article I&#8217;m going to show you the missing piece that I wish I&#8217;d known about when I first started.</p>
<p><b>Congratulations! You’ve Found The Missing Piece!</b></p>
<p>Here in Lucidology 101 Part 7 we&#8217;ll cover the &#8220;timer method&#8221;. This is a very powerful trick that allows you to cheat and easily trigger as many O.B.E.s as you want. I&#8217;ve read pretty much every book on O.B.E.s and I&#8217;ve tested every single method I could find. There really is no other method that gives faster results than this. In fact, it&#8217;s possible you&#8217;ll have your very first O.B.E the very first time you use this. That doesn&#8217;t always happen, but quite a few people have written in to tell me that this was the secret that got them over the edge to start having frequent O.B.E.s in just one night.</p>
<p>At the end of this article I&#8217;ll show you how you can get a free copy of the Lucidology 101 O.B.E Explorer&#8217;s kit so be sure to read to the end for the URL.</p>
<p><b>The Story So Far: Sleep Triggers To Fall Asleep Fast</b></p>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve learned to put the body to sleep as fast as you can and enter a subconscious focus. You start out awake and alert, on the upper right and end asleep and in a subconscious trance on the lower left. But what we really want looks more like this&#8230;</p>
<p><b>What You Want: Hover On The Awake/asleep Threshold</b></p>
<p>What you want is to &#8220;hover on the awake/asleep threshold&#8221; so that you slip into a subconscious focus without losing too much awareness by slipping into deep sleep. This way your retain full awareness in your subconscious.</p>
<p><b>The Main Problem With Tricking Your Body Into Falling Asleep</b></p>
<p>You may be thinking, &#8220;easier said than done!&#8221; because what usually happens when people try to have an O.B.E is they just fall asleep and that&#8217;s the end of it.</p>
<p><b>Spontaneous Lucidity While Asleep</b></p>
<p>The solution most books give is to hope that you somehow magically become aware within the dream spontaneously. The idea is that by telling yourself over and over while you&#8217;re awake to become lucid you&#8217;ll eventually have lucid dreams just from force of habit alone. This is possible but it&#8217;s very unreliable. It takes months of practice to get this to work and even when you can do it, it&#8217;s always a matter of luck. You never know for sure if you&#8217;re going to have an O.B.E on any given night.</p>
<p><b>What Can You Do That’s Reliable?</b></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the secret: what if you could cheat and manufacture your own lucidity trigger so that even if you fell completely asleep you&#8217;d still end up having an O.B.E?</p>
<p><b>Our Secret Weapon Cheat: The Digital Cooking Timer</b></p>
<p>It turns out such a secret weapon does exist. It&#8217;s called a digital cooking timer.</p>
<p>The idea is to fall asleep like normal and don&#8217;t even try to stay aware. You set the timer to beep so it wakes you up a few minutes later. By waking up and falling asleep every few minutes without moving you&#8217;ve formed a safety net so that you don&#8217;t fall too deeply asleep but enter a subconscious focus.</p>
<p><b>How To Use Hypnotic Fractionation To Have O.B.E.s Easily</b></p>
<p>This uses a principle from hypnosis called &#8216;fractionation&#8217;. Hypnotic fractionation means that when you are put into trance and then are taken from that trance, the next time you enter trance you&#8217;ll enter it more deeply than before. That means that if you can enter even the slightest trance then you can enter a very deep trance just by going in and out of that trance over and over.  This is how you can hover on the awake asleep threshold and ease your way into an O.B.E without really having to use a lot of practice or skill.</p>
<p><b>Remember The &#8220;Roll Over Word&#8221; Sleep Command&#8221; Equation:</b></p>
<p>Remember that everything we covered earlier about the roll signal still applies. This only works when you use the timer and do not move ever at any point. </p>
<p><b>Simple, Proven Success Formula</b></p>
<p>If you wake up and fall asleep 4 or 5 times in an hour without moving you&#8217;ll start to have spontaneous paralysis, O.B.E vibrations and O.B.E.s. However if you wake up and fall asleep twice, shift position, and then wake up and fall asleep 3 more times then it won&#8217;t work nearly as well.</p>
<p><b>8 Steps To An O.B.E Using Hypnotic Fractionation</b></p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the big picture in a nutshell. First you wake up and fall asleep 4 or 5 times without moving using a timer and the sleep commands from Lucidology 101 parts 3 and 4. This will put you in sleep paralysis. You then use movement-free reality checks which we&#8217;ll cover in part 8 to check that you&#8217;ve shifted into a nonphysical focus. Then you use an exit method to convert paralysis into an O.B.E or lucid dream. We&#8217;ll cover basic exit methods in Lucidology 101 part 12 and advanced exit methods in Lucidology 102.</p>
<p><b>Timer Options</b></p>
<p>To do this you have a couple options for timers including cooking timers, timer mp3s and the Lucidology Flash timer.</p>
<p><b>Using A Digital Cooking Timer</b></p>
<p>I started out using a $10 cooking timer and it works just fine. To use one of these, memorize the buttons so you can reset it using your thumb without looking at it. Sleep with it in one hand, move ONLY your thumb when resetting it and the rest of your body will stay in paralysis. </p>
<p><b>Timer Mp3s</b></p>
<p>Alternately, in your Lucidology explorer&#8217;s kit you get timer mp3s that contain the predefined timer setups. To get these, visit <a href="http://www.Lucidology.com" target="_blank">www.Lucidology.com</a></p>
<p><b>A More Powerful Flash Timer</b></p>
<p>Finally, you can use the Lucidology Flash timer which also comes in your free Lucidology lucid dream kit. The flash timer allows you to customize your timer setup and change the intervals between the beeps however you want.</p>
<p><b>Ramp Timer Setup: The Reliable Workhorse</b></p>
<p>Your timer setup has a giant impact on how many O.B.E.s you have. I&#8217;ve spent countless hours testing various timer setups and here is the most reliable workhorse setup. It&#8217;s called &#8220;ramp&#8221; and the intervals are 8 minutes, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 20, and then 6 minutes repeating. </p>
<p><b>Ramp Timer Setup: What To Expect</b></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you can expect when you use the ramp setup. During the middle of the 20 minute intervals you&#8217;re likely to have lucid dreams and possibly spontaneous O.B.E.s. During the tail end 6 minute intervals you&#8217;re likely to have O.B.E.s. Here&#8217;s why&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Waking Up The Same Time Every Day Using A Timer</b></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever used an alarm clock to wake up at the same time each morning you may have found that you started waking up 5 minutes before the alarm actually started beeping. You had conditioned the subconscious to expect the beep, but it does not like to be shocked awake. So its response is to wake you up before the beep. </p>
<p><b>Ramp Works By Faking The Subconscious Out</b></p>
<p>You can use this effect to your advantage by faking the subconscious out. The initial 8 minute interval is used for relaxation. After that the intervals start out short and increase in length, going from 4 up to 20 minutes. By the time you get to the 20 minute interval your subconscious is starting to expect another beep in the next 4 to 16 minutes. </p>
<p>To avoid the shock the subconscious goes on alert at around 4, 8 or 12 minutes. However, during the 20 minute intervals those beeps never come. This is enough to make you become spontaneously lucid in the middle of a dream in expectation of the &#8216;phantom&#8217; timer beep that never happens. </p>
<p><b>The Phantom Beep Only Affects The Mind, Not The Body</b></p>
<p>The phantom beep can also give you waking sleep paralysis because body continues to sleep and doesn&#8217;t care about the phantom beep.</p>
<p><b>Are You Focused In The Dream Or In Your Body?</b></p>
<p>Whether you get a lucid dream or O.B.E from this depends on where you&#8217;re focusing at the moment of the phantom beep: either in a dream or on your physical body.</p>
<p>If you get a lucid dream your clarity level will likely be less than most O.B.E.s. However lucid dreams are often a lot more fun because they often start out in some kind of strange otherworldly area which is usually more fun to explore than the nonphysical version of your physical surroundings.</p>
<p>However, O.B.E.s often have much higher clarity than lucid dreams. When you use the timer method you&#8217;ll end up with plenty of each so you can decide which you prefer.</p>
<p><b>Tail-end O.B.E.s: The Other Half Of The Ramp</b></p>
<p>The shorter tail end intervals usually result in O.B.E.s rather than lucid dreams. This is because of the hypnotic fractionation effect we mentioned earlier. </p>
<p><b>O.B.E.s In Short Intervals: Why?</b></p>
<p>During the short intervals you don&#8217;t have time to slip very deeply into sleep like you do with the long intervals. This causes you to hover much more closely on the awake asleep threshold so that when a beep comes you&#8217;re more likely to have a physical focus you can use for an O.B.E.</p>
<p><b>How To Trick Your Body Into Falling Asleep</b></p>
<p>This is the simplest way to trick your body into falling asleep and feel the paralysis wave. When the timer beeps, your body may wake up for a moment but as long as you stay perfectly still your body will create the paralysis wave and put itself to sleep after 5 or 10 seconds. This is also an excellent time to use the sleep triggers from Lucidology 101 part 4 to command the body into paralysis.</p>
<p><b>Trick You Can Use Tonight To Have Your 1st Obe</b></p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the actual method to use to have conscious sleep paralysis for the first time or even an O.B.E. </p>
<p>1.)	Go to bed at 9 PM</p>
<p>2.)	Get up at 4:30 AM</p>
<p>3.)	Stay up for 45 minutes until 5:15 AM and avoid lights</p>
<p>4.)	Go back to bed and do &#8220;Stop Drop And Roll&#8221; to start to fall asleep</p>
<p>5.)	At the end of S.D.R set your timer to use a ramp timer session. Fall asleep and let the timer wake you up and put you in an O.B.E.</p>
<p><b>Timer Method Disadvantages</b></p>
<p>As good as this method is it does have two drawbacks. First is your sleep cycle. The second is false awakenings.</p>
<p><b>The Timer Method &#038; Your Sleep Cycle</b></p>
<p>Getting up early in the morning to do O.B.E.s is effective but it can leave you tired the rest of the day. The solution is called &#8220;Inductionless O.B.E.s&#8221;. Inductionless O.B.E.s are my favorite style of accessing the subconscious because they allow you to have O.B.E.s without messing up your sleep cycle. This is an advanced method that we cover in Lucidology 102 Part 8. </p>
<p><b>False Awakening Loops</b></p>
<p>The second disadvantage the timer method has is actually because it&#8217;s so powerful. This side effect is called a false awakening loop in which you think you wake up physically but actually wake up into another O.B.E. You may have to wake up several times before you really do wake up in your physical bedroom again.</p>
<p><b>How To Deal With The False-awakening Loop?</b></p>
<p>To solve this you basically need a way to take the red pill and figure out where you are and what&#8217;s going on. This is called a reality check. And not just any reality check will do, you need a movement-free reality check so that you can do it without disturbing your trance. </p>
<p><b>Lucidology 101 – Part 8: &#8220;The 4 Easiest Ways To Take The Red Pill&#8221;</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tested dozens of types of movement free reality checks and boiled them down to the 4 most reliable ones. Be sure to read part 8 next to find out what they are.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here in Part 6 you&#8217;ll find out how to use the sun to avoid the #1 mistake in O.B.E.s &#038; how to optimize your brain chemistry.</p>
<p>Plus &#8211; The ONE O.B.E. induction I would use if I was not allowed to use any others.</p>
<p><b>The #1 Biggest Mistake Almost Everyone Makes!!</b></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a mistake I see almost EVERYBODY make. This is not their fault since most of the books on O.B.E.s are actually telling them to make this mistake. People often ask for advice on forums about how to induce O.B.E.s. The posts often start out saying: &#8220;Last night I went to bed to do an O.B.E.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here they&#8217;ve actually already made the cardinal O.B.E mistake. The mistake is: Don&#8217;t do your O.B.E. attempts at night (like most books say). Instead do them in the early morning!!! </p>
<p><b>Optimal Brain Chemistry Is All About Timing</b></p>
<p>Optimal O.B.E. brain chemistry is all about timing and your body&#8217;s circadian rhythm. I&#8217;ve had literally thousands of O.B.E.s in the early morning. I&#8217;ve had fewer than ten at night. </p>
<p><b>Circadian Rhythm Brain Chemistry</b></p>
<p>The two main chemicals involved are called serotonin and melatonin</p>
<p><b>Serotonin Is Your &#8216;On’ Switch</b></p>
<p>Serotonin is your on switch and helps you stay alert and lucid. It&#8217;s a &#8220;feel-good&#8221; neurotransmitter which helps your brain&#8217;s neurons transmit signals more freely. </p>
<p><b>Melatonin Is Your &#8216;Off’ Switch</b></p>
<p>Your body uses serotonin to make melatonin which is your off switch and helps you relax. It tells your body to shut down for sleep and begin repairing. Melatonin stimulates the immune system. It&#8217;s also associated with anti-aging and the human growth hormone and is an antioxidant.</p>
<p><b>The Melatonin Circadian Rhythm</b></p>
<p>Serotonin is made when your body is exposed to light. Melatonin is made from serotonin at night in the dark. Melatonin breaks down under light. This creates the melatonin circadian rhythm</p>
<p>At night time you have very little melatonin. It starts increasing around dusk and peaks around 2 to 4 AM. It then breaks down again at dawn.</p>
<p><b>The Cortisol Circadian Rhythm</b></p>
<p>The other secret ingredient is the &#8216;fight or flight&#8217; hormone called cortisol. Cortisol is depleted throughout the day but then surges back in the early morning in preparation to wake you up. The interplay between cortisol and melatonin creates THE ideal sweet spot for O.B.E.s in the early morning.</p>
<p><b>The Circadian Sweet Spot: 4 To 5:30 Am</b></p>
<p>This sweet spot is between around 4 AM and 5:30 AM. During the sweet spot relaxation is easy because of relatively high melatonin levels and you&#8217;ve been relaxed for several hours during sleep. Alertness is easy because cortisol brings with it a rush of two other stimulants called epinephrine and norepinephrin. These stimulants are meant to help wake you up but you can use them for dream alertness instead</p>
<p><b>The Worst Time For O.B.E.s</b></p>
<p>Bed time is the single worst time of all for O.B.E.s because your brain chemistry is geared for the opposite of lucidity at that point. Instead it&#8217;s geared for zonking out which is what always happens in the questions I see in forums. At bed time you&#8217;re low on cortisol and melatonin. By the time you&#8217;ve relaxed enough to fall asleep your cortisol levels are so low you have virtually no chance or regaining lucidity.</p>
<p><b>&#8220;Wake Back To Bed&#8221;Is The Single Most Powerful Trick!</b></p>
<p>So that&#8217;s the wrong way to do it. Here&#8217;s the right way to do it. In fact if there was only one method I could use, this is the one. It&#8217;s called &#8220;wake-back-to-bed&#8221; and was invented by former NASA engineer Dr. Albert Taylor.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also the author of an excellent book called &#8220;Soul Traveler&#8221; which I definitely recommend.</p>
<p><b>How To Use The Circadian Sweet Spot</b></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how wake-back-to-bed works. Get up in the early morning during the O.B.E sweet spot, stay awake for a period of time then go back to sleep. Use the sleep paralysis methods we covered earlier and you&#8217;ll likely have spontaneous O.B.E.s and lucid dreams. We&#8217;ll use wake back to bed as the foundation for more an even more advanced induction later on called the timer method.</p>
<p><b>Why Wake Back To Bed Rocks The Hizzouse</b></p>
<p>The reason wake back to bed works so well is because of the fundamental theorem of sleep paralysis. If you wake up and fall asleep in the early morning you&#8217;re pretty much begging for sleep paralysis and spontaneous lucid dreams. In fact before I knew anything about O.B.E.s I used to have waking paralysis episodes all the time and didn&#8217;t know why. It was really irritating to wake up and not be able to move. I later realized it was because I was not sleeping well and was waking up for a few minutes and then going back to sleep without moving. That caused the paralysis and it&#8217;s the basis for pretty much all our other induction tricks.</p>
<p>So how do you improve on wake back to bed? The immediate answer is to tweak the amount of time you stay awake before going to sleep again.</p>
<p><b>Tweaking The Time You Stay Up: Two Options</b></p>
<p>You have two options:</p>
<p><b>Option 1: Wbtb + No Movement</b></p>
<p>1.)	The first is to stay up a short period. For this strategy you wake up, don&#8217;t move at all (don&#8217;t even move your eyes), fall back to sleep and keep awareness on your body for the sleep paralysis wave to come.</p>
<p><b>Option 2: Wbtb + Get Up In Between</b></p>
<p>2.)	The second strategy is the long period. You wake up, get up, stay up for a while, then go back to bed.</p>
<p>Both approaches work well but which should you use?</p>
<p>Going right back to sleep without moving makes it very easy to fall asleep again. However it&#8217;s very likely that you&#8217;ll fall completely asleep and not become lucid. Even so this is the method I use most because it requires no planning or effort.</p>
<p>With option 2 where you get up from bed for a while, it&#8217;s harder to fall asleep again. However it is very likely that you will become lucid if you do sleep. Research by Dr. Stephen LaBerge has shown getting up for an hour before going back to bed significantly increases lucidity.</p>
<p>My personal experience and most the people I&#8217;ve advised suggests 45 minutes works a slightly better than an hour. Several people who were not able to have success by staying up for an hour were able to have O.B.E.s simply by changing the wakefulness period to 45 minutes. Waiting until you start yawning again is a good rule of thumb.</p>
<p><b>Daytime Sunlight Increases O.B.Es</b></p>
<p>The amount of sun you get has a giant impact on your ability to have O.B.E.s because your body needs sun in order to make serotonin. Get at least an hour of outside sunlight at day break and sundown. Those are the best times to get sunlight without risk of a sunburn because the sun is so low in the sky.</p>
<p><b>1 Hour Of Gradual Darkness Before Bed Slays Insomnia</b></p>
<p>At night, make sure to turn the lights down at least an hour or so before going to bed. The body is not designed for the abrupt light to dark change that you get with artificial lighting. By turning the lights down gradually, you&#8217;ll simulate sunset and greatly reduce and chance of insomnia. </p>
<p><b>Tv Before Bed Wrecks O.B.E Inductions</b></p>
<p>Finally, always avoid TV at night. The first problem with TV is that it prevents the gradual period of darkness you need before sleep.</p>
<p>The second problem is more subtle. Research by psychophysiologist Thomas Mulholland showed that within 30 seconds of watching TV your brain enters an alpha state. There isn&#8217;t anything wrong with an alpha state by itself, in fact there are a lot of benefits to alpha waves which are beyond the scope of this section.</p>
<p><b>Tv &#038; Pot Put The Brain In Alpha</b></p>
<p>The problem is that in alpha the mind is much more suggestible than normal. Alpha is actually the state the brain enters in response to smoking pot. Watching TV is not the same as smoking pot but that is the direction TV is taking your brain by putting it in alpha.</p>
<p><b>Tv Causes Switch To Emotional Thinking And Numbs Critical Thinking</b></p>
<p>Herbert Krugman also showed that TV causes the left hemisphere to virtually shut down and the right hemisphere to become twice as active as the left. The left hemisphere is what the brain uses for critical thinking and analysis while the right side is more emotional. This switch from left to right causes the brain to release a surge of opioids into the bloodstream which has an anesthetic effect on the mind. </p>
<p><b>Brain Mush Mode Is Bad News For O.B.E.s</b></p>
<p>This is why watching TV for a long time makes it feel like your brain has turned to mush. The combination of these three effects:</p>
<p>First being awash in opioids, secondly having a numbed left hemisphere and third being tuned to an alpha state leaves the brain very susceptible to suggestion.</p>
<p>Brain mush mode opens the gate for all the commercials and other junk on TV to go directly past the mind&#8217;s usual critical thinking  defenses. If you go to sleep in that state it leads to hazy dreams. If you do have an O.B.E in that state it&#8217;s very unlikely to be very clear.</p>
<p>In the next section we&#8217;ll cover the fastest way ever to have O.B.E.s and lucid dreams. This technique is the missing piece that I wish I&#8217;d had when I first started doing O.B.E.s. It&#8217;s is called &#8220;the timer method&#8221; and allows you to cheat and easily trigger as many O.B.E.s as you want &#8211; without using visualizations at any point.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here in Lucidology 101 part 5 we&#8217;ll cover the exact relaxation routine you can use to fall asleep quickly to cure insomnia and enter waking sleep paralysis for frequent lucid dreams and O.B.E.s.</p>
<p><b>How To Save A Boatload Of Time On The Relaxation Stage</b></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to spend hours relaxing every part of your body to have O.B.E.s. About 90% of your body&#8217;s tension is in about 10% of your muscles. If you target just those key areas you can quickly relax enough that your body will interpret it as a signal to sleep. </p>
<p><b>The Best Place To Start Relaxing</b></p>
<p>Most books on relaxation say to lay down and start relaxing at your feet and work your way up to your head. That&#8217;s not the most effective way to do it because the vast majority of your body&#8217;s tension is in your jaws, not your feet. </p>
<p>The jaw is the strongest muscle area in terms of extorted force. The world record for bite strength is 975 foot-pounds for 2 seconds. No other muscle in your body can exert more total force than your jaw muscles and no other muscle holds more tension. </p>
<p><b>The Top 5 Health Problems From Excess Jaw Tension</b></p>
<p>Many people go their whole lives and never consciously think to relax their jaws. This causes bruxism, or &#8220;teeth grinding&#8221; which wears down your teeth and cause other problems such as:</p>
<p>1 &#8211; Tooth aches<br />
2 -	Headaches<br />
3 &#8211; Ear aches<br />
4 &#8211; Tinnitus (which is ringing in the ears)<br />
5 &#8211; Dizziness</p>
<p>So the very first thing I do before an O.B.E induction or falling asleep is to relax my jaws. This step is absolutely required. It only takes a few seconds so it gives you the most bang for your buck of all the relaxations you can do.</p>
<p><b>Step 1: Jaw Relaxation</b></p>
<p>Start with a very firm massage of the meaty part of your upper jaws in front of and below your ears. This is called your &#8220;masseter muscle&#8221; and is the single biggest culprit for locked up muscle knots in the entire body. Press strongly with your fingers on both sides of your head and get a &#8216;good hurt&#8217; feeling.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Palm Squeeze</b></p>
<p>The second step is to squeeze on both sides of your jaws with your palms instead of just your fingers. You can use quite a bit of force when you do this because your jaws are quite strong. Let your jaw go as slack as you can while pressing.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: The Jaw Stretch</b></p>
<p>It&#8217;s common to stretch before and after exercise such as stretching your legs by touching your toes. But have you ever stretched your jaws muscles? You may look silly doing this, but it really goes a long way to relaxing your jaws. So the third step is to relax your jaws as much as you can then use your fingers to pull your jaws open. You may be surprised how much your jaws resist your fingers but by stretching them you can get the tension out.</p>
<p>My grandfather was a professor of a science called relaxology. One of his colleagues could relax his jaws so much that you could wiggle it with your hands and it felt like there was almost nothing holding his jaws on his head. You don&#8217;t have to relax your jaws that much but I mention it to give you an idea just how much tension is in your jaws even if you think they&#8217;re relaxed.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: Horizontal Wall Chest Stretch</b></p>
<p>Step 4 is to stretch your arms and chest against the wall. Place a palm flat on the wall and turn the trunk of your body so that you get a good stretch from the very tips of your fingers, down your forearm, you bicep, shoulder and all across your chest. Exhale all the tension out. Repeat this twice with both arms.</p>
<p><b>Step 5: Vertical Chest Stretch</b></p>
<p>Step 5 is to stretch against the wall by placing both palms above your head against the wall and then bending forward. This really targets your shoulder and chest tension. Inhale and exhale fully and slowly 3 times to work all the tension out. Stand up normally, then repeat the vertical chest stretch.</p>
<p><b>Step 6: Stretch Your Feet</b></p>
<p>Step 6 is to stretch the bottom of your feet by propping your foot against the wall and leaning forward. This will also give you a good calf stretch. Repeat this on each foot two more times then sit down and massage the individual muscles in the soles of your feet with your hands.</p>
<p><b>Step 7: Stretch Your Hands</b></p>
<p>Step 7 is to stretch the palm of each hand by pushing your fingers back with the other hand. This also gives your forearms a nice stretch.</p>
<p><b>Step 8: Relax Your Shoulders</b></p>
<p>Step 8 is the last stretching step. Do some slow windmills to relax your shoulders. It&#8217;s tempting to skip this step but your shoulders carry almost as much tension as your jaw so it&#8217;s important to stretch and relax your shoulder as much as possible.</p>
<p><b>Step 9: &#8220;Pre-roll&#8221; To Dissipate Overall Body Tension</b></p>
<p>For step 9, remember that one purpose of the roll over signal is to get you to roll over which causes you to gradually gather and release tension. Here&#8217;s a trick to speed that up or even skip over it.</p>
<p>Lay down in bed and relax a much as you can for 15 seconds or so. Then roll over and relax for a couple more seconds. Roll again and relax&#8230; Repeat this several times and you&#8217;ll relax the rest of your muscles quite quickly.</p>
<p>This works because normally when you stretch one body part to relax it, you have to tense up another part.<br />
For instance, to stretch one hand you had to tense up your other hand. By laying down and rolling around for a minute you stretch and relax everything a little bit at a time and get your &#8220;roll over&#8221; phase done all at once. </p>
<p><b>Step 10: Stop Drop And Roll</b></p>
<p>Once you&#8217;re done rolling around, step 10 is to start Stop Drop And Roll. Lay flat on your back with your arms above your head and start daydreaming. See Lucidology 101 part 3 for how to do Stop Drop &#038; Roll to fall asleep if you haven&#8217;t yet.</p>
<p><b>Step  : Start Sleep Breathing</b></p>
<p>Step   is to begin sleep breathing. See Lucidology 101 part 4 for details if you haven&#8217;t seen it yet.</p>
<p><b>Step 12: Roll Eyes To Relax Them</b></p>
<p>Step 12 is to relax your eyes and the stop micromovements. Roll your eyes around both directions a few times and then let them rest. The idea is to completely forget that your eyes even exist. To do that count 150 heart beats.</p>
<p><b>Step 13: 150 Heart Beat Count To Forget About Eyes</b></p>
<p>Focusing on your heart for a long time will make it feel like it&#8217;s going to beat its way out of your chest. However if you get up and actually check your pulse you&#8217;ll find that it&#8217;s beating like normal. The heart pounding sensation is just a trick of the mind which will help to distract you from your eyes. </p>
<p><b>Step 12: Bring Arms Down To Enter &#8216;Drop&#8217; Mode</b></p>
<p>After 150 heart beats you&#8217;ve come to step 14 which is to switch on the roll over signal. Drop your arms down to your side and move to step 15 which is to tense and release each muscle group.</p>
<p><b>Step 15: Tense And Relax Muscles</b></p>
<p>By now you should be pretty deeply relaxed. Continue to sleep breathe and sense where you still have some tension left. Slightly tense that area for a moment then release it. This will cause you to relax that muscle further than before you tensed it. Start at your jaws and end at your feet.</p>
<p>To do this, count 150 heart beats starting at 300 which tires your brain out a little faster. After every 10 heart beats pause the count and tense and release another muscle group. For instance, when you get to 160 tense and relax your jaws. At 170 tense and release your face, at 180 your neck and so forth. If you lose track of where what number you&#8217;re on that&#8217;s a good sign that it&#8217;s working and you&#8217;re falling asleep.</p>
<p><b>Step 16: &#8216;Roll&#8217; Phase</b></p>
<p>When you get to 450 you&#8217;ll either be asleep or feeling the roll over signal. If you don&#8217;t have a very strong roll signal then just daydream and continue sleep breathing for a while until it&#8217;s strong enough. When you really feel the need to roll over you&#8217;ve reached step 16 which is to simply roll over and release any remaining tension. Continue sleep breathing and you&#8217;ll black out within a few moments.</p>
<p><b>Warm Socks</b></p>
<p>Two things that really speed things up are socks and earplugs. You may not realize how much your body temperature drops when you fall asleep but when you&#8217;re feet are just a little bit cold it&#8217;s really hard to relax. So wear socks even if you don&#8217;t think you need them.</p>
<p><b>Silicone Earplugs</b></p>
<p>Earplugs are also incredibly valuable for falling asleep fast. You can get them on amazon or Target. The silicone putty earplugs work the best and you can make them last several uses by washing them with soap after each use.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the complete system, step by step. </p>
<p>1	Jaw Massage<br />
2	Jaw Palm Squeeze<br />
3	Jaw Stretch<br />
4	Horizontal Wall Chest Stretch<br />
5	Vertical Chest Stretch<br />
6	Stretch Your Feet<br />
7	Stretch Your Hands<br />
8	Relax Your Shoulders<br />
9	&#8220;Pre-Roll&#8221; To Dissipate Overall Body Tension<br />
10	Start &#8220;Stop, Drop &#038; Roll&#8221;: Hands Above Your Head<br />
 	Start Sleep Breathing<br />
12	Roll Eyes To Relax Them<br />
13	150 Heart Beat Count To Forget About Eyes<br />
14	Bring Arms Down To Enter To &#8220;Drop&#8221; Mode<br />
15	Tense &#038; Relax Muscles That Are Still Tense<br />
16	Roll</p>
<p>Coming up in Part 6 you&#8217;ll find out how to use the sun to avoid the #1 mistake everyone makes in O.B.E.s &#038; how to optimize your brain chemistry for lucidity.</p>
<p>Plus we&#8217;ll cover the ONE O.B.E. induction I would use if I was not allowed to use any others. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here in Lucidology 101 part 4 we&#8217;ll cover 5 new sleep commands that you can use to quickly trick the body into falling asleep so you can end insomnia and have frequent lucid dreams and O.B.E.s.</p>
<p><b>The Discovery Of The Roll Over Signal And Sleep Paralysis Connection</b></p>
<p>A while back I had been up all night working on something. Around noon I was very tired and decided to lay down for a few moments. As I lay there I began to feel a very uncomfortable urge to roll over. For no real reason I decided to ignore it and just lay there. To my extreme surprise I felt the paralysis wave roll over me and put me in full sleep paralysis. </p>
<p>The paralysis was completely unexpected. I had always thought it was something you had to be very deeply relaxed to achieve. Instead I was actually fairly tense and my mind was not at all in any kind of meditative state.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d accidentally found something that I had never seen in any books on lucid dreaming. The roll over signal itself was all you need to enter paralysis. I spent the next several months experimenting with different variations of what I&#8217;d done. I began looking for other ways to command the body into sleep and here&#8217;s what I found.</p>
<p><b>The Two Types Of Sleep Commands</b></p>
<p>It turns out sleep commands come in two types: sleep starters and sleep triggers.</p>
<p><b>1.) Sleep Starters</b></p>
<p>Sleep starters are what you use to get the body to start thinking that maybe it&#8217;s time to fall asleep. For instance, using stop drop and roll is a sleep starter because it makes your body ask for permission to fall asleep by artificially creating the roll signal.</p>
<p><b>2.) Sleep Triggers</b></p>
<p>Sleep triggers are how you then tell it &#8220;Yes: fall asleep right now&#8221;. SDR has an implicit sleep trigger: when you simply ignore the roll over signal the body interprets it a trigger to enter sleep paralysis.</p>
<p><b>5 New Sleep Commands</b></p>
<p>In this section we&#8217;ll cover sleep breathing and stopped eye micromovements, which are sleep starters. Then we&#8217;ll cover three sleep triggers. The first is pause breaths, the second is muscle twitching and third is eye movements.</p>
<p><b>3 Ways To Learn The Sleep Breathing Sleep Starter</b></p>
<p>Sleep breathing is simply mimicking your body&#8217;s breathing pattern when it&#8217;s asleep. If you act closely enough like you&#8217;re already asleep then your body thinks that it really is asleep, even if your mind is completely awake and not even slightly relaxed.</p>
<p>There are 3 basic ways to find out what your personal sleep breathing is like.</p>
<p><b>1.) Sleep Paralysis Perspective</b></p>
<p>First, when you enter waking sleep paralysis a lot of times your perspective shifts slightly away from the center of your head and in to your sinuses. It sounds like you&#8217;re breathing in a cavern and you&#8217;ll find your body automatically breathes with quite a lot more force than you do when you&#8217;re awake. The breathing is much deeper and longer. Pay attention to how this sounds in order to learn your sleep breathing pattern.</p>
<p><b>2.) Watch Waking Breathing</b></p>
<p>The second way to learn your sleep breathing pattern is to practice staying perfectly still when you wake up in the morning. You can continue to breathe the same way you did when asleep if you wake up gradually.</p>
<p><b>3.) Record Sleep Breathing</b></p>
<p>The third way, which is the best, is to record yourself sleeping. For $30 you can get a digital voice recorder that can record the entire night. You can then use free software like Audacity to find the parts of the recording that have your sleep breathing.</p>
<p>Here is a recording I made of myself. It sounds a little creepy, but that&#8217;s just how it sounds in a cheap recorder. </p>
<p>Once you have your recording you can listen to it right before you go to sleep in order to make sure you&#8217;re on the right breathing rhythm. If you don&#8217;t want to record yourself, you can download a free mp3 of my breathing pattern in the O.B.E Quickstart at <a href="http://www.Lucidology.com" target="_blank">www.Lucidology.com</a>.</p>
<p><b>3 Sleep Breathing Gotchas</b></p>
<p>When you use sleep breathing there are a 3 gotchas to be aware of: These are the learning curve, blackout breathing, and the narcotic breathing effect.</p>
<p><b>1.) Sleep Breathing Learning Curve</b></p>
<p>The learning curve means that it takes practice and if you don&#8217;t have the rhythm right it can prolong the time it takes to fall asleep. It&#8217;s best to practice using sleep breathing for a couple nights before using it during an early morning O.B.E induction. However once you have the rhythm right, sleep breathing is probably the single most powerful of all the sleep commands. </p>
<p>A while back I laid down in the afternoon and just starting doing sleep breathing. I didn&#8217;t use any other methods at all and within 15 minutes I entered waking sleep paralysis. I could roll over and completely wreck the paralysis and then bring it back again with just 3 or 4 sleep breaths. </p>
<p>I usually don&#8217;t have that amount of control with sleep breathing, however it does show the potential power it has when you get the rhythm right.</p>
<p><b>2.) Blackout Breathing</b></p>
<p>The second gotcha is blackout breathing. A lot of times when you use sleep breathing for the first few minutes it seems like it&#8217;s not working and you feel like you should give up. But then all of a sudden you black out and you&#8217;re in a dream or you&#8217;re waking up the next morning. The blackout breathing effect is very real so if you use sleep breathing for WILDs make sure you have a timer because otherwise there&#8217;s a very good chance you&#8217;ll send yourself so far into sleep so quickly that you&#8217;ll never become lucid without a beep.</p>
<p><b>3.) Narcotic Breathing</b></p>
<p>The third gotcha is narcotic breathing. Sometimes instead of blacking out all at once you get a relaxing feeling. It feels like when you first wake up in the morning and the last thing you want to do is get up out of bed. You just want to go back to sleep. This is very useful in destroying insomnia. When you get the narcotic breathing effect it feels really good to lay there and breathe and you&#8217;ll have no desire to get up. Narcotic breathing is a signal that it&#8217;s working and you&#8217;ll be asleep very soon.</p>
<p><b>Second Sleep Starter: Stop Eye Micromovements</b></p>
<p>That wraps it up for sleep breathing. The second sleep starter is to stop eye micromovements.</p>
<p>During the day the eyes are searching for changes in motion. Because of this they make tiny micro movements all the time and at the end of they day they are still making these micro movements even though you may want to go to sleep. </p>
<p>If you close your eyes and try to keep them still you&#8217;ll find that after about 30 seconds they are still twitching very slightly. It&#8217;s not easy to totally relax the eyes. However if you can keep them at complete ease for several minutes the body will interpret that as a signal that the mind may have fallen asleep. In fact if you keep your eyes still your body will often fall asleep even if the rest of your muscles are fairly tense.</p>
<p><b>Roll Eyes To Relax Them</b></p>
<p>Before sleep, relax your eye muscles by rolling them around in wide circles in both directions several times and then letting them rest. After 3 or 4 nights of practicing this you&#8217;ll be able to keep your eyes totally still and you&#8217;ll fall asleep much faster. </p>
<p>This brings us to sleep triggers which are used to convert partial paralysis into full paralysis. </p>
<p><b>First Sleep Trigger: Pause Breaths</b></p>
<p>The first trigger is pause breaths. When you reach 90% paralysis, the reason the body doesn&#8217;t go to full paralysis is it has a bit of doubt about just how asleep the mind really is. This is because of muscle tension. The best solution is to relax more deeply but sometimes that&#8217;s not possible. </p>
<p>What you can do is exhale and pause for 2 or 3 seconds. Relax as much as you can and then begin breathing again like normal. By relaxing your breathing you reduce your overall tension just barely enough to send a signal to complete the paralysis. During those 2 or 3 seconds you&#8217;ll feel the paralysis deepening. Sometimes you may have to use 2 or 3 pause breaths about 15 seconds apart. When you do this, you&#8217;re not trying to alter your blood oxygen levels or anything like that. The purpose is to simply lower your overall muscle tension just long enough to paralyze completely.</p>
<p><b>Second Sleep Trigger: Muscle Twitching</b></p>
<p>The second sleep trigger is muscle twitching which was actually the first sleep trigger I ever found. I reached partial paralysis and on a whim decided to try twitching my right forearm to see what happened. To my surprise my entire arm paralyzed. I then twitched my right calf and my right leg paralyzed. I gradually paralyzed my entire body that way and completed the separation. </p>
<p>In other words muscle twitching only paralyses the surrounding muscles. I&#8217;ve actually found that I could paralyze just a single finger by twitching it when in partial paralysis.</p>
<p><b>How To Do Muscle Twitching</b></p>
<p>To do this twitch once every second or two when you&#8217;re in about 95% paralysis. The twitch is very gentle and only lasts the smallest fraction of a second. If you twitch your forearm the rest of your arm should not move at all. If you twitch too hard you&#8217;ll wreck the paralysis so keep it very light. </p>
<p>Probably the reason this works is when you dream you try to move your muscles but sleep paralysis prevents you from moving. However you do move your muscles just a bit when dreaming which causes muscle twitching. This means the body associates muscle twitching with deep sleep so one way to mimic deep sleep is to use muscle twitching.</p>
<p><b>Third Sleep Trigger: Up And Down Eye Micromovements</b></p>
<p>The third sleep trigger is up and down eye movements. With your eyes closed you simply move your eyes up and down as fast as you can for about 10 seconds. I&#8217;ve never been able to get it to work using left and right movements. However there is actually a type of hypnotic psychotherapy called &#8220;eye movement desensitization and reprocessing&#8221; or EMDR which uses side to side eye movements. You may try experimenting with side to side movement to complete partial paralysis but I find up and down is a safer bet.</p>
<p><b>The Order To Use Triggers</b></p>
<p>So which trigger do you use? The most reliable strategy is to start with a few pause breaths which is usually all it takes to get to 100% paralysis. If that doesn&#8217;t work use arm twitching. If that doesn&#8217;t work use up and down eye movements. If that doesn&#8217;t work just relax for a few more minutes before using the triggers again.</p>
<p><b>When To Use Sleep Triggers</b></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve experimented using sleep triggers to go directly from awake to asleep but that doesn&#8217;t seem to work. I find that for up and down eye movements to work you need to be in about 99% paralysis, muscle twitching works at about 95% paralysis and pause breaths work at about 90% paralysis. So it&#8217;s best to start out using sleep starters and then switch to triggers for the last step.</p>
<p>Up next in part 5 we&#8217;ll cover the exact relaxation routine you can use to fall asleep quickly to cure insomnia and enter waking sleep paralysis for frequent lucid dreams and O.B.E.s.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here in Lucidology 101 part 3 you&#8217;re about to find out use the &#8220;stop, drop &#038; roll&#8221; sleep command to fall asleep quickly by making your body ask to fall asleep &#038; then giving it the &#8220;yes&#8221; command to tell it to fall asleep.</p>
<p>In the last section we found that <a href=http://www.lucidology.com/blog/waking-sleep-paralysis/57>sleep paralysis</a> is most likely when you wake up and fall asleep again without moving at all. So to do that you need a way to fall asleep quickly and reliably. The question is, how do you do that?</p>
<p>
<b>Mind Body Independence</b></p>
<p>The key is in the principle of &#8220;mind-body independence&#8221;. Mind-body independence means that your mind and body never know precisely what the other is doing. For instance, your body is growing hair, transcribing DNA, digesting food, making blood cells and regenerating tissue. Your mind is mostly unaware of all these. If you had to think about each one you&#8217;d never get anything else done. This is mind-body independence.</p>
<p>Mind-body independence also works the other way. When you mind falls asleep your body never really knows completely for sure what happened and if your mind is really asleep or not. So how does your body know when to enter sleep paralysis?</p>
<p>The key is that even though the mind and body act independently, they still communicate using a language. By learning the words in this language you can talk to your body biologically and make it fall asleep when you want it to.</p>
<p>
<b>Your First Word In This Language</b></p>
<p>Your first word in this language is called the &#8220;roll over signal&#8221;. When your body has been very still and relaxed for a long period, your body starts to wonder if maybe your mind has fallen asleep. It would be a very serious mistake if the body went to sleep too early, so the body sends a test signal to the mind. This test signal feels like a strong urge to roll over.</p>
<p>
<b>The Roll Over Signal</b></p>
<p>If the mind is asleep, then mind does not respond and the body decides that the mind really is asleep and shuts down. If the mind does respond to the roll over signal and you move, then the body knows the mind is still awake and does not fall asleep. So this a major mistake that you need to avoid: Never respond to the body&#8217;s roll over signal because it sends a message to stay awake rather than fall asleep. This can be difficult because the signal can become so strong that it&#8217;s excruciatingly painful.</p>
<p>
You can visualize the way this works with the two dotted arrows on this chart: <br />
As you become more relaxed, the blue dotted line gets lower and lower. At the same time, the red dotted line represents the strength of the roll over signal that the body sends out which grows and grows. When these two lines meet the body decides to enter sleep paralysis and shuts down.</p>
<p>So the question is: what can you do improve this?</p>
<p>
<b>The 4 Types Of Roll Over Signals</b></p>
<p>There are four types of roll over signals you&#8217;ll encounter.</p>
<p>
<b>Fast Relax</b></p>
<p>1.) The first type is the &#8216;fast relax&#8217; case. This happens when you relax quickly and deeply and the body decides to just go ahead and paralyze without sending much of a roll over signal, if any. This is a good case to have because it happens quickly. </p>
<p>
<b>Slow Relax</b></p>
<p>2.) The second type is the opposite case. If you&#8217;re tense but stay still long enough and if the body is tired enough, the roll over signal builds and builds until it becomes very painful and extremely hard to ignore. However, if you&#8217;re too tense the body won&#8217;t paralyze no matter how long you&#8217;ve been still. This is called a &#8220;signal swell&#8221;. </p>
<p>
<b>Urge Surge</b></p>
<p>3.) The third type is called an &#8220;urge surge&#8221; which is a very useful case. In an urge surge, the body sends out a strong signal out of nowhere. If you&#8217;re able to resist the signal for three or four seconds the body ends the surge and paralyses all at once. If you&#8217;re not relaxed enough, this will probably result in only partial sleep paralysis which is not ideal. We&#8217;ll cover ways to transform partial sleep paralysis into a successful exit in Lucidology 102.</p>
<p>
<b>The Quick Switch Roll Signal</b></p>
<p>Finally forth type of roll signal is called a &#8220;Quick Switch&#8221;.</p>
<p>4.) If sleep paralysis is the holy grail for new OBEers, the quick switch signal is the holy grail of urge surges. It happens quickly and rewards you with nice and deep sleep paralysis almost instantly. It&#8217;s also a very unmistakable feeling which is extremely useful because it lets you know what&#8217;s going on. </p>
<p>
<b>The Two Cases That Cause A Quick Switch Signal</b></p>
<p>This usually happens in one of two cases:</p>
<p>First: when the body is really tired and wants to go to sleep right now</p>
<p>Second: when the body was very recently asleep and is deeply relaxed.  </p>
<p>
In order to make those cases more likely you need a way to bring on the roll signal as fast as possible.</p>
<p>So how do you do that? The trick is to use the right body position.</p>
<p>
<b>Body Position Is Key</b></p>
<p>The body position that brings it on the roll signal faster than any other position is to simply lay flat on your back with your arms at your side. When you lay with your arms at your side you will probably tempted to place your hands on your stomach or cross your ankles. This is a veiled form of the roll over signal. If you get that sensation it means you&#8217;re on the right track, just make sure not to give in. Keep your arms at your side and your ankles slightly separated.</p>
<p>Using this simple bit of information we can eradicate the single biggest cause of insomnia: the toss and turn syndrome.</p>
<p>
<b>The Tossing And Turning Syndrome: Big Time Cause Of Insomnia</b></p>
<p>When you toss and turn in bed, what you&#8217;re doing is resetting your body&#8217;s internal sleep timer each time you roll over. The body is trying to go to sleep by sending you a roll-over test signal but you keep telling it not to sleep when you move. So you end up stuck in a toss and turn loop and never get to sleep.  This results in insomnia. </p>
<p>So you may be thinking is that it?? You just lay there?<br />
Not quite… There are a few things you can do actively to speed things up and tell your body to fall asleep.</p>
<p>
<b>3 Body Positions</b></p>
<p>What we do is add body positions before and after the hands-at-your-side position. The first position is to lay with your hands above your head. The final position is where you roll over and then fall asleep in that position. </p>
<p>We choose these positions very carefully so that when you move from one step to the next you release the maximum amount of tension possible. </p>
<p>
<b>&#8220;Stop, Drop And Roll&#8221; Releases Tension In Chunks</b></p>
<p>This way instead of haphazardly releasing small amounts of tension by tossing and turning over and over, you release it in a exactly two calculated big chunks and get it over with all at once:</p>
<p>
<b>Make The Body Ask To Sleep Then Tell It &#8220;Yes&#8221;</b></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what is happening at each step.</p>
<p>1.) &#8220;Stop&#8221; &#8211; The Relax Step: In this step you have your arms above your head and relax as deeply as you can. Once you feel you&#8217;ve relaxed as far as you can, &#8220;drop&#8221; your arms down to your side which releases all the shoulder tension that you couldn&#8217;t get rid of from just laying there. This is the purpose of the first body position &#8211; to get rid of shoulder tension all at once.</p>
<p>2.) &#8220;Drop&#8221; &#8211; The Ask Step: When you drop your arms down to your side and relax the body will seriously start to consider that maybe the mind is asking it to go to sleep. This position will make you want to roll over which is what you want. The stronger the roll over signal, the more the body is asking for permission to sleep. If you get to a point where it feels like it&#8217;s plateaued, slowly roll over which puts you in step 3.</p>
<p>3.) &#8220;Roll&#8221; &#8211; The Yes Step: In this step you tell the body, &#8220;yes it&#8217;s time to sleep.&#8221; Simply roll over and then don&#8217;t move until you&#8217;re asleep. Your goal is to not move again the rest of the night. </p>
<p>
<b>Roll Over Signal Changes Depending On Your Position</b></p>
<p>The sneaky thing is that the roll over signal changes based on how you&#8217;re laying and that may trick you into moving. The roll over signal when you&#8217;re on your back tends to center in your chest. However the roll over signal when you&#8217;re on your side tends to make you want to move your legs. Don&#8217;t fall for that! Don&#8217;t bend them or straighten them or anything. Keep your legs perfectly still. The urge to move your legs is actually a disguised form of the roll over signal and you must resist it at all costs!</p>
<p>
<b>Best Body Position For Healthy Sleep</b></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the best final body position that&#8217;s the healthiest for your back according to researchers at the University of Cleveland. You want to lay on your side so your neck and spine are neutral and relaxed<br />
Bend your hips and knees a bit to lower pressure on your spine<br />
To relieve sciatic nerve strain, put a pillow between your kneeson <br />
Sleeping on your stomach is not recommended because it puts your back in an odd position</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus Secret To Build Up Roll Signal</b></p>
<p>We have one last very powerful trick in reserve that you can use when you have a really hard time falling asleep.</p>
<p>The key is to build up a super strong roll over signal before even getting into bed. Rather than trying to <a href=http://www.lucidology.com/blog/waking-sleep-paralysis/57>fall asleep</a> in your bed, lay down on the floor next to your bed on your back and relax. </p>
<p>This is unpleasant and after forcing yourself to lay there perfectly still for 10 or 15 minutes, when you finally allow yourself back into bed your body will be so grateful that it will  grab the chance to fall asleep as quickly as it can. </p>
<p>In extreme cases you can even lay on an uncarpeted floor such as in your kitchen which will build up the roll signal very quickly. </p>
<p>
In the next section we&#8217;ll cover 5 more powerful sleep commands you can use to trick your body to fall asleep while you keep your mind awake to have O.B.E.s.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re new to out of body experiences and lucid dreams and you&#8217;re wondering where to get started, here it is. In this article you&#8217;re about to find out why sleep paralysis is the holy grail for new OBEers because it&#8217;s how you can access your subconscious without having to practice using any visualizations at all.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever woken up in the morning and found that you couldn&#8217;t move or make a sound for a few minutes, you&#8217;ve had sleep paralysis. This used to happen to me and I had no idea why or what it was. But as it turns out, this was the trick that opened the door to frequent O.B.E.s for me after having insomnia for years. </p>
<p>
<b>Sleep Paralysis Is A Protection Mechanism</b></p>
<p>The question is &#8220;what is sleep paralysis and how can you use it?&#8221; Sleep paralysis is a protection mechanism your body uses when you fall asleep. If you were to dream you&#8217;re doing something very active, such as running, and you weren&#8217;t in sleep paralysis then you would move your limbs when you&#8217;re asleep and you&#8217;d wake yourself up. To prevent that from happening, your body disconnects your voluntary muscle system from your mind so that you can dream all you like without waking yourself up.</p>
<p>
<b>Usually Your Mind Falls Asleep, Then Your Body</b></p>
<p>Normally you&#8217;re not aware that of this happening because by the time your body shuts itself down in sleep paralysis, your mind is already asleep and unaware of what&#8217;s happening. In other words you enter a state of &#8216;body awake/mind asleep&#8217; before entering &#8216;body asleep, mind asleep&#8217;. </p>
<p>
<b>Sleep Paralysis Is Actually A Lucky Break</b></p>
<p>The whole trick to lucid dreaming is to enter a subconscious focus without losing awareness. Here&#8217;s how sleep paralysis does this for you. </p>
<p>
<b>Sleep Paralysis Automatically Puts You In A Subconscious Focus </b></p>
<p>When you&#8217;re awake your brain is in what&#8217;s called a &#8216;beta&#8217; state. Beta means your dominant electrical brain waves are oscillating at around 14 to 30 cycles per second.</p>
<p>When you enter sleep paralysis, your brain automatically puts itself in &#8220;dream mode&#8221; which is called a &#8216;theta&#8217; state. Theta is slower than beta and is around 4 to 7 cycles per second.</p>
<p>Knowing this secret allows you to avoid one of the major mistakes most people make when first starting out in O.B.E.s.</p>
<p>
<b>Major Mistake! Most  Books Say To Do O.B.E.s In One Step</b></p>
<p>Most books on O.B.E.s say to simply induce an O.B.E in what is basically a one step process. Going directly from a waking state to an O.B.E is possible but it&#8217;s difficult so this is not what I recommend you start out with.</p>
<p>
<b>Two Transitions To Success, Not Just One!</b></p>
<p>Instead, you&#8217;ll progress much faster by making it a two step process. You first use the sleep commands we&#8217;ll cover later to trick your body into falling asleep and enter sleep paralysis.</p>
<p>You then use exit techniques we&#8217;ll cover later to convert sleep paralysis into an O.B.E and separate from your physical body.</p>
<p>
<b>How Most People Discover Sleep Paralysis: By Waking Up In It!</b></p>
<p>Now, how do you do that? The way you&#8217;ll usually become aware of sleep paralysis is that you wake up in it and find you can&#8217;t move or make a sound. </p>
<p>Sleep paralysis often feels like there&#8217;s a heavy lead blanket on you. It&#8217;s not that there is really anything on you or that your muscles have become weaker. The feeling is because your brain has to send a stronger nerve signal than normal to get the same muscle movement. That makes it feel like you&#8217;re having to overcome some kind of resistance when you try to move. </p>
<p>This feeling also usually makes it feel like it&#8217;s harder to breathe but it&#8217;s actually a natural sleep process. Sleep paralysis happens every single time you fall asleep.</p>
<p>
<b>But&#8230; Isn&#8217;t That Dangerous?</b></p>
<p>You may be wondering if sleep paralysis is dangerous and if there&#8217;s a way to break free. Sleep paralysis is not dangerous because it&#8217;s something your body does every night. Plus, here is a secret &#8220;safety release&#8221; trick you can use to free yourself from paralysis so you always have a backup plan.</p>
<p>
<b>How To Break Sleep Paralysis 100% Of The Time: Use Deep Breathing To Contrast Sleep Breathing</b></p>
<p>The only way your body knows for sure if your mind is awake is if you move. This is a problem when you&#8217;re in 100% sleep paralysis which is preventing you from moving. Luckily paralysis is limited to your voluntary muscle system like your arms and legs. Your breathing is semi-involuntary so you still have control over it even in deep paralysis.</p>
<p>If you enter sleep paralysis and decide you want break free and wake up, simply change your breathing pattern to something other than the sleep breathing pattern your body is in. The most effective way I have found to do this is to begin breathing deeply and slowly.</p>
<p>After 10 or 15 seconds your body will notice the change and bring you out of paralysis. Not many things are 100% reliable in lucid dreaming but this has worked for me every single time.</p>
<p>
<b>Sleep Apnea</b></p>
<p>A very few people have reported that they woke up in sleep paralysis and noticed that they weren&#8217;t breathing at all. The problem is not the paralysis itself, but that they had an existing health condition called &#8216;sleep apnea&#8217;.<br />
 <br />
Sleep apnea basically means that you stop breathing when you&#8217;re asleep. So this is one of the side benefits of using sleep paralysis to have OBEs: you&#8217;ll find out whether or not you have sleep apnea.<br />
 <br />
Keep in mind there&#8217;s a big difference between the normal &#8220;heavy lead blanket&#8221; feeling that comes with sleep paralysis versus not breathing at all. If you find you stop breathing entirely then you may have sleep apnea and should see a doctor about it. If you only feel the heaviness sensation then everything is normal.</p>
<p>
<b>&#8220;Accidental&#8221; Versus &#8220;Deliberate&#8221; Sleep Paralysis</b></p>
<p>So far we&#8217;ve talked about the case where you somehow manage to wake up in sleep paralysis. However that&#8217;s basically an uncontrolled and accidental process. The question is what can you do to make it happen more consistently?</p>
<p><b>Toward Consistency:  What If The Body Falls Asleep First?</b></p>
<p>The idea is to flip the sleep order around so that instead of entering &#8220;body awake, mind asleep&#8221;, you enter of &#8220;mind awake, body asleep&#8221;.<br />
When this happens you&#8217;re actually aware of the process your body goes through when it falls asleep. This is our main secret trick for doing visualization-free lucid dreams and O.B.E.s. This transition is the most important skill to learn in this part of the course. </p>
<p>Why? Because when you can put your body to sleep without losing consciousness at any point, you have 100% perfectly clear dream recall. This is called a &#8220;wake induced lucid dream&#8221; or WILD. It&#8217;s as easy to remember what you did in a WILD as it is to remember the last 15 minutes or so of normal waking awareness. With this method, you don&#8217;t have to think back through and hazy dream phase like you normally do with most dreams.</p>
<p><b>If You Actually Succeed&#8230; What Does It Feel Like?</b></p>
<p>So what does it feel like to actually watch your body falling asleep?</p>
<p>Instead of waking up in sleep paralysis and with the heavy lead blanket feeling, when you induce paralysis consciously you actually have the sensation of the heavy lead blanket being laid on your chest. It often feels like it begins at your feet, comes up over your chest and ends at your head. When that process is complete you&#8217;re in sleep paralysis.</p>
<p>
So how to get this process to happen consistently? Here is the key. And this one fact is so important and so critical that I&#8217;m giving it a big fancy name. It&#8217;s called the &#8220;Fundamental Theorem of Sleep Paralysis&#8221;.</p>
<p>
<b>The Fundamental Theorem Of Sleep Paralysis</b></p>
<p>The Fundamental Theorem of Sleep Paralysis is that if you wake up and fall asleep without moving at all, sleep paralysis becomes extremely likely. </p>
<p>
<b>Sleep Paralysis Is Most Likely When The Body Was Recently Asleep</b></p>
<p>And when I say, without moving I mean you wake up and don&#8217;t move your eyes, don&#8217;t open your eyes, don&#8217;t scratch any itches, you don&#8217;t move at all in any way. The idea is that your body doesn&#8217;t really know for sure if your mind is actually awake or not. If you don&#8217;t give it any signals otherwise, it will assume that the mind really is still asleep and re-paralyze itself.</p>
