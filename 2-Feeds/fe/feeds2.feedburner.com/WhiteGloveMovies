Here, the horrible "Great Old Ones" mysterious inhabitants of a dark, unfathomable void-seek entry into our world. One of their imprisoned overlords gathers them, just as his worldly servants open portals throughout Arkham for the coming onslaught. Only Salem's master witch, Robert Craven, holds the key to safeguarding mankind. He plans to gather a team of intrepid scholars to find the hidden portals and close them with powerful magic seals. The noble witch's elite team must battle the threat of madness, duel the dark servants, tackle mystical challenges, and face their ultimate nemesis: an unidentified Great Old One with an unknown and incalculable strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In "Witch of Salem," you step into the terrifying world of renowned storyteller Wolfgang Hohlbein, a mythos inspired by the tales of H. P. Lovecraft. You play one of the witch's scholarly allies. Working cooperatively with your cohorts, uncover the secrets of the Necronomicon, combat creeping insanity, defeat the coming Evil, and bar the Great Old Ones from exiting the inter-dimensional abyss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Struggle for Catan™ is a fast-paced game between the 2-4 factions developing newly settled Catan. Manage your resources to build settlements, cities, city improvements, knights, and roads that generate victory points or special abilities. While your settlements, cities, and city expansions remain yours, valuable roads and knights change hands.

The Struggle for Catan™ is a fast-paced game between the 2-4 factions developing newly settled Catan. Manage your resources to build settlements, cities, city improvements, knights, and roads that generate victory points or special abilities. While your settlements, cities, and city expansions remain yours, valuable roads and knights change hands. Varied expensive city improvements give you additional victory points and lasting advantages, so they’re generally key to victory.

&lt;p&gt;A modern classic, Barbarossa is a great game for family and friends! Enter the fantastic world of this casual riddle-solving game. Share laughs with your friends or family as you create and master riddles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, each player forms objects out of clay. Since the item is a riddle, your clay figure will only show rough contours. So there's no need to be an artist when you mold the rough shape of a dinosaur or a bug!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Is it a living thing?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Is it bigger than me?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...these questions might bring you closer to solving the other players' riddles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you solve a riddle, you are rewarded with points. You can also earn points when your riddle gets solved, but only if it's not too easy and not too hard! You earn bonus points if your riddle is solved in the middle of the game, but you lose points if it is answered early (too easy) or late (too hard)! Earning points is the key to victory, so put your thinking cap on and mold your best riddles in the clay of Barbarossa!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite having limited resources early on you have enough gold to construct your first few small buildings. Your influential connections will provide you with all the necessary building permits! Once a building is constructed, it can start generating gold or influence for your use. Soon this flow of materials will allow you to start going after bigger projects! You may even become involved in the construction of the town church or the city walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But beware of your competitors! They may try to leverage their way into your neighborhood with their own permits! If you don't watch themclosely enough, they might even attempt a hostile takeover of your buildings! Will you emerge as Elasuand's most influential city developer? Find out in this new Catan adventure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forest is ablaze, the smoke is thick, and the flames are spreading! The only inhabitants of this inferno seem to be a few courageous firefighters, their supporting planes, and a horde of fleeing animals. Ablaze consists of three complete, distinct games. Each game revolves around a forest fire, but each is different and has its own unique favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wild Fire!, you lead a crew of firefighters who are attempting to contain a rapidly spreading wildfire. To emerge victorious, you and your crew must cover the largest area of forest while always maintaining a link to water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Volcano!, you pilot an air tanker struggling to help extinguish a conflagration initiated by an erupting volcano. Extinguish or isolate the most forest fires and you earn honor and victory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In On the Run!, a lighting strike has started an intense brushfire, forcing fluffy forest fauna to flee the inferno in an effort to escape a fiery demise. You shall decide the fate of some of the frantic forest fauna. Saving the most animals will win you the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play Time: 45 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're a program director at a radio station. Your playlist of songs your station plays can make or break a band and your station. But you have to pay attention to listener requests and corporate orders! You begin with 5 cards in your hand, representing your playlist. Each turn you get to add a band. But the company that owns your station will also add a band. When a band gets enough requests, it triggers a countdown, and bands rise or fall in the hit parade based on the requests. Collect the cards for the bands you think will do well. Use your cards to influence the requests.&lt;/p&gt;

Players: 3-5
Ages: 8+
Play Time: 45 minutes
 
You're a program director at a radio station. Your playlist of songs your station plays can make or break a band and your station. But you have to pay attention to listener requests and corporate orders! You begin with 5 cards in your hand, representing your playlist. Each turn you get to add a band. But the company that owns your station will also add a band. When a band gets enough requests, it triggers a countdown, and bands rise or fall in the hit parade based on the requests. Collect the cards for the bands you think will do well. Use your cards to influence the requests.
 
At the end of the game, you score points if your playlist contains the bands at the top of the hit parade. If you have the most points, you win!

&lt;div&gt;The Romans rule over an enormous empire. But now, Rome holds its imperial breath. The empire is weak. Wild barbarian hordes surge across the frontier.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;You rule one of those Barbarian hordes. Your noble tribe is strong, but rival princes stand in your way! Are you wily enough to outmaneuver them? Will you have enough wealth from plundering to found your own kingdom? Your fate is in your hands: civilization is ripe for conquest! Will you forge a mighty new kingdom? Will you be the one to inherit the storied glory of Rome?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automobile carries you back to the birth of America’s car industry, when inventors, craftsmen, and entrepreneurs created a wild array of marvels and misfortunes. You step into this rough, romantic trade hoping to create a fortune by building and selling cars. Tapping the talents of men like Ford, Sloan, Kettering, Howard, Durant, and Chrysler, you balance quality versus quantity, mass production versus premium branding, and innovation versus distribution and aggressive sales. Lose your balance and you go bust. Strike the best balance, shift the right gears to best your rivals, and you’ll be rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might even win. So, pull up your sleeves and start making cars!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Middle Ages, wealthy and influential men and women across Italy wished to prove their importance. They desired a solid, visible symbol of their power and prosperity. So, they built magnificent tower-like buildings: the more influential the family, the taller the towers!

Throughout the Middle Ages, wealthy and influential men and women across Italy wished to prove their importance. They desired a solid, visible symbol of their power and prosperity. So, they built magnificent tower-like buildings: the more influential the family, the taller the towers! But the competition never let up, and if a family should ever lose influence, newer, taller towers quickly appeared.
As a master builder of these "Patrician Towers," you stand ready to profit from the vanity of these patrician families. You will build their towers, adding floor after floor. And when the towers are complete, you will be there to take the credit!
In Patrician, players compete to build the tallest towers in cities across Italy. You must shrewdly accept the building orders of the patrician families to position yourself in the right place at the right time. Play your cards right, and your name will be famous among the rich and powerful!

&lt;p&gt;Art, Steel, and Glory! Can You Craft the Greatest Swords Ever Made?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central Spain, A.D. 1600. You play a member of a family famous for making exquisite swords from renowned Toledo steel. By engaging the services of the skilled sword smiths, you hope to present the finest and most beautiful swords ever crafted to the great emperor of the Spanish Empire. These strong, sharp, and often gem-laden weapons-magnificent works of art and swordcraft- provide your pathway to power and glory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel the hilly streets of Toledo to acquire the fine metals and gems you need to craft these beautiful swords. Forge your magnificent swords and carry them to the grand Alcazar palace. You might also visit the storied artist studio of El Greco to buy some of his works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But beware! Toledo can be a dangerous place. You may duel, engaging in swordfights to protect your honor. In the end, whomever presents the best set of swords to the emperor claims glory and victory!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Steam™ you build railroads and deliver goods along an ever changing network of tracks and stations. You build the tracks, upgrade towns, improve your train, and grab the right goods to make the longest, most profitable deliveries. Score your deliveries and add to your income or victory points, balancing your need to invest against your quest to win the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam contains a beautiful, double-sided game board. The map on each side depicts terrain, towns, and cities at the start of the railway age. The map of the northeastern USA and neighboring Canada is ideal for 3 or 4 players. Use the map of Europe's lower Rhine and Ruhr region when playing a 4- or 5-player game. You can play Steam on any number of current and future variant and expansion maps, so we include pieces for 6 players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steam is the culmination of Martin Wallace's classic railroad game series. It contains a brilliantly balanced standard game, and a very rich, elegant basic game. Both offer you unparalleled flavor and fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed By:  Klaus Teuber&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Players: 2-4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ages: 8+&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play Time: 30-45 minutes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp;amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call "Wacky Water!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: "no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens..." Now one thing's for sure: something’s gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Play Time: 30-45 minutes
 
Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call "Wacky Water!"
Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: "no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens..." Now one thing's for sure: something’s gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....
In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.

&lt;p&gt;Las Vegas. The Strip. To the untrained eye, it's a sleepy desert crossroads. A wasteland of cheap hotels, gas stations, and dust. But to you, it is Paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brilliant plan? You will construct a magnificent chain of casinos and fill them with light. You will manufacture the ultimate dream of easy money and impossible luxury. You will sell-basically-nothing. You are not alone in this plan. In Lords of Vegas, you and your friends play rival developers, building on the Las Vegas Strip. You can get ahead by building the glitziest, most glamorous, and most popular casinos. But you can fall behind by letting your enemy become your boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lords of Vegas is a clever strategy game with all the thrills, risks, and rewards of the casino business. You start out with empty lots, build small casinos, and expand them as your bankroll grows. Your rivals can build next door, and they just might take you over with a clever paint job or a lucky roll of the dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy, sell, trade, and gamble your way to the top as you build your empire along the storied Strip.So come on, roll the dice, and build your piece of Paradise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 19th Century has arrived and America is heading west. Wagon trains form on the frontier. Settlers seeking fresh lives and opportunities strike out to tame wild lands and build new cities. These new cities rely on young railroads for vital goods. Trails become rails and create great wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the crowded East still offers options, its resources dwindle. Look west to make your fortune. Smart money seeks rich, unclaimed land and hungry new markets. Finance your settlers as they head west to build capitals of tomorrow. Link these cities with rails of steel. Operate your railroad to supply the townsfolk with goods. Go west. Settle the wide, open land. Claim your destiny!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settlers of America, Trails to Rails™ utilizes the simple, fun Catan hex-tile grid to map the young United States. Collect and trade resources in order to purchase and move settlers, build cities, lay rails and acquire and move trains. Create rail links to acquire gold, which lets you buy resources and use opponents’ rails. Use trains to distribute goods to rival cities. But, as your settlers populate the West, they deplete the resources of the East. Still, your options always abound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark clouds are gathering over the peaceful island of Catan. Wild barbarians, attracted by the wealth of Catan, sailed to attack the country. Fortunately, warning has given Catan time to meet the danger. The size of the barbarian army corresponds to the number of cities in Catan. Thus, for Catan to fend off the barbarian attack, the players must form a knight force as strong as the barbarian force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to fending off the barbarians, players compete to build the three great metropolises of Catan. Each of these magnificent centers are worth two additional victory points. To build a metropolis, players must invest in city improvements. To acquire these improvements, players must acquire the three new types of Trade Cards: Coinage, Paper, and Cloth. These cards can only be gained by building a city next to mountain, forest, or pasture hexes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;"...to be sure, your sin will find you out."&lt;/i&gt; - Numbers 32:23&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novices are on the loose! Temptation has lured them out of their cells, and they hope not to be caught by the abbess and the prioress.

&lt;p&gt;In Nuns on the Run™ you explore the exciting nocturnal world of a grand abbey filled with intrigue and deception. As the old abbess, the noble prioress, or a simple novice you become hunter or prey. Everyone gets a special "blessing" but only the novices try to fulfill a "secret wish." They must sneak through the dimly lit halls, corridors, and gardens, seeking keys and treasures unique to their goal. Meanwhile, the vigilant abbess and prioress patrol their routes, ever watchful of young novices who should be fast asleep in their austere cells. Are you wily enough, or sneaky enough to fulfill your quest and win the night?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 1920's and 1930's, rival gangsters compete in a life or death struggle for control of the gleaming city on the shores of Lake Michigan. Each district is hotly contested, because in the end there can be only one "King of Chicago!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You play a mob boss. You compete with your fellow bosses. Through careful placement of your "boys," you control important locations throughout the city. But time is limited! Only three days remain for you to exert influence in the neighborhoods. Use these days wisely, because the gangster with the most influence at the end is proclaimed the boss of bosses!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware! Your opponents seek the same raw glory. Take care, because if a gangster is invited down to the river for breakfast, he might not be around for supper!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gather up your boys, hop in the sedan, and see if you have the skill, the cunning, and the ruthlessness to become Chicago's top Gangster!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Journey to Ancient Egypt's sacred Nile valley!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great kings compete to forge mighty kingdoms in a struggle to control the land of "Kemet."

With clever use of card and tile play, you guide the course of the sacred river, and the lands that surround it! You determine where the desert will give way to the green marshes, red hills, and rich black farmlands of this ancient land. Using your influence, you gain control of valuable regions. You may even build a holy necropolis to thwart the expansion plans of your foes. If true and noble, you might even earn the blessings of the Horus temple!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horus uses a unique combination of tile and card play to create a delightfully casual yet engaging game with surprising strategic and tactical depth. Beautifully designed tiles feature ancient hieroglyphics, and the playing pieces evoke the deities of this fascinating culture. Horus is easy to learn and play, but is full of intrigue and player interaction. Ever changing, always different, you will find mastery of the Nile delightfully elusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you seize your destiny and reign supreme over the land of Egypt?

Picking up artifacts as you move, you must be wary of creating gaps in the bridge. For as the gaps proliferate and widen, those behind you face a costly-even perilous-journey to safety. So, flee with care and cunning. Be the first to guide your people to their new haven!</itunes:summary>

&lt;p&gt;Several thousand years ago, clans of people began settling in Mesopotamia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can lead one of these clans, exploring unknown areas, building huts to live in, and creating cult centers to collect the valuable and desired Mana. At the same time, all the players must work together to build a magnificent temple for the god Marduk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each clan brings their offerings to this mighty temple, hoping to earn the blessings and protection of the deity. The highest rewards will come to the leader who brings all of his people’s offerings to the temple first. Can you lead your people to their rightful place in the eyes of the god Baal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You never give up! Despite the long journey to your new homeland, and the loss of everything you owned, you have made it: you are a settler of Catan!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You begin with nothing more than your own two hands, and each day will bring you a host of new experiences and adventures. Hunting bears and wolves? Building trunks and furniture? Working hides and skins? Not a problem for you! But soon you grow tired with simply roaming the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your goal is to settled down with a roof over your head, sheep to breed, and a field to sow your grain. To do this, you will need the help of the other settlers in the village. Easily done! If you supply a sword to Jared, he will give you a bag of seeds in return. Osmund needs a new chest, and offers you some sheep. Candamir would like new windows and can help you build your new house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again and again you head out for the wilderness, hunting bears and wolves, collecting honey and rare herbs. But you must be cautious!&lt;/p&gt;

You never give up! Despite the long journey to your new homeland, and the loss of everything you owned, you have made it: you are a settler of Catan!
You begin with nothing more than your own two hands, and each day will bring you a host of new experiences and adventures. Hunting bears and wolves? Building trunks and furniture? Working hides and skins? Not a problem for you! But soon you grow tired with simply roaming the island.
Your goal is to settled down with a roof over your head, sheep to breed, and a field to sow your grain. To do this, you will need the help of the other settlers in the village. Easily done! If you supply a sword to Jared, he will give you a bag of seeds in return. Osmund needs a new chest, and offers you some sheep. Candamir would like new windows and can help you build your new house.
Again and again you head out for the wilderness, hunting bears and wolves, collecting honey and rare herbs. But you must be cautious!
