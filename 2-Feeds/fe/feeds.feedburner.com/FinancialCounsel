<p>Van Zandt, 68, was the owner of The Van Zandt Agency, which was a well-known tax preparation firm in Westchester Square.  His business partner and son, Robert Van Zandt Jr. was found dead floating in his swimming pool in Yonkers last fall with a bullet in his head.  Van Zandt Jr. was tied to former Mafia boss Vincent “Vinny Gorgeous” Basciano.  Van Zandt Sr. is blaming the scam on his son but many believe the father was behind it.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said that in 2007 Van Zandt Sr. began to take investments from tax preparation clients.  He targeted clients with large retirement savings and funds and ripped off his blue collar clients.  According to the indictment and statements made by prosecutors at the arraignment, Van Zandt Sr. guaranteed high rates or return to the new investors and promised to invest their money in lucrative securities, including real estate projects.  These real estate projects were, in fact, impossible to build.  Specifically, he would guarantee high rates of return to these unsuspecting clients and then take the cash to pay previous investors and his own personal expenses.  In reality, their money was never invested as promised in the promissory notes or shareholder agreements that he gave to his victims.  From February 2008 to January 2011 Van Zandt Sr. stole more than $4.6 million from his investors.</p>
<p>Dozens of hard-working New Yorkers put their individual life savings into the hands of Bob Van Zandt only to see it destroyed by his greed.  Since their life savings have been depleted, many of Van Zandt’s former clients have been forced to re-enter the workplace or rely on government assistance.  Some of his former clients even face foreclosures on their homes or bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Van Zandt Sr. was also a broker with the Manhattan firm Metropolitan Life Securities Inc.  He first became registered in the securities industry in December 1973.  He was associated with FINRA registered firms from 1979 to 1997 and then joined American General Securities Incorporated.  In November 2004, he joined MetLife where he stayed until January 2007.  Currently, Van Zandt Sr. is not registered or associated with any member firm.</p>
<p>While he was at MetLife he sold more than $20 million in unregistered promissory notes to over one hundred unwitting customers allegedly for the purpose of funding his own real estate ventures (for example, Burke &amp; Grace Avenue Corporation and Empire Builders of New York Corporation) and gambling debts.  He misrepresented to these investors that their funds were invested in real estate investments, that their promissory notes would pay generous interest rates and that their principal was “secure” because the investments were backed by real estate.  These promissory notes were unsuitable for these investors in light of their financial position, risk tolerance and investment objectives and these investments sold and recommended by Van Zandt Sr. eventually deteriorated into a full-blown Ponzi scheme. It has been alleged that MetLife failed to supervise Van Zandt Sr. and failed to overlook his solicitations to investors to purchase the promissory notes by openly displaying brochures in his office.</p>
<p>Van Zandt Sr. is currently being held on $500,000 bail on Rikers Island.</p>
<p>If you are an investor that has suffered losses investing with Robert Van Zandt and/or MetLife, please contact one of our attorneys at 312-332-0000 to discuss your recovery options.</p>

SCI is an entity which operates as a real estate company here in the United States.  Specifically, SCI acquires multi-family and retail properties as 1031 exchanges and investments to individual real estate buyers.</p>
<p>On February 11, 2011, the Los Angeles-based company filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. <br>The confirmation hearing is set to take place on June 13, 2012 for the firm’s liquidation plan.</p>
<p>It turns out the most problematic  offered by SCI is the SCI Capital Group Mezzanine Fund.  This Fund invested in unsecured loans to SCI and its affiliates.  The Fund, however, did not invest in real estate.  The loans appear likely to be discharged by SCI’s bankruptcy filing.  Further, SCI’s tenant-in-common (TIC) real estate investments have been negatively affected by the collapse of the real estate market. <br>This is a strong indicator of a complete loss for the investors who invested in TIC.</p>

He also sought a declaration that Wells Fargo, LLC may not enforce the promissory note against him.  <em>In the Matter of the FINRA Arbitration Between: Jason Martin Schlesinger, Claimant v. Peter Yan Hong; Wallace Lawrence Key; Wells Fargo Adivsors, LLC, Respondents v. Jason Martin Schlesinger, Counter-Respondent</em>.</p>
<p>In particular, Schlesinger (Claimant) alleged that he was fraudulently induced to join Wachovia Securities by a couple of promises.  Those promises were:  "a position in which he would be the sole broker in a start-up hub office specializing in high net worth investors; and that he would have access to a pool of names of so called orphan accounts left from a previous merger of Wachovia Securities and Gold West World Savings."  <em>See Statement of Claim</em>.</p>
<p>Claimant understood this to be a promise that he would be entitled to receive all the leads of the bankers in the new office since he would be the only broker in the office.  Respondents denied these allegations and asserted affirmative defenses.</p>
<p>In Wells Fargo Adivsor's (Respondent/Counter-Claimant) Counterclaim, it asserted that Claimant breached a promissory note (Note) executed by Claimant.  It was alleged that when Claimant joined Wachovia the Note was executed for $925,306 on April 14, 2008.  Furthermore, on July 16, 2010 the Note was amended and went down to $792,776.  Respondent/Counter-Claimant requested the principal balance due on the Note ($734,052.27) plus 3.25% annual interest, costs, and attorneys' fees.</p>
<p>The FINRA Arbitration Panel (Panel) did not find fraud on behalf of the recruiters Respondents Peter Yan Hong and Wallace Lawrence Key.  The Panel did find, however, there was considerable confusion on the part of Respondents as to why Claimant was paid only $87,000 for his first year at Wachovia Securities.  There was also confusion on how it was calculated.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Panel found Claimant liable and he was ordered to pay $734,052.27 to Respondent/Counter-Claimant Wells Fargo Advisors.  In addition, the Panel found Respondent/Counter-Claimant Wells Fargo Advisors liable to Claimant and ordered it to pay him $100,000.  Thus, the net final award that Claimant owed was $634,052.27.</p></div><div class="feedflare">

[F]raud or the wrongful taking of property?  [F]ailure to supervise in connection with investment-related statutes, regulations, rules or industry standards of conduct?"</p>
<p>Specifically, the Arbitrator recommended that the answers to the above questions be changed from "Yes" to "No," and also the Disclosure Reporting Pages that accompany the questions be enitrely expunged.  Lastly, the Arbitrator recommended that the "Reason for Termination of Discharge" in the Form U5 be replaced with "Voluntary."</p></div><div class="feedflare">

This is because of older brokers who continue to age and who have even older clients.  On April 18th, a six-person panel at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Sifma) addressed this issue of succession planning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Chief administrative officer private wealth management at Robert W. Baird, Scott Falk, said there are two approaches that work well for their organization to talk transferring business to a younger advisor:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">First, there are Baird qualified teams which is a creative group with various generations of advisors.  Within this team there are certain rules and incentives to carry this on.  Second, there is the codified succession planning.  Baird has put together a binder of information and in turn formalized a program to make it easier for advisors to prepare in advance and accomplish succession plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Specifically, business growth begins to slow down, usually through attrition (either for health reasons or age), for advisors aged around 50.  The problem typically comes to fruition when it comes time to sell their book and advisors do not have much left.  It is said the most serious concern is when advisors reach the average age of 59 and do not have a plan in place to recruit younger representatives.  Advisors fall victim to this problem when they fail to plan to transfer client relationships and the problem is right there in front of them.  Not to mention, the number of advisors to take over the book is not very deep.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another solution for this problem was created by RBC Wealth Management - US.  That firm created a plan that creates a team with an "anchor," which facilitates conversation between the advisors.  An "official" team, according to the firm, has to have a formal strategy with roles and responsibilities as well as a succession plan for death and/or disability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are other firms that have used different spins on the aforementioned plans to prevent this issue from occurring.  Either way it is nice to see that firms are recognizing the issue of the aging base of brokers and have been active to implement plans to remedy the problem.</p></div><div class="feedflare">

The notes were sold through Community Banker Security.On August 10, 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against the two firms for their roles in the fraudulent note offering. Evolution Capital was an investment adviser registered with the Commission until June 2010.  The SEC alleges that, in the offerings, Evolution Capital and EIGI falsely promised that the notes were safe and secured by assets guaranteed by the United States government. The firms also falsely promised that they would use leverage to purchase the assets securing the notes. In fact, according to the SEC’s complaint, the assets securing the notes were subject to significant, undisclosed default and prepayment risk. Moreover, the defendants never obtained leverage to purchase the assets. The SEC further alleges that the defendants paid themselves more than $2.5 million in fees and expenses and used approximately $2.7 million from the second note offering to make Ponzi-like payments to investors in the first note offering. As a result of defaults and prepayments on the underlying assets, the failure to obtain leverage, and the excessive Ponzi-like payments and fees, the SEC alleges that the defendants do not have sufficient assets to repay investors in accordance with the notes.
