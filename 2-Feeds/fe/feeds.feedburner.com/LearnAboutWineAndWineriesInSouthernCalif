			<title>An Interview (and a Game of Go Fish) with Legendary Winemaker, Robert Pepi</title>
			<itunes:author>mbwords@yahoo.com</itunes:author>
			<description>Bob Pepi comes from a long line of Californians, like his famous father Robert Pepi, who founded the family’s Napa Valley winery before it was sold to Jess Jackson more than a decade ago. Then there’s the Italian influence of his mother, a gentle octogenarian with striking features and a welcoming demeanor, who comes from Lucca, a small village in Tuscany. These two cultural influences in Pepi’s life, the Californian-Italian ties, have always been a strong part of who he is, and of the wines that he has made. 

Like a modern-day Midas, over the past few decades, Pepi has had a finger in more successful wine projects than you could imagine in Sonoma, Napa and even Argentina. In fact, his own project is named Eponymous, because he is not legally allowed to label a wine with his family name.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LearnAboutWineAndWineriesInSouthernCalif/~4/idIcoaD4ejs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>SEASON PREMIER: Frank Mangio interviews Delfi LeCler, of Jean-Luc-Colombo vineyards.</title>
			<itunes:author>Frank Mangio  / www.TasteOfWineTV.com</itunes:author>
			<description>The wines of Jean-Luc Colombo typically reflect an exuberance of fruit and depth of expession. Concentrated and precisely crafted, they resonate with authentic varietal character and thus entice the wine lover's palate.

Jean-Luc-Columbo wine comes from the assembling of old vines from various vineyard sites of the Cornas appellation. After a classical vinification with destemming, the wine is aged in oak for 18 months. Les Mejeans is a fine expression of the terroir and appellation of Cornas, while it may be cellared for some years or enjoyed younger while still on its fruit.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LearnAboutWineAndWineriesInSouthernCalif/~4/VvUkmyXPbt8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>Nick Palumbo of Palumbo Family Vineyards in Temecula Valley Wine Country</title>
			<itunes:author>Frank Mangio - Wine Club Television</itunes:author>
			<description>Located in the heart of Temecula Valley Wine Country, Palumbo Family Vineyards and Winery is committed to small lot, handcrafted wines from varieties that are grown on the property. The 13 acre, 2500 case per year family run winery has often been described as “boutique” but favors the term “Artisinal” to describe the involvement and passion that goes into the daily operations.

Nicholas Palumbo, passionate Viticulturist and budding Enologist, believes in producing only what he grows himself. “I believe there is only two basic ingredients in making fine wines, the fruit itself and the barrels it ages in”. With one foot in modern techniques and the other foot firmly planted in tradition, the wines produced posses a depth and elegance that is becoming harder to find in California wines.

Along with his wife Cindy and their four children, Reed, Ryan, Sophia and Dominick, the Palumbo’s believe that the vineyards come first. The 13 acres are planted with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Sangiovese varietals. A new block of Viognier and Syrah was planted on neighboring properties to round out the line of wines available.


Specializing in full-bodied reds, the estate-grown and produced offerings include both single variety bottlings as well as a few special blends, like the very popular Meritage called “Tre Fratelli”. Other blends like the 2005 Shiraz/Cabernet Sauvignon help round out the wine list and showcase the versatility and depth of quality that the Palumbo wines are known for.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LearnAboutWineAndWineriesInSouthernCalif/~4/mvLJS8dIvMI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>Don Reha of Thornton Winery Talks About Their New Champagne Release</title>
			<itunes:author>Taste Of Wine TV- Southern California</itunes:author>
			<description>CHAMPAGNE HISTORY

A little splash of history . . .

No one had to "invent" sparkling wine. Effervescence has always been a natural phenomenon, produced as a result of fermentation.

But it took the legendary Dom Perignon, a Benedictine monk in the Champagne region of France, to develop a process that could produce a consistently fine sparkling wine and make it commercially viable.

In the late 17th century, Dom Perignon discovered that by blending the wine from several of his best vineyards, he could produce a wine greater than any of its components. Intrigued by its naturally sparkling tendencies and helped along by the introduction of glass bottles and corks, Dom Perignon is credited with developing the méthode champenoise, allowing his exquisite cuvée to ferment in individual bottles.

When he first tasted his champagne, Dom Perignon is said to have exclaimed, "I am drinking stars!"

Today, most of the practices he developed are still in use by champagne makers throughout the world. While some steps of la méthode champenoise have been mechanized, the basic process has remained the same for all these many years.

WINE PAIRING FACTS
Rules are Meant to be Broken . . .


 

It has been said that when pairing wine with food that red wine goes well with red meat and that white wine pairs well with fish and poultry. However, this rule fails to acknowledge the complexity of ingredients that make up a dish, as well as the wide range of wines available. 

There are some basic guidelines that can be taken into consideration when selecting a good food/wine pairing. Generally, the chosen wine should complement the dish. 

Acidic Wines
Acidic wines, such as the Thornton NV Brut and 2001 Sauvignon Blanc are exceptional with sour, acidic, or salty food. Thornton sparkling wines generally pair with salty foods because the acidity cuts the saltiness.

Sweet Wines
Sweet wines, such as the 2002 Muscat Canelli and Cuvée de Frontignan, go well with sweet foods. The sweetness of the wine and the sweetness of the food will cancel each other out. However, be careful not to pair a wine with food that is sweeter than the wine.

Dry Wines
Dry wines, such as the Thornton 2000 Reserve Merlot, 2000 Nebbiolo, 2000 Côte Red, have a high level of tannins and will make bitter foods taste less bitter. Tannic wines are also calmed by protein, making rare beef an excellent choice for pairing.

Light-body and Full-body Wines
There are many other aspects of wine pairing to take into consideration. Try pairing light-bodied wines with lighter food and fuller-bodied wines with heartier, more flavorful, richer and fattier dishes. Also, consider how the food is prepared. Is there a sauce, seasoning or dominant flavor of the dish? How is the food cooked? If poached or steamed, a delicate wine would pair appropriately. If grilled, braised, roasted or sautéed, a more flavorful wine would pair well.

Pairing Flavors
Match the flavors of the food with the wine. It is important to read the wine notes or the back of the label for information on what flavors are dominant in a wine. For example, the cranberry taste of Thornton Cuvée Rouge goes with holiday turkey for the same reason that cranberry relish does.

Try creating new flavor sensations by pairing opposites. Very hot or spicy food works best with sweet dessert wines, such as the 2002 Muscat Canelli.

The goal of pairing wine and food is synergy and balance. The food and wine should complement one another, and not be overpowering. The "perfect match" will bring out the nuances and enhance the flavors and unique characters of both the food and the wine.

			<title>Frank Mangio's Ten Best Wine Tastes of 2007</title>
			<itunes:author>Michael Bragg</itunes:author>
			<description>Frank Mangio's  Top Ten Tastings for 2007
This year has been a huge one for wine sales, an increase in wine events and the many individuals in the industry that I have met who have a passion for wine.

As the Italians would say…”finche c’e vini c’e sperenza” (as long as there is wine, there is hope.)

I have attended roughly 200 wine events this year, always seeking wines that I can call my own.  If your palate is like mine, it is constantly changing.  What might have been lovely last year is so last year’s news.

This year I found 3 Cabs from Napa to merit my 10….last year there was none. Italy is again represented with 2 entries. Nearby Temecula keeps getting better and this year a cab whose grapes come from above and beyond the appellation scored in the ten. There was a repeat from last year, a delicious old vine Zinfandel from Sonoma.  Chile also repeated with a consistently wonderful Syrah.

And rounding out the ten, an oh-so-smooth Shiraz from Australia.

The wines are listed alphabetically and not by rank.  All are excellent for the varietal they represent.  Prices listed may vary and are mostly taken from actual purchases or the winery websites.

ÿ Antinori Toscana Tignanello, Italy, 2004.  $75.  The trophy wine of the Piero Antinori family.  The ’04 harvest bloomed beautifully all over Italy for this “Super Tuscan,” a blend of Cab, Cab Franc and Sangiovese. Concentrated and velvety, this vintage is close to the heavenly ’97 harvest. 
www.italianwinemerchant.com.

ÿ B Cellars Blend 24, Napa Valley Ca, 2004. $36. 75% Cab, 15% Merlot and 10% Syrah, this ’04 does well to typify the exciting yield of the ’04 Napa harvest.  Sweet red fruit fills the palate with fresh raspberry and currants.  Fine balance on the finish.  www.bcellars.com.

ÿ Bogle Reserve Petite Syrah, Clarksburg Ca, 2004.  $20. The top “PS” varietal at the big San Diego Wine and Food Festival. Has a heady scent of ripe fruit with spicy oak evidence from14 months in French and 1 year in American Oak.  Nice backbone…could age 10 years. www.boglewinery.com.

ÿ Chateau St Jean Cabernet, Napa Valley CA, 2004. $19. Highly acclaimed veteran winery that doesn’t disappoint, it’s a lavish wine with smooth tannins and smoky flavor; a pleasing price.  www.chateaustjean.com.

ÿ Gaja Sperss Nebbiolo, Piedmont Italy, 2001. $50. In keeping with the powerful character of the Nebbiolo brand, this is a wine for the ages, from the legendary hand of Angelo Gaja.  ( Accompanying photo shows daughter Gaia with this writer.) 94% Nebbiolo, 6% Barbera; 12 months in small oak, 12 months in large casks.  Classic hints of the land: tar, licorice and a touch of truffles. www.terlato.com

ÿ Montes Syrah, Chile, 2005.  $25.  A repeat from last year’s ‘04, this hot appellation should be in anyone’s collection. The ’05 has some Viognier in the mix.  From the Colchagua Valley. Sweet texture. www.monteswines.com.

ÿ Pedroncelli Dry Creek Zinfandel, Sonoma CA, 2005. $14.  This “mother clone” old vine Zin shows style and class with a deep garnet hue. Demands respect as any matriarch would.  www.pedroncelli.com.

ÿ Robert Mondavi Cabernet, Napa Valley, CA, 2004.  $20.  The final touch of the Mondavi family before they got bought out.  Every bit as great as the “reserve” that cost over 4 times a much as this gem. www.mondaviwines.com.

ÿ South Coast Wild Horse Cabernet, Temecula, CA, 2003. $28. Best of class medaled at the CA State Fair, these cab grapes come from high ground Palomar Mt. area.  Ripe and big…from the hand of award-winning winemaker John McPherson.  www.wineresort.com.

ÿ Schild Shiraz, Barossa Valley, Australia, 2005. $17.  400 acres of estate vineyards, about 1/3 devoted to luscious Shiraz.  25 year old vines.

			<title>Nature Sweet D'Vines (Those Tasty Little Tomatoes that Pair Well With White Wine)</title>
			<itunes:author>www.TasteOfWineTV.com</itunes:author>
			<description>Recipes

Shrimp Boats - Cut NatureSweet tomatoes in half lengthwise. Carefully slice off a small amount of the rounded bottom of tomatoes to stabilize tomatoes and set upright on a serving platter. Gently scoop seeds and pulp from tomatoes. Season the tomatoes with salt and pepper and turn tomatoes upside down on paper towels to drain.

In a small bowl, whisk together garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, white wine or white wine vinegar, Dijon, mayonnaise, oregano and dill. Season with salt and pepper.

Finely chop shrimp and add to a large bowl. Combine the shrimp, corn, bell pepper, celery, red onion, parsley, chervil and season with salt and pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings if necessary.

Pour dressing over shrimp mixture, tossing gently to coat. Taste mixture again and adjust seasoning and dressing if necessary. Spoon the shrimp salad into halved D’Vines tomatoes, set upright on a serving and garnish with fresh parsley and sprigs of fresh chervil.

2 packages NatureSweet D’Vines tomatoes (approximately 12 tomatoes per package)
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 pounds medium peeled, deveined and cooked shrimp, chopped
1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon white wine or white wine vinegar
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
¼ cup mayonnaise
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh oregano
6 tablespoons minced fresh dill
½ cup of thawed frozen corn
½ cup minced red bell pepper
½ cup minced celery
½ cup minced red onion
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley leaves
24 sprigs of fresh chervil &amp; , parsley for garnish
Prep Time: 25 minutes 
Cook Time: 5 minutes 
Yield: 12 servings of 2 appetizers each


NatureSweet D’Vines Caprese Stack

Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F

Lay out the puff pastry on a lightly flour dusted surface. Roll out the pastry to between a 1/8-inch – ¼-inch thickness. Using a 2-inch round cutter dipped in flour, cut into as many rounds as possible. Brush the pastry with the egg white. Transfer puff pastry rounds to un-greased baking sheets, about ½-inch apart. Bake pastry rounds until pastry puffs for approximately 20 mins.and cool to room temp.

Add vinegar to a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the mixture is thick and syrupy, for 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool slightly.

Slice the mozzarella into ¼-inch thick slices. Using a 1 – 1 ½-inch round cutter, cut the mozzarella into as many rounds as possible.

Cut the D’Vines tomatoes in half lengthwise. Using a small, very sharp paring knife, cut a very thin small slice off the rounded side just to stabilize the tomato so it will set upright when placed onto the mozzarella and pesto.

To assemble, place a piece of mozzarella on the puff pastry round, dab pesto in the center of the mozzarella. Lay the D’Vines tomato on top, with the cut side facing. Drizzle balsamic syrup over the top, then a light drizzle of organic olive oil. Sprinkle with fleur de sel and freshly ground black pepper, to taste, garnish with a basil leaf and serve.

1 (17 ¼-ounce package) puff pastry – two sheets, thawed Flour, for dusting
1 cup balsamic vinegar, reduced to a thick syrup
2 pounds fresh Burrata mozzarella, cut into ¼-inch thick rounds
1 package NatureSweet D’Vines tomatoes, approximately 16 tomatoes, cut in half lengthwise
Basil-arugula pesto, recipe follows
Extra virgin olive oil. Fleur de sel &amp; Freshly ground black pepper, to taste Fresh basil, for garnish
Basil Arugula Pesto

1 ½ cups baby arugula, stemmed
2 cups basil leaves, washed and dried
½ cup fresh herbs (parsley and mint)
4 cloves garlic, chopped
¼ cup pine nuts lightly toasted
½ cup freshly grated Parmesan
½ cup olive oil
Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
Add all ingredients, except the olive oil to a blender Process until the ingredients form a smooth paste. Add the olive oil in a stream until combined. Season with salt and pepper.

			<title>San Diego Bay Food and Wine Festival - Mark Abraham of Pedroncelli talks about how wine glasses get their shapes.</title>
			<itunes:author>www.TasteOfWineTV.com</itunes:author>
			<description>Since 1927, when John Pedroncelli, Sr. purchased vineyard and a small winery in Sonoma County's Dry Creek Valley, two elements remain unchanged: the exceptional place the Pedroncelli family farms vineyards, and the family's dedication to making fine wines. 

From selling grapes to home winemakers during  prohibition in order to keep the vineyards going,
to growing a small base of business during the 1930s and 1940s,to the second generation joining their father: son John becoming winemaker in 1948 followed by Jim in 1955 as sales director, to 1963 when the winery was officially purchased by John and Jim from their father, to growing the line of wines in the 1960s with vineyard expansion and diversification, to the boom time of the 1970s and 1980s along with many changes and additions to our sales base including national sales and export, the third generation coming on board and vineyard replanting in the 1990s
to the 21st century where the fourth generation is coming up the ranks...and it is still a family owned business.

			<title>Cheri Linn of La Cereza in Temecula Wine Country Talks About "Girlfriends" Wine Release</title>
			<itunes:author>www.TasteOfWineTV.com</itunes:author>
			<description>La Cereza (Spanish for cherry) welcomes visitors to its Spanish-style winery where the charming tasting room entrance leads out to lush picnic grounds overlooking beautiful vineyards, and leads into our  rich and cultural tasting room.

Guests are invited to enjoy gourmet cheeses and a selection of deli items while sampling La Cereza's 22 varietals and blends. Popular wines include a crisp and refreshing Chardonnay, a Zinfandel, a flirty raspberry-flavored champagne, and Girlfriends – the first wine produced in Southern California designed specifically to appeal to female palates. Other distinguished varietals include a Gold- and Silver-Medal-winning Grenache and a multi-Gold Medal -winning Gewürztraminer that earned Best in State and Best White Wine of Competition. La Cereza is also proud to receive Best Viognier in the State of California and Best Red and Best White in the Temecula Valley.

La Cereza Vineyard &amp; Winery was founded in 1994 and is operated today by Buddy and Cheri Linn. Winemaker Gus Vizgirda and Assistant Winemaker Jim Swelgin help the Linns produce premium boutique wines in small quantities, where every bottle is an extraordinary creation in itself. The labels are original works of art, the bottles hand-numbered, and stories of adventure and intrigue are displayed on the back label.

La Cereza Vineyard &amp; Winery, along with Temecula-based Sunrise Balloons (800-548-9912), recently embarked on a joint marketing effort in which the winery's newly released Peach Girls sparkling wine is prominently displayed on the side of a new hot air balloon.

Visit La Cereza Vineyard &amp; Winery for a European retreat in Temecula wine country. While touring the marvelous grounds, don't forget to inquire about the winery's exciting wine club, as well as outstanding facilities for private functions, corporate retreats, and weddings.

We are open for tastings everyday from 10 am-5 pm. We are closed Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Tastings are $8 for five tastes and a logo glass. We also offer a Passport Ticket at $12 which entitles you to five tastings and a logo glass at La Cereza AND at our sister winery, Maurice Car'rie.

Other distinguished varietals include a Gold- and Silver-Medal-winning Grenache and a multi-Gold Medal -winning Gewürztraminer that earned Best in State and Best White Wine of Competition. La Cereza is also proud to receive Best Viognier in the State of California and Best Red and Best White in the Temecula Valley.

La Cereza Vineyard &amp; Winery was founded in 1994 and is operated today by Buddy and Cheri Linn. Winemaker Gus Vizgirda and Assistant Winemaker Jim Swelgin help the Linns produce premium boutique wines in small quantities, where every bottle is an extraordinary creation in itself. The labels are original works of art, the bottles hand-numbered, and stories of adventure and intrigue are displayed on the back label.

La Cereza Vineyard &amp; Winery, along with Temecula-based Sunrise Balloons (800-548-9912), recently embarked on a joint marketing effort in which the winery's newly released Peach Girls sparkling wine is prominently displayed on the side of a new hot air balloon.

Visit La Cereza Vineyard &amp; Winery for a European retreat in Temecula wine country. While touring the marvelous grounds, don't forget to inquire about the winery's exciting wine club, as well as outstanding facilities for private functions, corporate retreats, and weddings.

			<title>Interview with winemaker Jeff Stewart of Historic Buena Vista Winery</title>
			<itunes:author>TasteOfWineTV.com</itunes:author>
			<description>Before there were vineyards in every valley north of San Francisco, before Napa and Sonoma were household names, before there was a California wine industry at all, there was Buena Vista. Founded in 1857, Buena Vista is California’s oldest premium winery, and its history is as colorful as it is proud. Just outside the town of Sonoma, the original winery is now a California Historic Landmark, and home to our Tasting Room &amp; Visitor’s Center.

Buena Vista’s founder, Count Agoston Haraszthy, arrived in Sonoma County as a Representative to the State Legislature from San Diego (nearby Vallejo was the capital at that time). Previous to this post, he had been Sheriff of San Diego, founder of a city in Wisconsin, ferryboat owner and member of the Hungarian Royal Guard. But chief among the Count’s many interests was growing grapes. Upon arriving in Sonoma, he planted some of the state’s first European varietals and laid the foundation for Buena Vista’s winery buildings.

As California’s wine industry grew, so did the Count's role in its leadership. He brought back thousands of vine cuttings from Europe and published an account of his journey, which helped to bring California’s wine industry into the world spotlight. Unfortunately, he met an untimely demise not long after. While exploring rum interests in Nicaragua, legend has it that Count Haraszthy perished crossing a crocodile–infested river. A dramatic ending for a vibrant and important figure in California wine history.

Buena Vista lived on, however, and became a prominent name in California winemaking until the great earthquake of 1906 destroyed its underground cellars. It was not until 1940 that the winery drew new breath under the direction of journalist Frank Bartholomew. With the help of famed winemaker Andre Tchelistcheff, Bartholomew restored Buena Vista to its original grandeur.

In 1979, the winery began investing in vineyard land from the then up–and–coming Carneros region. Strong confidence and commitment to the quality of the Carneros region paved the way for today's remarkable Buena Vista Carneros wines.

Today, the working winery is located in the heart of Carneros, and Buena Vista is the largest landowner in Carneros, investing in new rootstock clones and a new winemaker are helping to ensure Buena Vista’s rich tradition of world–class wines endures another 150 years.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LearnAboutWineAndWineriesInSouthernCalif/~4/H71OC5XruMA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>Learn About Laird Family Family Winery in Napa</title>
			<itunes:author>www.TasteOfWineTV.com</itunes:author>
			<description>The Lairds have seen a family dream come to fruition, from vine to tasting room, based primarily on the incredible diversity and quality of their vineyards. The stewardship of these vineyards began nearly twenty-five years ago when many pioneer farmers passed on critical knowledge and techniques to Ken Laird and later to son Justin, all in the spirit of kindness and helping hands. Several of these farmers, like Guillermo “Willie” Medina, were there in the beginning and continue to play core roles within vineyard operations.

Today Justin oversees nearly 2000 prime vineyard acres for Bayview Vineyards, the Laird’s vineyard management company. While Bayview Vineyards is small and completely family run, it serves over 35 ultra premium wineries including our own family label.

Geographically, these vineyards offer incredible diversity, from the cooling Carneros fog of Suscol Ranch to the rock and cobble soils of Mast Ranch just north of Napa. These variables express themselves through Laird estate wines, most evidently in subtle nose and flavor elements. By capitalizing on and combining these unique characteristics of site, we have created wines of true distinction.

			<title>Don Reha of Thornton Winery Talks About Summer 2007 Syrah and Zinfindel Releases</title>
			<itunes:author>www.TasteOfWineTV.com</itunes:author>
			<description>Nestled in the heart of the Temecula Valley Wine Country, THORNTON WINERY opened in 1988. The winery combines old world style with new world taste to create award-winning and premium varietal wine. The Méthode Champenoise process is used because it has proven to be the best for producing fine quality Sparkling Wine/Champagne. 

From the beginning, THORNTON WINERY has utilized skills perfected in blending Méthode Champenoise Sparkling Wine/Champagne and then applied them to the new premium varietal still wines in 1993. The result: more awards and medals. Over the years, some very unique premium varietal wines have been added to the product line. These varietals emulate classic wine styles of the Mediterranean and Rhône regions.

THORNTON WINERY favors producing wine that is exciting for its freshness, bursting with flavor and showcasing the distinct characteristics of the varietals included in the blend using whole cluster pressing, extensive blending, barrel aging, and different vinification techniques.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/LearnAboutWineAndWineriesInSouthernCalif/~4/pDd4Sr74ynw" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>Ray Falkner Talks About His 2003 Meritage</title>
			<itunes:author>www.TasteOfWineTV.com</itunes:author>
			<description>While vintages of wine may differ due to natural variances in the growing season climate, Falkner wines all display a similar style: full fruit flavors with a soft, clean finish. 

Like one wine and you will probably like many more. This consistency is achieved through meticulous winemaking by our region renown winemaker - Steve Hagata.

Another reason for our great, consistent style is our willingness to continue to age wines until we believe they meet our style and are very “drinkable”. Most of our red wines age at least 3 years before public release.

Located in Temecula Wine Country, Falkner also prides itself on producing great blended wines. Wine such as the Falkner Amante™ is an example of a great Super Tuscan Style red wine that blends together the great flavors of Sangiovese, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Cabernet Franc.

Another Falkner great blend is the Bordeaux Style Meritage which is a robust blend of estate grown Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc. If you enjoy a touch of sweetness in your wine, try our Luscious Lips red wine or our Sweet Loretta or Riesling white wines. Sweet or dry, you will be happy with any of our hand-crafted wines.
