<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fighters and Managers</span></h2>
<p>&#8220;Pro MMA Radio is the best show in the business and has a huge following with the fighters and the fans. My interviews with Pep were always the best I&#8217;ve done in the sport so I’m excited to be a part of the show and talk MMA with my boy Pep more often on our &#8220;Suga &amp; Pep&#8221; segment. I know we&#8217;ll positively impact the sport and have fun doing it.”<br />

<p>Our company currently manages many mixed martial arts fighters who compete in the UFC, Strikeforce and many other promotions. Over the years I have scheduled our clients for literally hundreds of television, radio and print interviews. In my opinion, Larry is far and away the best interviewer in the sport today. His ability to conduct interesting and relevant interviews is matched by his vast knowledge of the sport. I personally listen to Pro MMA Radio because the content is never dull and Larry is always able to elicit information from the athletes that is interesting and entertaining. Every client I have scheduled on Larry&#8217;s show has had nothiing but positive feedback following the interview. We are very selective about the interviews we grant. Larry has always been, and will continue to be, first in line.<br />

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#8220;I love coming on the show with Larry because we&#8217;re both so passionate about mixed martial arts. I feel like we educate people about the sport every time I come on. The interviews are the best in the game.&#8221;</span><br />

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Cagewriter.com, Yahoo Sports&#8217; Popular MMA Blog</span></p>
<p>“Pro MMA Radio host Larry Pepe is the best interviewer in all of mixed martial arts…few people in the world know more about MMA.”<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">The MMA Truth</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This was an incredible interview. Pepe gets more in-depth with the fighters than probably anyone in the business and asks the tough questions. Very timely as well. He&#8217;s great at connecting with the fighters and getting them to open up. I really encourage you to take a listen to the Rashad Evans appearance which in all honesty is the best and most in-depth interview I have ever heard.</p>
<p>Once you hear one of Larry&#8217;s interviews and entire radio show episodes you will realize what good MMA radio is all about. In all honesty, this is some of the best MMA radio available anywhere. And that&#8217;s coming from someone who has listened to all of them and still listen to quite a few on a regular basis. I love the long in-depth style. I have yet to hear anyone get in there and dig deep into what the fighter is about like Pepe. Excellent stuff.&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8220;Just wanted to drop you guys a quick note to let you know you&#8217;re doing a fantastic job with the show. Larry Pepe&#8217;s interviews are, without a doubt, the best in the MMA industry today. His interviews with Sean Sherk and Howard Jacobs were great and the interview with Ricardo Almeida was one of the most in-depth, substantive interviews of a fighter I have ever heard. Getting beyond the interview questions typically posed to fighters and speaking to Almeida about his son&#8217;s recent autism diagnosis really took the interview to a level rarely reached in this industry. There&#8217;s a real shortage of outlets for intelligent commentary in the MMA industry and I would definitely consider your radio show among those working to fill in this gap. Please keep up the good work and send my praises to Larry Pepe for a job well done.&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8220;Pro MMA Radio is stellar.&#8221;<br />

<p>&#8220;Pro MMA Radio has had a ton of early success. They do it all&#8230;fighter, manager and trainer interviews, news and notes&#8230;all your MMA is available on Pro MMA Radio every Monday night. They are really knocking it down.&#8221;<br />

<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong> </strong>Our Valued Listeners</span></h2>
<p>&#8220;I tried several MMA podcasts and it just wasn&#8217;t working. Either the hosts would &#8220;Beatdown&#8221; on me by opening every show and talking about themselves or anything but MMA for 15 minutes. Or, my favorite, announcers making consistently obscure references to prove how knowledgeable they were while alienating me &#8211; the listener. Then my brother turned me on to Larry&#8217;s show by introducing him as &#8216;the best he has found on MMA&#8217;. Larry show is great! He starts quick &#8211; no messing around. His show is divided into three rounds. He has a perfect balance of timely guests, event breakdowns and sport experts. Best of all, he only has one show a week. In this case, less is more. I can&#8217;t keep up with more than one show week and why should I when I get everything I need in one great show? You definitely can &#8216;submit&#8217; any of your friends in an MMA discussion after listening to Larry&#8217;s show. Larry is knowledgeable, has spot-on opinions, is well-respected in the industry, and knows how to get the best out of his guests. I am a big fan. So give it a try for just one week and it will become a great part of your week from then on.&#8221;<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Craig S.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Larry, I have followed your show from the start. It is the best MMA show there is. Keep up the fantastic job and best of luck!&#8221;.<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">John B.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your podcast is the first one I have found to be informational, interesting, entertaining, funny and I would miss one episode. I&#8217;m glad I found you on iTunes!&#8221;.<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Denise B.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Personally, I believe you are the best MMA radio host today, but not only that, you’re also the most disciplined, educated, and studied interviewer inpossibly the entire combat sport journalism community. Like always Pep, you do great work. I look forward to this Rashad Evans segment and I look forward to hearing your next show!&#8221;<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Always respect, </span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Brenden A.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan and listen to your podcasts every week.&#8221;<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Andrew D.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just gotta tell ya&#8230;Your MMA radio show totally kicks ass. I mean it. As someone who is a die-hard fan of the sport, I really have to tell you how much I appreciate what you do.</p>
<p>With MMA&#8217;s popularity and mainstream integration still so much in its infancy, I NEVER expected what I came across in your radio show! You come across on the air as knowledgeable yet humble, while also clearly excited about the subject matter &amp; very clearly a fan. It is a winning combination of qualities. You interview style is very impressive: respectful, direct and well-researched. This made the interviews themselves relevant and entertaining. And I could listen to you and your guests break down every UFC event. Continue to keep up this level of reporting for a long time, and you may just find yourself regarded as MMA&#8217;s top journalist!</p>
<p>Sorry if this is long-winded. It&#8217;s just that again, as a die-hard, live-and-breathe MMA fan there really has been no place for me to go and get good reporting AND good radio all-in-one&#8230;until now. So I just want to sincerely say THANK YOU. I hope you keep at this for a long time because you&#8217;re good at it. I&#8217;ll definitely be listening.&#8221;<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Cormac</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have been following MMA for just over a year. My nephew asked me to watch one UFC event a year ago and I was hooked. I started subscribing to podcasts several months ago and found a few I enjoyed. Eventually I stumbled across ProMMAradio and I couldn&#8217;t believe what I heard. Your broadcast brings a professionalism to the sport that I haven&#8217;t heard anywhere else in radio or TV. The interviews you do are unlike what anyone else is doing. The interview you did with Rashard Evans where he explained his frustration with the scheduling of the Shogun fight was by far the best interview I have heard in this sport. I went back and listened to every podcast and your interviews make the fighters say things they don&#8217;t to anyone else. You ask more intelligent questions and you seem to know how to get them comfortable enough to say the things they don&#8217;t say anywhere else.</p>
<p>And finally the interview you did with the New York official trying to keep the sport out of the state was golden. You treated him with respect, asked brilliant questions and allowed him to crucify himself. Keep up the good work.&#8221;<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dan N.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;the show is great and I listen every week. Larry always keeps it on track, one topic at a time. I find other MMA shows are all over the place. Keep it up and wish you guys the best!&#8221;.<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Joshua L.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have been listening to your show for a while now, among others, and I must say you do the best interviews hands down. I just wish you show came on more often.&#8221;<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Chauncey H.</span><br />
&#8220;Larry, you are a true ambassador of MMA and the way you handled the interview with Bob Reilly was expert. Your arguments were well presented with evidence and clarity while he only referenced his own reports and studies with no name from people with no name. As a student, I took a class called the Scientific Method: Debunking Pseudo-Science. Assemblyman Bob Reilly&#8217;s arguments are very pseudo scientific. From what I have heard on your program, this Bob Reilly can not be reasoned with, swayed, or intelligently argued with. I applaud your efforts to reason with him. You are seriously a hero to MMA fans and myself. You get extra credit from me for using a scientific approach to argument with Mr. Reilly when he believed that all MMA fans are rabid animals and would rather kill him than reason with him.&#8221;<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Travis M. </span></p>
<p>Larry,</p>
<p>&#8220;Just wanted to say you did a really good job of having a level headed conversation with Bob Reilly and you where able to do it without being combative and disrespectful. It was good journalism and great for the sport of MMA to have you discuss with him and not have it end sour. Keep up the good work.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">A loyal listener and MMA Fan.</span><br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dan C.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;First off Larry, I want to thank you for Pro MMA Radio. Your impeccable taste in guests and your immense knowledge of MMA is second to none. You come prepared with the best questions and you truly are the voice of the fans. Well, I think it&#8217;s time for me to remove my lips from your ass! Thanks for such an awesome show, Pep. Keep up the good work!&#8221;.<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pro MMA Radio Fan for Life,<br />
Albert G.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I stumbled on to Pro MMA Radio through your interview with Brock Lesnar and loved your work. I live in Australia, and it is hard at times to keep up with the news. I look forward to listening to many more shows. Keep up the good work!&#8221;.<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Andrew H.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Larry, love the show; my favorite MMA podcast!&#8221;.<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Robert A.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a long-time listener to you show them love your ideas of how to change the sport to make it more exciting. Especially, giving out bonuses for the earlier finishes. Keep up the great show!&#8221;.<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Andrew D., MMA Fan/Martial Artist</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Outstanding show&#8230; my first time. Love the in-depth questioning (you really listen). Much much better than the rest. Leben is smart and articulate and I never would have gotten that from other shows. Consider me a fan.&#8221;<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dennis L.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I just want to say that ever since I discovered PMR I&#8217;ve been HOOKED and it really gets me through the day of my shady job. I&#8217;m a HUGE MMA fan (obviously since I&#8217;m listening to your show constantly) and one of my all time favorite fighters (besides Rampage, GSP, Jon Jones, Diego Sanchez, Shane Carwin, etc.) is Rashad Evans. I was listening to an old interview between you and him and couldn&#8217;t help to be moved and inspired on how much she&#8217;s been the underdog since the beginning of his career and people still don&#8217;t believe in him, which floors me after all he&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>Keep up the awesome work. I&#8217;m on here every day. Love it. The way you and Jesse Holland feed off each other comedically makes me laugh my ass off.&#8221;<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Wesley C.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Big Props from Berlin, Germany!<br />
Just wanted to tell you that I love the the show and think you are doing a great job. Being used to more rational news broadcasts in Europe, I have a hard time listening to all the other MMA radio shows. It&#8217;s just too much &#8220;blah, blah&#8221; and self profiling of the hosts for me. What I like about your show is that you keep the sport and the athletes in the foreground, but still present your opinion in an intelligent way. So you know you got some fans here in Germany thanks to the internet!&#8221;.<br />

<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Notable Moments on Pro MMA Radio</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Chael Sonnen Says Lance Armstrong “Did Drugs and Gave Himself Cancer</strong><br />
<em>PMR 108 &#8211; August 2, 2010</em></p>
<p>“When you screw up, you have to own it. That stuff really gets under my skin. Take Lance Armstrong. Lance Armstrong did a number of things and he gave himself cancer. He cheated, he did drugs, and he gave himself cancer. Well, instead of saying ‘Hey listen, I cheated and gave myself cancer, don&#8217;t be like me.&#8217; He actually made himself the victim and then went out and profited something like $15 million dollars from this ‘Hey, poor me, let&#8217;s find a cure for cancer&#8217; campaign instead of just coming clean and saying, ‘Look, here&#8217;s what I did, I screwed myself up, and I hope people learn from my mistakes.&#8217; You just watch these guys and can&#8217;t help but think, God, what a fraud. You got the whole Michael Phelps being a pothead thing too. I&#8217;m just glad I&#8217;m in the business I&#8217;m in so I can get them in the cage and kick the crap out of them.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Pepe vs. Reilly: PMR Host Larry Pepe and NY Assemblyman Bob Reilly Debate the Legalization of Mixed Martial Arts in New York</strong><br />
<em>PMR 133 &#8211; February 7, 2011</em></p>
<p>Pepe systematically dissects and destroys each and every one of Reilly’s arguments against the legalization of MMA including the idea that the goal in MMA is harming one’s opponent, that violence begets violence, the MMA is too dangerous to the participants to be licensed and that legalization would cost New York money rather than bring money into the State. In the final minutes of the interview, Pepe confronts Reilly with some troubling political connections and union contributions that raise questions as to why MMA might not be legalized in the State. This is perhaps the most important episode of Pro MMA Radio in the show’s history.</p>
<p><strong>Brock Lesnar Says He Wouldn’t Be Accused of Taking Steroids “If He Was a Black Guy”</strong><br />
<em>PMR 20 &#8211; November 3, 2008</em></p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve been accused of using steroids my entire life, probably since the tenth grade in high school… I’ve never failed a drug test. Now if I was a black guy and I looked the way I do would I get asked this question a 100 times? I just happen to be a white guy that has some great genetics, so I guess that puts a bullseye on me… I’m a white dude that’s shredded and you don’t see a lot of it &#8212; a guy that’s walking around that looks like me.&#8221;</p>
<h2><strong>Cerrone vs. Varner:</strong><br />
<strong> The Biggest Feud in WEC History is Born on Pro MMA Radio</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Donald “Cowboy” Cerrone Says He Heard Jamie Varner Quit on His Stool</strong><br />
<em>PMR 18 &#8211; October 20, 2008</em></p>
<p>“I train with Drew Fickett who used to train with Varner and he told me with Varner if you get in his head he just quits and you can grind him out and mentally get him to quit. We were sitting right there when he came back to his corner and he was telling his corner ‘I can’t take him down. I don’t want to go back out. I don’t want to finish, I’m tired.’ Jamie was saying that. He was already mentally beaten. His coaches were like ‘get your ass out there and get it going’.”</p>
<p><strong>Varner Responds to Cerrone’s Allegations: “He’s a Dead Man”</strong><br />
<em>PMR 31 &#8211; January 19, 2009</em></p>
<p>“Drew Fickett is a scumbag. Cowboy thinks he can grind me out and break me? What the hell has that guy ever done? He&#8217;s a goddamn kickboxer and jiu-jitsu guy. I wrestled Division 1! One of the hardest things anyone could ever do is go through one wrestling season in college. I went through three of them and broke my tailbone and still wrestled. I fucking boxed also. Not only was I an All-American wrestler I was also a national boxing champion. If he thinks he can break me or take me into deep water and push me over the edge, he&#8217;s crazy. If I take him into deep water I&#8217;m going to drown him. Drew Fickett is a drunk and a complete fuck-up. He&#8217;s just kind of a loser unfortunately and if he&#8217;s Cowboy&#8217;s mentor, I welcome that. I want to thank Cowboy for taking this fight and pissing me off because now he&#8217;s a dead man and I get to hold onto my belt a little longer.”</p>
<p><strong>Cowboy Says He’ll “Submit His Little Ass”</strong><br />
<em>PMR 31 &#8211; January 19, 2009</em></p>
<p>“Whatever man, talk is cheap. Bring it on. This fight&#8217;s not gonna go out of the second round, so it doesn&#8217;t really matter how much cardio he has. I&#8217;m gonna submit his little ass. That&#8217;s my prediction. I hope he&#8217;s listening too. He said he&#8217;s a Division 1 wrestler, so I&#8217;m gonna come out and take his little ass down. I&#8217;m feel I&#8217;m better than him in every part. Usually I&#8217;m very respectful, I have a lot of respect the for guy, but for him to come out and say he&#8217;s gonna kill me and blah, blah, blah&#8230;just keep talking. I don&#8217;t care, I&#8217;m ready.”</p>
<h2><strong>Back to the Future?</strong><br />
<strong> Sonnen and Soares, Circa 2008</strong></h2>
<p><strong>People Think a Clairvoyant Chael Sonnen is Crazy When He Outlines What He Would Do to Anderson Silva back in 2008, 20 Months Before They Actually Fight</strong><br />
<em>PMR 25 &#8211; December 8, 2008</em></p>
<p>“I don’t look at Anderson with my hat in my hand like the rest of the division. I’m in this specifically to be the champion. If that means Anderson Silva who everybody but me seems to be afraid of then it means Anderson Silva. If I fought Anderson I would walk straight in to where he could reach me. If he wants to hit me, I’ll be standing there. The second Anderson Silva moves a fist in my direction, lifts a foot, moves a knee, clenches an elbow I will change elevation and blast a double so hard that I’ll put him through the fence if it’s not reinforced. Anderson Silva will end up on his back for 25 minutes getting punched in the face or until he gives up. And that’s how that fight would go. I have no illusions of trading punches with Anderson Silva. He has no illusions, and if he does he will be greatly disappointed, of stopping me from taking him down. And I don’t mean one single time in 25 minutes will he stop me. I will put him on his back every time I want to.”</p>
<p><strong>Ed Soares Says GSP Doesn’t Deserve a Fight with Anderson Silva</strong><br />
<em>PMR 7 &#8211; July 21, 2008</em></p>
<p>&#8220;That’s sound great, I think GSP is an incredible fighter. But I think GSP needs to prove himself. He still hasn’t had a successful title defense (at 170 lbs.). I don’t really feel that he deserves (a Silva fight) yet. Go defend your title a few times and then we’ll talk.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Florian vs. Guillard<br />
On the Air, Not in the Cage</h2>
<p><strong>Melvin Guillard Says Kenny Florian “Had Several Chances and He’s Blown It”</strong><br />
<em>PMR 129 &#8211; January 10, 2011</em></p>
<p>“Them giving me the Dunham fight was a blessing in disguise, and I also feel that that fight was more deserving to me anyway. I felt I should have been in that spot before Kenny Florian. Kenny Florian had his shot, he had his chance, he had several chances, and he’s blown it. Let some of us other 55’ers have our chance, we work just as hard as those guys, why should those guys always get the title shot?”</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Florian: “If Melvin Thinks He Deserves a Shot Over Me, He Should Fight Me and Beat Me.”</strong><br />
<em>PMR 131 &#8211; January 24, 2011</em></p>
<p>“It doesn&#8217;t make sense. There&#8217;s a lot of guys working hard. It&#8217;s who the best fighter is. If Melvin thinks he deserves a shot over me, he should fight me and beat me. It&#8217;s always about who the best fighter is. Who has he beaten? What has he done? That&#8217;s great he&#8217;s finally considered a top contender. Losing to Joe Stevenson in the first round isn&#8217;t gonna get you that shot. You have to be consistent. He has to separate himself from the pack. I would take that fight.&#8221;</p>
<h2>“Larry Pepe Eviscerates Josh Gross for Proposing Zero Tolerance UFC Drug Policy.”</h2>
<p><em>PMR 115 &#8211; September 27, 2010</em><br />
<em> PMR 117 &#8211; October 11, 2010</em></p>
<p>That was the headline the week after Pepe took on the issue of steroids in MMA and the episode that created controversy throughout the MMA community. Gross argued that 30-70% of fighters are using performance enhancing drugs and that a zero tolerance policy that would mandatorily cut any fighter who failed a drug test should be implemented by the UFC. Citing facts and statistics pertaining to both issues, Pepe strongly made the case that usage in MMA is significantly less than the numbers Gross proposed and that a zero tolerance policy is absolutely ridiculous and unwarranted. In Part 2 in PMR 117, Pepe responds to the critics about his critique of Gross’ arguments and puts the final nail in the arguments’ coffin.</p>

The opportunity to provide a fast-paced, fun, informative MMA show to our heroes stationed in 178 countries around the world is an absolute honor.”</p>
