			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feed on <a href="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/how-to-lose-belly-fat-for-men-iii/">How to Lose Belly Fat For Men- Part III- Mobile Techologies</a> by <a href="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com">::EwebpediA BloG::</a></p><p><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">This is the third part of the series &quot; <strong>how to lose belly fat for men</strong> &quot;. Please study <u><strong><a href="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/how-to-lose-belly-fat-for-men" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(178, 34, 34);">part i</span></a></strong></u> and <a href="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/how-to-lose-belly-fat-men-ii/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(178, 34, 34);"><strong><u>part ii</u></strong></span></a> to better understand this part. Briefly saying, in previous parts, we have discussed about balancing in food and nutrition and some of the workouts or exercises in short. In this part, we will be talking about latest mobile technologies (especially for iOS devices) and applications which will ease and speed up the process for losing belly fat or strengthening muscles.</span></span></p>
<h1><u><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;">Lose Belly Fat for Men: iOS Applications for Workouts </span></span></u></h1>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Some of the iOS applications or software which i am using or had used for losing fat and gaining and strengthening core belly muscles are as follows</span></span></span>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">1) Abs Workout Pro:- </span></span></strong><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">This application is for iPhone, iPad and all the iDevices running iOS. It has both the free and paid/ pro version. The interface is very clear. Various levels of workouts are there but you can choose particular exercises according to your stamina.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Workouts.jpg"><div id="attachment_953" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 160px"><img src="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Workouts-150x150.jpg" alt="how to lose belly fat for men" title="Workouts" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-953 wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft" height="150" width="150" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ewebpedia Inc, &copy;</p></div></a></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Apart of having various stages of workouts sessions, there is an automated trainer which will guide you through the whole process. And you can even customize the exercises to create a workout plan suitable for yourself. I am also using this application and satisfied with the results. So, i recommend to all the iOS users to try the free trial app, then they can upgrade to pro one. Well, if you don&#39;t have any iOS devices, we will be publishing each workout exercises detailled in coming days. So, keep connected with us.</span></span></p>
<p><span id="more-944"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:14px;">2) Heart Rate Monitor:- </span></span></strong><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">This is another iOS application by Azumio which is very helpful for fitness programs, especially for burning calories. We are not going to define the mechanism behind this software but, this is really handy and user friendly. It will instantly shows your heart rate while at rest or at workout and you can determine the level of calorie you are burning. It is not only useful for<strong> losing fat from belly</strong>, but for overall <strong>weight loss program</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/instant-heart-rate.jpg"><div id="attachment_955" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 160px"><img src="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/instant-heart-rate-150x150.jpg" alt="heart rate monitor" title="instant heart rate" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-955 wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft" height="150" width="150" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ewebpedia Inc, &copy;</p></div></a><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">So, how can this heart rate monitor will help in belly reduction? This may be the question in your mind at this moment. And yes, you are correct too. Only, measuring the heart rate wont do much help. But, when it is combined with Abs workouts, with proper balanced diet, it will do magic. In this software, there are certain pre-defined zones in which we enter while doing certain exercises or workouts. When our heart rate increases, it enters to certain zone and these zones have their own use. This software is helpful for cardio exercises. For example, you can track your heart rate before doing workouts, on resting phase of workouts and after some duration of workouts. Additionally, heart rate monitor also facilitates the timeline recording of your heart rate in various periods. Anyway, without describing the pre-defined HR zones, it will be a bit difficult to understand. So, here it goes:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Warm Up (120 bm-140bpm)</strong> :- As the name suggests, when your heart rate is between 120 beats/minute to 140 beats/minute, its just warming up. Simple jogging can help you to reach this condition. It can also be taken as cool down phase to relax the muscles and prevent injuries. In this phase, the heart rate is 50-60% of your max heart rate.</span></span><br />
<hr /></li>
<li><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Fat Burn (140 bpm-151bpm)</strong>:- This is also self-explanatory. Here, you have 60-70% of your max heart rate. Be in this zone, if your aim is to lose weight. Your body is fueled by 10% carbohydrates, 5% protein and 85% fats. Gentle running can get you in this zone.</span></span><br />
<hr /></li>
<li><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Cardio (152 bpm-163bpm) </strong>:- Here, you have 70-80% of your max heart rate. This zone is also called aerobic zone. In this zone, your heart and lung capacity will increase resulting the growth in your stamina. So, you can exercise for longer period. Overall health benefits can be achieved by staying in this zone.</span></span><br />
<hr /></li>
<li><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Extreme (163 bpm-174bpm)</strong> :- Here, you have 80-90% of your max heart rate. This zone is also called anaerobic zone. This zone is highly intense and is not recommended to workout for more than 10-15 minutes max. And, beginners must avoid this zone. In this zone, your body&#39;s ability to consume oxygen will increase. Here, your body will burn 85% carbohydrates, 15% fat and minimal amount of protein.</span></span><br />
<hr /></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;Well, to <strong>lose belly fat for men</strong>, being in Fat Burn and Cardio Zone is sufficient.</span></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">The process of workouts using this application must be simple for it to be effective in the long run. Complete the cardio exercises for at least 10-20 minutes in the beginning. Then take rest for at least 5-10 minutes. After you can switch to abs workouts with proper interval.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;In upcoming posts, as we said, we will be focusing on individual abs workouts. Feel free to pour comments. See you there.</span></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feed on <a href="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/how-to-lose-belly-fat-men-ii/">How to Lose Belly Fat For Men- Part II</a> by <a href="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com">::EwebpediA BloG::</a></p><p>This is the second part of our tutorial series &quot;<strong>how to lose belly fat for men</strong>&quot;. In our previous part, Jack had discussed about Diet and a little bit about Exercise or Workouts.<a href="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/how-to-lose-belly-fat-for-men" target="_blank"> <strong>Read the first part</strong></a>. The understanding of first part will make you get this part with more ease. In this post, particularly we will be focusing on modern technologies which can speed up the process and make it more reliable and easy.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Terminologies</strong></p>
<p>Well, before moving further, you need to understand the basic terms which are important for you on your overall program of weight loss or losing belly fat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):-&nbsp;This is the amount of daily calories you would burn if you stay in bed all day. This is the minimum requirement of calories or energy your body needs at resting phase. So, it is also known as Resting Metabolic Rate or RMR. Your normal metabolic processes like Heart beats, Breathing etc., consume energy. The more you get older, your BMR decreases and this is where cardio exercises are needed.</li>
</ul>
<div align="center" style="margin-left:.5in;">
<hr align="center" size="2" width="100%" /></div>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Body Mass Index (BMI):- This is a measurement of body fat of an individual based on his/her height and weight between ages 18-65. This is the significant tool for analyzing if a person in underweight, overweight or suffering from clinical obesity. A normal BMI score is between 20-25.</li>
</ul>
<div align="center" style="margin-left:.5in;">
<hr align="center" size="2" width="100%" /></div>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Body Fat Percentage: &#8211; As the name suggests,&nbsp; it is the percentage of body fat in your body. Certain amount of fat is essential for maintaining bodily functions but the percentage should be calculated in certain duration. This measure is more important in case of weight loss program and in losing belly fat too. The best time to calculate the body fat percentage is in the morning, as your body weight and waist measurements are the most accurate just after you wake up.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-915"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/V-ups.jpg" rel="" style="" target="_blank" title=""><div id="attachment_924" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 160px"><img style="" src="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/V-ups-150x150.jpg" alt="how to lose belly fat for men" title="V-ups" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-924  wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft" height="150" width="150" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ewebpedia Network &copy; -- All rights Reserved</p></div></a><strong><u>Exercises to Lose Belly Fat</u></strong></p>
<p>Now, this is the main part which i was eager to present and you guys too may be eager for. As i mentioned earlier, Losing Belly fat needs the combination of&nbsp;CARDIO EXERCISES plus ABS WORKOUTS.</p>
<p><strong>CARDIO EXERCISES:-</strong>&nbsp; If you are a beginner, it&rsquo;s necessary for your body to be familiar with the workouts and exercises to increase the stamina in coming days. So, before going for tough procedure, 3-5 minutes warm-up exercise is very essential.</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep your body loose, wear comfortable cloths. Then start jogging or jumping with ease for 2-3 minutes (STOP WATCH OR TIMER is very necessary).</li>
<li>After 3 minutes, rest for 2 minutes and start breathing from belly (not chest). This will ease and relax you and makes you energetic.</li>
<li>Stretch your hands, roundup and loosen them. Same case for legs. Twist your wrists, knees, toes and hips comfortably for 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Rest for 3 more minutes. Then Set, timer for 4 minutes.</li>
<li>Take a jumping rope and start to jump it until you get exhausted. In the beginning, you can&#39;t jump continuously for more than 2 minutes which will be somewhat 100 times.</li>
<li>Do this for at least 1 week. Then after, you can increase the duration accordingly with ease.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: NEVER OVERDO AND NEVER FORCE YOUR BODY. YOUR BODY NEEDS REST SO AS TO RECOVER AND BUILD UP, REST IS UNAVOIDABLE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Here i haven&#39;t mentioned of other apparatus like Treadmill, as this is bit expensive and if we get the same benefit without expending much, we need to promote them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mechanism Behind Cardio Exercise</strong></p>
<p>Well, you need to understand how cardio exercises can help us burn calories. Our average heart rate is 72 bpm. When we do cardio exercises, our heart rate increases which results in burning the calories. We will discuss each zone separately in another segment below.</p>
<p><strong>ABS WORKOUTS:-</strong></p>
<p>Abs workouts not only strengthen your core muscles of abs, but also help to lose fats from belly as losing fats is the initial process for 6 packs. And yes, Abs workouts are not limited only to losing fat in belly. So, here i will only present the basic abs workouts for losing belly fat and definitely create another series <strong><em>only dedicated to Abs workouts</em></strong> in coming days.</p>
<p><strong><u>Beginners Abs Workouts</u></strong></p>
<p>1) <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/bgf5OjCgQj8" target="_blank">Crunches</a></strong> :- Repeat 10 times of 2 Sets with a pause of 30 seconds in between. For one week, the rhythm must be slow.</p>
<p>2) <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/SRejE-wV4Tc" target="_blank">Bicycle Crunches</a></strong>:- Repeat 10 times of 1 set in slow rhythm for one week with a 30 seconds resting time.</p>
<p>3) <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/UhB0DxhRYTU" target="_blank">Planks</a></strong>:- Repeat 5 times of set 1 in slow rhythm for one week with 45 seconds resting time.</p>
<p>4) <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/gvfxNbJYdNQ" target="_blank">Sit Ups</a></strong>:- Repeat 10 times of 1 Set in medium rhythm with a resting duration of 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Note: For Video Tutorials for each workout, click them.</strong></p>
<p>We will talk about individual exercises in more details in our coming posts. And we will talk about the mobile technologies for enhancing and making this process easier in third part of this ,&quot;<strong>how to lose belly fat for men&quot;</strong> tutorial. Be there!!</p>

I mentioned the age group in the sense that, after the age of 30, normally body starts to gain weight and if we can&#39;t manage to exercise and our diet plan, we are going to get those extra pounds without our desire.&nbsp; Generally, people look fat when their belly protrudes forward. So, you guys might be reading this post by being conscious of&nbsp;your looks or external beauty. But, apart of looks, excess fat in belly or simply obesity has much more negative results if we care to learn regarding our health too.</p>
<p>There are many methods, process and products for reducing weight and belly fat. Some use traditional methods and some use very latest technologies. In this tutorial series, we will try to combine or fuse both the methods so as to create a more advanced method.</p>
<p><strong>Diet Part:-</strong> This is the most crucial part when it comes to reducing or increasing weight and yes in reducing belly too. Without a proper and balanced diet, we are not going to achieve the result we want to see. So,&nbsp;here are some tips for this part.</p>
<p><span id="more-883"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce Food containing Fats:</strong> &#8211; This is known to all. Stop the intake of foods containing huge amount of fats. Generally, if you are a McDonald&#39;s and KFC&#39;s fan, you need to sacrifice them for your health and here, for your belly. This means, you are not going to have fried foods at home. Ignore fried foods.</li>

This is the average need. But it also depends on how active or passive your life style is. If you are a heavy trainer or your work is kind of sweaty, you need more water to fulfill the loss by sweats.</li>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stop Junk Foods: </strong>- Junk foods are the one which are high in calories but low in nutritional content. So, for a fat belly, you need to stop having them.</li>
</ul>
<div align="center" style="margin-left:.5in;">
<hr align="center" size="2" width="100%" /></div>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase Fruits intake</strong>: &#8211; Replacing fried or fatty foods with fresh fruits can be a good switch. Therefore, have plenty of seasonal fresh fruits. It&rsquo;s better to have them fresh rather then having them after 5 days in refrigerator.</li>
</ul>
<div align="center" style="margin-left:.5in;">
<hr align="center" size="2" width="100%" /></div>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase vegetable contents:</strong> &#8211; Vegetables are generally low in calories but are high in vitamins, minerals so, try to beat meat products with vegetables.</li>

<hr align="center" size="2" width="100%" /></div>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduce Red Meat intake</strong>: &#8211; Red meat are the one which are red in raw state, like beef. Red meat is generally high calorie meat which takes a bit longer to digest. So, try to replace them with chicken, fish (salmon) and eggs.</li>
</ul>
<div align="center" style="margin-left:.5in;">
<hr align="center" size="2" width="100%" /></div>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Never Do Dieting:</strong> &#8211; This is the most important point of all. People have a wrong impression of dieting and reducing weight. Believe me, the more you miss your meal the more negative effects it will have on your campaign or i say on your overall health. Every time you miss your diet or meal, your metabolic process or metabolism becomes slow. This means, your body will store or reserve more fat than usual and consequently makes you more fatter.&nbsp; And you know very well, starvation makes you eat double than you usually would and this is not positive for reducing weight or your belly.</li>
</ul>
<div align="center" style="margin-left:.5in;">
<hr align="center" size="2" width="100%" /></div>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Exercise Part:-&nbsp; </strong>This is another inevitable factor when it comes to lose belly fat. Let&rsquo;s assume you have followed a good diet plan having a balanced diet, but you are not seeing any results, why? The answer is simple and clear, you need to calculate the calories of your food intakes and burn the excess calories out of your body.&nbsp; And to burn them, you need to work out or exercise specifically targeting your belly or abs (in this case). To know how much calorie you intake and how much you need to burn, we will be discussing in part two of this tutorial.</p>
<p>In general, we have a wrong impression that every exercise will help us to reduce fat or weight. But, this is totally wrong concept. Exercises which will help us to reduce excess fat are CARDIO EXERCISES or cardio-vascular exercises or AEROBIC EXERCISES. Some examples of Cardio Exercises are</p>
<ol>
<li>Running</li>
<li>Stair Climbing</li>
<li>Skipping Rope</li>
<li>Tread Meal</li>
<li>Jogging</li>
<li>Cycling</li>
<li>Swimming</li>
<li>Kick-Boxing.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise" target="_blank">More about cardiovascular exercises</a></strong>. Cardio or Aerobic exercises help us to burn those extra calories but not totally make your belly or abs flat. For this you need to practice abs workout. Some abs exercises, you can do at home are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crunches.</li>
<li>Abdominal Holds.</li>
<li>Bicycle Crunches.</li>
<li>Cross Body Crunches.</li>
<li>Hip Thrusts.</li>
<li>Oblique V Ups.</li>
<li>Pendulums.</li>
<li>Sit Ups.</li>
<li>Prone Cobras.</li>
<li>Reverse Crunches.</li>
<li>Supermans</li>
<li>Russian Twists.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will talk about the abs workouts for a flat belly in another part of this tutorial. See you there. If you are using any methods and programs for losing belly fat, please let us know in comments section!</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Scripting</strong>:- If you tattoo design is small, it will be very much easy to cover it up. Scripting can be done to the pre-existing tattoos of scripts. This is effective to hide the old script by merging or creating another script out of the old one. It is not as easy as it seems. To create another script&nbsp; with a meaning from old one is really tough.</li>
<li><strong>Re-Structuring</strong>:- If you have large tattoo like of dragons, skulls, ladies and covered a large body part, you can restructure it . Creating a dinosaur out of dragon is one example but the idea is limitless. You can make anything, just think of what can be the best which suits your overall personality. This method is easier than scripting as you are free to create new designs</li>
<li><strong>Tribal:-</strong> In many cultures, tattooing has a distinct and important place. This method is useful if you are religious. Tribal tattoos are deep colored which can easily hide your old tattoo. Each of the tribal tattoos have their own meaning so, you need to have a clear understanding of what you are going to cover up your old design and what message will it deliver.</li>
<li><strong>Naming</strong>:- Its similar like scripting, but limited to names. If you have a tattoo of your name or of your sweetheart&#39;s, you can cover it up with another script or font style.</li>
<li><strong>Coloring:-</strong> Color plays an important role in our life. This process is simply covering up your old tattoo with new color, but the design will be the same. When using color, do not use extreme red and bright color. Go for light brown, maroon and blues.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, you are new to iOS or iPhone and captured a bunch of high quality snapshots through it. It looks and feels really great to have an iPhone and contents inside it. Especially ,if we are passionate about digital photography, high end devices like iPhone is our best companion. But, if one is not tech savvy or a newbie to use iPhone, it is definitely a challenge for them. So (putting them in my mind), in this tutorial, we are going to discuss on <strong>how to transfer pictures from iPhone to computer</strong> of PC having WindowsOperating System especially, Windows 7.</p>
<h1><span style="font-size: 14px;">How to Transfer Pictures from iPhone To Computer </span><span style="font-size:14px;">|</span><span style="font-size:14px;"> Apparatus Required:</span></h1>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:12px;">iPhone 3G/3Gs/4/4S ( latest firmware is recommended )</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:12px;">iPhone Data Cable</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size:12px;">Personal Computer having Windows Operating System 7</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-769"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 14px;">Automatic Procedure:</span></h2>
<p>In windows 7, most of the functions are user friendly, so the computer itself will asks or suggests the user on many operations. So, when the autoplay feature is enabled in<a href="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gjivans-iphone.jpg" rel="" style="" target="_blank" title=""><div id="attachment_772" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 160px"><img style="width: 151px; height: 172px;" src="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gjivans-iphone-150x150.jpg" alt="how to transfer pictures from iphone to computer" title="gjivan's iphone" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-772  wp-caption alignleft" height="150" width="150" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ewebpedia &copy;</p></div></a> windows, a pop-up window will automatically appear in the desktop screen when iPhone is connected to the computer which is definitely a very easy task. From that pop-up window, you can perform various tasks like</p>
<ul>
<li>You can import pictures and videos.<br />
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>You can import media files.<br />
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>You can even open the device explorer<br />
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, this process is definitely automatic as it is performed in just one click. But, if the autoplay feature is turned off or inactive, this process does not work. For this, you have to follow the manual process which is mentioned below.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size:14px;">Manual Process:</span></h2>
<p>As like the method mentioned above, this is also similar, but this is not going to happen in one click.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/portable-device.jpg" rel="" style="" target="_blank" title=""><div id="attachment_775" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 160px"><img style="" src="http://blogs.ewebpedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/portable-device-150x150.jpg" alt="how to transfer pictures from iPhone to Computer" title="portable device" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-775  wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft" height="150" width="150" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ewebpedia &copy;</p></div></a>1) Connect your iPhone to your computer with data cable. ( If the iPhone is connected for the first time, windows will update its driver )</p>
<hr />
<p>2) Click on Windows Start button then Computer or My Computer. ( Shortcut to open My computer or Windows Explorer is Windows key+ E in keyboard ).</p>
<hr />
<p>3) There you can see Portable Devices under which your iPhone will be displayed. ( If you&#39;ve specified any name of your iPhone, that will be displayed).</p>
<hr />
<p>4) Right click on your iPhone and there you can see <em>&quot;Import Pictures and Videos&quot;</em>, just click it. Or you can enter inside the iPhone and choose pictures you want to transfer. Then you can copy and paste to your desired location at your computer.</p>
<hr />

<p>Its important to know, why and where you want to use this technology. It depends on your but some common areas involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to track location of your children, especially suffering from autism.</li>
<li>You want to track your lover. Reason may be different, lol.</li>
<li>You want to track your employees (From business perspective).</li>
<li>You&nbsp; want to be in touch with a group, especially your friends.</li>
<li>You want to track your lost or stolen cell phone.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-749"></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size:14px;">Apparatus Required to locate a Cell phone:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Smartphone (Having an operating system like iOS, andriod, symbian etc, GPS enabled preferred)</li>
<li>GPRS, 3G or wifi enabled ( internet connection should be active).</li>
<li>Application ( paid or free) properly installed to the one which you want to track.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Process:</h3>
<p>Proper application needs to be installed and must be active to the cell phone you wanna track with the minimum requirements mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Applications to track a cell phone:</h3>
<p>Now, we are in the main part and motive of this whole post and i know you are eager to get info for this. So, without taking more time, i am going to give a brief description of applications which i am using or had used for this purpose. But, you need to know that, applications vary according to operating system of mobile phones and of course some are free and most are paid.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Google Latitude:</strong>&#8211; As the name suggests, this is the property of Google Inc. and interestingly , it is free. It is compatible to almost mobile operating system including iOS, Nokia Smartphones, Androids, Windows Mobile 5.0+, Blackberry Smartphone etc. To install it, type <strong>http://google.com/latitude</strong> in your mobile browser, then it will automatically redirects you to proper application stores. But before using it, and due to security purposes, you need acceptance to share location from your friend or whom you want to track. Its kind of mutual sharing. It is best for group meetings and gatherings of friends. When the location is shared, it is displayed in the Google map of everyone who are allowed to view the location.<br />
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Spy Bubble:&#8211;</strong>&nbsp; This is another reliable software, having a bunch of features apart of location tracking. It can track&nbsp; SMS, calls, Phone book, emails, photos etc. And yes, as like Google latitude, this works in almost Operating System. After installed once, it is hidden or undetectable which gives more security. And when you have a spybubble account, you can use it to multiple phones. This is a paid software which costs something 50$ which is less valued if we compare its features and modules. This is mostly and specifically used to spy. For more information, visit <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.spybubble.com/cell-phone-spy.php" target="_blank" title="More about Spybubble"><span style="color: rgb(255, 140, 0);">here</span></a></strong><br />

With GPS functionality, it uses SMS application. All you need to do is to install it on the desired phone. After installing, you need to authorize the mobile no. ( From which you will send the query ), through this application and its done. The application will SMS your number instantly about the information of query sms you need to push so as to obtain the location. Even in active mode, it remains hidden. And the best part of this application is that, the person whom you are tracking doesn&#39;t know that he/she is being tracked, because, there are no notifications on incoming sms as well as outgoing sms embedded with his/her location. Till this date, this application is compatible with Blackberry phones, Android , Windows Mobile and Symbian but iPhone version has not been released. But, MIND&#8211; the local carrier sms tariff will be charged per sms on both the tracking and tracker mobile phones. So, check the tariffs before using it. Get it <strong><a href="http://www.dondeesta.com/rw/default.aspx" target="_blank" title="SMS location tracker"><span style="color: rgb(255, 140, 0);">here</span></a></strong><br />
<hr /></li>
<li><strong>Find my iPhone</strong>:&#8211; This is the similar software which can only be used in iOS devices like iPhone and a property of Apple Inc. To use this service, one should have an iCloud account. If you have lost your iPhone, the approximate location can be viewed in computer screen or even you can track it through another iPhone where, find my iPhone is installed. But the location services and internet connection must be active. You can even delete all data of your iPhone remotely and even can lock and put a continuous siren. Apart of this, you can send a push notification message to the thief or one who got it and can ask to return. So, this application is a must for all iPhone users.<br />
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok, these are some of the popular applications (which i am using or have used) for locating or tracking cell phones. But, there may be thousands of other similar applications online. But, i do not recommend any other software which i have little or no experience.</p>
<h3>Limitation of Tracking Software:</h3>
<p>Hmmm!! I don&#39;t know how much i am successful to quench your queries via this post. But i need to mention the limitations and drawbacks of these applications. You guys might have noticed that, there are common factors or necessities for these appz to work efficiently and effectively. So, here are some limitations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Old model mobile phones are not supportive. Only Smartphones having OS, support them.</li>
<li>Internet Connection and GPS capability is the must ( exception-Google latitude works even in GPS disabled phone).</li>
<li>These apps do not work if the phone is in offline mode or switched off.</li>
<li>Location tracked and delivered may not be 100% accurate.</li>
<li>Some of these apps are expensive and may not be affordable to all.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE:&#8211; If you guys have any more questions and queries relating to this topic, you can ask me in the comment section. Happy Tracking!!!</p>
<p><em>[P.S. Tracking location unknowingly is restricted in some countries so, use according to the local laws with caution and for betterment]</em></p>

This process goes on till we are mature enough to apply it to our day to day life. And we are introduced to more advanced form of study i.e. LEARNING and this is an endless phenomena till our last breath. The methods and process of studying varies among individuals. Some are quick to catch new things and forget earlier and some takes time to memorize and have a great retention ability. Apart of having genetic coding and inherited characters by parents to offspring, the physical structure of HUMAN BRAIN is almost similar in size and shape. So, why some people like Einstein are termed as GENIUS ? The answer is simple, he used it to the fullest and extracted the results to the fullest. As like, the more we exercise and workout, the more our body develops and is the same case in brain. The more we exercise the brain cells, the more synapses it will create and the greater the bond in synapses, the more retention level we will achieve. Instead of variation in studying, a technology which people were using (knowingly or unknowingly) from past has been developed and now we even can use it for our betterment too. People have various level of perception and reception to the information or data supplied and input. Like, some are visual minded who catches quickly by seeing or visualizing, some are audio minded, memorizes easily to what is heard and listened, some motor minded, prefers to learn by writing and rare are kinesthetic ( learning by using all senses and even movement). Everyone has and you also have one sense dominating other so, its your duty to find which way you prefer and are using. I am not going to talk about these all in this post, here i am focusing on <strong>brainwave entrainment</strong> especially <strong>binaural beats</strong> and using it as an aid to study (Binaural beats can be used for various motives and purposes).</p>

<p>Our brain is composed of billions of brain cells known as neurons and they are interconnected to each other. They use electricity to communicate and this electricity creates a pattern which is shown in EEG ( Electro Encephalogram) in a wave form known as brainwave pattern. This brainwave pattern changes due to various causes and have an great impact on what we think, how we think, what we do and what we feel. <strong>Brainwave entrainment </strong>also known as <em>brainwave synchronization</em> is a technology to practice to change the brainwave pattern by using third party means ( in this case audio means ) to the level on wants. We can find a bunch of <em>brainwave<strong> </strong>entrainment software</em> online or offline.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size:14px;">Types of Brainwaves</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beta Wave</strong>:&#8211;This is a brainwave pattern, originates within the frequency of 15Hz-38Hz. Generally, when we are awake, alert and doing our daily chores.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha Wave:</strong>&#8211; Alpha wave is another brainwave pattern which can be seen just before sleep and before waking up. This brainwave pattern is responsible for relaxation, relieving stress and strain and perfect for strengthening immune system as a whole. It has a frequency of 8Hz-12Hz. Alpha wave is the one which we are targeting for study. It is mostly used in self-hypnotism, affirmation, self-suggestion, accelerated learning. In this state, body is completely relaxing but mind is awake and alert. Generally, we are in direct connection with sub-conscious mind and whatever suggestion we input will instantly taken by it.</li>
<li><strong>Theta Wave</strong>:&#8211; This brainwave is produced at about 3-8Hz.&nbsp; It is used for more relaxation, lucid dreams, deep meditation and hypnosis.</li>
<li><strong>Delta Wave</strong>:&#8211; It is the most profound wave pattern used for deep dreamless sleep. It is the slowest brainwave of all . In delta state, body starts to heal and reset its biological clock. Delta brainwave are used for releasing of growth hormone and for accelerate language retention programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are sub-types of each brainwave pattern like low alpha, mid alpha and high alpha which have their own significance and functions but knowing this basics is sufficient for us regarding this post.</p>
<h3><a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44568283@N02/"><div id="attachment_697" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 160px"><img src="../wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Binaural-beats-150x150.jpg" alt="binaural beats" title="Binaural beats" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-697 wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft wp-caption alignleft" height="150" width="150" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ewebpedia Network &copy;-- Photo by Digital Bob</p></div></a>Binaural Beats</h3>
<p>As we have known some basics of <strong>brainwave entrainment</strong>, now let us have an idea of <strong>binaural beats</strong>. <em>Binaural beats</em> are the beats produced by <em>brainwave entrainment</em> technique by using audio signals as a medium. For example, if a left ear is sent an audio signal of 100Hz and 110Hz is sent to right ear, this create a difference in beat frequency; in this case 10Hz is the difference which falls under <strong>Alpha Wave pattern</strong> as discussed above. So simply, binaural beats are the sensation of&nbsp; third sound when brain integrates the two signals having similar frequencies. Now, you might have been cleared about how we can change our brainwave pattern and achieve the desired result. When a binaural beats of 10hz is created, we are in Alpha brainwave state manually.</p>
<h3>Where to Find Binaural Beats</h3>
<p>Various companies are producing smartphones software and applications relating to binaural beats and more advanced form known as Isochronic tones. One of the top company is <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.monroeinstitute.org" target="_blank" title="More about Monroe Institute"><span style="color:#b22222;">Monroe Institute</span></a></strong> which has created a new method known as <strong>HEMI SYNC </strong>using <em>binaural beats</em>. And programmers and web-developers are also developing applications for various platforms like iOS, andriod, symbian etc. You can search accordingly.</p>

<h3>Marijuana: An overview</h3>
<p>It is definitely important to know what is marijuana and how we get addicted to it.&nbsp; Cambridge Advanced Learner defines marijuana as <em>&quot;a usually illegal drug made from the dried leaves and flowers of the HEMP plant, which when eaten or smoked can cause a pleasant feeling and relaxation&quot;</em>.&nbsp; The main cause of addiction to this weed is because of its primary chemical element <strong><font color="#1f1a17">tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></strong><font color="#1f1a17">This element is actively present in marijuana which is responsible for inducing relaxation and heighten of the senses.</font></p>
<p>People generally consume marijuana as like smoking cigarettes, popularly known as joints. This weed is also taken by hollowed cigar pipes, internally filled with it. When people are addicted to some sort of weed, they can use it in combination with other drug like cocaine. The process for stop smoking weed is similar like that of getting rid of smoking cigarettes but it also depends on the concentration and time period of addiction.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Train your Subliminal Mind:-</strong> We can&#39;t deny and ignore the fact about the power of subliminal mind. So, with positive affirmation you can make the impossible for you, possible. Train your mind, that you are happy without weed and the pleasure crafted by it. Its all about attitude. So, repeat this many many many times. &quot; I am happy without smoking, i feel relaxed and calm. I am totally out of weed&quot;.

<li><strong>Elastic Effect:&#8211;</strong> It is definite that, you will want to have marijuana in the process of quitting. So, put an elastic band on your arm. Then, whenever the feeling of smoking knocks your mind, or the first impulse of weed comes, stretch and leave the band. This will create a temporary pain in your arm which suggests your subconscious about the NO NO to weed. This point seems stupid but working too.<br />
