            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>If you just came here to see outdated podcasts, welcome.</strong>&nbsp; It's been a while since I've done interviews and even longer since I've done any audio editing for IndieInterviews.</p>
<p>I have been busy with my full-time work. (You didn't think this was a job did you?)&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I've been contributing both in writing, topic selection and design for my friend Chris Cantalini's oh-so-popular blog <a href="http://gorillavsbear.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><strong>GorillaVsBear.net</strong></a>.&nbsp; In addition to the blog, I've been recording and producing his weekly radio program for <a href="http://www.sirius.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Sirius</strong></a> satellite radio -- cleverly titled &quot;GorillaVs Bear Blog Radio.&quot;&nbsp; We've had a handful of great guests (<strong>Tapes 'n Tapes</strong>,<strong> St. Vincent</strong>, <strong>Tim DeLaughter</strong> and <strong>Voxtrot</strong>) as well as some truely incredible live &quot;studio&quot; recordings often done in vechicles.&nbsp; <strong>Dana Falconberry</strong>, <strong>Peter and the Wolf's Red Hunter&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;Sparrow House's Jared VanFleet</strong> have <em>overwhelmingly</em> wowed Chris and myself.</p>
<p>That being said, <strong>IndieInterviews isn't dead.</strong>&nbsp; It's just paused.&nbsp; I don't know exactly if it'll take the same form when we start it back up.&nbsp; I've been wanting to do a lot of text interviews.&nbsp; The text form allows me to design .pdfs which I really enjoy and&nbsp;is an overall simpler method&nbsp;than recording and editing audio.&nbsp; I've turned into that which I started the site to avoid.&nbsp; I've also considered doing more video.&nbsp; But video is more time consuming than audio, and it's time -- not passion -- that I'm lacking.</p>
<p>Will it start with 2007?&nbsp; I don't know the answer to that. But I, with the help of other bright minds, will return and make use of this exciting site and&nbsp;cleverly-titled domain.&nbsp; <strong>Thanks for visiting.</strong></p>
<p>While you patiently wait, here's my <strong>Top 30 tracks of 2006</strong>.&nbsp; You probably saw this <a href="http://gorillavsbear.blogspot.com/2006/12/songs-of-2006.html" target="_blank"><strong>list and commentary</strong></a> at GvsB but if not, here it is again.<br/></p>
<p>- <strong>The Album Leaf</strong> Wishful Thinking<br/>- <strong>Band of Horses</strong> The First Song<br/>- <strong>Birdmonster</strong> The Bar in the Back of the Basement<br/>- <strong>Cat Power</strong> Living Proof<br/>- <strong>Alela Diane</strong> Pieces of String<br/>- <strong>Ghostface Killah</strong> Be Easy<br/>- <strong>Emily Haines</strong> A Maid Needs A Maid<br/>- <strong>Oh No! Oh My!</strong> I Love You All The Time<br/>- <strong>Spank Rock</strong> Coke &amp; Wet<br/>- <strong>Sunset Rubdown</strong> They Took A Vote And Said No<br/>------------------------------------<br/>20. <strong>Thom Yorke</strong> The Clock<br/>19. <strong>Joanna Newsom</strong> Sawdust &amp; Diamonds<br/>18. <strong>Midlake</strong> Young Bride<br/>17. <strong>Camera Obscura</strong> If Looks Could Kill<br/>16. <strong>Peter and the Wolf</strong> The Bonsai Tree<br/>15. <strong>J. Tillman</strong> My Waking Days<br/>14. <strong>Catfish Haven</strong> Crazy For Leaving<br/>13. <strong>TV on The Radio</strong> I Was a Lover<br/>12. <strong>Sound Team</strong> Back In Town<br/>11. <strong>The Futureheads</strong> Back To The Sea<br/>------------------------------------<br/>10. <strong>Man Man</strong> Ice Dogs<br/>I've been meaning to write iTunes to reclassify Man Man as soul. Peeling back the chaotic yet truly innovative outer skins of Man Man, the listener will find they've exposed some of the strongest melodies and hooks currently being written. If they were given the chance to play this song on national television, they would be the biggest band in America. <br/><br/>9. <strong>Sparrow House</strong> When I Am Gone<br/>This song (and the entire <em>Falls</em> EP) turned out being exactly what I had hoped the Midlake record would be. What <em>Trials of Van Occupanther</em> was for the distant spring season, Sparrow House's <em>Falls</em> is for the corresponding season. Just like Chris, this song has one of the top iTunes play counts -- try putting it on and listening once. It's harder than you'd think. <br/><br/>8. <strong>The Raconteurs</strong> Blue Veins<br/>Somehow in 2006, Jack White and team made a song containing every element I love about classic rock. Initially this song was a skip track. I didn't appreciate how easily one could pinpoint the song's obvious influences (most noticeable is Led Zeppelin). But after a few listens, you realize that it isn't wrong of them to borrow from the best. It's simply reproducing that which we (20 somethings) wish we could experience. <br/><br/>7. <strong>Ratatat</strong> Wildcat<br/>It seems simple and nearly calculated but it's so fresh and clever. Maybe it's the calculated simplicity that is what makes it seem also fresh and clever. AND this would for sure be the theme song for my embarrassingly weak, more adorable/geeky than threatening, white-boy gang. <br/><br/>6. <strong>Grizzly Bear</strong> Plans<br/>The production of this record should become legendary -- equally gigantic and confounding as Stonehenge or the Pyramids. What I love about this record, as well as the John Vanderslice 2-track record (#8 of 2006), is the active element of the room/studio/space. The space is as present as vocals. After <em>many</em> listens, I think it's their most engaging instrument. If Chris hadn't outlawed it, I probably would have put another Grizzly Bear track on this list. <br/><br/>5. <strong>Peter Bjorn and John</strong> Young Folks<br/>The second I heard the maracas, I knew it would be a top track of the year. Then there was the bassline and then the whistling and then the male vocal/female vocal relationship dialog. It's nearly scientific. <br/><br/>4. <strong>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</strong> Turn Into<br/>This record is so lopsided or it would have easily been my top record of the year. Honestly, the last 3 tracks of this record are better than 50% of 2006's complete records. This song ends in a glorious campfire manner. YYYs use of the acoustic guitar on the record's last tracks gave me a renewed faith in the overly theatrical band. <br/><br/>3. <strong>The Knife</strong> Marble House<br/>In April <em>Silent Shout</em> was the only album in my car for about 2 months and somehow I never bored of it. The synthscape of &quot;Marble House&quot; develops into a cocoon for one of the record's more emotional tracks. It's has the drive present on most of <em>Silent Shout</em>'s tracks without being dancy or abrasive. <br/><br/>2. <strong>The Long Winters</strong> Hindsight<br/>Lyrically, this song is the song I've wanted to write. In just over four minutes, Roderick <a href="http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=108971">explains</a> the universal passion for the hard way, long roads and hopeless underdogs. <br/><br/>1. <strong>Voxtrot</strong> Soft &amp; Warm<br/>If I had to have an Artist of the Year, it would be Voxtrot. My late introduction to <em>Raised by Wolves</em> combined with the addictive <em>Mothers, Sisters, Daughters &amp; Wives</em> and adding to that, seeing a half dozen of their live performances has equalled something close to a musical obsession. This song holds lyrical gems (&quot;I'd leave you for the person you used to be&quot;) that carry amazingly accurate sentiment. This song is often the first that I share with people wanting to know what I listen to. </p>

<br/><span><a href="http://www.birdmonster.com/"><strong>Birdmonster</strong></a> entered bloggers' and critics' consciousness in October of last year on the strength of a self-released EP that, with its brash Springsteen-meets-Fugazi aesthetic, opened doors to high profile supporting slots with the likes of Art Brut, Sound Team, Catfish Haven, and Division Day, not to mention the type of buzz that forces Pitchfork to wallow in its limitations as a credible source for anything.<script></script> <br/><br/>The San Francisco quartet's storied live shows and unique D.I.Y. sensibility very much paved that road, but, as they revealed last month on an eerie Dallas night, Birdmonster's true ambitions are focused on the songs and an ever-growing sonic palette. <br/><br/>This week, Birdmonster's Peter Arcuni and David Klein sit down to discuss their just-released debut long player, <em>No Midnight</em>, and how the experience of communicating their live energy on that record whet the band's appetite to develop their studio sound and the burgeoning songwriting methodologies that will shape their sophomore effort.<br/><br/>The Birdmonster Beauty Bar photo and more by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chadwadsworth/tags/birdmonster"><strong>Chad Wadsworth</strong></a>.<br/><br/>Mp3: Birdmonster - <a href="http://www.toolshed-media.com/ts/birdmonster-cause-you-can.mp3">&quot;'Cause You Can&quot;</a><br/><br/>Mp3: <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/indieinterviews/15ish_Minutes_with_Birdmonster.mp3">IndieInterviews podcast</a></span> ]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<br/><img height="253" src="http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/podcasts/indieinterviews/images/FutureheadsBarry.jpg" width="440"/> <p>On a sweltering Friday evening in June, <strong>Barry Hyde</strong> of UK quartet, <strong><a href="http://www.thefutureheads.com/" target="blank">The Futureheads</a></strong>, kindly invited me into the band's well-equipped (and air conditioned) tour bus to escape, well, the summer and the throngs encircling Dallas' Gypsy Tearoom. <br/><br/><strong>&quot;How can you possibly stand this heat?&quot;</strong> he asked as we sat down. <br/><br/><strong>&quot;I can't,&quot;</strong> I remarked. <br/><br/>When we sat down, Hyde, the Futureheads' frontman and chief songwriter, cut right to the chase and thoughtfully unraveled the executional and philosophical approaches to the songs and harmonies on their just-released <em><strong><a href="http://www.vagrant.com/release/details/65" target="blank">News and Tributes</a></strong></em> LP, exhaustively contrasting their latest effort with their critically-acclaimed eponymous debut. <br/><br/><a href="http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/podcasts/indieinterviews/images/Episode41_TheFutureheads.pdf"><img border="1" height="400" src="http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/podcasts/indieinterviews/images/Episode41_TheFutureheads_cover.jpg" width="400"/></a><br/><br/>Assessing the Futureheads' rise -- and his scorn for their former label, Warner Brothers -- Hyde generously shed light on the inner-workings of a band that began, as he will admit, with few and simple expectations.<br/><span class="q"><br/>If there ever was any uncertainty about their rise, Hyde et al affirmed his confidence, and the audience's high expectations, pushing the limits, lengths, and structures of their crafty cache of songs for almost two hours. It was an impressive set and, for your host, at least, the show dutifully proved why the Futureheads have garnered such praise from a growing network of famous friends, influential publications, bloggers, hipsters, and the rest.</span><br/><br/><strong><a href="http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/podcasts/indieinterviews/images/Episode41_TheFutureheads.pdf">Downloadable PDF of Episode 41: The Futureheads</a></strong><br/><br/><strong><a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/indieinterviews/Episode_41__The_Futureheads.mp3">Download Podcast of Episode 41: The Futureheads</a></strong> </p>

			<title>John Roderick Explains &lt;em&gt;Putting The Days To Bed &lt;/em&gt;Lyrics</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/john-roderick-explains-em-putting-the-days-to-bed-em-lyrics]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><br/>Over the last two years, <a href="http://www.thelongwinters.com/" target="blank"><strong>The Long Winters</strong></a> have quickly become one of my all-time favorite groups.&nbsp;The pop songs have crisp and precise production paired with <span>articulate and emotionally insightful lyric</span>s.&nbsp;If possible, I could sit&nbsp;for hours talking with&nbsp;frontman <strong>John Roderick</strong> about his songs and the ingredients that make these records truly incredible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through a series of e-mail exchanges, Roderick has answered some highly specific questions concerning lyrics off the new record.&nbsp; <em><strong>Putting the Days to Bed</strong></em> will be released July 25th on <a href="http://www.barsukrecords.com/" target="blank"><strong>Barsuk Records</strong></a>.<br/><br/>I have placed the lyrics in the order they appear on the record. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Track 1: <strong>&quot;Pushover&quot; - <em>&quot;Unkind girlish walk, like a deed to the world without the talk&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>JR: </strong>Well... you know there are some coquettish walks, some flabbergastingly captivating gaits, which cross the line. They aren't innocent, they're wielded like a flaming sword, and they have the power to own a man for a period. That doesn't mean they're a force for good in the world.<br/><a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/indieinterviews/01_Pushover.mp3" target="blank">(MP3)</a><br/><br/><br/>Track 3: <strong>&quot;Teaspoon&quot; -<em> &quot;You weighed your suitcase down, but it still wouldn't sink&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>JR: </strong>This happens to all of us at one point or another. We have a small suitcase worth of stuff, thoughts, feelings, recent events, that we would give anything to just sink to the bottom of the sea, but it's always that suitcase that refuses to go down. You can't just leave it floating there, so you have to take the damn thing home again.<br/><br/><br/>Track 4: <strong>&quot;Hindsight&quot; - <em>&quot;I'm baling water and baling water 'cause I like the shape of the boat&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>JR: </strong>I'm afraid that this lyric is already perfectly self-explanitory. When I say it's self-explanatory I'm not trying to be difficult, it's just to me nothing could be clearer than a lyric like that. It's a lyric about the small-scale, almost charming, tendency we all have toward self-destruction. If we weren't humans, if we were able to judge like computers or Vulcans, the only logical criteria for a BOAT would be that it floats without leaking. How it looks couldn't be less relevant to how it functions. Our humanity is revealed by our love for lost causes, for three-legged dogs and rusted-out &quot;classic&quot; cars, and there's something pathetic about us for that reason. The same eye that loves art and music will plunge us into buying a house with a cracked foundation, while a perfectly solid, and cheaper, house next door is rejected for being not as &quot;cute&quot;. I celebrate this quality in people; it's what makes us interesting, and lovable, and individual, even if it means that we're doomed, somewhat. Why be in a relationship with someone? For love, comfort, support and encouragement. How many of us are in relationships that provide none of those things, but which we fight for against all odds?<br/><br/><br/>Track 5: <strong>&quot;The Sky Is Open&quot; - <em>&quot;My propeller tries to find the air&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>JR: </strong>Overtly, this is meant literally: the pilot is so high up and the air is so thin that his propellor is cleaving into the ragged edge of a vacuum. Indirectly it refers to the propellor in each of us which is always chewing up the air, taking us higher, hungry for sky.<br/><br/><br/>Track 7: <strong>&quot;Clouds&quot; - <em>&quot;False prophesy doesn't mean prophesies are true&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>JR: </strong>I'm continually amazed at how easy it is for people to recognize and laugh at the preposterous aspects of every religion but their own.<br/><br/><br/>Track 8: <strong>&quot;Rich Wife&quot; - <em>&quot;So tell me, is your high horse getting a little hard to ride -- and your little bit on the side getting harder to find&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>JR: </strong>You can be a snotty little brat all you want when you're twenty-five, but the day you turn twenty-seven you start to notice your friends don't think it's so cute anymore.<br/><br/><br/>Track 9: <strong>&quot;Ultimatum&quot; - <em>&quot;Crave translates into slave, No-one can harness the rain, And I can make myself into rain,You feel me on your cheek, And on your sleeve&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>JR: </strong>When you're in love it's very easy to start ascribing supernatural powers to your lover. &quot;How can they make me feel like I'm about to explode, yet they seem so unperturbed?&quot; I have felt so strongly about someone that I wouldn't have been surprised if they had just turned themselves into rain, so powerful did they seem and so inconsequential was my hold on them.<br/><br/><br/>Track 11: <strong>&quot;Seven&quot; - <em>&quot;Did you see me the way I imagined, every eyelash a picket or a wire?&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>JR: </strong>I see people in their teens and early twenties all the time who are blatantly shielding themselves from intimacy by wearing ridiculous costumes, or by talking constantly about themselves, or by being hyper-shy, or by a thousand other methods. When you get a little older you abandon those transparent ploys, because adults don't respond to them as well, but a great many people want to maintain their defenses and just shrink them down until they're an invisible veil over the eyes.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span>Before his recent Dallas&nbsp;show, I had the chance to pull Red aside for an expansive interview and an impromptu recording session, which resulted in two single-mic performances of some of his most beloved songs, "Red Sun" from <i>Peter and the Wolf</i> and Adventure from MTV2's <em>Wonder Showzen</em>.</span></p><p><a href="http://www.whiskeyandapples.com/"><strong>Red Hunter</strong></a>&nbsp;isn't like most musicians I've talked with over the last year. Maybe that's because he's so willing to ponder, detail, even perform, his many diverse interests. He will tell you about playing shows in graveyards and dressing up&nbsp;like a Vet for a case study in audience reaction.&nbsp; He will tell you about jokingly&nbsp;suggesting he and a peer tour in a sailboat.&nbsp; He will cite Chomsky and address the perils of media propaganda and,
in a twist, tie it all -- and convincingly so -- to independent music.&nbsp;<span chatindex="673A3E5E1854290844">He will offer perspectives, ideas, </span><span chatdir="1"><span chatindex="673A3E5E1854290845">and insights that only hint at why he's one of the more compelling figures in underground music</span></span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Last Sunday, a few friends <a href="http://gorillavsbear.blogspot.com/" target="blank"><strong>of</strong></a><strong> </strong><a href="http://totesprobsmaybs.blogspot.com/" target="blank"><strong>mine</strong></a> and I spent the day relaxing -- drinking some margaritas at Lee Harvey's, learning to dj from DJ Pedro himself and topped off the rare beautiful breezy Texas day with an amazing <a href="http://tvontheradio.com/" target="blank"><strong>TV on the Radio</strong></a> show at <a href="http://gypsytearoom.com/" target="blank"><strong>Gypsy Tearoom</strong></a>. <br/><br/>I had never seen this band live before. I've heard stories of the &quot;experience&quot; or &quot;the best live show&quot; and read the quote in the most recent Filter where the band themselves say you might not understand the performance. I told Adam after the show, <strong>&quot;I rarely think this when I leave a show, but&nbsp;HOW do they do this night after night?&quot;</strong> The energy released through the vocals (and arm movements) of Tunde Adebimpe is intense. The band unites and the cohesive sounds on record are equally powerful live. <br/><br/>After the show, Adam and I had the chance to talked with Kyp and Tunde of TVOTR. We quickly walked into the empty Ballroom and recorded for less than 10 minutes total. <br/><br/>Here's segment 1 from Kyp Malone; he tells his love for a <strong><a href="http://209.200.80.36/bands/bandDetail.cfm?artistID=14" target="blank">Narnack Records band</a></strong>, whose music is &quot;honest and organic and not a put- on and not some fake hippie shit.&quot; He also talks about a new record <em>and DVD</em> that he feels insired by. <br/><br/>Soundbed music is &quot;Dry Drunk Emperor&quot; found <a href="http://touchandgorecords.com/bands/album.php?id=367" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a>. <br/><br/>More audio available tomorrow. </p>

As they entered Denton on this past Friday (after a day of uncertainty caused by van problems), we were discussing a follow-up interview and also a possible song request&nbsp;for that night's concert at Hailey's. I had suggested &quot;Union City Blue&quot; since it's one of my favorite songs off <em>Eat to the Beat</em>. It was a song Ramesh was familiar with but not possible for the entire band. <br/><br/>We met up at the show, talked and he realized the song I was thinking wasn't the same song he was.&nbsp; The song he was thinking was &quot;Shalya&quot; -- another amazing track from <em>Eat to the Beat</em>.&nbsp; We went to my car and listened to the&nbsp;song a few times through. Ramesh&nbsp;went looking for an acoustic guitar. I returned&nbsp;into the venue.&nbsp; Within minutes, he said he had found one.&nbsp; I said &quot;where were you thinking we'd record?&quot;, and he replied &quot;there's probably enough room in your car.&quot;&nbsp; I had no complaints and we went to the quietest place to record -- 95 Corolla Studios as it will forever be called. <br/><br/>This is the output.</p>

<p>&quot;My name&nbsp;is <strong>Sam Sanford </strong>and I'm in <strong><a href="http://www.soundteam.net/" target="blank">SOUND team</a></strong>. 

I guess if any of us could ask questions, we would probably want to get <strong>Brian Eno</strong> and ask him a lot of technical questions about specific songs and specific sounds on specific songs.  How did you make this sound?  Like for example on the song "Sky Saw"  the first song on <em>Another Green World</em>, <strong>how did you make the sky saw sound?</strong>&quot;

<p>&quot;My name&nbsp;is <strong>Sam Sanford </strong>and I'm in <strong><a href="http://www.soundteam.net/" target="blank">SOUND team</a></strong>. 'Your Eyes Are Liars'&nbsp;is a song that started out as a recording that <a href="http://www.blondebill.com" target=blank><strong>Bill</strong></a> made by himself in our studio, <a href="http://www.bigorangerecords.com/" target=blank><strong>Big Orange</strong></a>. It underwent a lot of transformations during the process of arranging it for live performance. It was rerecorded to reflect those changes in the arrangement and the song you'll hear on the record is that. It's a recording of&nbsp;the live arrangement that we worked out based on the&nbsp;original recording. Which actually came out on a cassette we put out two years ago called <em>Every Day Is A New Year</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hi. This is <strong>Lenka</strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.decoderring.com.au/" target="blank">Decoder Ring</a></strong>. &quot;Somersault&quot; is the theme song to the movie <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0381429/" target="blank">Somersault</a>. And it's the reason why I joined up with <strong><a href="http://www.decoderring.com.au/" target="blank">Decoder Ring</a></strong> because they were an instrumental band before and they decided they needed female vocals for a song or two on the album. And it's about, I co-write the lyrics with <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0795153/" target="blank">the director</a> of the film, and it's about the idea. It's kind of a truth idea about love. In that, if you can breathe in a person's air and their breath into you, you've got a little piece of them forever. In this girl's sentimental memory of the boy that's what she holds on to. <br/><br/>The movie is coming out in April in the States and the soundtrack <em>Somersault</em> is coming out in May. This film, it's an art house film, but it was a really successful film in Australia. The film and the album both won heaps of awards. It's was kind of a buzz film a couple of years ago. So, it will probably get an art house release over here, but you should look out for it because it's a gorgeous film&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hi. This is <strong>Lenka</strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.decoderring.com.au/" target="blank">Decoder Ring</a></strong>. My favorite city to play in is <strong>New York</strong>, of course. Because, I'm here right now and it's just been quite mind-blowing. And it's great to just be here, for a reason, to do gigs. And the gigs that we've done have been amazing and we've had lots of fans in the audience. It's the coolest city in the world. What more can you say?&quot;<br/><br/><strong>IndieInterviews</strong>: &quot;You like playing there <em>more</em> than in Australia?&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Well, playing in Australia it's a different thing because everyone knows our songs. And they kinda get really excited when they hear them and everyone dances. And also, we play to big festivals like 5,000 kids in the audience (often it's kids) having a great time. Sometimes it's in the day and it's a very different atmosphere. But I'm way more excited about New York right now because it's where I am and it's different, you know?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hi. This is <strong>Lenka</strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.decoderring.com.au/" target="blank">Decoder Ring</a></strong>. The new record I'm into is <a href="http://www.catpowerthegreatest.com/" target="blank"><strong>Cat Power</strong></a> - <em>The Greatest</em>. I have a lot of her albums and I really love her. Being on tour at the moment, I've been listening to it a lot because it's extremely soulful.&nbsp; It's really nice to come home after a crazy night and just, sort of, be&nbsp;nourished.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hi. This is <strong>Lenka</strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.decoderring.com.au/" target="blank">Decoder Ring</a></strong>. My friend's band is <a href="http://www.siamusic.net/home/" target="blank"><strong>Sia</strong></a>. She's an Australian artist that has a record out in America called <em>Colour the Small One</em>. And I'm actually right now having red wine with her. But, well, not right now. She's not sitting right next to me. She's in the bar. I'm in the foyer. Anyways. I love her because she's mad, spontaneous and wonderful. And the album is just gorgeous.&quot; </p>

			<title>IndieInterviews Insider Program</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/indie-interviews-insider-program]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<strong>IndieInterviews.com</strong> has opened a new chapter.  Part 2. 
<p>
We are opening our metaphorical doors to involve whomever wants to be involved.  The new feature is titled <strong>"IndieInterviews Insider"</strong>.
<p>
The program will establish a mailing list for <strong>two-way</strong> communication between <strong>IndieInterviews</strong> and <strong>our listeners</strong>. An IndieInterviews Insider will have privileged information on upcoming interviews and the ability to submit questions via the mailing list. It will also show questions that have been accepted throughout the process: from <strong>booking</strong> to <strong>conducting</strong>. If your question is used, you will be mentioned on the site and if applicable, your blog will be linked.  Podcast posts are also attached to all files available on respective <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=81695587&s=143441">iTunes episodes</a>.  Of course, not all questions will be accepted and we will try to set to it that the interviews have a good balance of Insider questions and those developed by IndieInterviews.com.

<p>
It will allow the participants to assist in the interview development. <strong>Basically, it would just invite others to feel heard and involved.</strong>
<p>
If you want to be involved with the IndieInterviews Insider program, simply email <a href="mailto:insider@indieinterviews.com?subject=I%20Want%20Be%20An%20IndieInterviews%20Insider">insider@indieinterviews.com</a>.]]></description>

			<title>Texas Explodes Indie in 2006</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/texas-explodes-indie-in-2006]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This post was also previously published at <a href="http://texasgigs.com" target=blank><strong>TexasGigs.com</strong></a>. Over the last month, that site has really exploded with content and style. </p><p>The Essential MIX is still being finalized -- "Essential" demands a lot of attention. Friday most likely.</p>
<p>Add your opinions on additional Texas bands who should be on this list.</p>
				<p><strong>Ten Texas Bands Who Will Impact 2006</strong></p><p>  <a href="http://baptistgenerals.com"><strong></strong><strong>Baptist Generals </strong></a>(Denton)<blockquote>Denton's Chris Flemmons has high hopes for his band and their next record. His aspirations to develop pure beauty in a lo-fi shell was present on 2003's <em>No Silver/No Gold</em>. If time and effort are equal to blood and tears, <em>Revolutionary Modern Heart</em> (tentative spring release - <a href="http://subpop.com" target=blank>SubPop</a>) will be both bloody and tearsoaked.</blockquote></p>

<p> <a href="http://bosquebrown.com"><strong>Bosque Brown</strong></a> (Denton/Stephenville)<blockquote>National touring acts rarely take note of their local counterparts, Bosque Brown not only amazed Damien Jurado but has been asked for as tour support by many others (Two Gallants and John Vanderslice). Her gothic sound resonates venues and leaves audiences wanting more. See this band live and you'll agree.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.janahunter.tk"><strong>Jana Hunter</strong></a> (Austin)<blockquote>After an amazing year, including a split with freak-folker Devendra Banhart and tour dates with like-minded Castanets and Deerhoof, 2006 should be an even stronger year for Jana Hunter. Her late 2005 release, <em>Blank Unstaring Heirs of Doom</em>, is gaining audience interest and press attention. IndieInterviews thinks she might be the reincarnation of Nico.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.chosendarkness.com/"><strong>I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness</strong></a> (Austin)<blockquote>After three years recording and scrapping sessions, Chosen Darkness signed to Secretly Canadian and have finalized their debut LP, <em>Fear Is On Our Side</em>, due March 7, 2006. Using a studio shared with Austinites ...Trail of Dead, the band has developed a sound expanding from their popular 2003 self-titled EP (or as their press release writes "[on the new release,] ILYBICD breaks out of any genre-specific molds").  <br>**<strong>NEW MP3 - <a href="http://www.scjag.com/mp3/sc/accordingtoplan.mp3" target=blank>According To Plan</a></strong>**
</blockquote></p>



<p><a href="http://www.knifeonthewater.com"><strong>Knife in the Water </strong></a> (Austin)<blockquote>Since impressing many with their 2003's <em>Cut The Cord</em>, Knife in the Water has been touring extensively and recently have been working in south Austin on their upcoming record <em>Viet Kieu</em>. The band's country-fused psychedelia has garnered them foreign and a growing domestic attention. Heavy touring is expected in Texas and their home away from home, Europe.</blockquote></p>


<p><a href="http://midlake.net" target=blank><strong>Midlake</strong></a> (Denton)<blockquote>Expanding on the European successes of fellow Denton artists, 5-piece Midlake signed to English label Bella Union and released 2004's <em>Bamnan and Slivercork</em>. After a brief tour with Rilo Kiley, Midlake spent most of 2005 working diligently on their sophomore release <em>Van Occupanther</em>.</blockquote></p>

<p>
<a href="http://pilotdrift.com"><strong>Pilotdrift</strong></a> (Texarkana)<blockquote>The band's recent release <em>Water Sphere</em>, a Good Records release, has got them much local press and excellent local bills. They will join fellow Good Records labelmates, Polyphonic Spree, at the band's annual winter show.  If the band's successes continue to leave the DFW area, who knows what well happen. The band will have their chance for this as they nationally support Supergrass in February.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.jound.com/shearwater"><strong>Shearwater</strong></a> (Austin)<blockquote>Unfairly confined to the weaker placement in their relationship with Okkervil River, Shearwater will define their identity as Texas' most accurate rock band: expansive, beautiful and yet, full of lament. After their 2005 EP release <em>Thieves</em> and touring with The Mountain Goats, Jonathan Meiburg has written, recorded and is now finalizing their next full-length, <em>Palo Santo</em>, planned for April 22, 2006 <a href="http://misrarecords.com" target=blank><strong>Misra</strong></a> release.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.soundteam.net"><strong>Sound Team</strong></a> (Austin)<blockquote>The band's most recent EP, <em>Work EP</em>, explains what this band does most of their time. The band has been working on a major label full length with Mike McCarthy and Alan Moulder, whose collective resumes include Smashing Pumpkins, Spoon and My Bloody Valentine. The record, which the band has been working on for over a year, should be evidence of their passion, effort and work.</blockquote></p>

<p><a href="http://www.voxtrot.com"><strong>Voxtrot</strong></a> (Austin)<blockquote>Their EP <em>Raised By Wolves</em> has gotten the band massive press in the blogsphere (including <a href="http://www.spin.com/features/band_of_the_day/2005/12/051214_voxtrot/" target=blank>SPIN Band of the Day</a>). The band's history includes major love from their Austin homebase, from home shows to sell out shows at Emo's, the band has broadened their audience greatly after SXSW and CMJ showcases. Their full length record is in the works and should amplify from the era fusing pop featured on their EP.</blockquote></p>]]></description>

I am very lucky I got to meet all these people and that they helped me so much as a person and as a filmmaker - It makes life seem really exciting.</i></blockquote>Mills might have known the title at the time or based on his quote, DeLaughter and band confirmed this title.<BR><BR>
More details of the record can be heard in the <a href="http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=23116"><strong>IndieInterviews September podcast</strong> with <strong>Tim DeLaughter</strong></a>.]]></description>

<strong>10</strong><BR>Andrew Bird<BR>
<i>& The Mysterious Production of Eggs</i></a><BR><BR>
MP3: <a href="http://ekonomiskmgmt.com/audio/andrew_bird/Nervous_Tic.mp3">A Nervous Tic... </a> | <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4469859

<BR><BR>
Lyrically, one of the most impressive records I have ever heard. Bird's allusions and metaphors have scattered this record with gems of literary and auditory beauty.  His layering of whistles, raw electric guitar and his technical violin parts work into one of the year's most unique and skilled releases.  These songs all start by escalating in way that you've swallowed the lure whole before you know otherwise. <i>& The Mysterious Production of Eggs</i> leads you on an irresistible journey of Thai butterflies, calcium, GPS, monsters and more.

<BR><BR>
The promotion for this record was so ambitious it was nearly a turn off.  The quote from Uncut or NME referred to the record, as early as February, as one of the year's best records.  From the first notes of "Like Eating Glass", the energy of the record is overwhelming.  The record's less successful tracks are surrounded by single suited songs.  The consistent layers of guitars and vocals makes listening to the record soothing and yet energizing.

<strong>8</strong><BR>Rogue Wave<BR>
<i>Descended Like Vultures</i></a><BR><BR>
MP3: <a href="http://72.1.140.201/downloads/free/Publish_My_Love351.mp3">Publish My Love</a> | <a href="http://72.1.140.201/downloads/free/10:1334.mp3">10:1</a><BR><BR>
After loving <i>Out Of The Shadows</i> over the last two years, I had massive expectations for the band and the record.  The <i>10:1</i> EP worked to wet the appetite. "10:1" is one of Rogue Wave's strongest songs: the recording zips, squeals and creaks established a ripened character for the band's sophomore attempt. The charm of <Descended Like Vulture</i> is the record's pacing and order. The acoustic numbers shows a clarity of a singer/songwriter and quickly is followed by elaborate full pop songs showcasing the tight entity that Rogue Wave has become.

This band opened for Drive-By Truckers November 2004.  The band was signed by Fat Possum based on a strong suggestion from The Black Keys' Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carneyand. The Heartless Bastards joined the label and released <i>Stairs and Elevators</i> in February 2005. The recording's raw quality catches you off-guard. After a few listens, you realize it more accurately reflects the band's efforts than a glossy recording. The blues community has had many female powerhouses. However at 5'2" and blonde, Erika Wennerstrom has created her own chapter. <i>Stairs and Elevators</i> has more attitude than you expect of any band's debut.

Richard Buckner, Damien Jurado and Dolorean played a sold out show in Austin in a nontraditional venue.  The night was amazing.  Dolorean opened and established a smooth foundation for the night.  After Dolorean finished their short set, a thin, tall, scruffy man entered the stage wielding a guitar and said "Damien asked me to come out and play you a song."  He didn't say his name or the title of the song.  He stayed on stage playing guitar with Damien Jurado.  After the show, the man was guarding the merch booth.  I asked what his name was and if he had any music available.  At that point in time, he handed me a copy of a burned disc.  The record got picked up by KEEP Records and was released very limitedly.  Look forward to a future release from this amazing songwriter.

<BR><BR>
People aren't making records with the way Adams does it.  The urgency of the record is felt with each additional listen.  The masks Ryan puts on and shares with the listener are an anthology of pain and loss. This is the most Whiskeytown-like record that Ryan has recorded since going solo.  Everyone says it's <i>Heartbreaker</i>.  Which no doubt is a compliment but it also puts <i>Jacksonville City Nights</i> in a shadow that isn't necessary or accurate.  If <i>Cold Roses</i> could have been limited to a single disc and allowed to stew for 8 months, it would be <i>Jacksonville City Nights</i>.

The jovial nature of this release carries the dozen cuts through the blurs of words and swamp of keyboards.  Cheated by the dozens of comparisons and celebrity namechecks the band receives, CYHSY! have double the duties to establish a sound and image of their own. Luckily, the band's debut <i>CYHSY!</i> captures the carnival atmosphere and fused it into a well paced rock record. The future for this group is blindingly bright.

<BR><BR>
Great records must have many human characteristics: body (substance through instruments), emotion (lyrical or tonal feelings), thought (efficiency) and a heartbeat (the record's soul).  This record, in all the variety of songs, always accentuates the record's heartbeat. This element unifies the eleven tracks.  The use of samples defines the brilliance of The Octopus Project: subtle, clever and with intent.  The accuracy and precision in this record astonishes me. The fine tuning of <i>One Then Hundred Thousand Million</i> is the crux of it's beauty.

<BR><BR>
I often wonder if Sufjan predicts the joy listeners experience as we trek through these states along his side.  I've visited Illinois.  I have stories of Chicago and Urbana. However, it takes the genius of Stevens to illustrate these cities and towns as done on <i>Illinoise</i>.  Sufjan's <a href="http://nsu.newschool.edu/writing/lit/lit5sel.htm#stevens" target=blank><strong>stint at the New School</strong></a> has never been so  present; as through these lovely short fictions (disguised as songs), Stevens shares the histories, thoughts and emotions of this interesting state. Although <i>Seven Swans</i> received heavy rotation, I was cautiously anticipating the continued religious subtleties.  However on this record, Sufjan shines more light into the struggles of piety and the disappointment which results. <i>Illinoise</i>'s 74 minutes make for a lush, descriptive, and yet, beautifully authentic glimpse at the Land of Lincoln.

After <i>Castaways and Cutouts</i> and last year's <i>Her Majesty</i>, the momentum was building for a powerful record.  This record layered with adjectives and characters so thick that Meloy's idols alive and dead must be rejoicing. The vocals are placed perfectly ahead of everything else. As the band's stage show has grown into something of it's own, as have the records. This record persuade the listener to want to see it live. This factor is surely a massive success from any musician's perspective. Decemberists multi-instrumentalist Chris Funk correctly defined <i>Picaresque</i> as a truly quintessential Decemberists record.

The music director at the time set up lots of fantastic in-studio performances.  In February 2005, <a href="http://roguewavemusic.com/" target=blank>Rogue Wave</a> stopped in for a 5 song acoustic set.  The band had previously played in the fall of 2004 in the smaller on-air studio.
<BR><BR>
The band's performance was amazing. Amongst the tracks they played at <a href="http://ktsw.net" target=blank>KTSW</a> was a cover of Nirvana's On A Plain.

            <description><![CDATA[Sound Team is yet another amazing Austin band on the verge of massive success.  Two-thirds of the band's six members attended the same high school in San Antonio, TX.  There they played and recorded music with a variety of groups. Sooner or later, the band grew and developed into the current lineup present today.<BR><BR>Bassist/multi-instrumentalist Bill Baird and vocalist/guitarist Matt Oliver met in Austin in 2001.  The band has a young fanbase, being as in 2002, Baird asked his younger brother Michael and Michael’s friend Jordan Johns to join the band. Both of the guys were in high school at the time.  Over the next two years the band added Bill's old friend and guitarist Sam Sanford and organist Gabe Pearlman to establish the Sound Team present on their new record "Work".<BR><BR>The independent group released their initial recordings on CD-Rs, limited press 7-inch vinyls, several cassettes, with each release and show garnering gradual audience and press attention.  <a href="http://soundteam.net" target=blank><IMG SRC="http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/podcasts/indieinterviews/images/soundteam.jpg" border="1" bordercolor="black" align="left" style="padding : 3px 3px 3px 3px;"></a>After months of searching, Bill stumbled upon former record-pressing plant filled with <a href="http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=15655" target="blank">"three tons of garbage, asbestos and cockroaches."</a>  After finding the location, the band invested and became the owners of <a href="http://www.bigorangerecords.com" target=blank>Big Orange Records</a> and soon began making handmade records.  Sound Team's next record, <i>Work</i> is the band's last self-released release prior to their debut record on Capitol in spring of 2006.  On <i>Work</i>, a 5 track EP released, 185-gram vinyl and, like habit, cassette tape, the band continues its style of synth and guitar waves and rhythmic evolutions.<BR><BR>The band has had sporadic touring schedules(last playing hometown Austin at SXSW) and has been in the studio for months.  They are doing a two week tour up to NYC where they played CMJ's Summerstage with Arcade Fire.  This tour will be with Mazarin.<BR><BR>11/10/05 - Baton Rouge, LA @ Red Star<BR>11/11/05 - Houston, TX @ TBA<BR>11/12/05 - Austin, TX @ Emo's (Inside)<BR>11/13/05 - Dallas, TX @ Gypsy Tea Room<BR>11/14/05 - Norman, OK @ Opolis<BR>11/16/05 - Minneapolis, MN @ 400 Bar<BR>11/17/05 - Chicago, IL @ Empty Bottle<BR>11/19/05 - Cleveland, OH @ Beachland<BR>11/22/05 - New York, NY @ Mercury Lounge<BR>11/23/05 - Philadelphia, PA @ Northstar<BR><BR><BR>Their latest release has the image designed by Sam Sanford.

			<title>Bosque Brown</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/bosque-brown]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Often when you get a new record, comparisons immediately hit. Other times, you are mesmerized and it takes days to set bearings for the sound.  <a href="http://bosquebrown.com/" target=blank">Bosque Brown</a>'s <i>Plays Mara Lee Miller</i> was initially a mystery.  After listening to the voice and lyric content for a week, my bearings are set. There is a lot of talk around the indie rock scene of the relationship between <a href="http://www.dragcity.com/bands/newsom.html" target=blank>Joanna Newsom</a> and <a href="http://www.dragcity.com/bands/smog.html" target=blank>SMOG</a>'s Bill Callahan.  Rarely does the discussion of offspring come about.  However, if I had to guess what their talent fusion would be, it would be <a href="http://bosquebrown.com/" target=blank">Bosque Brown</a>: an innocence coupled with troubled thoughts and fears. <BR><BR>Bosque Brown is the moniker Mara Lee Miller uses.  Her debut record, <i>Plays Mara Lee Miller</i>, is a collage of haunting songs which reflect a time far from today.<BR><BR>Most new female indie vocalists get compared to Cat Power's Chan Marshall and/or Joni Mitchell. But for Miller to get that would be truly an injustice.  Her lyrics and tone are far before Chan herself. This is the music that Gillian Welch would love. Those that tell stories of the rapture and times of old. Miller's friend and supporter Damien Jurado compared her "the heartache of Kitty Wells and the lonesome howl of Robert Johnson", which might be most accurate.

			<title>Fruit Bats/Off By A Week</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/fruit-bats-off-by-a-week]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Though <a href="http://www.subpop.com/scripts/main/news.php?table=news&display_type=news_full&id=528" target=blank>SubPop's RSS feed</a> noted October 5th as the date the Fruit Bats would perform on the Last Call with Carson Daly show, something was wrong. 
<BR><BR>
It wasn't tonight so if you stayed up, set TiVo or generally altered your schedule in any way for it, IndieInterviews.com feels your pain and regrets the misguided information.
<BR><BR>
The correct date is <strong>October 12th</strong>, exactly one week from the date noted before.  Bright side is the interview with his thoughts on the Carson performance is relevent for one more week! Enjoy.

            <link><![CDATA[http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/the-black-angels]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[We're less than two weeks out from the worldwide release of <a href="http://www.theblackangels.com/" target=blank>The Black Angels</a> self-titled debut EP.  The Austin-based six piece has had massive European exposure and acclaim in little over a year and half.<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/zub/33211088/in/set-737679/" target=blank><IMG SRC="http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/podcasts/indieinterviews/images/blackangels.jpg" border="1" bordercolor="black" align="right" style="padding : 3px 3px 3px 3px;"></a>  Though the band takes their name from a Velvet Underground track, they sound much like a modern-day The Doors.  The extending moans of vocalist Alex Mass and the organ playing of Jennifer Raines make the comparison fair. With a demo track entitled "Syd Barrett Blues", it's really clear to see the psychedelic connections the band has received.<BR><BR>The band played Austin's <a href="http://www.kvrx.org/locallive/performance.php?pid=634" target=blank>KVRX radio</a> last year broadening their local fanbase. In addition, The Black Angels have been raised under the loving hand of BBC's <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/alt/zanelowe/" target=blank>Zane Lowe</a>, who has generously spinned their music on BBC Radio.  The group has wild backgrounds which surely worked as foundation for the haunting sounds on record. <BR><BR>The band has a few dates coming up with the most buzzed band of 2005, <a href="http://clapyourhandssayyeah.com/" target=blank>Clap Your Hands Say Yeah!</a><BR><BR>10/12/05 - Dallas, TX @ Gypsy Tea Room w/ <a href="http://clapyourhandssayyeah.com/" target=blank>CYHSY!</a><BR>10/13/05 - Dallas, TX @ The Double-Wide<BR>10/16/05 - San Antonio, TX @ Sanctuary<BR>10/17/05 - Nashville, TN @ The Basement<BR>10/18/05 - Wash, DC @ Black Cat w/ <a href="http://clapyourhandssayyeah.com/" target=blank>CYHSY!</a><BR>10/19/05 - Baltimore, MD @ 8x10 Club w/ <a href="http://clapyourhandssayyeah.com/" target=blank>CYHSY!</a><BR>10/27/05 - Athen, GA @ Caledonia Lounge w/ The High Caliber<BR>10/31/05 - Raleigh, NC @ King's Barcade w/ Glissade<BR><a href="http://www.lightintheattic.net/releases/blackangels/index.php" target=blank>And More...</a><BR><BR>Seattle-based <a href="http://www.lightintheattic.net/" target=blank>Light In The Attic</a> will release the band's first record, a 4 song EP, worldwide (except North America) October 17th and then stateside the following day.

            <description><![CDATA[<a href="http://secretlycanadian.com" target=blank>Secretly Canadian</a> has done an amazing job adding new bands to it's roster: <a href="http://chosendarkness.com" target=blank>I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness</a> and <a href="http://catfishhaven.com" target=blank>Catfish Haven</a>. <a href="http://www.catfishhaven.com/onesheet.html" target=blank><IMG SRC="http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/podcasts/indieinterviews/images/catfish.jpg" border="1" bordercolor="black" align="right" style="padding : 3px 3px 3px 3px;"></a> The latter is a solid three-piece who've toured with groups like My Morning Jacket & Kings of Leon. Guitar, bass, and drums are the band's simple palate. The band calls Chicago home but take their name from the Missouri trailer park guitarist and vocalist George Hunter was raised. 
<BR><BR>

			<title>Band of Horses</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/band-of-horses]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<strong>Band of Horses</strong> have just finalized the record due in March 2006 on <a href="http://subpop.com" target=blank>SubPop</a>.  They have had great reception from Southern audiences. About the time they signed to SubPop, the band did a short Deep South tour with Iron & Wine.  The band's debut release was produced with Phil Ek (Doug Martsch from Halo Benders to 2002's solo <i>Now You Know</i> and also SubPop's own The Shins.)
<BR><a href="http://bandofhorses.com" target=blank><IMG SRC="http://indieinterviews.libsyn.com/podcasts/indieinterviews/images/horses.jpg" border=1 bordercolor=black align=left style="padding : 3px 3px 3px 3px;"></a>
Band of Horses will quickly get sound comparisons to My Morning Jacket; mainly due to the shared love of thick reverb between Jim James and Band of Horses' Ben Bridwell.
<BR>
While we wait for the record, SubPop is also <a href="http://www.subpop.com/scripts/main/discography.php?cat=true&display_type=discog_single&title=Limited%20Edition%20Tour%20EP" target=blank>selling</a> a previously tour-only limited-pressed EP which features 3 demos and 3 live recordings.
<BR>
Band of Horses will leave home for a short 8 date tour up the West Coast with Jagjaguwar's <a href="http://jound.com/okkervil/main.html" target=blank>Okkervil River</a>.
<BR><BR>
10/20 - Tucson, AZ @ Plush<BR>
10/21 - San Diego, CA @ Casbah<BR>
10/22 - Los Angeles, CA @ The Echo<BR>
10/23 - San Francisco, CA @ Cafe Du Nord<BR>
10/24 - Redding, CA @ Serendipity<BR>
10/25 - Portland, OR @ Doug Fir Lounge<BR>
