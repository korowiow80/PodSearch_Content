			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:16px;">In the last year or so Netflix has changed from one of my favorite companies to one of the ones I hate the most. When they suddenly changed their pricing and did away with the DVDs by mail I thought it was the worst PR blunder since New Coke. Then, a couple of days later, they sent out an email that was supposed to be (I think) an apology email but which came across as &quot;Bite my ass, we&#39;ll do what we want and you&#39;ll like it&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">I canceled my DVD by mail subscription, which is what I think they wanted to accomplish anyway, and almost canceled my regular subscription.<br />
	</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">I&#39;m still not sure I won&#39;t cancel it, but they recently announced they were going to be doing original series and then not too long after announced that Arrested Development, one of the greatest TV shows ever, would be brought back as a limited new series on their system which already has the old episodes. I&#39;ll give them a while longer just for recognizing class,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">I was thinking that the old HBO show John From Cincinnati would also be a great one for them to work on. JFC, as we fans know it, was a fantastic one season series which HBO canceled because the ratings weren&#39;t good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">The problem with the show was that it was not pre-digested pablum. To watch the show you had to think, something that many of the television viewers weren&#39;t prepared to do on a Sunday night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">However, JFC has a pretty loyal cult following and those of us who loved it, LOVED IT!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Since Netflix doesn&#39;t have a good way on their website to contact them by email unless you fall into specific categories, I thought I&#39;d bring the idea up here and see if anyone had any thoughts. The show would fit them perfectly and by lowering the production costs and making it available online they could likely generate enough interest to make it a worthwhile project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Come on Netflix, &quot;resurrect&quot; John From Cincinnati!</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:16px;">It&#39;s starting to feel like spring here in the South (mild, mild, mild winter) so I hear the beach calling. To be honest, I hear it calling all the time but it gets louder when it&#39;s like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">For those of you who are suffering from the cold and need a little something to get you craving boat drinks and feeling the sand between your toes here&#39;s a song that has to put a little warmth on you. I especially love the line &quot;I wish I had a dime for every bill I got to pay&quot;.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:16px;">As my readers know, I am all about giving props and thumbs up when I like something and, even more, when someone does a good job but today it&#39;s time to give a big thumbs down to Verizon and probably most cell phone companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">I&#39;m ignoring all the BS about the throttling down, the limited connections, the awful customer service, the billing problems, and all the other BS because I&#39;ve decided that no matter how upset I get it makes no difference and they all seem to be the same. However, I had enough today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Last year, as a matter of fact one year ago THIS MONTH, I changed to Verizon and went with the Droid 2 Global for a variety of reasons. The wifey was getting an iPhone and since we were going to be involved in the app business for both platforms I decided to go the Droid route. I chose the Motorola Droid 2 Global for a variety of reasons that aren&#39;t important here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">I like the phone except that 1) it&#39;s slow, 2) it has some annoying habits including shutting off in the middle of apps occasionally, and 3) the battery life is worse than awful.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Today I wanted to buy an extra battery because I&#39;m going to watch the better half run a half marathon tomorrow and my phone went dead last year before it was all over. However, I find out today that none of the Verizon stores carry batteries for the Droid 2 anymore because it is an &quot;old model&quot;. This is infuriating! I bought the damn thing a year ago!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">I can understand that they changed models, but if I can order a battery online they ought to be able to keep one or two in their stores doe those of us who just bought the damned thing LAST YEAR!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Wise up people and beware. It is just this kind of thing that causes new companies to come in and wipe out the old ones. A company that remembers they make money because of us the customer will cause us to jump ship because I guarantee you that 1) none of us are that loyal tyo Verizon and 2) we&#39;re getting screwed over!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Enough of the rant.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:16px;">My kids got me a Mr. Coffee brand K-cup coffeemaker for Christmas and I have really, really enjoyed it. My problem is that I rarely drink more than one cup of coffee at a sitting and so it is a hassle to go to all the fuss and clean up of a coffee pot just for one cup. However, with this thing there&#39;s no muss and fuss, just pop a K-cup into the holder, add water, and put your cup under the spout. When you&#39;re finished just throw the used K-cup away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">In addition to regular coffee, I have tea, coffee, flavored coffee, hot apple cider, hot chocolate, and even Sweet Tea K-cups (and the Sweet tea ones make a perfect large glass of iced tea) so there is a lot of variety in addition to ease of use. I highly recommend this contraption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">However, my love for this thing isn&#39;t the reason for this entry. I want to offer a thumbs up to Amazon.com for their customer service. As a disclosure, my readers know that we are an Amazon affiliate and, in addition, I write and sell books for the Kindle.However, if they were doing something wrong I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to blast them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Since as a part of my nightly ritual of television watching I like to have a glass or cup of something to sip on. &nbsp;I am trying to switch from drinking caffeinated diet drinks to something else, and my wife had bought me an herbal tea sampler of K-cups. In the sampler was a blend called &quot;Sleepytime&quot; by Celestial Seasonings. Yeah, I know, the name is kid of wussy-ish but I tried it anyway with a spoonful of honey in the bottom of the cup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">The tea is a blend of Chamomile and Spearmint and actually appears to relax you and wind you down just a little bit at the end of a busy day. I soon ran out of that blend and after some research found that Amazon.com had the best price on these and so placed an order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">The packages arrived pretty quickly and the other night I plugged one in and made a cup, then sat down to watch a movie. As I raised the cup to my lips I was a little put off at a musty odor emanating from the cup. Nevertheless, I sipped on it until it was gone. Last night I did the same thing, made the cup and then sat down to watch the second episode of &quot;The River&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">I again hit that smell coming from the cup, and was able to identify it as the odor of old gym socks. I&#39;m not sure why this would have been, because the taste was okay, so long as you don&#39;t breathe in while you&#39;re sipping it. However, the smell of the tea was part of what I enjoyed and so I knew this was a REJECT. I jumped online, fumbled around Amazon until I found a place I could send them an email, &nbsp;described the problem and asked how I could return the item.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">To my surprise, this morning I had an email from Amazon.com waiting for me. They had refunded the money to my credit card, told me they were sorry there was a problem, and told me to just dispose of the tea, no need to return it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">That is good customer service. I still don&#39;t have my tea, but I certainly have the warm fuzzies about Amazon. And I also have no worries about ordering more from them because the original sampler was from them and there were no problems, this was just an anomaly.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:16px;">As I&#39;ve mentioned before, I like some of the reality television shows although the longer they continue the worse the show gets. Top Chef being a prime example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">This past week the ABS show, The Biggest Loser, so infuriated my wife that for us the show is now a &quot;will not watch&quot; EVER.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">I&#39;ll mention that I have too many pounds on me, so when I refer to someone as &quot;a fat chick&quot; it isn&#39;t really referring to their weight. To me, that term describes an attitude more than it describes a physical appearance. &nbsp;One of the most attractive women I have ever known was a bigger woman but her weight didn&#39;t detract from her inner and outer beauty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Back in the days when I had just graduated law school, one of the pieces of advice I got from a veteran trial lawyer was &quot;never put a fat woman on a jury if you are representing the Plaintiff in a civil case, or the Defendant in a criminal case&quot;. While I know it sounds awful, the times I forgot or ignored that piece of advice I invariably regretted it later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">His thinking was that, as a rule, &quot;fat chicks&quot; are mean and show little sympathy for others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">A couple of the girls on The Biggest Loser are proving this to be correct. A couple of shows ago a brother and sister team won the right to &quot;come to the ranch&quot; by meeting a weight loss goal and immediately the brother was set upon by the others on the team that he went to, just like a bunch of chickens will set on another chicken who has a bit of blood on them. The other chickens eventually peck that one to death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Almost all of the team members were pretty atrocious, but the worst was a girl named Conda &nbsp;and a woman named Kim, who used to be a hot wrestler under the stage name &quot;Desire&quot;. Kim is intense, I&#39;ll give her props for that, but is just not nice and Conda is an absolute bitch. What amazes me is that the people on the team don&#39;t seem to realize what a drag a person like that will be on team spirit, since she is continually instigating and causing trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">But the reason we are no longer watching the show isn&#39;t because of these two people, it&#39;s not because there are other doofuses, it&#39;s not because the show is unrealistic, and it&#39;s not because it is full of BS (Oh Bob! This sprout and broccoli sandwich with a sprinkle of tofu powder tastes just as good as a hamburger or slice of pizza!) We are no longer going to watch the show because they are spending way too much time focusing on the negative aspects of what &quot;the game&quot; causes people to do there and the trainers are either blissfully unaware, choose not to address the issues, just don&#39;t care, or are held back from keeping these people from engaging in destructive behavior so that the show has more drama and gets better numbers. It is this kind of reality television that is harmful to us as a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">So long as the producers allow this to happen, The Biggest Loser is no longer on our menu.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:16px;">I was really looking forward to this movie after seeing the previews. I love Hawaii, am fascinated by its history and the way the missionary families intertwined with the islanders, and I even like George Clooney.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">The movie was booked into the local theaters when it got the Academy Award nomination, so my wife and I decided to go and see it when we got a chance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Was it well written? Yes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Was the acting good? Yes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Was it worth seeing? Probably not and definitely not worth wasting the price of even a matinee priced ticket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">The scenes of Hawaii itself are sparse, most of the movie seems to take place indoors. There are few scenes of Hawaiian life, the references to the title are almost non-existent, and overall it&#39;s just boring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">There are some bright spots. The character &quot;Sid&quot; can be entertaining at times, George Clooney and the young actress that plays his teenage daughter both do a very good job, and there are some memorable lines from the movie but overall it just doesn&#39;t sing. It doesn&#39;t even clear its throat to begin singing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">The best scene, to me, is the last one of the movie with George and the girls watching television. It is the only part of the movie that I would say was done well, even though there was minimal talking. It was just a great way to wrap up an otherwise boring, depressing movie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">At least one thumbs down, maybe two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">If you are interested in Hawaii I&#39;ve put some of my favorites down below. The books are phenomenal, the movies aren&#39;t quite as great but they are fun and the scenery is like an extra character in the movie. I have all of these and read or watch them at least once a year.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:16px;">Let me lead of by saying that I think Top Chef has probably jumped the shark. The advertiser plugs are getting annoying, the &quot;set ups&quot; are ridiculous (right, there&#39;s a big black state trooper blocking the country road and by the way, the road from San Antonio to Austin or Dallas is an interstate, and no one noticed John Besh or Padma standing in the field next to the road with cooking stations set up) and both the judges and contestants are bigger asses than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">The show just isn&#39;t a &quot;must watch&quot; any more. For the first few seasons it was less obvious that the judging was based on who the producer wants to go on versus who the judges think should advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">By the way, &quot;my palate&quot; and &quot;needs more acid&quot; have to be the two most overused phrases in reality cooking television. Come on!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">I am also very, very tired of people getting ragged on for not naming their dish correctly. This week&#39;s dumbass judges&#39;s statement&#8230; &quot;If he hadn&#39;t called it Almond Joy we&#39;d be praising him right now&quot;. Really Emeril? Really? To paraphrase Tom Colicchio from one of the earlier seasons, &quot;This is Top Chef, not Top Food Namer.&quot; (By the way, all 4 judges were ragging on the chef-testant because of the name).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">If the show was on any channel other than Bravo it would be a goner after this season, but with some of the other crap that is on that station it is probably safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">By the way judges&#8230;I&#39;ve eaten at some of your fancy, high priced restaurants and I hate to tell you that the aren&#39;t as good as the show would make you think. In fact, the words overpriced and pretentious come to mind. With the exception of Hubert Keller&#39;s Fleur de Lis in Vegas (which was absolutely magnificent and Chef Keller even came by the table to talk to us) I have been very, very disappointed.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:16px;">I am sitting here at my computer working on one of my books and listening to music playing, this time from YouTube playing on another screen. Since I&#39;m firmly butting my head against that impenetrable barrier (at least until it suddenly disappears) known as writer&#39;s block, I thought I&#39;d blog a minute to see if that loosens me up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">I am amazed at the way that certain songs evoke such strong memories. When Queen&#39;s Another One Bites the Dust/We are the Champions plays anywhere the smell of coconut oil (from suntan lotion) blasts into my memory as well as the picture of a beautiful blonde girl named Angie that used to ride my bus in high school. I never had the courage to do any more than carry on a brief conversation with her and wonder what would have happened if I had the chops then that I developed later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">In this case, it is Led Zeppelin&#39;s Stairway to Heaven that brought the memory of a warm spring/summer night, the smell of popcorn at the skating rink and the feel of a nubile young girl firmly snuggled against me (back in the days before my belly would have prevented the intimate contact) for the first part of the song as we skate danced. Of course, most of us left the floor as soon as the fast part of the song started (I&#39;ve still never seen anyone dance to that) but for the few minutes before it cranked it was the best song for the up close and personal contact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">It&#39;s hard to believe that the music invading the air and internet waves today will cause the same sense of nostalgia for today&#39;s teens as they approach the magic 50 number but who knows?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">I wonder what Angie Campbell is doing now. If anyone knows her (she lived in Northwest Park in Houston and went to Eisenhower) ask her to drop me a line here and let me know.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:16px;">I&#39;m a little behind in posting these but better late than never.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;">We flew out of Shreveport, La and into McCarran on a pretty non-eventful flight. Saved pretty good bucks flying from there instead of DFW so if you&#39;re in the area and planning a trip you might want to price it both ways. We flew in at night and the airport was pretty deserted so got the bags and out to the cab line pretty quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:16px;"><b id="internal-source-marker_0.8927187861409038" style="background-color: transparent; "><span style="background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; ">We took a c</span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">ab from the airport and took the freeway. Since we were staying at the Venetian I meant to ask them to take Las Vegas Blvd. instead since I had heard it was cheaper, but forgot to ask and the cab driver did not ask us, as I understand he was supposed to.. The cab ride via freeway cost $25.50 plus a tip, $30 total. LV cabs are soooo expensive compared to other places.</span></b></span></p>
<div style="background-color: transparent; "><span style="font-size:16px;"><span id="internal-source-marker_0.8927187861409038"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">My first thought was Wow, Vegas hasn&rsquo;t changed a lot in the few years since I&#39;ve been here except to get more Vegas-y.</span></p>
<p>	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">We checked in at the Venetian to stay in the Vennezia Suites. Very nice. I was staying with my best friend, let&#39;s call him Habeas Corpus, and splitting a room and it was definitely the nicest one he and I had shared in Vegas but then we usually stay downtown. In this case I had to do a little work online while I was on my trip so he had booked us a room with a separate sitting area and desk. Plenty of room, view was of the roof of the parking garage but since it was a guy&#39;s trip who cares? They wanted $17.95 (or maybe it was $12.95) a day for internet service but I had brought my 3g wireless card and it worked fine. The hotels practice of 1) charging a resort fee and 2) charging for internet sucks, but that&#39;s Vegas, prepare to be ripped off in as many ways as they can get away with it.</span></p>
<p>	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">By the way, if you have never stayed at the Venetian it is a looooooong walk from the front desk to the rooms. </span></p>
<p>	</span>This was my first time staying here and I was surprised that #1 there were a lot of middle easterners, way more than was proportional to the actual population and #2, a lot of the younger crowd, early 20s. Before I get accused of being racist, ageist, or anything else, I don&#39;t care what nationality or age they are,I was just commenting. Downtown there are a lot of Asians, at the California there are a lot of Hawaiians, at Paris there used to be a lot of frat boy types, etc.</span></div>
<div style="background-color: transparent; "><span style="font-size:16px;"><br />
	</span></div>
<div style="background-color: transparent; "><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">One thing I immediately noticed as we sat down in the patio area at the Grand Lux for dinner, there are a lot more short skirts and high heels than I was used to seeing. Not only are there more, the dresses were A LOT shorter. I promptly got online on my Droid and bought a new website name, BabesOf Vegas.com so look for it soon.</span></p>
<p>	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">We ate dinner at the Grand Lux with a few drinks. HC got some kind of breakfast and I got Chicken Piccata that was good. We also started out with some kind of duck breast pot stickers which were excellent and spent our time eating, drinking, conversing, and ogling the women walking by.</span><br />
	</span></div>
<div style="background-color: transparent; "><span style="font-size:16px;"><br />
	</span></div>
<div style="background-color: transparent; "><span style="font-size:16px;">Leaving the Grand Lux, we stopped to play a little at one of the Venetian Casinos and I started the worst gambling run in Vegas I have had EVER!</p>
<p>	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">I&#39;m not a huge slots fan but all of the table games were overpriced so I played a $1 Wheel of Fortune game and was down $50 quick. I didn&#39;t get any wins out of the $50, no Spin the Wheels, nothing. This machine was tighter than Rick Santorum&#39;s butt at a gay pride parade.</span></p>
<p>	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">From there we went to the Wynn, which is next door (in Vegas distance, actually about a quarter mile hike).</span></p>
<p>	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">I&#39;ve only been to the Wynn a few times and never stayed here but the dealers are always really nice and the decor (assuming you like Whorehouse Red) is pretty nice as well.</span></p>
<p>	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">We played craps for a little while, dropped $150 QUICK. There were lots of sevens after you had loaded up the come bets, only a couple of numbers, hit and I don&#39;t remember ever winning a come bet. Arrggh!</span></span></p>
<p>	<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">I hit the slots again and lost a little more, then we decided to adjourn to the bar. I don&#39;t remember which bar it is, other than it&#39;s round, right in front of the windows to the Wynn waterfall, and is nice.</span></p>
<p>	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">The bar must be on the way to some nightclub because the short, short skirts and high,high heels began coming by in rapid succession. The waitresses are nice, attractive, and attentive although the drinks are a tad pricey. The bar tab for three drinks (a Chivas 18 yo scotch, White Russian, and a Grey Goose martini cost $55 plus tip). However, the scenery definitely was worth the price and the music wasn&#39;t so loud that you couldn&#39;t talk.</span></p>
<p>	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">After we finished our drinks we headed back into the Wynn to gamble some more.</span></p>
<p>	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">Hit slots for a while, up $15 or so for that session.</span></p>
<p>	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">After slots we finally decided to play blackjack and were doing well with just me and Habeas Corpus at the $15 minimum table. I won 8 of the first ten hands, got four 21s, and was quite excited about the prospects until two posers in suits (no ties) sat down puffing away on cigarettes and the table promptly went to crap. Cashed out $50 up.</span></span></p>
<p>	<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">I played slots again for a while at the Venetian, brok even on slots and walked away. HC needed a Coke to bring with him to the room so we went back looking for the store we saw when we were at the Grand Lux eating.</span></span></div>
<div style="background-color: transparent; ">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="background-color: transparent; "><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">The store wanted $3 for the Coke (come on guys!) but we bought a couple and some snacks and headed back toward the room. </span><br />
	</span></div>
<div style="background-color: transparent; ">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="background-color: transparent; "><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">I spotted a likely slot, stuck $20 in machine and&#8230;nothing. Not a single hit. Llost $20.</span></p>
<p>	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">So I ended up down $250 the first night, but can&rsquo;t figure out where it all went. The numbers don&rsquo;t add up leading me to suspect that the strippers/hookers (who abounded in the area) have figured out a way to shortcut the dancing and just teleport the money directly from my pocket.</span></p>
<p>	<span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; ">Fun night anyway. Got to bed at 3:30 Vegas time, 5:30 our time.</span></span></div>
