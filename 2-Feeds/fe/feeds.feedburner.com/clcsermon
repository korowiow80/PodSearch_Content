			<title>Living on Purpose: Living with Regrets	</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>We all have regrets.  Past mistakes, failings, fallings, and sins can scar our souls in significant ways.  How do we move past these things and live with the chazowns that God has given us?  The key is Godly sorrow, otherwise known as repentance.  Rather than beating ourselves up over our past mistakes, we need to sorrowfully bring them to Christ so that he can forgive them and give us a fresh start.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/GdpRudA9bMs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>Living on Purpose: What Matters Most</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>During Memorial Day weekend, we remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice serving our country.  We also remember that every life will eventually end.  With this in mind, it is worth it to ponder whether or not we are living with eternity in mind.  For Paul, what matters most is “knowing Christ and the power of his resurrection.”  For this is the key to eternal life.  Does this matter the most to us too?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/ITxpyd9rggM" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<description>There are three other major spokes in our vocational wheel.  They include our health, our work, and our finances.  The goal in these areas is that we would be, as Paul writes of himself, “commended in every way” (verse 4) even when things get difficult, as they certainly were in Paul’s life.  We want to be found faithful.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/lCSIUoh1Qyg" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>Living on Purpose: Getting Spoked Up! (Part 1)</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastro Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>When people get excited about something, they will often speak of “getting stoked up,” like embers in a fire.  God wants us to get stoked up about the different vocations he has for us.  We can look at these vocations like spokes in a wheel – we need to faithfully live out several vocations at once to make our life roll forward.  For the next two weeks, we will talk about getting spoked up! That is, we will discover what spokes God has placed in the wheel of our vocations.  We begin with our two primary vocations – seeking God’s kingdom and sharing God’s kingdom.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/YZDhy99lHe8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>Living on Purpose: Putting it on Paper	</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>Crafting a personal purpose statement helps bring clarity to the ways in which God has gifted you to live for Him.  Writing it down allows you to revisit your purpose statement time and time again and discern whether or not you are being faithful to God’s purpose for your life.  When God comes to Habakkuk and asks him to write down a revelation, the Hebrew word for “revelation” in verse 3 is chazown.  The chazown that God wants Habakkuk to write down has to do with righteousness before God.  What chazown is God asking you to write down?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/_sWiowMBhjU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>Palm Sunday: Incredible Savings! </title>

			<description>As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, 2 saying to them, “Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me. 3 If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away.” 4 This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet: 5 “Say to the Daughter of Zion, ‘See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’” 6 The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them. 7 They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them. 8 A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. 9 The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/JSibEnw6pSQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<description>In the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent the secretary, Shaphan son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the temple of the LORD. He said: 4 “Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and have him get ready the money that has been brought into the temple of the LORD, which the doorkeepers have collected from the people. 5 Have them entrust it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple. And have these men pay the workers who repair the temple of the LORD— 6 the carpenters, the builders and the masons. Also have them purchase timber and dressed stone to repair the temple. 7 But they need not account for the money entrusted to them, because they are acting faithfully.” 8 Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the LORD.” He gave it to Shaphan, who read it. 9 Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him: “Your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the LORD and have entrusted it to the workers and supervisors at the temple.” 10 Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king. 11 When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his robes.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/g1WUckur1Zc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<description>King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh’s daughter—Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites. 2 They were from nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, “You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods.” Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love. 3 He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray. 4 As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been.  9 The LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice. 10 Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the LORD’s command. 11 So the LORD said to Solomon, “Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates. 12 Nevertheless, for the sake of David your father, I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son. 13 Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/Iy8v8KI-h80" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<description>The LORD said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king.” 2 But Samuel said, “How can I go? Saul will hear about it and kill me.” The LORD said, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.’ 3 Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate.” 4 Samuel did what the LORD said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked, “Do you come in peace?” 5 Samuel replied, “Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me.” Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. 6 When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, “Surely the LORD’s anointed stands here before the LORD.” 7 But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/Ynk6ooiyujs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with tambourines and lutes. 7 As they danced, they sang: “Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.” 8 Saul was very angry; this refrain galled him. “They have credited David with tens of thousands,” he thought, “but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?” 9 And from that time on Saul kept a jealous eye on David. 10 The next day an evil spirit from God came forcefully upon Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the harp, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand 11 and he hurled it, saying to himself, “I’ll pin David to the wall.” But David eluded him twice. 12 Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had left Saul.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/4vgJrofAPBQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<description>When conducting the Facebook survey that served as the basis of this series, one person commented, “I need a 25 hour day.”  This was the one thing she wanted more than anything else for 2012.  We have so many things to do and we never seem to have enough time to do them.  The apostle Paul realizes that “time is short” (verse 29).  And we will not get any more hours than what have been appointed for us.

			<itunes:summary>When conducting the Facebook survey that served as the basis of this series, one person commented, “I need a 25 hour day.”  This was the one thing she wanted more than anything else for 2012.  We have so many things to do and we never seem to have enough time to do them.  The apostle Paul realizes that “time is short” (verse 29).  And we will not get any more hours than what have been appointed for us.  What we need, then, is not more time, but to use the time God has given us to His glory.</itunes:summary>

			<title>Unresolved:  Healing</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>“It seems like everyone I know is getting cancer.”  A dear lady said this to me a year ago after her husband was diagnosed with cancer.  She prayed for healing.  It did not come.  Why is it that Jesus heals so many people in the Bible, but so many of our prayers for healing go unanswered?  How do we trust Christ even when our prayers for healing aren’t answered as we might like them to be?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/UaAuaY0NGXo" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

When He sees Jesus face to face, then, he sings, “Sovereign Lord, as You have promised, You now dismiss Your servant in peace” (Luke 2:29).  Simeon sees Jesus and now knows that he can die in peace.

			<title>All I Want For Christmas Is…An XBOX Kinect</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>The XBOX Kinect is a video game system you play by simply moving your body.  It interacts with your movements and your voice so that you can become fully immersed in the game.  No joysticks or buttons needed!  It takes you into a different reality.  On Christmas Day, we marvel at how Jesus willingly came into a different reality.  He left heaven to come to this earth. But His different reality was not an entertaining one, it was a humble and dark one.   As John says, “The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us” (verse 14).  The promise of the gospel is that Jesus joins us in our reality so that we can join Him in His.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/_S89HAkUbw4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<description>The Nerf N-Strike Stampede ECS is the first fully automatic Nerf dart gun, complete with one six dart clip and three extended clips which hold 18 darts each.  It has a lot of firepower and is every boy’s (and man’s) dream!  When Christ came to this earth, He came in the most meager of ways.  Born in a stable, He seemed to be nothing special – or powerful.  But Jesus, as God incarnate, had incredible firepower.  By His death and resurrection, He conquered sin, death, and the devil.  What sin, fear, or difficulty do we need conquered?

			<title>All I Want For Christmas Is…Legos</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>Lego Board Games are games you build yourself!  And as you build them, you also try to beat your opponents.  In Matthew 2, we are introduced to Herod the Great.  Herod was known as quite a builder.  He was the one who expanded the temple in Jerusalem to an untold splendor.  He was the one who built fortresses such as the Herodium and even built a whole new city – the Caesarea Maritima.  But Herod was also paranoid that someone would seek to take his power and prestige.  So when some Magi from the east come inquiring about “a King of the Jews,” Herod becomes immediately jealous, believing that someone is trying to steal his throne.  Sadly, during Christmas, our penchant for jealousy often comes out as we compare ourselves to those who more than us.  Are we satisfied with what we do – and do not – have?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/N-pu_rH4xew" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>All I Want For Christmas Is…A Pillow Pet</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>Pillow pets are exactly what their name implies – they are pets, but they are also pillows.  By simply unfolding it, your child can turn his stuffed animal into a pillow on which to sleep.  Around the holidays, a pillow pet sounds nice, doesn’t it?  After all, this season is so busy and tiring.  Who couldn’t use a nap?  In Isaiah 8, the prophet speaks of a dark, tiring, and stressful time.  He foretells a coming Assyrian invasion.  But then, in chapter 9, Isaiah breaks out in a chorus of hope:  “The people living in darkness have seen a great light” (verse 2).  He further promises a coming Messiah who, among other things, will be the “Prince of Peace” (verse 6).  Jesus, even when we are stressed and in need of rest, stills our souls with His peace.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/KsPxpEEQkZ8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>They won “The Toy of the Year” for 2011.  Sing-A-Ma-Jigs can talk, sing, and harmonize with each other!  If you collect the whole family, they will always sing in perfect harmony.  If only our families were as harmonious.  But the truth is, our families are often filled with stress and strife, especially around the holidays.  During the first Christmas, Joseph encountered a major family problem – his fiancé Mary turned up pregnant and he knew he was not the father!  Yet, because of Joseph’s trust in God, he stayed with Mary and saw their marriage through.  Do we trust in God to see us through difficult times and reconcile our broken relationships?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/PYlwf8NQFtc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<description>In a dispute, a plaintiff will sometimes try to sue a defendant for “pain and suffering.”  In these instances, the plaintiff is seeking to recoup some sort of reimbursement for the anguish the defendant has allegedly caused him.  Paul opens his letter with an honest admission of his situation:  he is in great pain and suffering.  He is “in chains for Christ” (verse 13).  Yet, rather than suing, Paul rejoices, for he know that what has happened to him “has really served to advance the gospel” (verse 12).

			<description>Though our national debt is big, it is not nearly as big as the debt of our sin, for the debt of our sin is incalculable.  When Jesus encounters a sinful woman who anoints His feet with perfume, He knows that she loves Him much because she has been forgiven by God for a debt of sin that baffles her.  On Reformation Day, we celebrate God’s extravagant love – a love so great that it would cover our sins.

			<title>More Blessed: Sturdier Than Prudential</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>Prudential built its reputation on providing their clients with steady financial returns on their investments.  That’s why their logo is a rock.  It indicates steadiness and sureness.  Stewardship, likewise, begins with a rock-solid promise: “I the LORD do not change” (verse 6).  This means if God has been generous to us in our past, we can count on Him to be generous to us in our future!  How have you seen God’s generosity in your past?  Do you steward your money generously as a sign of faith that you trust His generosity for your future?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/G8DG6VhBqUA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>The Me I Want To Be: Lust to Zeal</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>The enticement to lust is everywhere in our culture.  What we see on TV, the internet, in video games, and in many other places can tempt us to lust after someone who is not ours.  Paul’s pronouncement on lust is unequivocal:  We ought to flee it (verse 18)!  Why?  Because we are temples of God’s Spirit.  Thus, we live our lives with zeal for him rather than a lust for sin, as Paul says in Romans 12:11:  “Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/iRCNQGRn5t4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>When facing injustice, a person can respond in one of two ways:  anger or rejoicing.  The apostles could have responded with anger at the Sadducees because the Sadducees were unfairly persecuting them.  Instead, they were “rejoicing because they had been counted worthy suffering disgrace for the Name” (verse 41).  How do we respond to adversity?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/Y4XUEDZDjOA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<description>In Ephesians 4 and 5, Paul outlines four sins that cause us to FAIL:  Falsehood, Anger, Idleness, and Lust. What is the solution to overcoming such enticing sins?  Should we strive harder?  No!  Paul says we should “Put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness” (verse 24). We should put on Christ.  For when we do, we receive the PRIZE he has for us:  Rather than lies, we receive God’s Purity; rather than anger, we live with Rejoicing; rather than sitting around idle, we live with Intentionality; rather than lusting after others, we live with Zeal toward God, and, finally, Christ ushers us into Eternity. Over the next five weeks, we will unpack each of these items and discover how Christ’s power overcomes our sinfulness with his righteousness!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/khkqLDmzbgI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they display knowledge. There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard. Their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens he has pitched a tent for the sun, which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his pavilion, like a champion rejoicing to run his course. It rises at one end of the heavens and makes its circuit to the other; nothing is hidden from its heat.  The law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul. The statutes of the LORD are trustworthy, making wise the simple.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/Sk7aDwCvmvY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

A Tale of Two Adventures: Pointing to God's Crown</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>While Paul was in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols. Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: “Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious. For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you. The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands. In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/AbrWcfhvxqk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<itunes:author>Pastor Zach McIntosh</itunes:author>
			<description>James warns, “The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell” (James 3:6).  How we speak about others and God counts.  Our words can hurt more than many of us realize or understand.  How do you use your tongue?  To curse men or to praise God (cf.

			<itunes:author>Pastor Larry Krueger</itunes:author>
			<description>Wisdom does not begin with what a person knows, but with who a person knows.  To fear the Lord and to trust his Word is to have wisdom.  Notice that Solomon says that it is the “beginning of knowledge” (verse 7).  Hence, wisdom is a journey.  We have only begun to become wise.  There is always room for growth.

			<title>All in the Family: A Full Plate</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>The vast majority of Americans are overextended.  Our calendars are packed too full.  Our dollars are stretched too thin.  Our bodies are run too hard.  Most of us know the feeling of “a full plate.”  Martha certainly had a full plate.  And it was a plate full of good stuff!  After all, she was serving her Lord…or so she thought.  And yet, she was so busy doing what she thought was important that she missed what was truly important – spending time with Christ.  Do your obligations detract from your life with and in Christ?  If so, Jesus invites you to a slower, saner pace of life.  Jesus invites you to sit and learn from Him.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/rxG7s1fw9bs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>All in the Family: More Than Macho</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>The duty of a man in Ephesians 5 is clear:  He is to love and lead his wife and family like Christ loves and leads His Church.  Indeed, marriage is a reflection and picture of the Church.  Apart from Christ’s relationship with the Church, a man would not know how to love and lead his wife.  In this message, we will address such questions as:  “What does it mean for the husband to be the ‘head’ of the wife?”  “What does it mean for the wife to submit to her husband?”  “What are some common ways that men derelict their duties as husbands in our society?”  “What is the difference between being a godly man and a macho man?”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/hffdE7ujgio" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>All in the Family: Children Should Be Seen and Heard</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Josh Hower</itunes:author>
			<description>An old cliché, finding its origin in the fifteenth century in the sermons of a clergyman named John Mirk, says, “Children should be seen and not heard.”  Mirk originally applied this only to female children.

			<title>All in the Family: Help! I Need Somebody, Help!</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>Adam was not meant to be alone.  He needed a “helper” (verse 18).  The title “helper” is not meant to be derogatory toward Eve, relegating her to Adam’s slave, as this same moniker is used of God Himself:  “The LORD is with me; He is my helper” (Psalm 118:7).  This title is instead meant to describe the special gifting a wife has as her husband’s helpmate, helping him as God helps His people.  In this message, we discuss the woman’s role as a helpmate and talk about the temptation that women face to nag their husbands bitterly rather than to support them joyfully.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/rxG7s1fw9bs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<description>Esther was a strong woman.  As the favorite female of the king, she could have lived out her days in ease and luxury.  Instead, she chose to work fiercely and fearlessly to save her people, the Jews.  And God, though He is never explicitly named in this book, is there the whole time, giving Ester the strength she needs for the daunting tasks in front of her.

			<description>What a strange way to begin a series on how God views the family!  Jesus here talks about dividing the family and causing feuds, not uniting the family and fostering love.  And yet, here we find a fundamental truth concerning the family:  unless our families are rooted and founded in following Christ, they will ultimately fail.  Christ comes first.  He is the one who blesses and keeps our families.  Our families must rally around Him and be united by Him.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/TjKUF8lsdAk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>Palm Sunday: Hold Your Donkeys!</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Josh Hower</itunes:author>
			<description>Although the idiom "Hold your horses" is most commonly meant to encourage someone to slow down, it used to take on a more literal sense.  In the days of horse drawn carriages, people would use this expression if a horse became unruly.  It was an admonition to keep a horse in check.  When Jesus rides into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, he enters on a colt "which no one has ever ridden" (verse 2).  Unbroken colts were known to be difficult and unruly to ride because they were not used to carrying burdens.  Unbroken animals were also known to be set aside for holy purposes (e.g., Numbers 19:2).  Jesus, then, as the Holy One of Israel rides in on an animal set aside for God's holy purpose.  The donkey has been held just for Him.  Do you trust in Jesus as your Holy One?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/RRPolM_hvnw" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>Based on a True Story: God in the Gap</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>Scripture tells us that there is a chasm between us and God, created by sin.  God Himself bridges this gap by sending His Son, Jesus, to die in our place for our sin.  The punishment of hell is reserved for those who do not want God to stand in the gap between them and Him.  This is why Abraham reminds Lazarus, in hell, “A great chasm has been fixed” (verse 26).  The call in this life is to trust in Christ who bridges the gap between us and the Father so that gap does not become fixed eternally.  In this message, we will address the doctrine of hell, as well as some of the issues raised by Rob Bell’s new book, “Love Wins.”&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/NCrFUEawLPk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<description>Following the Fall, God renders a harsh judgment on Adam:  "Dust you are and to dust you shall return" (Genesis 3:19).  This is meant to remind Adam - and everyone - that we are made from dust and, upon our deaths, we will return to dust.  Yet, even though we are made from humble dust, the Psalmist exclaims that we are highly exalted!  He sings, "You have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned with glory and honor" (verse 5).  How is it that we, made from humble dust, can be celebrated as the crown of God's creation?  The preacher of Hebrews finally applies this Psalm to Jesus (cf. Hebrews 2:5-9).  It is Christ who exalts us and restores our value by His cross.  God, rather than dusting us away in death like we do with the dust on our furniture, blesses us, keeps us, saves us, and will raise us on the Last Day.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/oeh4VsMrMio" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>Fit for Life II: "Mind"</title>

			<description>In verse 30, Jesus quotes what is known as the Shema, a Hebrew word meaning, “hear.”  The Shema is taken from Deuteronomy 6:4-5, which was popularly considered to be God’s greatest commandment, as Jesus affirms in Mark 12.  Interestingly, when quoting the Shema, He says, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.”  Loving God with your mind, however, was not a part of the original Shema!  Jesus adds this!  He adds this because He knows that being mentally fit is important to a healthy life.  Thus, we are called to study the Scriptures, for by sharpening our minds, we also sharpen our faith.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/0l4J9c2Ap6Y" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>Fit for Life II: "Soul"</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description>Some people, when speaking of a person they love romantically, will refer to them as their “soul-mate.”  Though this term often carries with it connotations that are not concomitant with a biblical theology of romantic love, this term can be helpful in identifying the fact that romantic love is deeper than just physical affection.  For we, at the very level of our souls, were created to be relational beings!  Thus, appropriately ordering our relationships according to God’s design is paramount for healthy living.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/wUwdkYVYkdA" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<description>Some people, rather than stewarding their bodies for righteousness, become obsessed with their bodies in vanity.  It is to these people that Paul would say:  “Physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come” (verse 8).  Though physical training is good, eventually, no matter how much physical training we engage in, our bodies will waste away.

			<description>God has created your body and loves it and even promises to raise it on the Last Day.  Sadly, there is a battle for your body.  For whereas God loves your body as His creation, Satan hates it and wants to destroy it.  He uses things such as obesity, chemical dependency, and even terrible illness to wreak havoc in your body.  This is part of the reason Jesus speaks of demon possession so often.  Jesus wants to have control of your body by faith so that Satan cannot come in and destroy it.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/sYbPioWl9LI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<description>John 14:15-21

Shortly before He is crucified, Jesus promises His disciples “another Counselor.”  The word “another”  connotes that there is also a first Counselor, who is Jesus.  The Holy Spirit, then, is Counselor 2.0.  In the midst of the stress of the holidays, we need all the wise counsel we can get – to navigate stressful schedules and unhealthy family situations.  Do we rely on the great counsel of our God?&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/i-W8Sr_TNo0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

Whereas Christ came as a gentle baby in a manger upon his first advent, he will come as a conquering King at time’s end.

			<description>Doctrinal Topics: Scripture, Baptism, Lord’s Supper, Unity
Apologetic Concerns: Why Bother With Church?

The Lutheran Confessions teach: “The Church is the congregation of saints in which the Gospel is purely taught and the Sacraments are correctly administered. For the true unity of the Church it is enough to agree about the doctrine of the Gospel and the administration of the Sacraments” (AC VII 1-2). This is the Church: Word and Sacrament. And this is the source of the Church’s unity. On Reformation Day, we remember how Luther called the Church back to the core of its being.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/Ab6PQIdmtOs" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

This is why Jesus encourages us to take the right treasures – the very treasures of God. “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.

Apologetic Concerns: Christ’s Divinity, the Virgin Birth

Beginning with Adam and Eve’s “original sin,” it was always God’s intention to send a Savior. But God’s Savior is no hired hand. God’s Savior is God himself. The doctrine of the incarnation teaches that God comes into history in the person and work of Jesus.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/clcsermon/~4/Xniuzr-VDWY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<description><![CDATA[Stained by Anxiety		Mark 14:32-41

It’s called hematidrosis. Dr. Frederick Zugibe, the Chief Medical Examiner of Rockland County, New York, explains the disease: “Around the sweat glands, there are multiple blood vessels in a net-like form. Under the pressure of great stress the vessels constrict. Then as the anxiety passes the blood vessels dilate to the point of rupture. The blood goes into the sweat glands. As the sweat glands are producing a lot of sweat, it pushes the blood to the surface – coming out as droplets of blood mixed with sweat.”  This seems to be what Jesus experiences in the Garden of Gethsemane, so great was His anxiety.  Jesus understands our anxiety, and He also promises to care for us in the midst of our anxiety.  As He reminds us, “Do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well” (Matthew 6:30, 33).]]></description>

The tension in Mark’s gospel is intense as Jesus prepares to go the cross.  Before He gives His life, Jesus celebrates with His disciples one last supper.  But even this affair is marked by darkness.  For one of His own will betray Him unto death.  The Greek word for “betray” is paradidomi, meaning “to hand over.”  Interestingly, this is the same word used by Paul to describe the Lord’s Supper:  “For what I received from the Lord, I also passed on (paradidomi) to you” (1 Corinthians 11:23).

			<description><![CDATA[Stained by Inadequacy	Luke 5:4-11

Peter was a professional fisherman.  But even a professional has an off day from time to time.  He has been fishing all night and hasn’t caught a thing.  Jesus tells Peter to put his nets down on the other side of his boat.  When he does, and when he catches a miraculous number of fish, Peter responds with deep a sense of anxious inadequacy:  “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man” (verse 8)!  Do you every feel inadequate?  Addictions, guilt, and even other people can all make us feel inadequate.  Praise be to God that Christ makes us not only adequate, but abundant!]]></description>

Being ridiculed for your faith is as old as the faith itself.  Indeed, even on the Church’s very birthday – on Pentecost – the disciples are ridiculed as they speak in tongues.  “They have had too much wine,” their antagonists say (verse 13).  How do you respond in the face of ridicule?  Jesus promises, “Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you” (Matthew 5:11-12).]]></description>

At the root of all addiction is idolatry.  Satan tempts us to take a good gift of God such as food or drink or sex and turn it into a god-thing and that’s a bad thing.  As we review Israel’s idolatry in the wilderness, we see addictive behaviors such as drunkenness (cf. verse 6), situated in a context of rank idolatry.  Yet, even in such a sinful context, Moses holds out the hope of atonement, for there is rescue from addiction!]]></description>

			<title>Five Family Fiascos: Hope When...You're Stretched too Thin</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Hope When…You’re Stretched Too Thin 	Exodus 18:13-18, 21-23

Have you ever felt overwhelmed?  Moses knows how you feel!  He took on too much.  Blessedly, his father-in-law encouraged him to delegate his tasks.  One of the great spiritual dangers of our world is the danger of having too much to do and not enough time for what – and who – matters most.  Do you delegate what you need to delegate so that you have time for your family and for God?]]></description>

			<title>Five Family Fiascos: Hope When...You're Caught in Blame</title>
			<itunes:author>Pastor Bill Tucker</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Hope When…You’re Caught In Blame		Genesis 3:1-13

“My wife tricked me!”  At least, that’s Adam’s excuse when God questions Adam as to why he broke God’s command.  Adam blames his wife for his sin.  He tries to pass the buck.  How often do we try to blame others for our faults and pass the buck of our foibles to others?  The blame game destroys relationships and families.  Thankfully, we have someone who took the blame our sins deserved and died the death we should have died – Jesus Christ.  Rather than playing the blame game, Christ removes our blame of sin.]]></description>

			<title>Five Family Fiascos: Hope When It All Falls Apart</title>

			<description><![CDATA[Hope When…It All Falls Apart		Luke 24:1-6a

When the women go to the tomb on the first Easter, they must have felt as if their whole world had crumbled out from underneath them.  The Man they had worshipped, followed, and put their trust in was now dead…or so they thought.  But on Easter, when they arrive at the tomb, they find hope in what they don’t find.  They don’t find Jesus – because He has risen!  As we begin this series, we will discover how the risen Christ can offer hope to us – and to our families – just He offered hope to these women on that first Easter morning.]]></description>
