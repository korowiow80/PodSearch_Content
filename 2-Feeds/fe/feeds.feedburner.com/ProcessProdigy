<h2>FIRE FIGHTER TRAINING. . . WHEN BAD DRAMA HAPPENS TO GOOD PROCESS</h2>
<p>By Beth Schneider, Process Prodigy</p>
<p>One moment I'm rehearsing and preparing for a teleclass where I was the guest expert. The next minute, my computer screen goes black. The computer starts making a weird beeping noise and all I've got are blinking lights and characters that don't make any sense.</p>
<p>I frantically push buttons as I realize I'm supposed to "go on" in 10 minutes. Not only have I lost my script, but the call-in number to the teleclass and the contact number for the person running the class are locked in the depths of my now useless computer.</p>
<p>AAGGGGHHH.</p>
<p>Sometimes even the best laid plans can unexpectedly blow up in your face and birth a crisis.</p>
<p>People make mistakes, technology breaks down, "drama" happens. We've all been there when the panic sets in and all rationale hits the road. Trust me I know from personal experience.</p>
<p>The key to handling a crisis or what we sometimes refer to as a fire, is to become a Fire Fighter. Take a look at the steps I used to extinguish this fire. Then incorporate them into your routine so that you can be a Fire Fighter when bad "drama" happens to your good process.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: It's OK to feel</strong></p>
<p>When I realized that my blinking computer wasn't going to recover I yelled a long list of expletives at it, pounded on it one more time and then got to work. Don't ignore your emotions. Be mad, sad, frustrated, scared, etc. The key here is to feel these emotions, not dump them on all the people around you. When the problem hits, close your office door and rant all you want, go outside, make a phone call to a sympathetic uninvolved ear, something to let out the feelings so that they can pass and you can focus.</p>
<p>Screaming at the people around you or the person who made the mistake is NOT going to help.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Focus on a Solution</strong></p>
<p>I needed a solution, fast! My heart was pounding. I was sweating. I had 8 minutes to recreate my script and somehow get the phone numbers I needed to actually dial in to the teleclass. I took a deep breath, calmed down and started brainstorming. I had a choice. I could focus and create a solution or jump up and down and have a temper tantrum. Former New York Mayor, Rudy Giuliani once said that his father told him the key to problem solving was to be the calmest person in the room. Yes, this is sometimes difficult, but by being calm, you can start to focus on a solution to the problem rather than the problem itself. And isn't the goal to get a solution in place?</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Form a Plan and Get Going</strong></p>
<p>With 6 minutes to go, I had a plan. As I phoned my Dad, I prayed he was home sitting in front of his computer. He was! First, I had him pull the phone number of the person facilitating the teleclass from their website. Then I had him register for the class so he would get the auto responder sign-in info. Phone numbers, yeah! While he was surfing, I opened my files and pulled a script from one of my live speaking events. Not quite the same program, but something to improvise from. My blood pressure was starting to return to normal.</p>
<p>Once you are able to focus, put a general plan of action into place so you know where you are going and not simply running in circles. Even though it may seem like there is "no time", stop and think. Determine what immediate actions you have to take to keep your head above water.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Get Help</strong></p>
<p>I started thinking about who would have immediate access to a computer. My Dad was the first person I thought of. If he hadn't been there, I would have gone to my Brother. Then to anyone else I could think of who I knew had a good chance of being in front of a computer.</p>
<p>Get the right people working with you. Figure out an expert who might be able to help or offer advice. Find a colleague who may have already been there, done that. Pull people off other projects if you need extra hands. See if there is something you can buy that will help.</p>
<p>If your house was burning down, would you want a fire fighter or a plumber? Do what it takes to get the resources you need.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Recap</strong></p>
<p>I called in to the teleclass in just the nick of time. It was a huge success and no one was the wiser. Wwwwhhhheeeewwwww.</p>
<p>Now I have a paper file of teleclass scripts, just in case. I also have a running log of teleclass call-in numbers, just in case. I have a system in place to ensure this never happens again. When the dust clears, revisit what just happened. Where did the breakdown occur? How could it be prevented in the future? If it might happen again, what should the plan be?</p>
<p>Fires happen all the time. It's how you prepare and deal with those fires that make or break the amount of damage that is done. You can be your own best Fire Fighter.</p>

<h2>5 Ways To Drive Revenue To Your Business</h2>
<p>By Beth Schneider, Process Prodigy</p>
<p>Take a deep breath. Do you smell that? That's the unmistakable smell of summertime! And you know what that means, it's vacation time. Time to put your feet up, relax and enjoy the sun with friends and family. Whether you decide to head north, south, east or west, now is a great time to focus on driving revenue into the business. Way back, when I was in college, one of my professors told us that, "what we do today will determine the kind of vacations we take tomorrow." Almost 25 years later those words still stick in my head so I thought you'd like my system for driving revenue into your business - any time of year.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Create a Marketing Schedule</strong> - Our most successful consulting clients don't just say they are going to do specific things like send out an ezine, host a teleclass or launch a product. They create a schedule. Grab a calendar and plot out when you'll write your ezine, when you'll send it out and what content should be included. Having a schedule will keep you and your team accountable which means it will actually get done, which means people will have the opportunity to buy from you. Who knew a calendar would be that profitable!?</p>
<p>2. <strong>Be Prepared for Inquiries</strong> - I was browsing my twitter stream the other day and there was a conversation going on about how someone cancelled 100 magazine subscriptions because the company couldn't get their act together. Don't let this happen to you. Make sure you lay out the steps and know how to handle client inquiries. When people are handled quickly and efficiently, they are more likely to buy from you.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Have a Follow-Up System</strong> - Not too long ago I had a conversation with someone whose services I was interested in. I said the magic words, "Let me give you my credit card." We agreed on a date I would give up the cash and she would start the service. That was over a year ago and I'm still waiting for that follow-up phone call. How many times have you spent a bunch of cash and taken the time to go to an event? Then you come home with a boat load of business cards and new connections and then don't do anything with them. Before you ever leave the house, decide how you are going to connect with people after the event.</p>
<p>4. <strong>New Client Set Up</strong> - Ever been in a situation where the sales person follows you around? Everything is, "yes, we can do that", "let me help you with that", "what questions do you have?" Well, it's all those things until you give up your money. Then it's like you pulled out your Harry Potter invisibility cloak and totally disappear. Don't do that to you own clients. It's really easy to get caught up in the excitement of a new client. After you are done doing your happy dance, take those new clients through a specific set of steps to make them feel like the VIPs they are. Things like sending them a welcome kit, telling them how their meetings will work, explaining your contracts, sending a welcome gift, etc. This step is so important that I've included a new client set-up system as part of the core systems for my 3 Essential Systems program <a href="http://www.processprodigy.com/3essentialsystems">http://www.processprodigy.com/3essentialsystems</a>  . It's the key to getting clients to trust you and refer additional business to you.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Ask For Referrals</strong> - The easiest way to get new clients is to ask your happy clients for referrals. Most do this randomly. Instead of being haphazard about it, plan a specific time when you will ask for referrals. If you are a coach who sells coaching packages, maybe after the 4th call, you always ask for referrals. If you sell products, add in a message in an autoresponder series that asks people to become an affiliate. The key is to pick a specific time to ask for referrals and then ask.</p>
<p>Being strategic doesn't have to be hard. Spend a few minutes preparing what you want to do so that you can easily execute. Then when you find you have extra time and money on your hands go head to the beach.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My husband and I are in Memphis this week for an Operations Conference - what a great city!</p>
<p>In the mean time I keep getting reports from my team about projects they were completing, people they are meeting with, and new ideas they are implementing...all while I was touring Memphis and eating at multiple BBQ restaurants. The trick to getting this all to happen at the same time is to power up your team with strong systems so they can do things without you. </p>
<p>This week's article explains how to create systems for yourself and those who you work with. Yup, it's a system for creating a system. </p>

<h2>Go With The Flow</h2>
<p></strong></div>
</td>
<p><strong>By Sandye Linnetz, Systems Expert, Process Prodigy </strong></p>
<p>Today's "key to success" is to choose and use the best tool for the job. Toothbrushes are fabulous for brushing teeth... and fairly effective when cleaning the grout between ceramic top tiles, but not necessarily the proper tool of choice for washing a car. And so it is with systems design. Yes, you could use a "seat of the pants system" or an "it's all up here (point to forehead) and I won't forget" system, but my guess is that you've already tried both and neither was very good. You could make random notes on napkins, that giant desk blotter/calendar thingie or the backs of business cards; you might even get a bit more organized and write them out and keep them in a binder. How you organize those plans and where you keep them really will matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have determined what system you are going to create (e.g. handling email) and have even a rough idea of what that system will entail, it's time to get specific and write it down.</p>
<p>To see a sample system drawn out, grab a copy of our complimentary systems at <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?e=001b_RDBzNHfuPhzkHH5uXD6-Skh8wQFuUe5LsZoLLZp4t9kmqk4VQrfHZbPBwIjBIPldV7HMVcfDb-Qj1wMGLU1UimnGcMDp3xbyZZyfVRtMU=" shape="rect" target="_blank">http://www.processprodigy.com</a> . Yes, you could write up your system in outline form or long hand and create "systems files" or use sets of file cards which are "systematically" organized in steps... not bad ideas... but there is better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Focus on one system at a time. That's vital. It's also vital to decide AT THE BEGINNING of creating a system, what you want the system to do for you. What is the end result you want to create? "Gee, Sandye, I want a system that will end the constant interruptions of email and allow me to handle them quickly and efficiently." "Okay," I say to you, "let's write down the necessary steps and actions that you would need to take to have that happen". This is where you grab the pads of sticky notes and write one step on each page. This is how you begin to create your step-by-step process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The favorite tool of Process Prodigy (right after the iconic sticky note) is the workhorse of system design, the flowchart. A flowchart is a blueprint or a map, a word diagram that visually represents a process - your tool for managing that process - by showing the integral steps of the process in order and how they are related to other steps. Information, data (i.e., the steps) are written out, in various shaped boxes and brackets, and connected with lines and arrows that represent the "flow" of the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Definition: flow chart (also flowchart or flow diagram) noun</p>
<p>· a diagram of the sequence of movements or actions of people or things involved in a complex system or activity</p>
<p>· a graphical representation of a program in relation to its sequence of functions (as distinct from the data it processes)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you need to transfer those sticky note steps onto a flowchart, with each of the steps and decisions to be made going into shapes to create your visual word picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use these shapes and lines:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Process Box - rectangular; identifies a single step in the process</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decision Triangle - triangular; identifies when a decision must be made (typically a yes or no question)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Predefined Process - rectangular box with an extra set of vertical lines; identifies a named process such as a subroutine or a module</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arrow - line with arrow tip; connects the shapes and indicates the direction of the flow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flag - line and bracket; provides additional explanations, notes and/or questions that are relevant to the item it is "flagging"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now go with the flow... </p>

<p>It is Spring Cleaning Time! Now is a great time to look at what you can remove from your plate, either by eliminating it all together or delegating it to someone on your team. This week's article comes from our Systems Coach, Sandye Linnetz who shares some ways to eliminate and delegate.</p>
<p>Enjoy!<br />

<p>Next week I'm headed to Memphis for an Operations Conference. My hubby has already picked out 22 BBQ places to try. I don't think we'll make it to all 22! </p>
<p><strong><br />
<h2>Eliminate and Delegate</h2>
<p></strong><br />
<strong><strong>By Sandye Linnetz, Systems Expert, Process Prodigy   </strong></strong> </p>
<p>Too much to do and not enough hours to do it?</p>
<p>Perhaps it's time to eliminate and delegate. The most effective systems we can put into place involve the elimination of unnecessary or duplicated tasks and the delegation to others of those tasks that don't really merit our personal time and attention. So often we take the attitude that "WE" have to do it ourselves; that we have to be in every information loop. Well, time to rethink.</p>
<p>The all too frequent concern; that it is too expensive to delegate, is about to be wiped off the map of success. First of all, what is your goal? Is it just about making money? Or, is the money your means to an end - having the resources to live the life of your dreams?</p>
<p>Assuming that the goal for most - if not all of us - is to live the "good life", consider what your time and peace of mind is worth to you. How much would you pay to be stress free and actually enjoy what you are doing? Deferred-life, i.e. retirement and the good life we long for, should not be something we put off for the future - BE THERE NOW!</p>
<p>In his book, "The 4-Hour Work Week", Timothy Ferris writes about giving up the old rules of what he describes as SLAVE to SAVE to RETIRE. He says that you can have it all RIGHT NOW by shifting your thinking to the way the "new rich" (the NR, as he refers to them) think, and by doing what they do. It's all about elimination, delegation and outsourcing your business and your life. He actually gives us a "blue- print" with step-by-step details and sources. Amazing, truly amazing, and so possible.</p>
<p>Ferris recommends the "low-information" diet (to eliminate unnecessary extra "noise" and distraction) and suggests that we cultivate selective ignorance rather than selective listening. He also favors mega outsourcing - for your business and your personal life. He really got my attention with this idea. Ferris concludes that if you figure out the value of your time and factor in the freedom you gain, it is almost always better to outsource. And, he shows you how - even includes specific referrals!</p>
<p>Get the book<br />
Create the system<br />
Eliminate Delegate and RETIRE now.</p>

<h2>Your First Two Steps Toward Divine Delegation</h2>
<p><strong>By Sandye Linnetz, Systems Expert, Process Prodigy</strong></p>
<p>First, let's agree that you have more than enough on your plate and you are going to delegate some tasks to others. Now you have three very important questions to address:</p>
<p>What will you delegate and what stays on YOUR plate?</p>
<p>How should the delegated task/job be handled - and by whom?</p>
<p>What is the desired outcome?</p>
<p>Step 1: Decide what you must do and what you will delegate. What are your strengths? What do you enjoy doing - and do well? What are you currently and directly contributing to your business that has or is making it successful? Keep those jobs and tasks. Now decide which tasks are beyond your area of expertise, are overly stressful or unpleasant for you, constitute busy work that might be easily handed over to another, or are currently just not being handled or handled well? What do you already have on your "need help" list? Start there. Those should be the first things you give away.</p>
<p>Make a list of everything you do on a daily, weekly, monthly or annual basis. This is the basis for your job description. Look over your list and decide which tasks are essential for you to keep and which can be given away. Create a potential delegation list.</p>
<p>Step 2: Create a plan. Okay, it would be fabulous if you could just make a wish and be able to do anything and everything without either a learning curve or confusion. Unfortunately life seldom works out that way. So... plan your work and work your plan. Determine exactly what needs to be accomplished and how you want it to be done. Design a visual blueprint of your process that includes every detail from file names to faxing instructions. Put it all in writing! Document the details and create a flow chart that defines the step-by-step process that will take whomever follows it from where you are to where you want to be. (Remember: It's much easier to get "there" if you know where "there" is and have a detailed road map.)</p>
<p>Your plans, your written process, is the most valuable tool any employee could ask for; it virtually assures their success at work. By handing someone the flowcharts, files, forms and checklists you have designed around a particular task or job, you eliminate headaches, stress, the learning curve, most questions AND, if that employee decides to move on, any replacement could just step in and take over. In order for any delegation effort to be effective you must be able to share with somebody exactly what it is that you want them to do. Maybe no one does it as well as you because up until now no one has truly understood what it is that you want done!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey Beth,  <br />
 <br />
I'm frequently asked, "When is the best time to start putting systems in place?"<br />
 <br />
The answer is simple...right NOW. The sooner you start, the sooner you'll be working more efficiently and more profitably. And it doesn't matter if you have a team of 100 or a team of me, myself and I, the answer is still, right NOW.<br />
 <br />
So to get you started right now, I'm inviting you to my complimentary webinar "The 3 Simple Steps to Double (or Triple) Your Profits, Cut Your Work Hours In Half &amp; Enjoy a Business That Runs Itself".<br />
 <br />
Go get your spot: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cjm6l37">http://tinyurl.com/cjm6l37</a><br />
 <br />
Right now you can make small business tweaks that will allow you to work fewer hours while making more money. Really!<br />
 <br />
I know that might sound too good to be true, but these 3 steps will get you thinking differently. You'll see things from a completely different perspective so you can see where the dots don't connect.<br />
 <br />
And when you can see the missing dots and fill them in, that's when the magic happens.<br />
 <br />
The stress goes away. Your clients are happier. Heck...you're happier.<br />
 <br />
Basically, I'm going to show you how to take your existing business, your existing team, the marketing you are already doing... and squeeze 2-3 times the results from them.<br />
 <br />
It's like leverage on steroids.<br />
 <br />
You see what most people don't realize is that just like you need both a mother and a father to make a baby, you need BOTH savvy marketing and great business systems to "make" a successful business; one that brings in the money, lifestyle and freedom you want.<br />
 <br />
If you are frustrated because you are overwhelmed with ideas, feel like you are running in circles or just keep scratching your head because no matter what you do the money is just not there, then these are signs that you are missing some systems and this is definitely for you.   <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cjm6l37">http://tinyurl.com/cjm6l37</a><br />
 <br />
You'll spend about an hour learning some simple &amp; useful strategies to<br />
help you systemize your business to get you working less and making more money.<br />
 <br />
Things like...<br />
   &gt; The one thing you don't even know you're doing that is killing your marketing efforts and wasting all that time, money and energy.<br />
   &gt; How switching your thinking from "WHAT" to "HOW" can prevent things from falling through the cracks so you can watch your bank account fill up.<br />
   &gt; How you can set your team up to automatically "get it" so they accomplish more than you ever thought possible and say things like, "don't worry, it's handled" - and have the surety that it IS!<br />
   &gt; A proven 3-step formula that will show you how to get everything out of your head so you can get the business running without you.<br />
   &gt; You'll be seriously energized after this call!  <br />
 <br />
It's all happening:<br />
Date:                               April 12, 2012<br />
Start Time:                   4pm Pacific/ 7pm Eastern<br />
Grab Your Spot:         <a href="http://tinyurl.com/cjm6l37">http://tinyurl.com/cjm6l37</a><br />
 <br />
Are you ready to build a business where you can just show up and be the star? Then get ready to discover the tricks to building a business that works for you... rather than you working for it.<br />
 <br />
See you there!<br />
 <br />
Take care,<br />
Beth<br />
 <br />

<p>Enjoy!<br />

<h2>3 Business Lessons I Learned From Playing Angry Birds</h2>
<p><strong>By Beth Schneider, President &amp; CEO, Process Prodigy </strong></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1107" style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="angrybird" src="http://www.processprodigy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/angrybird.jpg" alt="angry bird" width="225" height="225" />I really hate to admit this, but I am seriously addicted. Don't tell anyone, but I can't get enough of the game Angry Birds. It started innocently as an app that I downloaded onto my Andriod phone and quickly became the game that I just couldn't put down. If you aren't familiar with the game, let me catch you up.</p>
<p>Basically you use a virtual sling shot to shoot a variety of birds at different objects with the intention of hitting the pigs that stole their eggs. It's very intellectual. So leave it me to find business lessons in a simple game.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 1: All the birds have different strengths </strong></p>
<p>In the game there are 5 different kinds of birds. Some fly fast, some explode, some crush glass, others wood. Each one has their own strength and you want to take that into account before you start shooting. It's easy to just wing wildly and let the bird go where it pleases. it's the same thing your business. I often see people picking team members and randomly assigning them things that aren't their strengths. Just like you want to be strategic about how you shoot each bird, you want to be strategic about your team. Clearly define the role and then search out people who have strengths around the needs of your role. When you do this, more often than not you'll hit the shot.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 2: Keep doing the same thing, you get the same results </strong></p>
<p>In the game, it's easy to keep shooting the same birds, the same way, in the same place...and not see results. Most of the time I have found that varying where I am shooting the bird or changing the angle has led to success. The way I had been doing it didn't work so I tried something new. This is really a systems lesson. If you are doing something the same way and the results are not what you want, then you have to change something in order to be successful.</p>
<p>You've proved it doesn't work, so instead of continuing along that path that doesn't work, try something new.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 3: Help is available</strong></p>
<p>After you fail a level, the game conveniently points you to online help. There are tons of examples of how to win the level. No, it's not cheating, it's helping. Someone else has already done the hard work. They've figured out the steps, the system, the ideal way to go. In business why would you want to work so much harder when there is someone already out there who has already found "the way"?</p>
<p>Don't be afraid to seek out help, whether it's online in forums, colleagues or paying for the right mentor.</p>
<p>And my mother always told me that video games would do nothing but rot my brain. I'm glad she was wrong.</p>

<p>We have a lot of birthdays and parties coming up in our family. This week's fun article from Sandye teaches you a System for Celebrating!  </p>
<p>Enjoy,<br />
Beth</p>
<p><strong><br />
<h2>Knowing Your Limits </h2>
<p>By Sandye Linnetz, Process Prodigy</strong>   </p>
<p>I have an Outrageously Effective System for celebrating and preparing for parties for the coming year. I've successfully used it for years, so I know it works. There have been times over the past fifteen or twenty years when I have had to make minor revisions, but we'll cover some of those much needed revisions towards the end of this blog. </p>
<p>On to my "Celebration" System-- Let's start with an upcoming birthday party 'cuz that's the fun part. I begin with the idea that I AM THE PARTY - so I am absolutely sure that wherever I go and whatever I do will be a blast! That takes a lot of pressure off planning. It doesn't really matter where I end up, I always know that I'm going to have FUN. I also know my limits. Big, huge parties with massive numbers of strangers don't generally work for me, so I tend to go to smaller "home" celebrations. I am a little person. That means not too much alcohol is needed or suggested for optimum results. I don't drive well when I'm exhausted, so I know that I must stay close to home or have a safe way to get home. My ride is arranged in advance. I LOVE champagne - good champagne - so I bring a bottle or two with me. This eliminates the disappointment factor if my hosts like to skimp on the bubbly! Okay, perfect evening planned. </p>
<p>And the plan for the next year? Rather than reflect back on the past year and look to the next with a list of MUSTS and SHOULDS and HAVE TOS, I prefer to create a plan, instead. I actually write it out and post it in my office (with a minimized copy next to my bed) and refer to it throughout the year. My SYSTEM involves a list of questions which, when answered, will naturally lead me to the results I am looking to achieve throughout the new birthday year. I am then able to create individual systems for each of the areas in my plan. </p>
<p>Here are some of the questions I suggest that you ask yourself in preparation for creating your plan. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR OVERALL GOALS FOR THE YEAR? WHAT INSPIRES YOU TO ACTION? </strong><br />
(Getting clarity is the first BIG step to achieving desired results, and writing them down is a powerful step towards turning desires into reality.) </p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE YOUR TOP THREE GOALS? GET FOCUSED! </strong><br />
(Specificity really helps.) </p>
<p><strong>WHAT OBSTACLES OR CHALLENGES SHOULD YOU BE PREPARED TO HANDLE?</strong><br />
(Think Boy Scouts here-- Expect the best but be prepared for the worst.) </p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS CURRENTLY STOPPING YOU - OR HAS STOPPED YOU IN THE PAST - FROM HAVING IT ALL?</strong><br />
(Consider strengthening your body and quieting your mind.) </p>
<p>Remember, it's not about resources-- we all have plenty of those. It's about BEING RESOURCEFUL and taking control of your future.  </p>
<p>And what about the party I wrote about earlier? Well, folks, got to admit that your Systems Goddess has had to create a system for knowing when enough is enough! Used to be that I could party all through the night. Now? Not so much. Truth be told, I'm ready for sleep by 11:00 most nights. I can count on one hand the number of times I've actually stayed at a party past midnight in the last ten years. The system? Simple. I silently ask myself the following questions (just like designing any other system): </p>
<p>1. How am I feeling NOW? </p>
<p>2. How do I want to feel tomorrow? </p>
<p>3. What steps will I need to take to have that happen? </p>
<p>If the answer to #1 is "GREAT"-- I stay and play until the answer begins to change. </p>
<p>If the answer is "tired and losing control". I call a cab or get a ride home. </p>
<p>If I can't even remember the question-- </p>
<p>Answering question #1 pretty much takes care of two and three. My answer to #2 has always been "awake, alive, refreshed and full of JOY". That pretty much creates the answer to #3; requires sleep and a clear head (possibly LOTS of water and a couple of Excedrin). </p>
<p>A system is a process for creating desired, predictable, duplicatable results. Remember to ask yourself the BIG THREE QUESTIONS: </p>
<p>Where are you NOW? </p>
<p>Where do you want to BE? </p>
<p>How can you get there? </p>
<p>And you can't help but create a system that is Outrageously Effective! Don't wait until your birthday to make this happen - do it now! Happy Birthday! Happy Everything! </p>

<p>Spring has sprung - but sometimes it is hard to "spring" into getting work done. This week's article gives you 6 ways to get in the mood and get motivated! </p>
<p>Enjoy,<br />
Beth</p>
<p><strong><br />
<h2>6 Ways To Get In The Mood And Get Motivated </h2>
<p> </strong><br />
<strong>By Beth Schneider</strong></p>
<p>It is this time of year that makes me want to crawl in bed and read a book or watch movies. The holidays are over, it is cool and cloudy outside, and I feel lazy. It is this time of the year that I have the tendency to go into hibernation, with my biggest dilemma being which book to download and read. </p>
<p>Fast forward to reality! The days are actually starting to get longer and somehow even though there is MORE day light, you seem to get less done. And it's all because you can't seem to get in the mood. The key is doing the things that get you in the mood. So here are six things to get you going.</p>
<p><strong>#1 Plan and take a brisk walk</strong><br />
There's just something about a little exercise that gets the blood pumping. So if you feel like you need a nap, grab those sneakers and head for the door.</p>
<p><strong>#2 Pick up some upbeat music</strong><br />
Put together a CD of songs that motivate you. For example, at a speakers training I took a few years back, I had to get up on stage and sing. I chose Tom Jones', It's Not Unusual. Now every time I play that song I get a boost of energy. Pick a series of songs that remind you of something fun, a win you had, or just get you going and then play them.</p>
<p><strong>#3 Start with something you don't want to do</strong><br />
I know this sounds crazy, but my mentor, Melissa Orr (CEO of a $25 million dollar corp.) starts with the things she knows she doesn't like to do. Why? She feels energized and accomplished by getting the tedious things out of the way first. By letting it drag on throughout the day, the thought of the one task saps her energy and the longer she waits, the more energy she looses. So instead she gets those things out of the way first and then feels motivated because it's done.</p>
<p><strong>#4 See it as a challenge</strong><br />
Multi-Million dollar business owner Burt Linnetz says you just have to know that not every day is going to be fun, but a true entrepreneur pushes through. See your tasks as a challenge and think about that feeling of accomplishment you will get when you've finished. Kind of like the accomplishment of getting to the top of a mountain. There is nothing better than standing at the top, admiring the view. Focus on that feeling - that will get you going.</p>
<p><strong>#5 Call a client</strong><br />
Set up an appointment with a client. A great way to force yourself to get motivated is to involve someone else. You'll have no choice but to get yourself motivated before the call and then after you can just coast on the motivation from the call. It's like a two-for-one.</p>
<p><strong>#6 Tidy up a bit</strong><br />
A clean office is a happy office. Spend a few minutes picking things up so that you feel really good working in your space. It will make you want to be there.</p>
<p>The best part is, once all your work is done for the day, you can just hang out!</p>

<h2><strong>Double The Profits - The Essential Pieces</h2>
<p></strong> </p>
<p>By Beth Schneider</p>
<p>These days I find myself doing a lot of writing. I have a whole routine; grab a cup of coffee and close down all programs except for a word document. Since I like to scribble notes, I keep a pad and pen handy. I also like to be comfortable, so yes, I have special writing pants. Even with my routine in place, I often find myself sitting and staring at a blank screen. Tapping my finger on the pad, scratching my head and getting frustrated, which makes it hard to think, which makes it harder to write. UGGGHH!</p>
<p>People are always asking me how to get started with putting systems in place. It dawned on me that these same people might have their own routine. They get motivated, put on their special systems pants and then stare at a blank screen. Focusing on HOW you do something in your business is the key to squeezing 2-3 times the results from your existing team and marketing efforts, so let's make this easy to get started. No more starting at a blank screen. Oh and special system pants are not required.</p>
<p>There are three essential systems that every business, no matter what the size, must have. At Process Prodigy, we call these the core systems. They are:</p>
<p>1. A system for Overcoming Sales Objections</p>
<p>2. A system for Setting Up New Clients</p>
<p>3. A Project Management System</p>
<p>Overcoming Sales Objections</p>
<p>My friend, Sharla Jacobs of www.rejuvenateyourpractice.com calls this "dancing with concerns", which, I think, is a great way to describe this task. Take a close look at the excuses . . .er . . . I mean reasons that people give you to explain why they are not ready to buy. Then, one-by-one, create a list of things to say and do to turn those "reasons to walk away" into "reasons to buy". The biggest complaint out there is, "I don't have enough clients." Consider this an essential piece of your business because it is what brings in the clients and signs them up.</p>
<p>Setting Up New Clients</p>
<p>I bet you've been in this situation. You go into a store and the clerk follows you around, attending to your every need... well, until you hand over the cash. Once you've given up your money, you become suddenly invisible. What do you do to your clients once they've said yes? Every marketing guru in the world will tell you it's easier to sell more to an existing client than to go out and get a new client. So what are you doing from the start to make sure that your clients feel like royalty and want to stay around you?   Lay out all of the new client steps ahead of time so that each and every one of those new additions feels completely taken care of and important. When your clients feel good, they buy more from you and then they tell their friends to buy from you. Result? You feel good, too.</p>
<p>Project Management</p>
<p>The dream is to be able to kick back and enjoy your life while your business runs without you. That's a scenario we'd all like to dive into, isn't it? Unfortunately, the more common scenarios I see include stressed out, overwhelmed and very "stuck" business owners. Why is like this? Well, primarily because so many business owners have "fallen out of the driver seat" and their businesses are driving them rather than vice versa. If this sounds like your situation, take a breath... You can get back into the driver's seat by laying out the pieces of your business as if it were a recurring project. For example, my client Michele takes each and every client through a series of steps and tasks. By documenting those tasks she made it easy for her team to understand exactly what she needs them to do and how to do it.</p>
<p>For your own situation, pick something that happens over and over, maybe coaching clients, launching products, doing teleclasses, etc. Lay out each and every step so that you can repeat those same steps instead of constantly reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>Next time you sit down to figure out how to free up your time and make things easier, think about the core systems.</p>
