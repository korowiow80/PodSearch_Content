Mail Bag - pretty slow couple of weeks:
"I was hoping to ask you a couple of questions in regards to work in the industry. It's been tough to know exactly where I should be looking, or even what entry-level jobs are necessary to eventually make my way up the ladder. I know that to work in a studio you need to start pretty much as a runner, but what about for other audio positions? I'm a strong student and have several areas of interest that I know I would succeed in if I could only get my foot in the door. I feel the Career Advisor for our program doesn't have the most valuable info as she's in Education, not Audio/Music, so I would love to hear what you have to say about getting started in the industry... just whenever you get a sec :-)"

with Derek K. Miller and Dave Chick

Finally, after two months, we're back. Derek reviews the Zune media player and iPod competitor, Dave talks about scoring for movies and TV, we discuss the merits of ABBA, and Paul goes on an indefinite hiatus from the show. Really!

If you can play Enhanced podcasts (AAC enhanced) on your iPod, PlayStation Portable, Apple TV, Xbox 360, TiVo, or Zune, or in iTunes or QuickTime, you'll find lots of photos and links accompanying this episode.


	00:00 Intros, thanks to GoToMeeting, Source Elements, macProVideo, Blubrry, Home Recording Network, zZounds, Amazon, and NCIX.
	02:03 BIG ANNOUNCEMENT: Paul, who founded this podcast, is so busy with his new company Mac Video Training that he has to take an indefinite hiatus from Inside Home Recording. So it's just Derek and Dave (with help from Boris and others) now. Whoa!
	05:35 NEWS: Dave was on the Home Made Hit Show; we're still waiting for the Project Studio Network; touring Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios with Sonic State (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3), plus early stereo recording; Eddie Kramer's Logic/Waves tour; Koblo's new open-source DAW, plugin marketplace, and more; look out for algae in your earphones (yuck).
	09:16 SPONSOR: GoToMeeting.com
	10:38 GEAR REVIEW: Derek reviews the Zune 8 media player (now available in Canada), sent to him free by Microsoft and Matchstick.
	20:41 IHR 101: Dave talks about scoring for movies and TV shows, part 1 of 2. Also look for his subsequent glossary post on our blog at InsideHomeRecording.com defining some of the terms he uses.
	29:56 EDITORIAL: Listen to music you liked when you were a kid. In Derek's case, it's the genius of ABBA. Also, when recording and mixing, avoid that "shopping mall sound."
	36:15 How to get in touch with us, and congratulations to Todd Cochrane of Geek News Central for his 400th podcast episode, and beyond.
	38:20 END.

with Paul Garay, Derek K. Miller, and Dave Chick
and featuring Boris Aeven

Paul works with Rod Stewart (sort of), Boris rants about stage pianos and monitor speakers, we discuss NAMM news and laptops vs. desktops, and Dave Chick comes to Derek's home studio to record IHR.

If you can play Enhanced podcasts (AAC enhanced) on your iPod, PlayStation Portable, Apple TV, Xbox 360, TiVo, or Zune, or in iTunes or QuickTime, you'll find lots of photos and links accompanying this episode.


	00:00 Intros with Paul Garay, Derek K. Miller, and Dave Chick - Disneyland, Derek's birthday, Boris has Internet!
	05:44 George Michael the home recordist.
	08:07 Summer NAMM Show news - Korg's nanoSERIES controllers, IK's Total Workstation Rack runs as a standalone sampler unit or as an external hardware plugin module.
	12:00 Pro Tools 7.4 finally supports Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, and there's also a Mac OS X update which improves support for Logic Pro.
	15:30 Don't forget the Home Made Hit Show summer song challenge, deadline August 10.
	16:10 SPONSORS: Thanks to Source Elements, GoToMeeting, macProVideo.com, Blubrry, Home Recording Network.
	16:30 AFFILIATES: zZounds, Amazon, NCIX (Paul found super-cheap deals on hard disks and Etymotic headphones).
	18:35 IHR TV #4 features Derek on "The Lab With Leo" (now cancelled, alas) talking about MIDI drums, and he also did some live gigs with his cover band The Neurotics (he posted on the IHR blog about their live setup).
	21:54 SPONSOR: GoToMeeting
	23:02 IHR 101: Paul in the studio with Rod Stewart (well, not quite). He uses Audio Hijack Pro for getting sound (especially from video sources), and Logic Pro for sequencing, beat mapping, and editing. He plays most of the parts himself, except for guitar, which he subs out to someone he's worked with lots, but has never met in person. Backing vocals also come from another studio. He uses a similar process for the TinaJourney.com Tina Turner tribute.
	34:47 BORIS'S RANT: Buying a new stage piano (Derek also wrote an article on that topic five years ago, which remains useful) and reference monitors. For pianos, the line between pro stage and home use has blurred considerably. He discusses Casio, Yahama, and Roland stage pianos, and some of the strange design decisions that get made along that blurred line. Newer pianos are definitely better in sound. He ended up with a Yamaha P140, despite some compromises, because the higher-end pianos are too heavy. He also purchased Dynaudio BM5A reference monitors, with much better low end and more accuracy than what he used previously.
	42:27 EDITORIAL: Paul bought a new MacBook Pro, necessary for the better dedicated video card, because of all his recent video work for Mac Video Training and macProVideo.com. General discussions of laptops vs. desktops, and the continued appeal of the tiny 12" PowerBook.
	56:00 Welcome Dave to Vancouver and its restaurants. Also don't forget the website and blog, IHR TV, our new page at Facebook, our Twitter notifications, the listener forums. See you for IHR #61!
	58:48 END

Has it really been a month since our last episode? Yes it has! We have a longer episode to make up for it, featuring Dave Chick on film composing, Derek on electronic drums, and Paul on Propellerhead Reason 4. Plus we pine for a new episode of the Project Studio Network, talk about cruises and videos, and rant about cable standards.

If you can play Enhanced podcasts (AAC enhanced) on your iPod, PlayStation Portable, Apple TV, Xbox 360, TiVo, or Zune, or in iTunes or QuickTime, you'll find lots of photos and links accompanying this episode.


	00:00 Intros. We enjoy Vancouver's crazy spring rain followed by a sunny Victoria Day weekend heat wave, and reveal that Paul's turning into Mr. Ocean Cruise.
	03:45 Thanks again to our sponsors at Source Elements, GoToMeeting, the Home Recording Network and Blubrry Network, and macProVideo.com, and our affiliate programs at zZounds, Amazon, and NCIX. And thank you for supporting us too! Derek bought a cool Thermaltake USB/SATA docking station via NCIX.
	08:45 Paul is releasing a new Reason 4 video course (to follow up his previous Reason 3 courses) via macProVideo.com, likely in June. We reviewed Reason 3 way back on IHR #11 in March 2006. And yes, we'll have more IHR TV video podcast episodes soon -- we just needed to get some more gear (including the Audio-Technica PRO 70 lavalier mic) and improve our workflow with our Panasonic HD videocams, Zoom H4 recorders, and Final Cut Express. Stay subscribed to IHR TV for new episodes coming soon.
	14:10 Speaking of delays, where is the Project Studio Network? Derek's wife's podcast Lip Gloss and Laptops reached 100 episodes recently -- but are the PSN guys scared of getting to the century mark?
	17:00 SPONSOR: GoToMeeting.com.
	17:45 IHR 101: Introduction to Film Scoring with Dave Chick. (He actually does this for a living!) There are thousands of working and aspiring composers out there, so it's really a business built on relationships. He outlines composing, orchestration and arrangement, sound engineering and production, computer skills, syncing DAWs with video, Internet communications and file transfer, negotiation and sales and business skills, and maintaining good relationships. This could turn into a big series...
	25:14 GEAR REVIEW: Derek drinks a Caffe Artigiano coffee near the Vancouver waterfront and reviews Yamaha's DTXPress digital drums and similar electronic kits from Roland, Alesis, and others. While electronic and MIDI drums have improved in the past 20 years since the days of Howard Jones, they're not quite ready to replace acoustic drums yet -- and they'd look silly in Derek's '60s cover band anyway.
	34:00 GEAR REVIEW: Paul takes on the massive new Reason 4 sequencer, DAW, and instrument package from Propellerhead Software. Check out IHR's Reason 3 review from two years ago too, and Paul's Reason tutorials at macProVideo.com (you can save 15% with our code ihrtv15). Reason has synths, samplers, loops, drum machines, mastering tools, mixers, a vocoder, effects, sequencing, and automation, but it does not record external audio natively (you can do that with ReWire, as explained on the first two episodes of IHR TV).
	42:40 EDITORIAL: Another Derek rant, this time about cables, patents, and monopolies. Derek's frustration is prompted by his persistently problematic MacBook laptop and its MagSafe power connector. Unfortunately, because of Apple's patent on the design, no one else makes MagSafe-compatible power cords. Imagine if you could only buy XLR or RCA or phono cables from one maufacturer. That would suck. And while Apple lets pretty much anyone make stuff work with the iPod dock connector, they can also arbitrarily change how iPod connections work, making old accessories obsolete.

	04:30 Episode #2 of IHR TV is out (on ReWire and Pro Tools), with more new ones coming. Please subscribe, because it's a separate video-only podcast feed.
	05:14 SPONSOR: GoToMeeting.com
	06:15 IHR 101 (Dave): Choosing an audio interface for your PC. Dave has a new Apex tube mic, which he says is "velvety smooth." He discusses the various technologies and options, and what to consider and look out for.
	28:12 COMMENTARY (Derek): Enjoying music. (Background music is "Three Preludes, Opus 104a: Prelude in B Minor" by Felix Mendelssohn, "The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin, and Derek's in-progress demo, called "Six Eight" for now.) Check out Arthur Rubinstein, Oscar Peterson, Glenn Gould, Dread Zeppelin, Celso Machado, and The Neurotics.
	34:17 EDITORIAL: What are unusual music controllers and instruments -- such as Yamaha's Tenori-On (discussed at Sonic State and Music Thing), C-Thru's AXIS-64 (see YouTube), Roland's Octapad, MIDI drums for triggering piano sounds -- useful for? How can you change your musical approach by trying instruments you aren't used to? But please, no more Super Mario theme or Stairway, okay?
	41:28 We recorded this podcast before the Vancouver Sun Run on April 20, but posted it afterwards. Derek has uploaded some photos of his gig for more than 56,000 people.

Shownotes


	00:00 Intros (picture is from Elf Yourself).
	00:35 The December 31 deadline for our Boris Aeven remix contest is coming up. Check out the forum thread.
	06:50 CORRECTION: The Levelator was written by Bruce Sharpe, not Paul Figgiani.
	08:40 SPONSOR: GoToMeeting.com.
	09:43 GEAR REVIEW (Paul): Ultrasone PROline 650 headphones, which Paul first heard about last year when recording the Apple Podcast Recipe seminar and from an IHR listener. See his photos, as well as Derek's previous headphone shootout and Audio-Technica headphone reviews.
	17:07 GEAR REVIEW (Derek): Guitar Rig 3 with Rig Kontrol 3 from Native Instruments. See Derek's photos, his article about guitar tone, Paul's Guitar Rig 2 review, Derek's reviews of AmpliTube 2 and AmpliTube 2 Live with StealthPlug (plus sound samples), as well as Home Recording Odyssey co-host Dave Criddle's guitar plugin shootout of Guitar Rig, AmpliTube, and Rock Amp Legends at the Project Studio Network podcast (both part of the Home Recording Network). The background music is Derek's brand new 12-minute ambient guitar instrumental "Striking Silver" (podsafe MP3 file), and was recorded live in one take with his G&amp;L guitar and a single setting in Guitar Rig 3. He recorded the Guitar Rig sound samples with the G&amp;L, his modified Yamaha Pacifica, and his Godin LG guitar.
	33:08 EDITORIAL: Black! Silver! Grey! Woodgrain! Gummy colours! Blue! Agh!
	39:06 END. Merry Christmas!

Shownotes

	00:00 Intros
	01:43 More details about our Boris Aeven remix contest, including samples of entries from several IHR listeners, as linked up in the IHR forums.
	07:52 SPONSORS: Thanks to our sponsors, GoToMeeting, M-Audio, Source Elements, and zZounds.
	09:19 AD: Try GoToMeeting online meeting software free for 45 days. Just visit GoToMeeting.com/podcast.
	10:28 GEAR REVIEW (Paul): Kontakt 3 from Native Instruments, including its simplified installation, massive sample libraries (33 GB!), Performance View, sample changes since Kontakt 2 (lots of new samples, but some older samples are no longer included), performance, new interface, file browser, wave editor, custom envelopes, destructive sample editor, effects, and sample imports. Here is NI's list of compatible sample formats and changes since Kontakt 2. Purchase Kontakt from zZounds in the U.S. and IHR gets a small cut. Thanks!
	24:01 GUEST INTERVIEW/REVIEW: Derek talks to Mark Blevis of Ottawa about various flash recorders, focusing on the Zoom H2. (Mark recorded his side of the conversation using an Electro-Voice RE-20 mic and Cubase, Derek with his MXL770 mic into the H2 itself.) Mark also uses the Edirol R1 (now sadly discontinued), while Derek has a Zoom H4 for comparison. They also discuss the M-Audio MicroTrack, Edirol R09, and new recorders from Sony and Marantz. Zoom originally planned to use a mid-side three-capsule mic design on the H2 (described well by Hens Zimmerman on his podcast), but ended up with a four-capsule dual-cardoid design. See Derek's H2 photos. Purchase an H2 or other recorder from zZounds in the U.S. and IHR gets a small cut. Thanks!
	35:29 EDITORIAL: The long-running saga of Paul's M-Audio Ozonic keyboard/FireWire interface continues, but this time the problem was with his Power Mac G5's front FireWire port instead of the Ozonic.
	43:00 Plans for IHR #50 next show, and don't forget the remix contest.
	44:04 END

	06:35 CONTEST: Check out details for our Great 2007 IHR Year-End Giveaway at insidehomerecording.com/contests -- remix Boris Aeven's song "And We Move On" (tracks and a rough mix are on that page), and enter to win tons of prizes. Talk about it in the forums too. Deadline is December 31, 2007.
	15:38 SPONSOR: Try GoToMeeting online meeting software free for 45 days. Just visit GoToMeeting.com/podcast.

	29:11 IHR 101: Derek's Quick 'n' Dirty Drum Miking 102 follows up his 101 session from way back on IHR #16, his first appearance as co-host. See his photos and screenshots at Flickr, and download his resulting drum tracks from 102, right here at the IHR website. He used the MXL770 and MXL990 condenser mics, and Samson's dynamic Q8 mic, as well as the Earthworks KickPadâ¢ (reviewed back on IHR #31) and M-Audio FireWire 410 interface, plus GarageBand '08.

	38:01 MIDI 101: Hens Zimmermann from the Sounds Good podcast, part of the Home Recording Network, talks about MIDI files this time around.
	44:41 EDITORIAL: When is the right time to upgrade to a new OS version, like Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard (just released) or Windows Vista (with a Service Pack 1 for Vista coming soon)? Derek wrote some general tips for OS updates on the blog.

Shownotes

	00:00 Intros
	02:00 CORRECTIONS: Andrew Brierley notes that the Zoom G2.1u effects pedal is actually die-cast metal with a plastic covering, not just plastic. And Mark from Samson let us know that the G-Track USB microphone can record either 44.1 or 48 kHz -- just change the sample rate in your DAW or computer audio settings.
	04:00 TIP: If you're in Canada but live near the U.S. border, you can order from U.S.-only online stores if you set up a P.O. box or mailing center just across the border in the U.S.A. -- you'll still need to pay duty and taxes when you return, but deals are pretty good for Canadians with the current exchange rate.
	05:19 TIP: Mike at Switching to Mac demonstrates a way to pay for .Mac subscriptions in different currencies by changing your mailing address in your .Mac account settings.
	06:12 Paul and Derek will appear on "The Lab With Leo" again soon -- we're taping two new appearances in the first week of October, showing hybrid audio devices and Logic Studio 8.
	07:30 SPONSOR: Try GoToMeeting online meeting software free for 45 days. Just visit GoToMeeting.com/podcast.
	08:35 IHR 101: Paul discusses multitimbral synthesizers (such as Spectrasonics' Stylus RMX and IK Multimedia's SampleTank plugins) and MIDI. He also talks about the old Ensoniq ESQ-1 and Roland JV-1080 hardware synths, MIDI channels, and implementation charts.
	17:07 GEAR REVIEW: Derek checks out GarageBand '08, part of the new iLife '08. This update is more focused on music than on podcasting, which was the highlight of version 3. He discusses Magic GarageBand, automation improvements, Visual EQ, arrangement sections, the Delete and Move command, 24-bit recording, automation locking, direct MP3 exporting, export normalization, and other new features, as well as a few bugs and design problems.
	26:38 PROMO: Sounds Good podcast, part of the Home Recording Network.
	26:53 GEAR REVIEW: SampleTank 2.5 review by guest reviewer Hens Zimmerman.
	32:54 EDITORIAL: Apple's aggressive pricing and bundling of Logic Studio 8, plus the new and improved interface, has created a lot of buzz in our IHR forums and among DAW users across the Internet. And next episode we'll announce our big Christmas giveaway remix contest.

Total time 30 min 12 sec. More news from Paul and Derek from around the audio world, a review of Digidesign's Mbox 2 Mini, and some of the first entries into our latest IHR "Show Us and Tell" contest (deadline is July 1, 2007).

If you can play Enhanced podcasts (AAC enhanced) on your iPod or PlayStation Portable, or in iTunes or QuickTime, you'll find lots of photos and links accompanying this episode.

	00:00 Intros, more cancer treatment fun with Derek.
	03:45 NEWS: VocalTuning.com, Ableton's Live Lite to Live 6 upgrade, Paul's Apple podcasting tour continues in June, and he appears on The Lab With Leo on TV in Canada and Australia. The Zoom H2 recorder has also been delayed until August, with a new microphone design.
	10:18 Thanks again to GoToMeeting.com for sponsoring the show.
	11:27 GEAR REVIEW: Paul reviews his Digidesign Mbox 2 Mini.
	19:47 CONTEST: Our "Show Us and Tell" contest asks you to send us your favourite original recording as an MP3 attachment, with "Contest" somewhere in the subject line, to contests {at} insidehomerecording {dot} com with an audio or written explanation of how you put it together. (Note that cover tunes of non-public-domain music won't work, because we can't play them on the show.) We'll randomly draw from all submissions (one per person) for some great prizes in July. The deadline is July 1, 2007. So get recording! Today we talk about two entries, Robert Willey's mellow "Into the Blue" (MP3) and Dead Hot Blonde's very non-mellow "Walk Away" (MP3).
	25:31 EDITORIAL: The pros and cons of automated software updates. They can be essential for security if you're connected to the Internet, but there are also hazards for complex audio production environments.

Just identify the three sounds we play in this episode of the podcast (recorded with Derek's H4) and send your guesses to contests {at} insidehomerecording {dot} com by March 31, 2007. We'll draw randomly from those who identify the sounds correctly during the first IHR show in April.
	13:55 SPONSOR: GoToMeeting.com
	14:56 GEAR REVIEW: Paul reviews M-Audio's Session software and Fast Track USB interface.
	25:18 IHR 101: Derek reconstructs how he built his latest instrumental track, "Fakeout," from his Penmachine Podcast, using his MacBook, Stratocaster guitar, GarageBand, Apple Jam Pack loops, and IK Multimedia StealthPlug interface with AmpliTube 2 Live software. Check out Derek's interview with his mastering engineer, Les Thorn, on IHR #22. Also see the details Derek posted on this blog about how he created the guitar tones.
	35:35 EDITORIAL: Paul has had to return yet another M-Audio Ozonic keyboard and FireWire interface just before playing his first live gig in five years with Tina Journey, a Tina Turner tribute band. Derek had to miss his first gig with The Neurotics in awhile because of his first of two colon cancer surgeries, which happened just before we posted this show. Derek's second surgery and Paul's Apple tours may mean our next show is a little later than usual in March -- we're not sure yet.

Shownotes
Total time 41 min 04 sec. A birthday, a future Zoom H4 recorder giveaway (thanks, Samson and Zoom!), Tunecore, recording solo guitarist-singers, homemade digital patch bays, NAMM trends, Audio Technology magazine, killing star rating, and surgery soon for Derek. Zoom H4 and M-Audio MicroTrack reviews. And do you think an IHR PayPal tip jar is a good idea?

If you can play Enhanced podcasts (AAC enhanced) on your iPod or PlayStation Portable, or in iTunes or QuickTime, you'll find lots of photos and links accompanying this episode.

	00:00 Intros, Home Recording Network, thanks to M-Audio and Source-Elements, GoToMeeting and zZounds.
	01:45 Paul turned 39 this week, and got a cool laptop case; Derek talks about the Samson Q8 dynamic mic donated to us by Samson at the NAMM Show.
	03:00 Coming up - IHR will be giving away a Zoom H4 Handy Recorder (worth $300 USD) in a future episode! Listen to IHR #37 in a couple of weeks for details.
	03:45 Please leave a review of IHR at the iTunes Store podcast directory for your country. (If you're at the Canadian directory, you'll see that Derek left a review, but that was way back when he was just a listener, not co-host.)
	04:30 Tunecore.com is another way to get your independent music in iTunes and other online music stores, and may work out better for you if you sell a lot of music. For smaller sales, CD Baby may be a better bet.
	05:30 Paul found a great way to record solo acoustic guitarist-singers with two microphones and some phase-reversal tricks, from a tip at the IHR forums. He used Apex 460 and 470 microphones.
	08:15 Paul also turned an analog patch pay into a SPDIF digital patch bay with some simple RCA adapters.
	11:10 Trends at NAMM: retro gear like modular synths and Rhodes pianos, high-end manufacturers moving into the home studio market, DJ equipment and techniques cross-pollinating with other stuff.
	15:35 Audio Technology magazine from Australia made some pointed comments about the hassles of product authorization, dongles, serial numbers, and so on -- something Moby noted four years ago too.
	17:20 Check out all our NAMM coverage and photos, plus stuff from Sonic State and Gearwire.
	18:25 What do you think of us having a PayPal tip jar, like the Project Studio Network or Derek's wife's podcast Lip Gloss and Laptops? Leave a comment at our "What Do You Think?" post.
	19:10 We're killing the star rating system! Finally! Yay!
	21:15 AD: GoToMeeting.com
	22:22 GEAR REVIEW: Derek reviews the Zoom H4 Handy Recorder. (Buy it for $300 USD from zZounds in the U.S. and IHR will get a small commission.) Check out the flip-up USB SD cards that Derek uses too. The guitar effects are apparently derived from the Zoom G2 pedal. Also take a look at the prototype Zoom H2 (coming in May for $200 USD) we saw at the NAMM Show. See Derek's Zoom H4 photos too.
	30:40 GEAR REVIEW: Paul reviews the M-Audio MicroTrack 24/96 flash recorder. (Buy it for $400 USD from zZounds in the U.S. and IHR will get a small commission.) If you lose the T-mic, that costs $15 USD to replace. You can use USB to charge, but if you want the official power supply or the hardware inline -10 dB pad, those are $20 USD each. Compare the MicroTrack to the Zoom H4 and the Edirol R09. Finally, see Microphone Data for information on mics that will work with the MicroTrack (and waaaaay more info too). See Paul's photos.
	37:00 EDITORIAL: Derek was diagnosed with colorectal cancer just before NAMM, and will be having surgery soon to remove it, spending a week in the hospital and about two months off work. IHR will keep going as usual, but we're not sure how long Derek will be out of commission, whether we'll bring in some guest hosts, or whether he'll provide some prerecorded segments. He's blogging about it at his blog at penmachine.com, and even appeared on Canada's CBC Radio at the end of January, discussing how he's blogging about his cancer.

News

	The great Star Time four-CD James Brown box set.
	Check out the absolutely amazing groove in James Brown's 1969 performance of "Cold Sweat" on the Mike Douglas Show, one of several YouTube videos featuring great JB clips that Derek posted to his blog. Just as astounding is the moment at 3:42 in this live video from Paris, where James kicks the band from "Brother Rapp" into "Ain't It Funky Now" in the tightest transition I've ever heard or seen. Plus you get super-funky solos from Phelps "Catfish" Collins on guitar, Fred Wesley on trombone, Bootsy Collins on bass, and JB himself on the organ.
	A list of some of the songs that have sampled Clyde Stubblefield's drum break from "Funky Drummer." This page features recordings, analysis, and transcriptions of that and some other famous drum breaks.
	Free, open-source Synergy software for sharing monitors and input devices between Macs, PCs, and Linux/Unix machines, plus the Belkin Flip hardware KVM switch that Paul had been using.
	A free online Synergy tutorial shows you how to set it up.
	The Levelator from GigaVox. Listen to this Podcast 411 interview where Doug Kaye and Michael Geohagen explain how it works.
	Crysonic mastering plugins via Les Thorn.

Reviews

	IK Multimedia StealthPlugâ¢ (buy via zZounds, or see Derek's photos).
	"Funkly Dougietude" tune from Derek and Doug Elliott, made with the StealthPlug, and also available at the Podsafe Music Network, and once again mastered by Les Thorn.
	Ableton Live 6 (buy via zZounds)
	Earthworks KickPadâ¢ (buy via zZounds and other dealers, or see Derek's photos)
	Shure SM58 and AKG D112 dynamic mics.
	Photos of the hollow riser stage my band played on, where we had to deal with low-frequency feedback from the bass drum.

Shownotes
Total time 47 min 27 sec. Another long show, announcing the new Home Recording Network, IHR's collaboration with Apple on a free online podcasting seminar at apple.com, frequency ear training, Derek's IHR 101 on the GarageBand Graduate's Toolkit, an interview with Corey Denis of IODA, and an editorial about tools for collaboration.

	00:00 Intros and news: IHR has helped form the Home Recording Network of podcasts at the suggestion of Andrew Brierley of the Home Recording Odyssey, Apple invited Paul to co-host its free "Podcast Recipe" online seminar at apple.com, and he also has new GarageBand videos at macProVideo.com. Derek has a UPS story about his wife's Lip Gloss and Laptops podcast, Paul has reconfigured his studio (which is why his voice was weird last episode) and likes his new Belkin Flip KVM.
	10:00 We announce the winner of our post-Halloween recording war stories giveaway, who gets a Shuttle Pro 2 USB controller courtesy of Contour Designs, Reason training videos hosted by Paul from macProVideo, a $50 USD gift certificate courtesy of zZounds, and some bonus stuff including candy.
	15:09 Ear Training (Paul): Identifying frequency boosts in a song from the Podsafe Music Network.
	19:58 IHR 101 (Derek): The GarageBand Graduate's Toolkit, featuring Apple's Logic Express, the open source Audacity, Rogue Amoeba's Fission, Adobe's Soundbooth, and GigaVox Media's The Levelator.
	28:38 Guest Interview (Derek): Corey Denis of the Independent Online Distribution Alliance explains what IODA and Promonet are all about, and her opinions and predictions about the music industry.
	42:55 Editorial (Derek): The home recording revolution helps us work by ourselves, but where are the tools to help us collaborate better with other musicians? Source-Connect is one option we're investigating, and even something like GoToMeeting might help too, but we deserve more ways to get that elusive "live" sound when playing music together with others.

		<itunes:summary>Guitar Rig 2 Giveaway Survey Continues, New Gear from Apple &amp; Dell &amp; Digidesign, Vocal Recording Part 2, Belkin TuneTalk Stereo, Jimmy Zee Interview, Corrections and Links
UPDATE: See my new important note on how to avoid recordings that skip using the TuneTalk Stereo (and presumably other recording interfaces) with your hard drive-based "5G" or "5.5G" iPod with Video.

	00:00 - Intros. Sorry the show is so late, but Paul and I were both out of town and it's been crazy back-to-school week too. We've made this episode extra-long to compensate. Our first episode sponsored by Wicked Lasers. Our condolences to Todd Cochrane at Blubrry.com on the loss of his father too.
	05:12 - Don't forget our Great Gear Giveaway: fill out our 67-question (we know, it's a lot, but it won't take toooo long) listener survey at www.insidehomerecording.com/survey so we can help make the show better, make sure you know the secret word from IHR #22, and you could win the excellent Guitar Rig 2 guitar amp emulator plugin, with hardware foot controller, direct from the factory at Native Instruments.
	06:25 - The Mbox 2 Pro finally offers a capable FireWire audio interface from Digidesign that includes Pro Tools LE. It's perhaps a much better alternative than Digi's M-Audio FireWire 410 (which Derek uses) and the less-capable Pro Tools M-Powered, for not much more money ($800 USD)
	07:10 - Apple's new Wireless Mighty Mouse, plus the Mac Pros ($2000 and up, quad-core Intel Xeon processors, very expandable) and iMacs (starting at $1000 USD for the 17", Core 2 Duo processors, including a new 24" model), as well as Dell's XPS 700 ($2000? and up), which are some of the most powerful and slick-looking digital recording desktops computers ever made
	12:00 - IHR 101 on vocal recording. Today, room acoustics. Check out the SE Electronics Reflexion Filter and Acoustics 101 from Auralex.
	22:27 - Derek reviews the Belkin TuneTalk Stereo for the iPod With Video ("5G"):

	Belkin website
	Amazon IHR affiliate purchase link
	Also available at the Apple Store
	My photos of the TuneTalk Stereo with my iPod
	Belkin TuneTalk support area, including FAQ
	Photos of Ala Moana Center Apple Store, food court, and Outrigger Shore Bird Lounge where I tested the TuneTalk in Hawaii
	Roland Tanglao's blog and Dogma Radio podcast
	My classical guitar
	Sony "plug-in power" 3Â V stereo mic (IHR affiliate link), originally for MiniDisc recorders
	Competing iPod recorders from XtremeMac (MicroMemo) and Griffin (iTalk Pro, which may not be released)
	Dedicated portable recorders from M-Audio, Edirol, Marantz, and Sony
	Another review from iLounge


	34:26 - Jimmy Zee interview.
	48:03 - As Derek posted to the blog, it turns out that the Tannoy Reveal 5A studio monitor speakers he reviewed last show, and which he had criticized for being too expensive, are only half the price he thought, deserving a full 5 out of 5 as an excellent value at $800 for the pair. For near-field mixing, you may never outgrow them, as long as you add a subwoofer.
	50:35 - Finally, check out our new photos by Kris Krug, the Project Studio Network cheap-vs.-expensive mic preamp shootout, plus Dave Criddle's new co-hosting position on Andrew Brierley's Home Recording Odyssey podcast. And Paul was interviewed on show #32 of the Canadian Podcast Buffet.
	53:40 - END

Thanks to all the participants in the very busy IHR listener forums. We've been learning a lot there, and hope you have too. Also remember that you can post your photos to the IHR Flickr Group - joining the Flickr photo sharing site is free

Reason Drum Kits Review

Looking to add some killer acoustic drum sounds to your Reason songs? You should check out Drum Kits 2.0 Refill for Reason 3.0.

You also might be very interested to see a super cool video presentation.

Overall: I thought it sounded very good and gives you very flexible control over the sounds, mixing of the kits, and effect settings. My only gripe was that it took way to long to load on in Mac OS X. When I used it in Win XP, it loaded much faster, leaving me wondering why that was?

We also recorded Paul's Yamaha upright piano in his living-room, using 2 Rode NT-2 microphones, straight into Digidesign  Pro Tools M-Powered using an Ozonic k/b, ART Tube M/P, and PowerBook 12" laptop. This allowed our listeners to hear what a real piano sounds like recorded into a DAW.

Paul and James were very impressed with all the instruments, however they both seemed to favor the sound and features of Synthogy's Ivory, and made it their "Top Rated" piano. Rated "Best Overall Value", was the Art Vista.

You can listen to on-line samples of each instrument by visiting the above links.</itunes:summary>
