<p>Glenn and Tom talk about getting inside the head of Website users to establish rules for developing and designing a Website that gets results through better usability for the target market.</p>

<p>How are Website design and development rules established?</p>
<p>    It all starts by understanding the target market.<br />
    Get inside the head of your users and really understand them.<br />
    Not all Web users are alike.</p>
<p>How are these rules made practical?</p>
<p>    Survey your target market and spend some time living their issues.<br />
    Conduct user testing with the target market and compare those findings to Web stats.<br />
    Hire team members that are part of your target market and listen to them.</p>
<p>What areas should rules cover?</p>
<p>    All areas of Web marketing should be covered in these rules.<br />
    Content is a key area for site-wide consideration.<br />
    Navigation and conversion points.<br />
    Use of design and photography.<br />
    Other areas that matter to your key demographics.</p>
<p>Aren’t most usability rules the same for all Websites?</p>
<p>    Many fundamental usability rules apply to all sites.<br />
    All Websites should be easy to use for their specific target.<br />
    How they Website is used is the key difference.<br />
    These rules go further then the basics and focus on the target market.<br />
    The rules help avoid the online brochure problem.</p>
<p>What are a few examples of rules for specific target markets? Consider the differences between the following market segments.</p>
<p>    Engineers and non-technical salespeople<br />
    Teenagers and the elderly<br />
    Construction workers and IT professionals<br />
    Mobile versus office workers<br />
    Real estate professionals versus accountants</p>
<p>What are the key action items for the listener?</p>
<p>    Conduct research and take the time to get inside the head of your Website users.<br />
    Make a short list of universal standards for your Website.<br />
    Distribute those standards or rules to all team members.<br />
    Have someone make sure the rules are followed as your Website is updated.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Podcast Number 73 &#8212; February 2012</p>
<p>Intuitive Website just launched a new Website, what do podcasts listeners need to know about<br />
the new site?</p>

<p>    This simple Website is the result of many year’s of work and thought about Web marketing<br />
    and usability.<br />
    The new site is an example of the difficulty in making Websites simple.<br />
    Our competitor Websites are much more complex.<br />
    The site is a work in progress and will improve over time.<br />
    It showcases what is key to our prospective clients, our Four Step Process and our<br />
    knowledge base.<br />
    It will drive leads that are highly qualified and ready to buy our services.</p>
<p>What are the key objectives and goals of the new Website?</p>
<p>    The goals of the Website are to drive inquiries for our services.<br />
    It does this through ease of use and education.<br />
    The Website supports our sales process.<br />
    It gets results from a variety of traffic sources.<br />
    The voice of the site should connect with our key audience.<br />
    We will refer people to the site to drive conversions.</p>
<p>How does the site go about meeting those goals?</p>
<p>    The site has very straight-forward messaging.<br />
    It uses one level navigation for most pages.<br />
    A brief introduction to our services.<br />
    A very simple contact us form and fewer options.<br />
    It communicates on a subconscious level that we know what we are doing because we<br />
    organize our approach around a process and we understand users.</p>
<p>What are the key action items for the listener?</p>
<p>    Go checkout our Website and gives your feedback.<br />
    Go to the site and subscribe to newsletter and read our articles.<br />
    Compare us to competitors in the industry and let us know your thoughts.<br />
    Consider a switch to WordPress (our new site was built in WordPress).<br />
    Hire us to be your Web marketing, design and development firm.</p>

    The site is a work in progress and will improve over time.
    It showcases what is key to our prospective clients, our Four Step Process and our
    knowledge base.
    It will drive leads that are highly qualified and ready to buy our services.
What are the key objectives and goals of the new Website?
    The goals of the Website are to drive inquiries for our services.
    It does this through ease of use and education.
    The Website supports our sales process.
    It gets results from a variety of traffic sources.
    The voice of the site should connect with our key audience.
    We will refer people to the site to drive conversions.
How does the site go about meeting those goals?
    The site has very straight-forward messaging.
    It uses one level navigation for most pages.
    A brief introduction to our services.
    A very simple contact us form and fewer options.
    It communicates on a subconscious level that we know what we are doing because we
    organize our approach around a process and we understand users.
What are the key action items for the listener?
    Go checkout our Website and gives your feedback.
    Go to the site and subscribe to newsletter and read our articles.
    Compare us to competitors in the industry and let us know your thoughts.
    Consider a switch to WordPress (our new site was built in WordPress).

In this podcast Glenn and Tom review 10 Website trends that are expected to be hot for 2012.  Plan ahead and be ready for these trends before they happen.

Prepare for the “Internets” 

Some Websites are so large, have many users can be considered an “Internet.”
This includes Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter and the emerging Google+.
Business profile pages and regular content additions are a must.
Users will stay on these Web pages for resources, to solve problems and help.
Each site will have their own strategy and stats monitoring.

The Mobile Web

Mobile traffic is growing fast.
Develop a mobile version of your site when traffic hits 10% or more.
Mobile traffic is highly qualified and needs conversion points.
Adapt your Website to the screen size of the user.

Publishing and Content

Content is free and valuable content will draw traffic.
eBooks are the future of publishing and magazines are next.
Stale content is a negative influence of Web results.

Google Wants New, Relevant and a High Volume of Content

Fresh Content is more important than ever for Google’s search results.
Google will continue to grow and Google+ will increase market share.
Blogs and regular Website content updates will drive growth.

Apple Slips

Apple will start to struggle for the first time in a while in 2012.
There is a lack of awesome break-through products.
Service is dropping in the stores.
Competitors are likely to come in.
Lack of leadership will be evident in 2012.
Excellent run for Apple could start to end in 2012.

Offline Success Drives Online Growth

Brands that are strong outside the Web will enjoy the most growth.
Websites without a strong offline presence will struggle.
More strong offline brands will embrace the Web fully in 2012.

Wild Election Process

The 2012 election will be won on the Internet.
Fundraising will go online and voter influence will come from the Web.
Obama will easily be re-elected with more online support than ever.
This will influence elections at all levels.

Website Knowledge Explodes

Knowledge of Web marketing is no longer for the geeks or Web masters.
This knowledge will explode among small to medium sized businesses in 2012.
Web marketing terms will become an accepted and critical part of marketing.

Integrated Media and the Death of Flash

User preferences will drive the use of more media on Websites.
Video, audio, written content, photos, slides, graphics and more will need to be on Websites to meet user needs.
This will drive job growth for graphic design and Web media jobs.
Flash will decline and HTML5 and other universal formats will emerge in 2012.

Website Development Speeds Up and Budgets Fall

CMS systems and Web savvy developers will build Websites faster and cheaper.
CMS templates and modules will make Website success more about strategy, messaging and content and less about development.
Good design is not going away, but development is now a piece of cake.
WordPress will continue to lead the way along with substantial growth for Magento.
This will also drive job growth in 2012.

		<itunes:summary>Podcast Number 70 – November 2011
In this podcast Glenn and Tom review strategies and recommendations on meeting the needs of Website visitors who may not understand your Website or come from various market segments. Can a Website be everything for everyone? Or should it focus strictly on its target market?
Should Websites be expected to meet the needs or even be understood of all Web visitors?

Remember the Seinfeld Soup Nazi?
You don’t want your Website to follow that role.
Look at the upside risk versus the downside risk.
As a rule of thumb, keep the site understood by as many visitors as possible.
Follow the 10-out-of-10 rule.
Don’t assume any Website visitors “get it” just because you do!
What if Bill Gates visits your home page?

How does a Website go about communicating with a broad ranges of users?

Keep it simple and use direct, easily understood concrete terms.
Landing pages should be easily understood.
More detailed and market specific content should be in place on interior pages.
Keep in mind the reading level of your visitors.

Is there a risk that the actual target market may be alienated?

If you upset a segment with content, then buy a separate domain name because you will need multiple Websites.
Research and talk to your target market and referral sources.

Where should Websites find a middle ground in these area?

The best and most popular Websites have wide segments.
The best Websites communicate broadly, even in niche areas.

Here are the action items from the Podcast:

Analyze your market segments and understand each’s hot buttons and triggers.
Understand and know how referral sources work on the Web.
Use this to develop a messaging strategy and Website segmentation approach.
Track your data and do user testing on broad segments and niches.
We all tend to be focused too much on how we perceive the world, the Web forces to get out of this bubble or vacuum and better communicate to new and current target markets and referral sources.

<p>In this podcast Glenn and Tom discuss the importance of developing and implementing a strategy around lead generation and the specific paths users take before they contact your company via the Web.  Website marketers must understand how users prefer to convert and the sales funnel they follow on a Website. This drivers a higher percentage of lead conversions.</p>
<p><strong>What is the “lead conversion funnel?”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The path users take on your site before they make contact.</li>
<li>Specific content, photos and Web pages that generally lead to conversions.</li>
<li>Website visitors can take multiple paths and those paths can be segmented.</li>
<li>They can also come to your site from other Websites.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are a few examples of how this funnel works?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Real Estate Websites start with a home search.</li>
<li>Product Websites that start with shop and compare.</li>
<li>The Netflix “How it Works” page.</li>
<li>Special offers and free samples can be part of the funnel.</li>
<li>A Facebook referral or special offer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How should Website owners and marketers go about setting up a funnel on their Website?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Website should be designed and developed around the content that will drive conversions and make up the conversion funnel.</li>
<li>It starts from a strategic standpoint and the content follows.</li>
<li>The navigation menu supports this path.</li>
<li>Specific pages can be funnel pages.</li>
<li>The contact us page is a conversion.</li>
<li>Website clutter is a barrier to the conversion funnel.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here are the action items from the Podcast:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Write a Web marketing strategy for lead generation based on content strategies and specific page views.</li>
<li>Set-up Google Analytics, along with goal tracking.</li>
<li>Watch your Webs stats on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Have an excellent Contact Us page (see our previous podcast).</li>
<li>Develop and improve the writing skills on your team.</li>
<li>Write conversion-based content, including photos, images and graphics.</li>
<li>Include a blog and regular content updates.</li>
<li>Understand how users convert on your Website. </li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Getting content done for a Website is a big challenge.&nbsp; Our clients either don&#39;t have time or do not know how to get it completed. &nbsp; It is worth the investment to either learn the skills or hire someone to put good content on the Web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is it such a challenge for small or large businesses to get content to their Website?&nbsp; It takes time, it&#39;s hard to find the time, and it requires skill and practice.&nbsp; Also, the best content resides with just one person or a&nbsp; few people in any organization. &nbsp; Don&#39;t use any of these reasons as an excuse for not getting the content on the site.&nbsp; It can be a team effort.&nbsp; The team will need to have the following skills, a) comfortable with English Language, b) understanding how people read Web copy and c) an understanding of the content and industry.</p>
<p>One way to make all this happen is to hire an <a href="http://www.intuitivewebsites.com/aboutus/team" target="_blank">external web marketing team</a> to help direct the process to ensure the content is completed.&nbsp; Whether the content is created internally or externally it still requires a process and persistence. &nbsp; If you choose to have content written by an external web copy writer&nbsp; be sure to hire someone that will spend the time to interview the business team and really learn the industry so the final content is relevant and accurate.</p>
<h3>What types of content are we taking about?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Home page copy and branding </li>
<li>Key bullet points</li>
<li>About Us content</li>
<li>Captions and tag-lines</li>
<li>Headers</li>
<li>Product and Services</li>
<li>Resources based content&nbsp; (blog, information content) </li>
</ul>
<h3>Where can Web marketers go to get resources or get started?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keyword research- content should be keyword rich to help draw search engine traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, write for your target market first and search engines second.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Start with the branding component &#8211; homepage messaging.</li>

Getting content done for a Website is a big challenge.  Our clients either don't have time or do not know how to get it completed.   It is worth the investment to either learn the skills or hire someone to put good content on the Web. 
Why is it such a challenge for small or large businesses to get content to their Website?  It takes time, it's hard to find the time, and it requires skill and practice.  Also, the best content resides with just one person or a  few people in any organization.   Don't use any of these reasons as an excuse for not getting the content on the site.  It can be a team effort.  The team will need to have the following skills, a) comfortable with English Language, b) understanding how people read Web copy and c) an understanding of the content and industry.
One way to make all this happen is to hire an external web marketing team to help direct the process to ensure the content is completed.  Whether the content is created internally or externally it still requires a process and persistence.   If you choose to have content written by an external web copy writer  be sure to hire someone that will spend the time to interview the business team and really learn the industry so the final content is relevant and accurate.
What types of content are we taking about?

Home page copy and branding 
Key bullet points
About Us content
Captions and tag-lines
Headers
Product and Services
Resources based content  (blog, information content) 

Where can Web marketers go to get resources or get started?

Keyword research- content should be keyword rich to help draw search engine traffic.   However, write for your target market first and search engines second.  
Start with the branding component – homepage messaging.
Find a copy writer that knows how to write for the Web.  If decide to go internal, make sure they get training to do it well. 
Many good books on Web content
Call Intuitive Websites to help direct the process and/or find you the right person to write your copy.

Key action items:

WRITE- and do it every day.  The more you do it the better you will get at it.  
Take the time to think about and develop a strategy for Web Content. 
Make it a priority in your Web marketing strategy.  
Share what you have learned, write what you have learned about your industry.  
Find someone to help you or learn yourself
Make the time, don’t make excuses.

Next podcast will dig a little deeper on this topic.  We will talk about content that drives the conversions.   Once you have made the time to develop content, next make content that will drive conversions.  </itunes:summary>

<p>College and university Websites are unique in many ways and we have much to learn from these complex sites. &nbsp; They have a diverse set of objectives, multiple stakeholders and many messages to relay. College/university Website design and management is challenging and time consuming. </p>
<p>Start by identifying the target markets (students, parents, faculty etc.) and identifying their needs.&nbsp; Then develop a plan and strategy for the Website based on those needs. The three key areas to focus on are 1) navigation, 2) conversion points and 3) contents/images.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The University of Colorado at Colorado Springs Website has complicated navigation. &nbsp; They are using graphics for navigation, many users will not know that these are navigation points.&nbsp; Below are some recommendations for this site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify navigation and focus toward the target markets</li>
<li>Keep the site design and menus consistent on all pages</li>
<li>Financial aid and registration areas need to be easier to find. </li>
<li>Buttons for &quot;Apply Now&quot; can be very effective.&nbsp; These should be clear conversion points throughout the site.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Use real UCCS students and faculty in photos to better personalize the site.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<h3>Let&#39;s look at a few other colleges Websites:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford University</a>: Using image and graphics that are true to the institution and their homepage navigation is easy to follow.</li>
<li><a href="http://mit.edu/" target="_blank">Massachussettes Institute of Technology</a>: Integrated the experience of being at MIT into their homepage</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hbs.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard School of Business</a>: Clean homepage design, consistent design throughout. </li>
<li><a href="http://coloradocollege.edu" target="_blank">Colorado College</a>: Strong photography with a focus on graduation, the first initial benefit from going to college.</li>
</ul>
<p>Social Networking will have a big impact on future college students.&nbsp; Social media is central to this target market of college bound high school students.&nbsp; This is an area of marketing for colleges and universities that is just waiting to be tapped.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Action Plan for UCCS:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Do the research and homework to develop a new site map.</li>
<li>Develop conversion points to meet the needs of the users and the college/university. </li>
<li>Look at other sites, what are they doing well and not so well. </li>
<li>Conduct user testing in key target markets.</li>
</ol>

College and university Websites are unique in many ways and we have much to learn from these complex sites.   They have a diverse set of objectives, multiple stakeholders and many messages to relay. College/university Website design and management is challenging and time consuming.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google is constantly updating AdWords and it is important to keep up.&nbsp; Google now has account reps and have implemented an outreach program to help their customers keep up. We have been assigned an account rep at Google and here are a few things we have learned.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Negative Keywords</h3>
<p>Google has improved the ability to remove negative keywords from your account.&nbsp; This feature allows you to tell Google what words you do NOT want to bring paid traffic to your site. &nbsp; In the new Google interface you can see what terms people are using to find your site (See Search Terms).&nbsp; You can disassociate certain words from your account and pay for the traffic <em>you want</em>.</p>
<h3>Wonder Wheel</h3>
<p>You don&#39;t need an AdWords account to see this feature.&nbsp; Do a Google search and just below the Google search you will see a link to more options.&nbsp; This shows you the most common searches related to the term you selected. &nbsp; Essentially this is a keyword research tool without having to set up an AdWords account.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Search Based Key Word Tool</h3>
<p>This function works best if you already have an AdWords account.&nbsp; Compares you Google AdWords keywords and scans your Website for what keywords it thinks you should be targeting.&nbsp; Basically, the opposite of the Negative Keywords tool.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finds critical missing key words based on your site content. A great Web marketing tool.</p>
<h3>Use of the Content Network for Branding</h3>
<p>Ability to put your Website ad on a variety of other Websites (like NY Times etc.)&nbsp; Google is modifying the way this tool works to focus on branding and improve results.&nbsp; You must have a strategy to make this work successfully. &nbsp; If you don&#39;t know your demographics or market segments, then you can spend a lot of money on the wrong traffic.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Historical data on search terms and related terms</h3>
<p>Insights for Google search results have been updated and improved.&nbsp; This can show you <em>where</em> the keywords are being used.&nbsp; In lower right corner you can find the &quot;rising trends&quot; area, that identifies new, related keywords getting more traffic. These are called <em>break out terms.&nbsp; </em>Historical trends also are available.</p>
<h3>Improve Google Ads with Call To Action!</h3>
<p>Have unique titles and clear call to actions on your ads and a clear reason to visit the Website.&nbsp; Make an offer or other incentive to click onthe ad.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Action Item Plan</h3>
<ul>
<li> Learn about Google AdWords and how it can help you determine market segments. </li>
<li>Set-up strategic campaigns based on your marketing segmentation. </li>
<li>Use the keyword tools (<a href="http://wordtracker.com" target="_blank">wordtracker.com</a> is another good source). </li>
<li>Run a simple test program at minimum cost.&nbsp; Look for coupons from Google too!</li>

<h3>What is marketing segmentation?</h3>
<p>It is the process of determining the various characteristics of your marketplace and preparing a Website that meets those needs.&nbsp; Identify the customer and what they perceive as benefits and overall value.&nbsp; In other words, it is the science of understanding your market place and dividing it into segments.&nbsp; Segments might include demographics, pricing, quality, and service expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp; Understand the ranges of expectations and what your target market perceives as &quot;value&quot;. </p>
<p>Successful marketing segmentation allows you to better meet the needs of your customer, and do it better than your competitors that may not have that focus. </p>
<h3>Two Great Books</h3>
<ol>
<li><u>Blue Ocean Strategy</u> (Kim and Mauborgne)</li>
<li><u>The Discipline of Market Leaders</u> (Treacy and Wiersema)<br /> There are three market focus disciplines: Operational, Product&nbsp; and Customer.<br /> Some rules to consider a) Strive to excel in a specific dimension of value, b) Maintain threshold standards on the other dimensions of value, c) Dominate your market by improving value year after year, and d) Build a well-tuned operating model dedicated to delivering unmatched value</li>
</ol>
<h3>Marketing Segmentation and Web Marketing</h3>
<p>Focus your homepage content and navigation to speak directly to the market segment you are targeting.&nbsp; The content throughout your site should also support your marketing strategy.&nbsp; Close attention to detail and finding a unique market place are key. &nbsp;</p>
<p> Use Web based segmentation strategies to drive traffic. Focus on bringing less traffic but focus on the <em>quality</em> of the traffic. Search engine research<em> is</em> a form of market segmentation. Email, content distribution, and strategies on social networking should be addressed to the niche market segment you have identified.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Action item plan </h3>
<ul>
<li>Become a strategic Web marketing expert-do your homework.</li>
<li>Utilize Google Analytics</li>
<li>Deliver message and a Website that connects with your target market</li>
</ul>

It is the process of determining the various characteristics of your marketplace and preparing a Website that meets those needs.  Identify the customer and what they perceive as benefits and overall value.  In other words, it is the science of understanding your market place and dividing it into segments.  Segments might include demographics, pricing, quality, and service expectations.   Understand the ranges of expectations and what your target market perceives as "value". 
Successful marketing segmentation allows you to better meet the needs of your customer, and do it better than your competitors that may not have that focus. 
Two Great Books

Blue Ocean Strategy (Kim and Mauborgne)
The Discipline of Market Leaders (Treacy and Wiersema) There are three market focus disciplines: Operational, Product  and Customer. Some rules to consider a) Strive to excel in a specific dimension of value, b) Maintain threshold standards on the other dimensions of value, c) Dominate your market by improving value year after year, and d) Build a well-tuned operating model dedicated to delivering unmatched value

Marketing Segmentation and Web Marketing
Focus your homepage content and navigation to speak directly to the market segment you are targeting.  The content throughout your site should also support your marketing strategy.  Close attention to detail and finding a unique market place are key.  
 Use Web based segmentation strategies to drive traffic. Focus on bringing less traffic but focus on the quality of the traffic. Search engine research is a form of market segmentation. Email, content distribution, and strategies on social networking should be addressed to the niche market segment you have identified.  
Action item plan 

Become a strategic Web marketing expert-do your homework.
Utilize Google Analytics
Deliver message and a Website that connects with your target market

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.intuitivewebsites.com" target="_blank">Intuitive Websites LLC</a>&nbsp; provides free Website reviews. This podcast will review PlusMoreMedia.com that was brought our attention by one of our podcast listeners.&nbsp; Plus More Media provides creative media solutions that make an impact for your business. For over five years they have been helping clients improve their business through customer focused Web design, graphic design, and video production services.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let&#39;s take a look at <a href="http://www.plusmoremedia.com" target="_blank">www.PlusMoreMedia.com</a></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Website Audits Review Each of the<a href="http://www.fourstepprocess.com" target="_blank"> Four Steps </a>:&nbsp; When looking at a site we review all four of the steps to a successful Website.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<blockquote><p>1. Strategy:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />2. Design and Development<br />3. Driving Traffic<br />4. Website Performance</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Strategy and Design </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Message is not direct enough to tell us what the site is about in 5-10 seconds. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps choose a tag-line that follows the navigation.&nbsp; Focus on&nbsp; Web graphic design and video production and show differentiation -what makes your company different.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Professional design, clear navigation and layout.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Suggested a rotator image to get across your message : a &quot;big&quot; image to communicate quickly what your business is offering.</li>
<li>Simplify the home page and tell the rest of the story within the site. &nbsp;&nbsp; Scale back on homepage content.</li>
<li>Focus on conversion point- they are using &quot;Deal of the Month&quot; , this is a good offer and shows a good impression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The offer should be duplicated throughout the site.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Banners are often hidden to a users. &nbsp; Many graphics are often not seen.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Driving Traffic:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The site is using very competitive and generic keywords. They are missing &#39;where you live&#39; in the title tag to narrow focus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use niche words.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Resource tab is missing &#8211; place for free stuff and more content.</li>
<li>Blog link difficult to find, on the New navigation. &nbsp;&nbsp; Did a good job putting the articles on separate pages.&nbsp; Long scrolling page, it would be helpful to make all links blue and underline. &nbsp; &nbsp; Brief description then lead to complete article.&nbsp; </li>
<li>There is a lot of good content on the site, work on the organization and accessibility of it.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How many leads are coming to the site and how many are converted to customers?&nbsp; Difficult to find the Contact information. &nbsp;&nbsp; Recommend phone and Email on every page with prominent placement.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Form on contact page is great but could add area to find out what the potential client really needs or present them an offer for completing the form.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Add information when customer what time frame they will be contact.&nbsp;</li>
<li>An About Us page with photos and information about the people that make up the company/service is what users want to see.&nbsp; People also want to see the client list and what you have done for them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Present credibility as well as the people/personal side of your business.</li>
<li>Avoid blocks of text.&nbsp; Use bullets or at least headlines over the blocks of text.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Action plan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify and make content more direct. </li>
<li>Make conversion points more visible and easily found.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Focus the graphic images.</li>
<li>More local focus and niche categories/keywords/strategy to drive traffic &#8211; use stats to help make these decisions</li>
<li>Change conversion points&nbsp; to an &quot;offer of the month&quot; and reinforce that you have&nbsp; service to offer. </li>
</ul>

Let's take a look at www.PlusMoreMedia.com 
Website Audits Review Each of the Four Steps :  When looking at a site we review all four of the steps to a successful Website.  
1. Strategy:   2. Design and Development3. Driving Traffic4. Website Performance

Strategy and Design 

Message is not direct enough to tell us what the site is about in 5-10 seconds.      Perhaps choose a tag-line that follows the navigation.  Focus on  Web graphic design and video production and show differentiation -what makes your company different. 
Professional design, clear navigation and layout. 
Suggested a rotator image to get across your message : a "big" image to communicate quickly what your business is offering.
Simplify the home page and tell the rest of the story within the site.    Scale back on homepage content.
Focus on conversion point- they are using "Deal of the Month" , this is a good offer and shows a good impression.    The offer should be duplicated throughout the site. 
Banners are often hidden to a users.   Many graphics are often not seen.  

Driving Traffic:

The site is using very competitive and generic keywords. They are missing 'where you live' in the title tag to narrow focus.   Use niche words. 
Resource tab is missing – place for free stuff and more content.
Blog link difficult to find, on the New navigation.    Did a good job putting the articles on separate pages.  Long scrolling page, it would be helpful to make all links blue and underline.     Brief description then lead to complete article.  
There is a lot of good content on the site, work on the organization and accessibility of it.  

Performance:

How many leads are coming to the site and how many are converted to customers?  Difficult to find the Contact information.    Recommend phone and Email on every page with prominent placement.    
Form on contact page is great but could add area to find out what the potential client really needs or present them an offer for completing the form.      Add information when customer what time frame they will be contact. 
An About Us page with photos and information about the people that make up the company/service is what users want to see.  People also want to see the client list and what you have done for them.   Present credibility as well as the people/personal side of your business.
Avoid blocks of text.  Use bullets or at least headlines over the blocks of text.  

 Action plan

Simplify and make content more direct. 
Make conversion points more visible and easily found.  
Focus the graphic images.
More local focus and niche categories/keywords/strategy to drive traffic – use stats to help make these decisions
Change conversion points  to an "offer of the month" and reinforce that you have  service to offer. 

If you'd like your site audited go to IntuitiveWebsites.com.

<p><strong>Why does a business need a podcast?</strong>&nbsp; Huge audience available to hear your message.&nbsp; People are multi-tasking to be more productive. &nbsp; Audio can be running in the background while listeners can continue other work at same time.</p>
<p>Blogs and podcasts are really one in the same.&nbsp; Add your mp3 files to your blog and you have posted your podcast to your blog. &nbsp; Some great resources are <a href="http://www.podcastalley.com" target="_blank">podcastalley.com</a> and <a href="http://www.podcast.com" target="_blank">podcast.com</a>. </p>
<p>Many people say, &quot;I don&#39;t have the technology to create a podcast&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t take a recording studio to make a podcast.&nbsp; They can be produced in the comfort of your own living room with little expense. </p>
<ul>
<li>Macintosh computers come equipped with Garage Band, a free program that will create your mp3 files. &nbsp; </li>
<li>PC users can download a free program at audacity.com.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Use a good USB headset and microphone.&nbsp; One microphone for each person speaking gives best results. </li>
<li>Professional announcers/hosts are a nice touch.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.voices.com" target="_blank">Voices.com</a> and <a href="http://www.voices123.com" target="_blank">Voices123.com</a> are two sites to get you started.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Action plan:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Make podcast strategy part of overal content distribution.</li>
<li>Get the right equipment (basic usbmicrophone, software, host, music).</li>
<li>Experiment </li>
<li>Prepare outline of key points</li>
<li>Summarize the key points on the blog posting&nbsp; </li>

Why does a business need a podcast?  Huge audience available to hear your message.  People are multi-tasking to be more productive.   Audio can be running in the background while listeners can continue other work at same time.
Blogs and podcasts are really one in the same.  Add your mp3 files to your blog and you have posted your podcast to your blog.   Some great resources are podcastalley.com and podcast.com. 
Many people say, "I don't have the technology to create a podcast".   It doesn't take a recording studio to make a podcast.  They can be produced in the comfort of your own living room with little expense.

<p>The Contact Us page is one of the most important pages on a Website, yet many times key information is missing or hard to find on the page which results in frustrated users.</p>
<p>It is amazing to see how many Contact Us pages do not include the most common pieces of contact information such as an easy to find phone number and street address for your company.</p>
<p>Here is a quick check list for the Contact Us page.</p>
<p>- Make it easy to find on the main navigation and home page.</p>
<p>- Include a phone and fax number, email, Web based form, office locations, business hours and driving directions.</p>
<p>- Communicate to users that you want to hear from them and they will get a quick response.</p>
<p>- Place contact information on every page of the Website, especially near important services and product pages.</p>
<p>The last thing a Website should do is frustrate visitors just as they are attempting to contact the company!  Follow these tips and make sure your Contact Us page is meeting user needs.</p>

More than ever people are shopping on the web.
More potential business partners/clients are using the web as a first evaluation of your company. Businesses can no longer afford to have subpar look and feel.
Most individual web users make credibility/trust judgments based on the look and feel of your Website.
55-60% of shopping cart visitors abandon the cart. On average over 50% of web users "bounce" – leave a site without looking at another page. Web marketers need to take steps to make their sites "sticky". 
Web marketers must analyze their statistics and do user testing to see where users are having difficulty and correct these obstacles.

Key points from our analysis 

Graphic ads are invisible to users. Don’t put important content on or near a graphic. 
Sites with many links must have an extremely clear organization and navigation. 
Be sure that all paths lead users in a desired direction. If you can’t “feel the funnel” when browsing the site, something is wrong.

How to Make Things Simple on Your Site

Clear Navigation: Make sure menu choices don't use jargon and don't have too many choices on one page!
Effective Use of Graphics: Make sure graphics serve a purpose. Beware of "banner blindness" – don't place important buttons as graphics. Make sure graphics are top notch – users will create instant impressions regarding quality of the site/company as a whole based on one glance at a photo. Use captions. Users looking at graphics will ALWAYS read the captions.
Watch Users: Do formal or informal user testing, use the best analytics packages to note what users do on your site. You will quickly see where they are confused or off-task. Fix those areas of the site.
Content: Don't use too much content! Use content to clarifiy the primary message quickly. Bullets, headlines, linking text, and highlighted text get read. Block paragraphs do not. Don't let company departments make a dumping ground of your site, stay focused on the marketing message and use a blog for dynamic, newsy content.
Be consistent: Don't put common controls on the page in places people don't expect!

		<itunes:summary>How to use your web stats and analytics software to understand visitiors and respond to their needs.

 
Resources

Google Analytics (formerly Urchin): A free and top-notch analytics package that integrates with your Google Adwords campaigns. Note that an active Google Adwords campaign is not a mandatory requirement for using this software.
Webtrends: A package that has matured over the years and is now an excellent, comprehensive analytics solution. This is a paid solution with pricing tiers from standard to advanced marketing to e-commerce.
Clicktracks: A great package for getting a visual sense of user behavior on your site. Excellent for executive overviews.
Omniture: This is a very complete solution for analytics, the package the big boys use with customers like Walmart. GM and eBay. It costs more with programs starting at 1500 per month but you get what you pay for — this is a deep analytics solution.

Action Plan

Insist on great analytics software – stats that “come with” hosting packages are often inadequate
Set and monitor goals for your Website
Create an ROI tracking system based on stats
Measure conversions using stats
Track customer behavior and respond to their wishes!
