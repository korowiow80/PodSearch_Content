     <title>Episode 47--X &amp; Y On The Fly--Parenthood:  The Greatest Birth Control Method Ever</title> 
      
<itunes:subtitle>Okay, it's been almost four years since the subject of 'kids' has been brought up on this show, and there's plenty more to discuss nowadays.  After all, having children changes the dynamics of an allegedly romantic relationship between a man and a woman, so this is important stuff.  And don't 'kid yourself' (pun intended), what's talked about in this episode matters A LOT whether you're a parent just yet or not.  Be sure to 'like' our newly-updated Facebook Page at http://www.facebook.com/scotandemily.  Grab a free special report on reconnecting with 'old flames' on Facebook when you do.</itunes:subtitle>

     <title>Episode 44--X &amp; Y On The Fly--Hey Jealousy</title> 
      
<itunes:subtitle>Where are you?  Who were you with?  What's more annoying, having to ask questions like that or being on the receiving end of them?  Well, in this episode, besides proving that the show is still in production after all, Scot and Emily give you the lowdown on jealousy.  What is it anyway?  And how can you tell for sure if those jealous feelings you've been having are reasonable?  Every angle is explored, including what causes 'habitual jealousy' (along with what cures it), and what to do if you find yourself with an overly jealous partner.  Guys, if you're ready to confidently approach high quality women, but don't necessarily want to be a pickup artist, be on the lookout for The Man's Approach...coming soon:  http://www.themansapproach.com</itunes:subtitle>

     <title>Episode 43--X &amp; Y On The Fly--You Can't Live With 'Em, And You Can't Shoot 'Em</title> 
      
<itunes:subtitle>Let's face it, whether you're a man or a woman there are things about the opposite gender that tend to drive you nuts.  Why do they do all that annoying stuff?  Well, in this episode you'll get straight answers once and for all from both Scot and Emily...even though they may not be the answers you want to hear.  Yet the fact remains that we somehow still love MOTOS (Members Of The Opposite Sex) anyway, don't we?  All of this nonsense can only make for a particularly spirited and humorous episode this time around.  Guys, the new program on how to understand women better is Chick Whispering, which you can find at http://www.chickwhispering.com.  Ladies, unravel the mysteries of men with Emily's Attraction Makeover program:  http://www.attraction-makeover.com</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>Let's face it, whether you're a man or a woman there are things about the opposite gender that tend to drive you nuts.  Why do they do all that annoying stuff?  Well, in this episode you'll get straight answers once and for all from both Scot and Emily...even though they may not be the answers you want to hear.  Yet the fact remains that we somehow still love MOTOS (Members Of The Opposite Sex) anyway, don't we?  All of this nonsense can only make for a particularly spirited and humorous episode this time around.  Guys, the new program on how to understand women better is Chick Whispering, which you can find at http://www.chickwhispering.com.

     <title>Episode 33--X &amp; Y On The Fly--Who's Got It Harder In The Dating World, Men Or Women?</title> 
      
<itunes:subtitle>Emily and Scot are back with another mano-a-mano discussion on a truly controversial topic.  So which gender has the more difficult time when it comes to dating?  Listen in as Scot gets some outside opinions on the matter to start out with. From there, prepare to be surprised and challenged by what you hear, because as usual nothing is left on the table and no stone is left unturned.  Do we finally get a good, bitter argument outta these two this time?  Well, of course not...but at least you can predict there'll be an Episode 34 that way.</itunes:subtitle>

<itunes:subtitle>Special Guest David Wygant (www.deservewhatyouwant.com/wygant).  Why is it so many people can't stay attracted to someone who used to seem so hot to them?

<itunes:subtitle>Special Guests Jon and Laurie Weiss (www.deservewhatyouwant.com/happy).  We all know that men and women are supposed to be 'happy' together.  But what does that <i>mean</i>?  Emily and Scot look at the big picture, welcoming some gold-plated advice from a pair of guests who happen to have nearly fifty years' worth of experience at both relationship coaching AND relationship happiness.  Don't miss this chance to hear the voice of real experience (and a very bad Regis Philbin impersonation).</itunes:subtitle>

<itunes:subtitle>Finally...something the 'perfectly imperfect' co-hosts don't exactly agree on.  Emily thinks that men should give women LOTS of flowers, early and often in a relationship.  Scot, while not exactly against giving women flowers altogether, has a completely different outlook on the subject.  No guests or 'man-on-the-street' interviews in this episode, just the two hosts mano-a-mano.  Tune in for something completely different and get ready to be fully polarized...whether these two 'kiss and make up' at the end or not.</itunes:subtitle>
