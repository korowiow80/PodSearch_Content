			<description>The Guys Outta Brooklyn return to their upbringing when they welcome modern-day horror movie host Lord Blood Rah to discuss the origins, history, and resurgence of the American Horror Movie Host tradition! Of course, this being a guest host episode of Better in the Dark, it soon morphs into a freewheeling discussion of the state of horror movies in general. It's almost two hours of fun and frights in the BITD manner! Plus, the forgotten blaxploitation mummy epic, why Dr. Frankenstein always has the upper hand when other mad scientists host tea parties, and why it might be a good thing that Guillermo del Toro isn't adapting Lovecraft.

			<guid>http://earth-2.net/podcasts/betterinthedark/episodes/betterinthedark_117.mp3</guid>
			<description>Throughout their broadcast history, Derrick and Thomas have made reference to a particular director they revere as one of the greatest of Great, Great Men. And now they've finally gotten around to devoting an entire episode to the man who embodied the esthetic of the outsider, a man who felt at home in times of trouble and strife, the man for who the phrase "Man's Director" was coined: Sam Peckinpah. Join the Guys Outta Brooklyn as they discuss the career of one of their favorite filmmakers, his turbulent life, and speculate on how he would thrive in a later era of Hollywood. Plus, why Tom feels The Grifters is not true to the Jim Thompson book, Derrick goes off on a rant concerning the state of screenwriting today, and what episode wouldn't be complete without impromptu singing?

			<description>The scalpels are out, the body is on the table, and it's time for The Boys Outta Brooklyn to figure out why another media body is on the slab! Join Tom and Derrick as they examine the failure of DC Comics and Warner Brothers to rise to the challenge Marvel has been making towards them for the last few years, and why their bids to create a new franchise - from this summer's generic Green Lantern to the rather wrongheaded attempt to recast Wonder Woman as the heroine of a David E. Kelley action comedy to proposed movies with The Flash (it's Se7en crossed with CSI) and Hawkman - have met with lukewarm response at best. Plus, Muppets in the boardroom, the question of whether X-ray vision can be used to stalk, and why the Ultimate Universe is like an appendix.

The Guys Outta Brooklyn discuss Bruce Campbell's entire career, dissecting all of his hits on the big and small screens, and try to explain why Campbell deserves to be revered as a true genre movie icon. Plus Tom and Derrick discuss their recent travels to such places as Pulp Ark and Larry Fine's Birthplace, somehow end up in a digression where they sing the praises of Doctor Who's Rory, and manage to sing from memory the theme song for Jack of All Trades!

Join Tom and Derrick as they discuss the all-too-small body of work of Sergio Leone, from The Dollars Trilogy to his handful of uncredited turns behind the typewriter and camera to his grand crime epic Once Upon a Time in America. The guys also spend some time discussing the other great filmmaker of the modern Western: Sam Peckinpah.

			<description>Last year, in the first episode of BITD hosted by Earth-2.net, Tom and Derrick dubbed the summer of 2009 "The Summer of Meh." Well, summer 2010 is as far away from that as possible -- so much so that The Boys Outta Brooklyn have to devote two episodes to cover it all! In the first half, they cover the comic booky flicks Kick-Ass, Iron Man 2, The Expendables, and Machete; announce the winner of our Summer o' Cowboy Fun Contest; answer viewer mail about Matt Helm, Judd Winick and Quantum of Boredo -- I Mean Solace; and have a rollicking discussion about movie adaptation of pulp properties. Plus, a brand new version of the theme song by B Hyphen, which writer thinks Superman is like Brian Azzarello, and news about how you can participate in Episode 100!

This year, however, they welcome the Patriarch of the First Family of BITD (and host of Dread Media), Desmond Reddick, to join in. The results are an international six pack of horror flicks ranging from the Finish period piece Sauna to the New Zealand (pretending to be Nebraska) should've-been-a-period-piece Strange Behavior to the Spanish chiller Who Could Kill a Child.

			<description>In episodes 28 and 31, Tom and Derrick celebrated the anniversary of one of their favorite television series: Doctor Who. Since then, enough changes have occurred that The Boys Outta of Brooklyn have enlisted the aid of Views from the Longbox semi-lackey / co-host (and perpetual Tom nemesis) Shag to provide an overview of the end of the Tennant era and the inaugural season of the 11th Doctor, Matt Smith! The trio discusses - and sometimes argues over - such subjects as the magnificence of Donna, Rose vs. Amy, the identity of The Dream Lord, the value of Russell T. Davies' Whedon-ization of the series, the Skittles Daleks, and other juicy topics. Plus, what is The Carey Mulligan Road? What is The Caruso Box, and why is Christopher Eccleston stuck in it? What if Brian Cox and Dougray Scott owned a bar together? Podcasts with bowties are cool, so get to clicking!</description>

			<description>The latest edition of Better in the Dark brings an icon of drive-in cinema before the docket! Tom and Derrick examine the influence American original Roger Corman had on Hollywood as both a director and a producer in a career that spans five decades. From his Poe adaptations to the long list of creative types he influenced to the series of giant animal movies that prowl the fringes of Syfy, Corman's entire life is put under the microscope. Plus Tom and Derrick mourn Gary Coleman, why you should never patronize a business run by Klaus Kinski, and why a certain film should've been renamed Murder Hyundais!

Learn how Cubby Broccoli's former producing partner bought Don Hamilton's hardboiled operative to get in on the cash cow he initially spurned, and ended up trapped in the Hell that was Dean Martin's making. It's the movie series that managed to misuse Ann-Margret, and Tom and Derrick suffer through every last film. Plus Asian characters with silly names, the Boys get angry over the tragedy of Sharon Tate, and enough imitations of a drunk Dean Martin to last a lifetime!

Tom and Derrick discuss the comedy team's history, the nature of their humor, and make recommendations for where to begin your education in Marx-ism. And, since this is an episode of BITD, the discussion does get a little tangenty with talk of Jerry Seinfeld, public school memories, sitcoms, and the evil that is The Hottest Scientologist.

They examine how Bond was re-imagined for the 21st century, and how the unconventional choice of Daniel Craig fit the remit for change. They really like one film, hate the other one, and then talk about the present situation with MGM and what it bodes for the world's longest-running movie franchise. All this, plus a little disagreement on the hotness of Karen Gillan, a major announcement, and the revelation of what the letters in QUANTUM stand for.

Plus, because we never stay on point when we've got a guest star, the guys get to talking about scripted "reality shows," the massive ego of Steven Seagal, and why moviemakers don't know jack about cyber-terrorists.

Along the way, The Guys Outta Brooklyn discuss the importance of Robert Englund in creating this horror icon, how Wes Craven attempted to kill the franchise repeatedly, and how the films, as bad as they got, never lost money. Plus, we find a connection between the series and the ultra-obscure Adam Sandler vehicle The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz, address a great disservice done to Curtis Mayfield, and do something at the very end of the episode that might upset our friend Kelen "B-Hyphen" Conley.

			<description>Spring is in the air, and you know what that means: it's time for the annual tradition where the Guys Outta Brooklyn dig into their vaults and pull out a six-pack of little-seen and forgotten films for their Obscure Movie Episode! 2010's batch includes the sequel to Black Belt Jones most people swear doesn't exit, the sequel many Rocky Horror Picture Show fans wish didn't exist, the only place where you can see the wife of John Denver being turned into a human hood ornament, and an absolutely insane blaxploitation comedy where a female motorcycle gang faces off against a Colonel Sanders look-alike plotting to take over Watts! Plus, Tom and Derrick pay tribute to Falco, and we address a letter about That Episode. Don't be a dead end, deadbeat, downbeat Mister, get to clicking!</description>

			<guid>http://earth-2.net/podcasts/betterinthedark/episodes/betterinthedark_077.mp3</guid>
			<description>In their effort to present the most comprehensive coverage of 1960s spy culture, Tom and Derrick begin their examination of some of the spies who gave Bond a run for his money, beginning with the cerebral, eccentric, and suave Derek Flint. Join the Boys From Brooklyn as they look at the adventures of the renaissance man that James Coburn turned into a cult hero, tracing his adventures from Our Man Flint to In Like Flint to the highly obscure, near-forgotten (and with good reason) Flint television pilot, Our Man Flint: Dead on Target. Plus a preview of other episodes in the Rivals of Bond series, Derrick wants Yvonne Craig to shake her money-maker, and a look at the two Flint movies (one written by Harlan Ellison) that never got to the screen.

			<guid>http://earth-2.net/podcasts/betterinthedark/episodes/betterinthedark_076.mp3</guid>
			<description>It's our periodic review episode, where the Guys Outta Brooklyn discuss such recent flicks as Legion, Sherlock Holmes, Moon, Avatar, and others. But it's when Tom and Derrick reach into the mailbag and answer a question about the famous "put on the costume" quote from another podcast that prompts a nearly half-hour, heated talk on comic fan behavior that is bound to cause shockwaves throughout the podosphere. And if that's not enough, well, ask Tom about the Smallville episode "Absolute Justice." This could very well be one of those landmark moments in the podcast's history.

From the original film that became a surprise hit to the tame television series to the remake featuring Samuel L. Jackson, we trace the entire history of the character that Richard Roundtree made an icon. Plus, in keeping with this year being our weirdest ever, Kelen gets five minutes to rant about Spider-Man, we debut the latest version of our theme song, and the guys somehow give birth to the new character sensation of 2010: Lil' Blade!

			<description>By popular demand, your favorite cinematic jurists are back, and this time they've got New Jersey's own in their sights! Tom and Derrick evaluate the life and times of Kevin Smith, and try to determine if he is on the straight and narrow or walking down a potentially disastrous road. The Guys Outta Brooklyn defend the much-maligned Jersey Girl, talk about the hazard of making Jay and Silent Bob main characters, question whether Smith's relationship with Bob Weinstein helps or hurts him, and look at other issues. Plus, the first and maybe only BITD discussion on religion, and now waaaaaaaaay outdated speculation on Spider-Man 4. It's better than a stink palm, so get to clicking!</description>

But before it's done, the Boys Outta Brooklyn will find themselves engaging in the first — and maybe last — edition of Better in the Dark Fight Night, featuring a selection of action movie stars... and Tom Savini. Plus Derrick tells us why Wes Craven deserves a daily kick in the ass, and Tom has fun with public domain blaxploitation films. Also, there's gratuitous Kristen Bell talk. (It wouldn't be an episode without gratuitous Kristen Bell talk, right?) This is one of the weirdest — and maybe funniest — episodes in the podcast's history, so get to clicking!</description>

Plus, the Superman films we didn't get (here's a hint: be happy we got what we got), Derrick defends Superman's right to stalk Lois, and Mike really doesn't like Kate Bosworth much... or at all.

Derrick chooses three films from the 70s including one of Steven Spielberg's first, and a creepy Guignol tale featuring a young Jodie Foster. And Tom chooses such gems as a high school ghost story, and a "documentary" that follows an aspiring serial killer as he plans his night of grue!

This time up, it's Quentin Tarantino who's under the microscope. Tom and Derrick examine Tarantino's use of cultural touchstones, whether some of his set pieces are homages or rip-offs, whether his frequent appearances have served to sour the public separate from the films themselves, and other outstanding issues revolving around the man who made being a film geek cool. Plus we review Inglourious Basterds, and make suggestions as to what Tarantino should pursue for future projects. It'll get medieval on you ass, so get to clicking!</description>

The Boys Outta Brooklyn argue that the Brosnan films represented a hard reboot that predated the Craig reboot years later, and examine a great debut picture (GoldenEye) and a lousy, lousy follow-up (Tomorrow Never Dies). We also discuss how the loss of the lawsuit with MGM-UA affected how the Brosnan films were written and produced, the value of fresh directorial blood, and a flaw in "The Commentary Script." Plus Tom likes Michelle Yeoh... a lot, the revelation of the Peckinpah-Bond connection, and Derrick talks about his nominee for worst Bond henchman. We are inwincable, so get to clicking!</description>

			<description>In this episode, The Guys Outta Brooklyn take a look at one of the great cinematic icons of the 80's, Sylvester Stallone, through one of his greatest characters, John Rambo. From the sheer good luck of First Blood being an action movie hit to the movement of the character into super-heroic territory and ultimate oblivion, Tom and Derrick will show how Rambo's filmic odyssey reflected what Stallone himself went through, and how he needed to go through the leaner years of the 90's to make the fiercer yet humbler Rambo. Plus Derrick talks about his brush with Richard Crenna, gratuitous Stallone impersonations, and even more gratuitous talk of G.I. Joe and the wacked-out martial arts non-classic Gymkata.

			<guid>http://archive.org/download/Bitd48/BITD48.mp3</guid>
			<description>In a change of pace episode, The Boys Outta Brooklyn move away from the movies to focus on the places you go to see them, movie theaters! During a freeform conversation, Tom and Derrick reminisce about their own experiences going to the movies, discuss the way the movie theater business has changed, the disappearance of the independant and single screen movie venues, and how the rise of home media formats such as videotape and DVDs may have eroded audience behavior. Plus Judd Apatow and Universal treat our guys to free popcorn, and a tangent involving fanfiction. It's a matinee complete with trailers and shorts, so get to clicking!</description>

			<description>Our survey of The Bond Films arrives at a major turning point as The Boys Outta Brooklyn reviews the first two movies to feature Roger Moore. It's the edge of some very, very dark territory with some seriously goofy films (including one Tom subtitles 'Black People Hate Bond'), but they do the usual cool eyed dissection. Plus Derrick says something so hilarious it makes Tom speechless and we rant about our choice for the worst Bond Girl ever.

It's a strange period just before Moore comes on-board, and the Guys Outta Brooklyn dissect these two films with the flair you've come to expect. Plus, we explore the connection between Blofeld and Lex Luthor, use the phrase 'it makes no sense' more often than anybody anywhere on this planet, and world premiere our brand new Theme Song by our very own B-Hyphen.

And even though all of these films are depressing, Tom and Derrick take the time to celebrate the joy of that 80's cheese classic The Last Dragon!

			<description>It was bound to happen, and here's where the Guys Outta Brooklyn are finally brought to their knees by the crapitude that is the 'psychedelic cinema' version of Casino Royale, a film so nonsensical, so awful that Tom and Derrick are near speechless! Of course, before they descend into the all-star train wreck, they discuss and dissect the Sean Connery opus/Japan travelog You Only Live Twice as part of our ongoing look at the James Bond series. Plus Tom wants you to pet his kitty, Derrick reminisces about syndicated television and we try to figure out how a man can hand wash his own intestines.

Each of these trio of films are very different in tone and approach, and Tom and Derrick will compare and contrast them all.

			<description>The Boys From Brooklyn share their love of one of the great horror actors of all time (not to mention actor, period) by looking at the seven films that comprise The MGM Screen Icon Set for Vincent Price! From the stultifying boredom that is Twice Told Tales to the sheer bleak hardcore genius of The Witchfinder General, Tom and Derrick discuss the last true horror films of Price's career. Plus we give our props to the greatest theological serial killer of all time, Dr. Phibes--and try to find out what happened to his super-sexy assistant Virginia 'Vulnavia' North, show reverence towards the late British director Michael Reeves and review a film neither man knew existed prior to the release of this set. It's a celebration of a true American talent--so click on, Macduff!</description>

			<description>Thomas and Derrick takes a swashbuckling trip down memory lane as they discuss the Sinbad trilogy of Ray Harryhausen! From The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad to Sinbad and The Eye of The Tiger, the Boys Outta Brooklyn go in-depth on why stopmotion animation rocks, why John Phillip Law's version of Sinbad is a dick, and why Caroline Munro is the hottest woman ever! (7/9 Addendum: Shortly after posting this episode, we learned that Kerwin Matthews, who is discussed in this episode, passed away. This episode is respectfully dedicated to his memory)</description>

			<description>Once more with more enthusiasm than facts (although we're getting better), Tom and Derrick spend an hour looking at George Romero's Dead series. From Night of The Living Dead to Land of The Dead, we examine the entire canon, including the remakes. Plus, the guys from Brooklyn tackle the eternal question of 'Canada--what gives?' (Just a heads up: There is a drop in audio levels at around the twenty minute mark. We're sorry about that, and are working to assure a higher quality presentation in the future.)</description>

			<title>Episode 04. Welcome To Our May, June and July 2007 Preview--Now With More Digressions!!!</title>
			<guid>http://www.archive.org/download/BetterInTheDarkEpisodeFourMayToJune2007Previews/Better_In_The_Dark_4.mp3</guid>
			<description>Once more with more enthusiasm than factual information--and with our ability to be foul mouthed restored--Tom and Derrick look at some genre movies that will be released through the middle of summer.... At least that's what we're supposed to do. In fact, we go off on a fistful of tangents. Join us as we give our feelings on the Don Imus situation, blast one film for its excessive violence before drooling over another due to its abundance of sexy young women, talk about how our DVD buying habits change, explain why Tom doesn't want to see Pirates, tell stories about celebrities with funny voices, hear Derrick say 'Yo, Dog,' and go off on rants sure to piss off fans of Transformers. Plus Tom does imitations of gilbert Gottfried and Keith Richards. Yeah, we know...but listen to it anyway...!</description>
