<p>Fr. Hemann was ordained to the Diaconate on May 3, 1984 at St. Peters Basilica in Rome, Italy. He celebrated his ordination to the priesthood on July 20, 1985 at Corpus Christi Church in Fort Dodge, Iowa. <br/>
<br/>
Fr. Hemann's assignments included: Holy Spirit (Carroll, Ia), St. Mary (Storm Lake, Ia), Little Portion Community (Eureka Springs, AR), Sacred Heart (Boone, Ia), Blessed Sacrament (Sioux City, Ia), St. Anthony (Hospers, Ia), St. Cecelia and St. Joseph (Sanborn and Hartley, Ia), and Marian Hall (Sioux City, Ia). On July 17, 2001, he was assigned as Pastor to Sacred Heart in Ida Grove, Ia. Then one year later took on Our Lady of Good Councel in Holstein Ia. In these assignments, Fr. Hemann has been fully engaged in every kind of pastoral activity proper to a diocesan priest. These assignments have also included 10 years of teaching in both high schools and grade schools. He also has enjoyed working with the youth of the parishes, starting successful youth groups in Boone, Sioux City and Sanborn/Hartley and now in Ida Grove and Holsten. As much as he enjoys working with the youth, Father David is a priest who works well with people of all ages from conception to death to eternal life.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to his regular priestly activities, Fr. Hemann has been engaged in a music ministry before and throughout his priesthood. He believes that music is the language of the people. Father David's music has lent itself to involvement in a number of nation-wide ministries of giving retreats, missions and concerts. One highlight was being a featured artist in the presence of Mother Teresa of Calcutta at the first World Youth Day in Rome in 1984 at the English speaking session at Santa Sabina. During 2000-2001, he was released for the period of one year from his regular priestly duties to pursue ministry around the diocese preaching on the themes of spirituality, discipleship, prayer and vocations. Each weekend was spent in a different parish putting on a mission which included regular weekend masses and homilies, a Sunday Evening Concert of original music and sharing the gospel, a Monday Evening talk on &quot;Pruning and Fruitfulness in the Catholic Life&quot; in the context of a reconciliation service, and a Tuesday Evening Healing Mass.<br/>
Father David has had the privilege of co-hosting with Msgr. Michael Heras a thirteen part teaching/musical series on EWTN called &ldquo;Alive with Baptism.&rdquo; The series itself won the UCMVA 2003 UNITY AWARD for BEST RELIGIOUS TELEVISION PRESENTATION FOR CATHOLIC EVANVELIZATION OF THE YEAR. <br/>
Father Hemann will soon appear on the EWTN series called BACKSTAGE which features Catholic musicians from around the country.<br/>

<p>Nancy Krebs started singing at age 3, and hasn't stopped yet! When she was 12, she began playing the violin. That soon led to the guitar and eventually the mandolin. In high school, Nancy began to write songs for Folk Masses and other church services. Ignoring a strong calling to compose full time, she actively pursued a career in theatre, film, radio and TV. </p>
<p>Nancy has performed with professional regional theatres such as Center Stage, Alaska Repertory Theatre and Meadowbrook Theatre. She was a member of the Emmy award winning TV series for PBS called Once Upon a Town. In 1980 she joined the theatre faculty of the Baltimore School for the Arts and since 1981 she has been a member of the Interact Story Theatre. </p>
<p>In 1994 Nancy's original calling to compose meditational songs of a spiritual nature could be ignored no longer. Turning the process over to God, Nancy spent 4 years composing music and began recording in 1998. With the guidance and support of her husband, Pete Baden, she has recorded and produced 5 albums; all of which are receiving airplay throughout the world. &quot;What a journey&quot;, she says. &quot;God has prepared me for this role all these years. When I look back it's just like a quilt. This is just what I should be doing.&quot;<br/>

<p>As a Catholic singer-songwriter, Annie Karto hopes to stir the flame in the Catholic Church through the power of God&rsquo;s great gift of music. The healing mercy of God is the heart of her music ministry, along with singing of the beautiful sacraments of the Church, and honoring the Blessed Mother Mary. She has a desire to encourage priests in their vocations and has been blessed to share the song she received, &ldquo;You Are A Priest Forever,&rdquo; to many priests across the country.</p>
<p>Being firmly rooted in the Catholic faith, and in complete obedience to the Magisterium of the Church and the Holy Father, Annie belongs to a lay apostolate, the Eucharistic Apostles of the Divine Mercy, an outreach of the Marians of the Immaculate Conception, Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Together they strive to promote Eucharistic Adoration, bring the Divine Mercy message to a hurting world, form small faith groups called cenacles, which meet to pray for vocations to the priesthood and religious life, pray for an end to abortion, and study Sacred Scripture, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, and the diary of St. Mar&iacute;a Faustina. They also encourage praying the Diving Mercy Chaplet for the sick and the dying.</p></span></span>]]>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Music has been a part of Margo&rsquo;s life from the very beginning. With talented musicians for parents, a deep love of music was passed on to her. As a teenager Margo found herself using music as an expression of her thoughts, emotions, and faith in God. At a young age she played a variety of instruments including cello, guitar, and the piano. Her love for music and the Lord led her to sing in the church choir and then later to play keyboard and sing in the church&rsquo;s contemporary group. Many of the songs from her repetoire have been used as a part of worship, Baptisms, Confirmations, healing services, anniversary celebrations, Holy Hours, and Reconciliation services.<br/>
<br/>
She shared her talent and love of music with piano students and her children. As time went on, her desire to share her love for the Lord and His love for us through songwriting increased. Seeking God&rsquo;s will, she prayed that if it was His desire she would like to play keyboard and sing in a contemporary Christian band that would be used as a ministry to reach many inside and outside of the church. At the same time a talented singer/songwriter musician named Bernie Antkowiak was praying for a keyboard player for his music group. The Lord answered both prayers, and the band Pure Heart for Him responded to the desire God had placed in their hearts. Sharing God&rsquo;s message of love they played for many venues such as Christian coffee houses, prayer breakfasts, Christian Music Connection (CMC) Fest, River Valley Ranch, ProLife events, fund-raisers, The Catholic Corner Books and Gifts, healing services, Marriage Encounter events, and Reconciliation services to name a few. The CD, &ldquo;Carry On&rdquo; is a compilation of some of the songs Pure Heart for Him shares during their musical ministry.<br/>

Songwriting and co-producing a new CD has been on Margo&rsquo;s heart for the past couple of years. By working with Michael Salacuse outside of <city w:st="on">
<place w:st="on">Nashville</place>
</city>, John Grant in Baltimore, Pure Heart for Him, and many other talented musicians and singers the CD, &ldquo;Because You Love Me&rdquo; has become a reality.

Today, music has certainly made its mark in Valerie's career path.  She has been honored to perform at the Lincoln Memorial Center and Catholic Marketing Network Showcase in King of Prussia. She is comfortable in front of 10 to 1000 people, playing styles such as folk, country, classic rock, big band and inspirational. Valerie has been able to combine her years of classical training with a contemporary sound that tantalizes the ears. Her typical venues include church services, concerts, festivals, restaurants and retirement homes&#8230; yet still she finds time to dabble in song-writing.  

As a songwriter, Valerie Von Fange taps into the fullness of Christ's teachings, with themes such as Our Lady, purgatory, the Eucharist and the Saints. In 1993, she released Thy Kingdom Come, a project inspired by a religious pilgrimage to Medjugorje, Bosnia. In 2001, she helped arrange and sang vocal backup as well as played keyboard on Rachel, a pro-life song that was aired on EWTN&#8217;s &#8220;Life on the Rock.&#8221; In 2005, Valerie co-produced and released her latest CD, Steadfast Love, an eclectic mix of Latin, bluegrass, country, folk and Celtic songs that reinforce the richness of committed love. Steadfast Love (recorded in Nashville, TN) has been receiving nationwide media attention from sources such as The National Catholic Register (Issue: Feb 2006), Faith & Family (Issue: Fall 2006), Sacred Heart Radio and EWTN Radio (AKA: Catholic Jukebox).</span></span>]]>

&nbsp; and fellowship. The festival will start Friday night, with the&nbsp; &quot;CrossRoads Sound Check.&quot; a looser, louder, somewhat less<br/>

<p>Recognizing the power of music to encourage and evangelize, GrapeVine&rsquo;s second mission is to expose this music to as many people as possible, that their hearts may be touched and encouraged by the Gospel message it proclaims.</p>

<p>THE COOL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SOUNDS OF RISE HAVE RETURNED!!<br/>
After almost 3 years in the making, the new CD, Stand The Line, from the Catholic band RISE is out!<br/>
<br/>
We recently had the exclusive opportunity to sample 3 songs from the new CD and the guys have definitely found their sound! With the addition of new drummer Mike Partain, the guys, Steve Rogers (lead singer, writer) Mike Beloud (guitar) and Jorge Ramirez (bass) have completed songs that can be described in one word, REAL! <br/>
<br/>
From the song &ldquo;Maybe Someday&rdquo;, a true Rock n' Praise tune, to the Acoustic heartfelt song &ldquo;Half Way&rdquo;, the guys have definitely been touched by the Holy Spirit in creating music that will be loved by teens as well as adults. <br/>
<br/>
RISE has also added a new level to Christian music with a song called &ldquo;Cancers Creation.&rdquo; We have never heard a song like this in Christian or secular music. Steve Rogers bravely opens his soul and writes about his experience with cancer and the guys presentation of this song will have you by your heart strings. <br/>
<br/>
The new CD is true to Rise&rsquo;s Rock n' Roll roots, from the sound and feel of Bon Jovi to the writing and harmonies of the Eagles. Stand The Line is a CD for those who miss the genuine sound of a classic Rock band blended with a strong love and devotion for our Lord. These guys have nailed it! In the words of the Righteous Brothers; &quot;If there's a Rock n' Roll heaven, you can bet RISE will be headlining! <br/>

RISE BIOGRAPHY:<br/>
What do you get when you mix a bunch of 80's rockers, only now they are a Police Officer, the president and CEO of an international tech company, a sales manager for an industrial materials manufacturer and a general contractor? and the only thing these four individuals had in common was music and Jesus Christ!<br/>
<br/>
YOU GET RISE! The Christian Rock and Roll Ministry that has touched tens of thousands of people from around the world since the release of their debut CD &quot;Through the Son.&quot; Now available, the latest release from Rise, &quot;Stand the Line.&quot;<br/>

After almost 3 years in the making, the new CD, Stand The Line, from the Catholic band RISE is out! We recently had the exclusive opportunity to sample 3 songs from the new CD and the guys have definitely found their sound! With the addition of new drummer Mike Partain, the guys, Steve Rogers (lead singer, writer) Mike Beloud (guitar) and Jorge Ramirez (bass) have completed songs that can be described in one word, REAL! From the song &amp;ldquo;Maybe Someday&amp;rdquo;, a true Rock n' Praise tune, to the Acoustic heartfelt song &amp;ldquo;Half Way&amp;rdquo;, the guys have definitely been touched by the Holy Spirit in creating music that will be loved by teens as well as adults. RISE has also added a new level to Christian music with a song called &amp;ldquo;Cancers Creation.&amp;rdquo; We have never heard a song like this in Christian or secular music. Steve Rogers bravely opens his soul and writes about his experience with cancer and the guys presentation of this song will have you by your heart strings. The new CD is true to Rise&amp;rsquo;s Rock n' Roll roots, from the sound and feel of Bon Jovi to the writing and harmonies of the Eagles. Stand The Line is a CD for those who miss the genuine sound of a classic Rock band blended with a strong love and devotion for our Lord. These guys have nailed it! In the words of the Righteous Brothers; &amp;quot;If there's a Rock n' Roll heaven, you can bet RISE will be headlining! (This update is courtesy of Gary Gersin at SacredHeartRadio.net.) RISE BIOGRAPHY: What do you get when you mix a bunch of 80's rockers, only now they are a Police Officer, the president and CEO of an international tech company, a sales manager for an industrial materials manufacturer and a general contractor? and the only thing these four individuals had in common was music and Jesus Christ! YOU GET RISE! The Christian Rock and Roll Ministry that has touched tens of thousands of people from around the world since the release of their debut CD &amp;quot;Through the Son.&amp;quot; Now available, the latest release from Rise, &amp;quot;Stand the Line.&amp;quot; </itunes:summary><feedburner:origLink>http://www.bigcontact.com/sacredheartradio/rise-2</feedburner:origLink></item>

<p><br/>
In the fall of 2002 began the journey that is Friday Mourning. Through many musicians and heartaches the band humbly came to fruition, stopping at every rest area along the way. What was a hobby of sorts quickly became a way of life in a matter of months. </p>
<p>Forsaking all, imbued with a calling, the five member band decided to start walking with thumbs raised high in the air. It was not long after, that national acts such as Ceili Rain, SonicFlood, and Switchfoot were stopping along the roadside to play a show with this up-and-coming band.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It was in east Ohio, on the hilltop known as Franciscan University that Friday Mourning began to flourish. From there it was out to Steubenville, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, across central Florida, and even as far West as St. Louis.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Since its inception the band has enjoyed countless blessings, a broken down van, lots of debt, sleep deprivation, but most of all its incredible fans. Regardless of where the band is, it seems the crowds are always the main attraction. Their excitement is only surpassed by their involvement in the performance itself. </p>
