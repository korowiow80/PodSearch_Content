<p>Diagnosed as a dyslexic, the youngest in a family of five, Jared struggled throughout the first phase of his life; searching for answers that would require him to look in places overlooked by most of society &#8211; the underworld of Africa.</p>
<p>With zero connections, very little money, and a driving passion to lift women out of poverty, oppression, and a demeaning way of life, he didn&#8217;t start a non-profit or launch a welfare system &#8211; <strong>he started a business</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Jared Angaza -</strong><em> We made a commitment early on that we’ll never treat our artisans as charity cases. We will not let their past define their future. We will give them a voice and a path to experiencing dignity.</em></p>
<p>In just a few short years, by teaching women life skills and business basics, Keza is not only changing the way the African woman view themselves, the company is also changing the fashion conscience and scene all across the map.</p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s reflection: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What&#8217;s your thought? Are non-profits the only way to do &#8220;ministry&#8221; and make a significant difference, or is there another way?</li>
<li>Is there a need you see, domestically or globally, that tugs on your soul and could use an entrepreneurial touch?</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://www.4pointscoaching.com/testonly/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/denied.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-10216" title="denied" src="http://www.4pointscoaching.com/testonly/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/denied.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="225" /></a>Doing my best to outrun the fleet of calories that seem to always chase after me, I found myself on the treadmill late Sunday afternoon listening to the latest podcast from my dear friend and mentor, Dan Miller.</p>
<p>For me,  treadmill time = learning time so I make it a habit of feeding my mind while I&#8217;m challenging my body.</p>
<p>Responding to a listener&#8217;s question, Dan mentioned something very poignant. Paraphrasing, he rhetorically asked, &#8220;What happens to dreams that are denied?&#8221;</p>
<p>The question stretches deeply because as he points out, a person&#8217;s dreams don&#8217;t simply go away. They can&#8217;t because they are a part of his or her DNA and are thus woven into the depths of their soul.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been privileged to work with people from many different walks who, (with the best of intentions), have shoved their dreams in the closest or have dismissed them as impractical and foolish, only to later suffer from the physical, spiritual, and emotional symptoms of a dream not embraced.</p>
<p>I remember working with David in Ohio who, for the majority of his working life, endured an excruciating professional existence because he believed that by denying his dreams, he was being responsible and realistic.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s Jacque in Tennessee. And, while she had a &#8220;secure&#8221; job for 20-plus years, because it ran in the opposite direction of any dream she ever had, the symptoms and compilations she experienced during her commute, made it almost unbearable.</p>
<p><strong>Today&#8217;s reflection:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Has someone encouraged you to set aside your dreams because of <em>reality</em> or <em>practicality </em>or have you convinced yourself to <em>ignore</em> or <em>stifle</em> the dreams that stir your spirit? If so, how is your body and spirit handling it?</li>
</ul>
