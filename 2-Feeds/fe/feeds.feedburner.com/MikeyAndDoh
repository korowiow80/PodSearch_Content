We were just uploading episode 13 and here we are with episode 14 and it’s a good one. This episode has everything; plastic testicles under trailer hitches, Farting Hitler, a real smart guy exposing himself to a bunch of blind people, Mikey’s got a tooth ache and if that’s not enough useless facts and information. And today not one, but two Classic Chuckles from Mikey. Yes even with a tooth ache he still wants us to laugh. So thanks for downloading, tell your friends and enjoy.&lt;br/&gt;Love,&lt;br/&gt;Mikey and Doh&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MikeyAndDoh/~4/461ML76azUY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

By the way here is something interesting, it turns out that it’s not just Austin Powers who likes to “Shag Baby!” The people in South Carolina love to shag and have been shaging for quite some time. In fact they love to shag so much, that the shag is their official state dance. Oh you were thinking about that other shag, weren’t you? Yes you were! You were thinking about the carpet. Well, it’s fun to shag no matter how you cut it.

We say, Hah to them! By the way, did you ever wonder who these people are that say these things? And where are they located? But enough about them, let us tell you what a great work of art we just cranked out, and speaking of cranking things out, episode 8 is not too shabby either. Truck stops, hookers, squealing pigs, whale dorks, dollar stores, colonoscopies, farting after colonoscopies, we covered it all. All it needs is a pair of discerning ears, like yours to appreciate the artistry within. Wow, what a load. Enjoy!&lt;br/&gt;Love,&lt;br/&gt;Mikey and Doh&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MikeyAndDoh/~4/U3Va7hpTM-o" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

It’s pretty much like all the other episodes, except there is a number 7 attached to it. Let’s see, how can we entice you to download and listen to this episode? We don’t talk about sex, we don’t give away any money, we don’t deal with politics, we don’t talk about religion, we don’t complain about gas prices, we just sit here for 52 minutes and just ooze entertainment like spilled honey on a Walmart shelf. Oh, and we have an old geezer, Robert Q. doing the news for us! If this didn’t entice you, you my friend are without a pulse. &lt;br/&gt;Love, &lt;br/&gt;Mikey and Doh&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MikeyAndDoh/~4/i816kkTur8U" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

Seriously, it contains so many magic tricks that will almost amaze you. Obviously you’ll have to listen to hear just how we did it. If an interview with a guy who dressed like a Mexican wrestler intrigues you, how about a guy who went Dr. Phil on Dr. Phil? How about seeing a huge orange UFO in the desert, in the middle of the night, while driving all alone? Pretty good huh? Still want more? Oh, we got a whole lot more in this magical episode for you baby.

Did you ever ride a stinky elephant with David Hasselhoff? By the way the preceding sentence does not need a punchline. Did you ever eat a spider as a late night snack? Oh yes you did! Do you own an old dickie? Those and many more questions will be answered in this exciting episode of Mikey and Doh. Thanks for downloading. If you chose not to download, you’re a load.

While recording it, Doh thought they had a stinker on their hands, but it’s not bad. Not bad at all. We’ve heard a lot worse. So, Did You Ever... have a dog with a farting problem? Did you ever eat 25,000 Big Macs? Not the computers, but the way. Did an alligator ever stick its tongue out at you? Did you ever lick your own elbow? If you find any of this is mildly intriguing, you’re as unbalanced as we are.

They also reveal where you can get scented candles, a nice nook, and a really cheap breakfast. And if that’s not enough, you’ll learn what Doh saw hanging above the front door of an ancient Pompeii cathouse. But wait there’s more! And to find out what, you’ll have to download the podcast.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MikeyAndDoh/~4/WQG8smheaZE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>
