	&lt;p&gt;GIVE IT TIME TO LOAD&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A late goal by substitute Matt Derbyshire gave Blackburn Rovers a 1-0 Premier League win over Fulham at Ewood Park.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Derbyshire finished with aplomb nine minutes after coming on, and he was assisted by fellow sub Carlos Villanueva, who played a delightful chipped pass for Roque Santa Cruz to nod down to the England Under-21 striker.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Chile playmaker Villanueva made the difference in the match, an inspired tactical move from Paul Ince that allowed Rovers to move away from the destructive style that could have seen them reduced to 10 men on more than one occasion.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Bullard was on the end of some particularly rough treatment, with a brutal Keith Andrews challenge and an Antipodean four-footed tackle by Brett Emerton and Ryan Nelsen arguably worthy of more than the yellow cards issued by Lee Probert.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;And later in the match, a retaliatory sliding assault by Stephen Warnock on John Pantsil somehow did not even draw a booking, even with Warnock glaring over his horizontal victim afterwards. Warnock was also spared by a technicality when he slid in late on Andrew Johnson - the ball had already gone out of play before he launched into the tackle.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Probert was consistently lenient, however. Pantsil escaped serious punishment for the foul on Keith Treacy that initially provoked Rovers, while Johnson was not even warned for kicking the ball away after he was caught offside.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Misdemeanours aside, it was an entertaining match that deserved more than its solitary goal.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Johnson nearly opened his Fulham account with a fourth-minute strike that the sprightly Paul Robinson tipped over in style, while a cameo of skill from Andrews saw him fire just wide in response to the Whites' early chance.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Jason Roberts, Morten Gamst Pedersen, Santa Cruz twice and Villanueva all had good occasions to score for the hosts, while Emerton sent a cross-shot off the post after a surging run from midfield.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Fulham used the ball more entertainingly, but the frustrating Bobby Zamora missed three very good headed opportunities with one particularly bad miss when found unmarked on the hour. Soon afterwards Johnson also should have scored when he ran clean through, but he shot low at Robinson who saved well.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As the game wore on, both sides became more stretched and the introduction of the creative Villanueva and natural finisher Derbyshire gave Ince a winning combination to stop a run of two consecutive defeats and - after conceding four goals in each of those two losses - a hard-earned clean sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The 28-year-old now faces up to four months on the sidelines which has come as a bitter pill for Ince to swallow. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"We gave him an injection a couple of weeks ago, hoping that would do the trick, but he's not getting there so we've no option but to put him under the knife," confirmed Ince. "It's a massive blow to us, and especially for the lad because he has been fantastic on and off the field. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"I gave him the responsibility of being vice-captain, which he took on board and he has been bubbly since I gave him that role. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"When you think about him, he is 28 now, but three or four years ago he would have been worth £15million or £16million. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"That's the type of player we're losing. It's a kick in the ribs, but we're going to have to get on with it. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"He is obviously devastated, which I can totally understand because he has been playing well. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"He is a unique player in what he does. There are not many of his like around. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"He is a special case, and that's why it's so disappointing to lose him." &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ince has also learned Australia midfielder Vince Grella, signed for £4million from Torino last month, will be out until the middle of next month with a calf injury. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"There are things that appear to be conspiring against us," added Ince. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Dunn has been missing since the draw with Hull on August 23 with an Achilles problem.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Scans have shown that the injury is serious and could sideline the midfielder for up to four months.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The news will come as a blow to Dunn who had started the season in fine style after being a series of injuries last term.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Dunn's injury comes at a bad time for Rovers as Paul Ince looks to get his side back on track after two heavy defeats to West Ham and Arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;A number of players have been on trial at Blackburn - Dutch winger Ugur Yildirim is the latest - but despite most being free agents, Williams said there were no plans to rush in any new additions. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The bottom line is we are not short on numbers in the squad and I think it is highly unlikely anyone will be coming in between now and the re-opening of the window," he said. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Of course, that could change if someone was presented to us that would really improve the team. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"But we are only four games in so there is no need to panic. The goals conceded are horrible but we will improve." &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Sivasspor boss Ozkan Dogan has confirmed that Rovers chief Paul Ince has enquired about 26-year-old, who recently asked for his contract to be cancelled to allow him to move on. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ince is still hoping to bolster his squad with free agents after a tricky start to the season in which Rovers have gained only four points from their opening four Premier League outings. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The New Zealander told the Lancashire Telegraph: "It has been really frustrating the last couple of weeks because the performances have been good but we are just leaking some horrendously soft goals. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"It is just finding the right balance at the moment. We are trying to play nice attacking football, going forward, and probably don't have the balance right at the moment and we are becoming a bit open. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Cavalier is a good word but in saying that it is probably my fault and I should probably keep the reins on the horses a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"We want to play, and play some entertaining football. It is a good attitude to have but we have been successful in the past by being tight at the back and we might need to get back to that."

The Togolese striker scored with a header, a right-footed penalty and a left-foot tap-in after rounding goalkeeper Paul Robinson late on, to walk away with the match ball.&lt;br&gt;
Robin van Persie earlier gave the visitors the lead following superb work by Theo Walcott.&lt;br&gt;
Arsenal looked devastating going forward - even with Cesc Fabregas not hitting the same heights as last season.&lt;br&gt;
Arsene Wenger suggested he might rest the 19-year-old Walcott following his hat-trick against Croatia, to minimize the risk of burn-out.&lt;br&gt;
However, given the absence of Samir Nasri, Tomas Rosicky and Abou Diaby, he had little choice but to play Walcott and the winger quickly vindicated his decision.&lt;br&gt;
Walcott is playing with such confidence that it came as little surprise to see him step away from two tackles in the eighth minute, accelerate towards the box and play a neat diagonal ball for Van Persie.&lt;br&gt;
The Dutchman took one touch to steady himself and another to send his left-foot shot past Paul Robinson.&lt;br&gt;
Walcott's dribbling ability saw him create numerous further openings for Adebayor, who, despite his hat-trick, did not play particularly well and repeatedly strayed offside.&lt;br&gt;
Arsenal's main man was Walcott, who proceeded to take numerous shots at goal, including an outrageous attempt at a Thierry Henry-style long-range sidefoot into the top corner.&lt;br&gt;
The fact that he did not score will matter less to Arsene Wenger than the fact that he is now prepared to trust his abundant talent and take control of games. He went off just after the hour mark to a standing ovation.&lt;br&gt;
But, this being Arsenal, Blackburn had their chances. Roque Santa Cruz fired over with a left-foot shot just two minutes after the opening goal, when William Gallas failed to deal with a long, diagonal ball.&lt;br&gt;
Brett Emerton supplied a reliable source of crosses from the right, including one that flashed in front of goal without anybody turning it in.&lt;br&gt;
Another found Santa Cruz leaping at the far post, but the Paraguayan headed over from six yards.&lt;br&gt;
At the other end, Van Persie twice went close to doubling his tally. He hit the side-netting after Denilson played him in with a canny ball, then volleyed just wide from 25 yards.&lt;br&gt;
Just before half-time, Arsenal extended their lead with a routine goal preceded by a remarkable build-up.&lt;br&gt;
The visitors must have completed 30 passes before Denilson crossed to Adebayor - onside this time - who powered his downward header past Robinson.&lt;br&gt;
The second period proved a tamer affair as Blackburn ran out of steam. Emerton nearly played Jason Roberts through early in the half and Morten Gamst Pedersen squandered a good attacking position by straying offside.&lt;br&gt;
Thereafter it was easy going for Arsenal, who would have gone further in front had Kolo Toure not somehow missed from a yard out.&lt;br&gt;
Emmanuel Eboue forced a great save from Robinson with a 25-yard strike, then won a penalty after a rash challenge by Stephen Warnock, and Adebayor put the result beyond doubt nine minutes before the end.&lt;br&gt;
And he completed the rout when he collected an Aaron Ramsey through-ball, took the ball past Robinson and shot into the empty net.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;"It is a three-month contract and if he does well and does the business then there is no reason why we can't extend that."&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The Blackburn chief believes almost every top club in the country will be feeling the pinch of the UK’s economic slowdown and warns the effects could soon be seen on the terraces. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Williams was quick to point to Rovers’ efforts to provide some of the cheapest match day tickets in the league as proof of their commitment to keep football available to the masses – but knows the game is increasingly fighting a losing battle. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Dwindling attendances would spell less money for squad rebuilding but, as the everyday fan is forced away from football, Williams admits everyone will have to “cut their cloth accordingly”. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;He said: “The economic situation is a worry for a lot of people. Football is a luxury but the reality is we are competing for that leisure pound. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“I am sure there will be a breaking point, when it really hits football, and I don’t think that will be too far away. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“It will be the corporate hospitality that is hit first, but finally it will have to spread to the terraces as well. Away attendances will certainly be hit because of all the extra costs involved in travelling to games. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Don’t get me wrong, the Premiership is still an attractive proposition but fans are starting to have to make choices and football clubs have to be very sensitive of that.” &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A recent fans survey, carried out by Virgin Money, suggests Blackburn are one of the clubs with the least to worry about, but with one in five still suggesting they will cut down on football, it is becoming an increasing concern. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Williams said: “I think that is evidence of our attempts to try and provide some of the cheapest prices in the league. We cut our prices the year before last and held them for ‘the early bird’ in the summer. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has to be conscious of what is happening. The reality is though if people stop coming in through the gates, we won’t have the revenue to give to the team. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“In our part of the world, the earnings are not in the top bracket and we are extremely conscious of that. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;“I think it will invariably lead to a shift from the family back to the individual as it has become a real struggle for someone to fund their whole family coming to football.” &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Virgin’s research showed costs of being a football fan have increased 21 per cent in the past three months, taking the cost of a match day for an individual to £106.21. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The new Blackburn manager’s odds tumbled dramatically from 66-1 to 6-1 amid reports in the North East that he was a strong contender for the Toon job. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Last night, Rovers officials declined to comment on the link. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;But the powers-that-be at Ewood Park are understood to be treating any possible move as a complete non-story, given that Ince is only two-and-a-half months into a three-year deal at Ewood Park and is expected to repay his total faith in Rovers after they offered him his big managerial break in the Premier League. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It is believed that Ince has emerged as a surprise contender due to his long-standing friendship with Newcastle’s director of football Dennis Wise, who is reported to have an influential role in appointing the new manager at St James’ Park. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In the 1990s, the two midfielders occasionally played alongside each other in the England engine room, and their relationship was forged further during Ince’s time as player-coach at Swindon, where Wise was manager. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Although the Magpies hierarchy are yet to compile a detailed short-list to replace Keegan, Ince is now seemingly on the radar, and his odds were last night shorter than that of former Newcastle and Rovers favourite Alan Shearer. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Reports from the North East now suggest United will be paying close attention to Blackburn’s display against Arsenal at Ewood on Saturday, as they quickly assess whether Ince has the required credentials to succeed in the Magpies hot-seat. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;However, any move by the former Manchester United and Liverpool midfielder is highly unlikely at this stage of his career, especially as he is just three league games into his stay at Rovers. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ince is unlikely to show any disloyalty towards chairman John Williams and the Rovers board after they recently plucked him from League Two champions MK Dons to provide him a platform at the highest level. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Outsiders may argue that the Newcastle job is one of the biggest in English football. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;However, in each of the previous three Premier League campaigns, Rovers have finished above the Magpies, while they boast a far more settled squad. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, at Blackburn, Ince is afforded total control of his squad in the transfer market, while Keegan resigned last week after disagreements with Newcastle owner Mike Ashley over the buying and selling of players at the club. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Coach Pim Verbeek insisted Grella's prognosis was "good", but added it was in the best interests of both his club Blackburn and Australia - who open the final round of World Cup qualifiers in the Uzbekistan capital - if did not play. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Grella will return to Ewood Park for further treatment. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Reid, whose last appearance for his country before the recent friendly in Norway had come against Germany almost two years earlier, turned in an assured display alongside Glenn Whelan in a dual midfield holding role as Trapattoni's masterplan paid dividends. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Having spent so long watching Ireland's games from afar because of injury, he was simply thrilled to be back in the picture. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Reid said: "I'm delighted. To be out of the squad so long with injury, I am delighted to be back in the fold. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"It's a pretty new role in the side and I am seeing plenty of the ball, which I am enjoying. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"I am enjoying playing alongside Glenn in there - he has been brilliant - so I am really enjoying it." &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Reid's blossoming partnership with Whelan has been perhaps the biggest change made by Trapattoni, who has resisted the temptation to throw Sunderland's Andy Reid into the mix, controversially so for many commentators. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Stoke midfielder Whelan has been ever present since the Italian took over at the helm, and he marked his fourth cap at the Bruchweg Stadium last night with his first senior international goal. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;His contribution to the victory - his 70th-minute strike put Ireland 2-0 in front after Kevin Doyle had headed home a 13th-minute Aiden McGeady cross - came after he spent his club's last two Barclays Premier League games on the bench. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Reid, who will hope to start against Montenegro in Podgorica on Wednesday, said: "It's surprising he has not played the last couple of games at club level. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"He is great technically, a great passer of the ball, he can put his foot in as well, and I have been really impressed with him in the last couple of games. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Hopefully we can improve the partnership and go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"It is a bit of an Italian way, maybe. He [Trapattoni] likes us two to sit in there and keep the ball. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"But Glenn chipped in with a goal on Saturday night, which we are all delighted about. I am really enjoying the partnership, and hopefully that will continue on Wednesday." &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Whelan's goal owed as much to keeper Giorgi Loria's blunder as it did to the midfielder's shot, and Reid, who had earlier seen the Georgian make a fine save from his drilled effort, could not resist a good-natured aside. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;He said: "I got hold of the ball well there, and then he let in Glenn's shank! &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"But we will take any goal that goes in. We were a little disappointed to concede the goal at the end going into the last couple of minutes, but it was a good result. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"But now it is about getting our heads back on for Wednesday." &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The victory got Ireland off to the perfect start in Group 8 as world champions Italy needed an injury-time winner to see off Cyprus and Montenegro were pegged back at the death by Bulgaria in a 2-2 draw. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A positive result in midweek would give Trapattoni and his players the perfect start, and no-one in the camp is in any doubt as to how valuable that could be. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Reid said: "We probably would have taken four points from the two games, but now we have got the win, there is no reason why we can't get a win on Wednesday and go home with the six points." &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Full-back Kevin Kilbane will make his 50th consecutive competitive appearance in that game, if selected, after reaching 49 wearing a protective mask over his &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Only a win will do if the province are to have any hopes at all of advancing to the play-off stage of the competition ahead of the finals in Sweden next year. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Manager Steve Beaglehole is aware of the stiff challenge ahead but is pleased with the progress they are making. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;He also believes Flynn is the right type to galvanise the players. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Jonny is very passionate about his country, you can see that when he pulls the shirt on," said Beaglehole, a coach at League One side Leicester. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"He sets good standards both on and off the field. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"I like centre-halves being captains as they can see the whole picture and he has leadership qualities. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"No disrespect to the other lads, he stands out and is growing into the role." &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Germany seemed set for top place in the Group Nine table, only to suffer a shock defeat by Moldova last month. The Germans now sit level on 13 points with Israel, with the Irish a point further back. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Beaglehole added: "It would be fantastic if we were to go on and qualify. But we have to be realistic. We only have an outside chance of progressing. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"We all know how strong Germany and are they cannot afford to be complacent after what happened against Moldova."&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;"I feel good," said Santa Cruz. "This injury is less significant than another one I had in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"I want to play on Saturday. If not, I will let another player take my place. We have other good forwards." &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Paraguay team doctor Manuel Aguilar added: "If we can use him in the second half it would be a boost." &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;America striker Salvador Cabanas and Olimpia defender Denis Caniza are also doubtful and will be monitored throughout the week. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;However there was also some welcome news when it emerged Santa Cruz would be back in action soon, despite limping off before half-time at Upton Park. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Rovers frontman damaged an Achilles, but it is not a severe problem and he could be back for Blackburn's first match after the international break, the league clash with Arsenal at Ewood Park on August 13. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Santa Cruz had suffered precisely the same problem in Blackburn's pre-season defeat to Wolves at Molineux but it kept him out for just a matter of days on that occasion, and a short recovery time is anticipated again. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"He will be out for probably 10 days to two weeks," said Ince. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"It is the same injury that he got against Wolves. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Someone came down on the bottom of his left Achilles." &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;However, Santa Cruz will still have to fly to Asuncion to be assessed by Paraguay's medical staff ahead of their World Cup qualifiers against Argentina and Venezuela next week. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Team doctor Manuel Aguilar told newspaper La Nacion: "I spoke to Roque after the end of the match and he told me his heel hurts a lot. It's a knock on the left heel. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"However, we'll be able to make a clearer decision when he comes here on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The player must attend the national team training because this is how the system works here. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"I also talked to the Blackburn doctor to tell him we will not risk Roque. We'll let them know all the details." &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Paraguay, who lead the South American Qualifying Zone on 13 points, face Argentina on Saturday in Buenos Aires before hosting Venezuela three days later. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;He told Blackburn's official website: "It is a dream come true really. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"I got the medical done on Sunday and have now signed my contract. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
GIVE IT TIME TO LOAD&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Paul Ince endured a miserable return to former club West Ham as his Blackburn Rovers side were beaten 4-1 at Upton Park.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Calum Davenport and a Christopher Samba own goal had already ensured the win for the Hammers, before Craig Bellamy and Carlton Cole struck in injury time to render the visitors' strike from Jason Roberts - who also had a penalty saved - nothing but a consolation goal.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Rovers boss Ince - who began his career at West Ham before controversially moving to Manchester United in 1989 - always endured rough treatment from the Hammers' fans when he returned as a player, and it was no different on his first appearance as a manager at the Boleyn Ground, where he was booed everytime the ball went near him. On the pitch his fortunes weren't much better.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;After sending in several tame set-pieces, midfielder Julien Faubert curled in his 12th-minute corner at pace and centre-back Davenport rose above two Blackburn defenders to head past the flailing Paul Robinson for his first goal in West Ham colours.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Alan Curbishley's side saw their lead doubled eight minutes later in controversial circumstances. As Mark Noble fired from outside the box Samba moved to try and hack the effort away because Dean Ashton was lurking behind him, albeit in an offside position. The Congolese defender only managed to swipe the shot into his own net however, and the goal stood due to the fact that Ashton had not touched the ball, despite his presence directly contributing to Samba's actions.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;To their credit, Rovers' response was almost immediate, and striker Roberts got his side back in the game two minutes later when he latched onto Morten Gamst Pedersen's pass and his low shot on the turn went underneath goalkeeper Robert Green into the far bottom corner.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As Rovers pushed for an equaliser during the five minutes of second-half injury time, substitute Bellamy had plenty of time to line up and fire a fierce half-volley in for his first goal of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Rovers' misery was compounded moments later when Swiss full-back Valon Behrami beat two men down the wing to cut a ball in for Scott Parker, who set up Cole with a simple tap-in.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Earlier, at 2-0, the resilience of Paul Ince's side was tested further when star striker Roque Santa Cruz was forced off with an ankle problem on the half-hour but his replacement, Matt Derbyshire, had the ball in the net with his first touch when he tapped in Samba's nod down from a Steven Warnock long ball.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Their celebrations were quickly cut short when they saw the referee's assistant's flag up on the sidelines, ruling Derbyshire had been in an offside position when Warnock's ball was played, though replays showed the former England under-21 was level with Davenport at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Their rough luck continued after the break when Robert Green saved Roberts's penalty two minutes into the second half, which Rovers were awarded after Carlton Cole had blocked Samba's free-kick with his hand. Hammers spot-kick specialist Green maintained his excellent record of penalty saves by getting down low to his left to turn away Roberts's effort.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The rest of the match maintained the competitive and exciting pattern, with both keepers being forced into action. Brett Emerton got in behind full-back George McCartney - who came on as a substitute for debutant Valon Behrami - and the Australian saw his header at the far post saved by the foot of Green.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Upton Park fans were given extra reason to cheer when Bellamy made his first appearance of the season when he replaced Ashton with 20 minutes to go, and the Welshman met a cross with a crisp volley that Robinson did well to palm away.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Rovers didn't clear the danger and moments later Carlton Cole fought off the grasp of Keith Andrews - making his Rovers bow after coming on at half-time for fellow new-boy Vincenzo Grella - to blast an effort that the former Tottenham keeper pushed away at full stretch.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It looked at that point as though the match would end 2-1, before West Ham hit their visitors with those two late sucker punches.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;NEW signing Keith Andrews couldn't hide his excitement at finally putting pen-to-paper on a contract with Rovers.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The 27-year-old midfielder this evening made the move from League One MK Dons to Premier League Blackburn Rovers signing a three year deal for an undisclosed fee.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Speaking exclusively to &lt;a href="http://www.rovers.co.uk"&gt;rovers.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;, Andrews said: "I'm absolutely delighted to be here, as everyone knows it has been a long drawn out few weeks between the clubs agreeing the fee and what have you, but obviously I'm delighted to be here and to finally get it sorted, I can't wait to crack on now.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Blackburn being a massive club and a Premier League club was a chance that I couldn't really let go. I did everything in my power to get here, I was pleading with the Chairman at MK Dons to get the deal done, and the chance to work with the Gaffer once again was obviously a key factor.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Coming here is a fantastic opportunity for me and it is one that I am really relishing and I hope to take with both hands."&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Andrews was an interested spectator at Ewood Park on Wednesday night as Rovers defeated Grimsby Town 4-1 in the Carling Cup, and the Dubliner is under no illusions of the task that lies ahead if he is to hold down a regular place in Paul Inces' starting eleven.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"My aims are to play as many games as possible but I know it is going to be hard to break into the team because they've had a very good start. The win against Everton and the draw against Hull, to take four points from the two games I'm sure everybody would have taken that when the fixtures came out.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"So I'm under no illusions, it is going to be a very hard test for me to get into the team, but it is one that I am relishing and very much looking forward to."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Blackburn's second string beat Grimsby 4-1 in the Carling Cup on Wednesday but Paul Ince has no intention of promoting them to his first team.Rovers, showing eight changes from the side that drew 1-1 against Hull last weekend, overcame the shock of going a goal down inside seven minutes to exert their Premier League class and see off the League Two outfit to book their place in round three. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Tom Newey's curling free-kick initially threatened to cause a shock before Carlos Villanueva found an equaliser within 10 minutes that his lively debut deserved, and further goals from Matt Derbyshire, who scored twice, and Brett Emerton saw Blackburn home as 4-1 winners. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Only Ryan Nelsen, Morten Gamst Pedersen and Aaron Mokoena remained from Blackburn's recognised first-choice line-up, but Ince was quick to assure his rested stars that they would regain their spots for the clash against the Hammers. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;When asked if he had been given something to think about, Ince replied: "Not at all, to be fair. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"When you win at Everton and draw at home to pick up four points, you don't change your side around a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"But there are certainly one or two that have shown if it's not going well on Saturday, which I hope is not the case, then I can put them on and they could change the game." &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Despite going behind early on, Rovers' passage into the next round was never in doubt and, but for a marvellous goalkeeping performance from Grimsby stopper Phil Barnes, it could have been a rout. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"We started off very slow, but it was always a game that could potentially have been a banana skin," added Ince. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"After 20 minutes we looked out of sorts, until Carlos created a bit of magic and got us back to 1-1. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"When that one went in, I felt more at ease then. The whole lads played well in the second half. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"We could have had eight or nine to be honest and that's not being disrespectful to Grimsby, because they've come here and had a go at us and, at times, caused us problems. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"But, at the end of the day they got tired, which you'd expect being a League Two side, and I think our quality shone through in the end." &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Grimsby manager Alan Buckley was proud of his team despite the scoreline, but believes they did not show enough belief in themselves when they had a foothold in the game. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Buckley, who saw his side lose to Ince's MK Dons side last year in both League Two encounters and also the final of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy, admitted: "It was always going to be a difficult game. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"At one time you'd come to a place like Blackburn and they'd have 14 or 15 top players in the squad, but now they seem to have 22 or 23 - so whatever team they had put out, we'd have been up against it. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"But at 1-1 I thought we looked a bit threatening, and I thought for 10 minutes we were in control and looked quite comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"I've got no complaints about our work-rate, but I think we have got to have a bit more belief in ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"I think we did reasonably well but we didn't have enough belief in ourselves when we had the ball, and we needed a bit more cut and thrust. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"But we have to put into perspective what we've played against - very, very talented players." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Grimsby stunned Ewood by taking the lead on seven minutes courtesy of a free-kick from Newey, but Rovers overcame that shock to take control with goals in quick succession from Carlos Villanueva, Matt Derbyshire and Brett Emerton.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A further goal from Derbyshire in the second half stretched Rovers lead with Mathias delighted with the display.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"In the first 20-25 minutes I thought they were in the game and pressured us a lot," said Assistant manager Ray Mathias on Radio Rovers after the game.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"But once we got into our pattern of play things started doing the right things I think things started to change then.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"I think we opened them up, especially in the second half, we pushed their wing-backs on and we had so much play and so much of the ball it was just unbelievable really, and as you've seen, with the chances we created, it was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"You can't wish for anything more exciting than that."&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It was the display from Chilean sensation Carlos Villanueva that left the home fans and Mathias drooling.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"He started off a little bit shaky, feeling the pressure of the game just trying to get into the tempo of the game. But once he got into that he was absolutely fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"We've seen him score goals like that all the time in training so it just shows what he can do. He also had a hand in two of the other goals so it was a complete performance from the boy."&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;But it wasn't only Villanueva that impressed under the Ewood lights on Wednesday evening, Matt Derbyshire and Keith Treacy also caught the eye of Mathias.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"When you talk about man-of-the-match displays I thought Matt did very well indeed, you look at the chances he's created for himself with his movement and the crosses coming into the box he could have four or five goals tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Keith is a great athlete, he can get forward and deliver good quality crosses and also he has pace to defend at the back. He's a little bit new in that position at left back but he has done very well tonight and he has certainly staked a claim on the team."&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Ince's MK Dons did the double over the Mariners in League Two last season, before beating them for a third time in the Wembley final of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;But despite last season's trio of successes, the Rovers boss will not underestimate the threat Alan Buckley's side will pose in tomorrow night's Carling Cup second round (kick-off 8pm). &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"They are a good side," he said. "We played them at Wembley last season with Milton Keynes in a fantastic day out and a fantastic victory.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Alan Buckley's teams always play very good football. So they'll come here, to a lovely Ewood Park pitch, and they'll be looking to play, which will hopefully help us. It should be a very good footballing game."&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Grimsby have made a less than impressive start to the new campaign, claiming just a point from their opening three games and still looking for their first league goal, but Ince insists that the form book goes out the window when a potential giant-killing is up for grabs. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"They'll be up for it," he added. "They are under no pressure, so they can just come here and enjoy themselves. That is when they are dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"As I've said, they are a good footballing side. The league results don't really matter when you go into cup games. It is going to be a tough game, so we are going to have to go out there and do a professional job."&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Now the 28-year-old has completed the switch from Torino in a deal reportedly worth £4million and he's signed a four-year deal.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Grella ends a ten-year stint playing in Italy having first arrived in Serie A in 1998 when he joined Empoli.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;He joined Parma in 2004 and Torino in 2007, but he has now sealed his move to the Premier League where he will link-up with Australian international team-mate Brett Emerton.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The 33-year-old striker has been training with Rovers this summer following his release by Cardiff.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;His former Liverpool and England team-mate Paul Ince is now in charge at Ewood Park and had hoped to utilise the veteran forward this season.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;However, Fowler is holding out for a longer contract that the one currently on offer and will miss the opportunity to prove his fitness in a Carling Cup clash against Grimsby on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"The situation with Robbie is still up in the air, so he won't be involved against Grimsby," said Ince.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"These things do take time, especially when the agent gets involved.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"I'm not unsure about Robbie, I'm just unsure as to when it will get done.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"There is no deadline, though, because he is a free agent and not tied down to the transfer window."&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;While being forced to accept that Fowler will play no part against the Mariners, Ince will still use the game to rest a number of his first-team regulars.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Andre Ooijer and Roque Santa Cruz played 90 minutes for their national teams last week and again against Hull at the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"I'm not happy about that and I'll be speaking to their international managers about it, but they will need a break."&lt;/p&gt;
