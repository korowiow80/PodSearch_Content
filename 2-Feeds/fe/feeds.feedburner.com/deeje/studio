      <description><![CDATA[<p>I was poking around this song a bit, trying to find a new sound for the guitar.  I started stripping out various tracks, when I realized that I had a pretty good snapshot of what I've been playing acoustically around town.</p>

<p>I'd like to clean up the abrupt panning of the guitar, and put some reverb on the horns...</p>

<p>I'd like to find another singer/musician to reproduce these harmonies live.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Share This Moment (2005-06-18)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>After regularly playing this song for about six months at the Sacred Grounds Open Mic, I came back to the recording feeling like it lacked something.  I decided to add an acoustic guitar track to match what I play live, and I completely redid the vocals.  The coda still needs a lot of work, and the break still needs some solo-like texture... perhaps I can expand on the horns to give them a larger role in the song.</p>

<p>(I've included two older versions of this song, at about six month intervals, for your comparison.  I'm sure there'll be newer versions, too!)</p>

<p>(I tried to use Feeder's enclosure upload feature, but it didn't work the firs time, and I've been struggling to get the feed file to appear new to my aggregator... :-(]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I found a chord one day, a funky A where I bar the 5th fret, and only put down my middle finger on the seventh fret.  I'm so unschooled I can't even tell you the name of that chord... but I'd strum it with my thumb and clamp and release my fret fingers to create IMHO an interesting rhythm.</p>

<p>I started to build a song around this chord as well as an irregular chord progression that leads up to it.  In this first version of the song from last year, you can hear that I didn't have any verses, but had a good idea of how the melody should go.  The chorus was fairly clear in my mind.  I played the same chord progression with a strongly distorted guitar, which produced an even stranger texture... I like it!</p>

      <title>Powder Cruise (very old)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This is my first post to my new studio podcast.  I'll be podcasting my music as I make it, so you'll get a chance to hear all the variations and permutations of my songs.  Interesting?  Probably not for most people.  But imagine if artists like U2 or Lenny Kravitz podcasted their studio work... would you pay to hear early versions of their songs?  Then again, would artists want to show their work before its ready?  So many questions...</p>
<p>So, to get things started, I've enclosed an old track called "Powder Cruise".  If you already have this song, nothing is new.  This just lets me test the enclosure field of the RSS feed, and the auto-download capabilities of various podcast clients.</p>]]></description>
