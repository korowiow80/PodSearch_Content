Dirk Bockel has produced top ten finishes at the Ironman World Championships in Hawaii each season since his first appearance 3 years ago, his most recent result being a commendable fourth place. During the 2012 season, he saw one of his dreams come true when he joined LEOPARD TREK, marking the first successful integration of a triathlete into a cycling team structure. With the professional support of LEOPARD TREK, he is determined that he has the tools to become the first Luxembourg athlete to ever win the Ironman World Championships in Hawaii.

As an authentic all rounder, his strengths reach all 3 disciplines of triathlon. He has the ability to come out of the water first, power from the front on the bike, and push through to the finish with one of the fastest marathon times. His twenty-plus years of experience have enabled him to put in the miles needed to perform at the top level at this point in his career, and is only improving with age.</itunes:summary>

Jessi Stensland will be joining Rock Star Triathlete tonight to do some Q&amp;A.

In 2000, Jessi entered the professional circuit. A strong swimmer who quickly developed strength on the bike, she hit the ground running. Her first professional win came in 2001 on one of the toughest bike courses on the circuit, at the St. Kitts International Triathlon. Since then Jessi has had 20 career wins both nationally and internationally. In 2004 she won the Half Ironman Mexico, her first attempt at that distance. The highlight of her career however was the Olympic journey which culmintated with the 2004 US Olympic Triathlon Trials where she finished 4th and 6th among the American women.

Early in 2008 Jessi resumed training and racing. Partnered with powerhouse Under Armour through 2010, the focus this time around is broader, as the tag line of this website implies. It will be an adventure in all things endurance, both on and off-road, and all (reasonable) distances.

Jessi attributes her desire to race again at an elite level and her ability to do so injury-free to the team at Athletes' Performance and the Core Performance program. An understanding of body awareness, being athletic, and how to integrate all elements of performance into life is a message that Jessi is committed to passing along.

The Right Stuff is a know as, "serious hydration for serious athletes." Rock Star Triathlete coach Kerry Sullivan uses it often, since he finds it works the best of any hydration/electrolyte product he has used.

This may sound like a lot of hype, but The Right Stuff has a lot of science to back it up. NASA originally developed the formula for there astronauts who were becoming seriously dehydrated when re-orbiting the earths atmosphere. They tested many solutions and found that the formula used in The Right Stuff was the best.

Below is an interview that Kerry did with the owner of The Right Stuff. In the interview, formulator of The Right Stuff David Belaga talks about what makes The Right Stuff so effective.

Check out: http://therightstuff-usa.com/ (http://therightstuff-usa.com/) after you listen to the interview below, and keep reading for a proprietary discount.

Ironman Kona

Michael Weiss SRM Bike Analysis 2011

File Viewer
http://tpks.ws/cIleWi8h &lt;--click here to view the file

 Did Not Finish Ironman Hawaii. Dropped out at mile 14 of run.

Bike Time: 4:25 (16th fastest among pros)
 Average watts: 317w (326np)
 79kg= 4.0 w/kg
 Average cadence: 89rpm
 Average Speed: 25.5mph
 Work: 5026kj

Austrian professional triathlete Michael Weiss did not have the race he had envisioned in this year’s Ironman Hawaii. Weiss had a very strong bike and solid run in 2010 which lead to a 13th place finish. However this year’s race ended with exhaustion half way through the run.

Weiss came out of the water in 43rd place (57:21) which meant he had to chase hard on the bike for the first hour in order to catch the first group of 20-some pros. He is a very strong cyclist, but having to make up so much time on the bike certainly didn’t help him finish with a strong run.

Weiss describes his Kona experience as, "I came out of water ~5:30 behind the main pack. I averaged 347 watts in the first hour to close the gap on the chase group. I caught a smaller group for the last 15 miles and settled into a more comfortable pace to recover for the run. Ran the first 10 miles in 1:05hr, but hit the wall around mile 14 where I was unable to recover and withdrew."

The Numbers Don’t Lie

By looking at his SRM power data in TrainingPeaks you can easily see how hard he chased the first half of the race. For just over 2hrs he averaged 343w, whereas the last 2hrs of the race he averaged 292w. A 50w difference took a lot out of Weiss which certainly showed later on. Not only did he average 343w for the first 2hrs, but he also started out with his first 10-minutes on the bike at 372w average! Wow big time numbers!

Weiss will certainly not ever forget this day and will be back with a vengeance no doubt.

Side note: IMAZ 6 weeks after IM Hawaii Michael rode a 4:24 bike (7th fastest) and he went on to run a 2:59. Finish time-8:21, 8th overall)

2011: 10:00:27 (31st place)

Bike 5:15
 21.4mph
 207w, 218np
 1.05 very good VI
 86avg cadence
 Hawi Climb- 27' 221W avg

Peak 30' was on the way back which is impressive. You had energy left in the tank for sure!
avg 223w for 30' within the last 90' of the bike.

Overall decoupling was great at 2.3% Power:HR. Very fit and paced it well.
1st half- 210w avg
2nd half- 204w. perfect!

avg 7:59 marathon splits (3:29)
134avg HR

Comparison to 2010 Ironman Hawaii

Time- 10:18:00
Bike- 5:17

Max 30' was 221w
88avg cadence

Michael Weiss Xterra World Championship Victory at Xterra 2011

 File viewer: http://tpks.ws/tLV7 &lt;--click here to view the file

 

Wow. holy cow.

-Michael averaged 350w for 1:17! His normalized power for the race was 442w!

Normalized power is a more accurate indicator of the watts he would have held if he rode at a constant pace.
Notice the VI is very different in Xterra vs IMKona (1.26 in Xterra vs 1.03 in Kona). VI is the variability index and shows how steady the effort was. A constant output would equal 1.0 which is almost exactly what Kona was.</itunes:summary>

In 2000, Jessi entered the professional circuit. A strong swimmer who quickly developed strength on the bike, she hit the ground running. Her first professional win came in 2001 on one of the toughest bike courses on the circuit, at the St. Kitts International Triathlon. Since then Jessi has had 20 career wins both nationally and internationally. In 2004 she won the Half Ironman Mexico, her first attempt at that distance. The highlight of her career however was the Olympic journey which culmintated with the 2004 US Olympic Triathlon Trials where she finished 4th and 6th among the American women.

In 2006 and 2007 Jessi took a break from professional racing to pursue other interests (imagine that!) the result of which was amazing opportunities in video production as mentioned below.

Early in 2008 Jessi resumed training and racing. Partnered with powerhouse Under Armour through 2010, the focus this time around is broader, as the tag line of this website implies. It will be an adventure in all things endurance, both on and off-road, and all (reasonable) distances.

Jessi also founded Movement U which helps athletes perform at there best through functional training.
