         <title>Is there too much talk about money these days?</title>
         <description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few months I have noticed many success gurus talking a lot about money and how much they and their clients make.</p>

<p>(Remember when it wasn't polite to talk about how much you make? I'm not saying I think we should go back to that, but is it swinging too far the other way?)</p>

<p>Well, all the talk has been about how despite the "recession" you can still make more than ever before. You just have to decide that's what you're going to do, and choose NOT to participate in the down economy. And they use extreme client examples to make their point.</p>

<p>And while I believe them and actively practice what they preach, I also am starting to feel like the entire focus is on money. And that bugs me a bit.</p>

<p>While I believe we should be paid well for what we do, I also know there are many other important reasons we do what we do.</p>

<p>I think we need to be very careful about placing ALL of our focus on the almighty dollar.</p>

<p>Here's a list of all the reasons I started my home-based business back in 1998 and am still grateful for that business every single day. </p>

<p>Review this list and remember all the reasons you started your business, or the reasons you want to start your business. Then I'd love it if you'd share your reasons by posting a comment.</p>

<p>1) To be home more with my kids</p>

<p>2) To have more flexibility and time freedom </p>

<p>3) To not miss out on important events in my kid's lives</p>

<p>4) To be the one parenting my children</p>

<p>5) To do the work I wanted to do, and on my terms</p>

<p>6) To be able to work with the clients I wanted to work with</p>

<p>7) To fulfill all of my creative passions vs. just doing a job (e.g. writing)</p>

<p>8) To contribute, serve and help others</p>

<p>9) To reap the benefits of my work vs. working for someone else's benefit</p>

<p>10) To allow me more time to take care of myself (e.g. exercise, etc.)</p>

<p>11) To be available for my kids when they come home from school</p>

<p>12) To enable me to better balance work, life and family without being stressed out all the time</p>

<p>And the list could probably go on forever!  There are so many reasons I started my home-based business and so many benefits I have enjoyed over the past 11 years and hope to continue enjoying for many years to come.</p>

<p>Yes, the fact that I can support myself and my family very comfortably is important, but not to the exclusion of all these other reasons.</p>

<p>Let's don't forget why we do what we do!</p>

<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts and reasons you have chosen the life of entrepreneurship vs. being an employee.  And to hear if you are tired of all this talk about what everyone is making, or if it inspires you. Please share!<br />

         <title>Want to get more done?  Here's a great idea</title>
         <description><![CDATA[<p>I don't know about you but after the holidays it always seems like I have more stuff. So I'm often compelled to clean out a few closets and de-clutter as part of my New Year's routine.</p>

<p>In fact, I spent last Sunday doing just that and I can't tell you how good it felt to go back to work on Monday morning with two newly organized closets, a clean desk and a clutter-free office.</p>

<p>I felt so much more productive this week, and I was able to think more clearly and accomplish so much more.</p>

<p>All from de-cluttering a few spaces in my home and office!</p>

<p>Did you know the average American wastes 400 hours a year digging through piles trying to find important documents and other important "stuff"?</p>

<p>Not exactly a productive way to spend your time.</p>

<p>Did you also know that we get more mail in one month than our grandparents received in an entire lifetime? No wonder we have so much clutter!</p>

<p>And, that's BEFORE you include email, information we print off the internet and other notes and papers we accumulate.</p>

<p>So if you're feeling a little overwhelmed and like you're drowning in paper it's no wonder!</p>

<p>And when all of those papers seem useful and important, what do you do with it all and how in the world are you supposed to organize it?  </p>

<p>I think so often we don't know HOW to handle it so what ends up happening is that instead of being able to use all of this great information we have saved, it just becomes more piles of clutter.</p>

<p>And we end up wasting astronomical amounts of money, time and energy because we have to go through all this stuff every time we want to find something we need.</p>

<p>It's the old "I know it's here somewhere ..." routine. Sound familiar?</p>

<p>As a result we lose opportunities because we've misplaced important contacts and notes. We lose money because we don't get around to completing or following up on projects in a timely manner.  </p>

<p>Or, we mess up relationships because we're late for meetings or we show up unprepared.</p>

<p>What's more, if you're like me, you started your own business so you'd have more control over your schedule and be able to spend more time with your family.  </p>

<p>But instead you may find yourself spending more time working because of all the unproductive time you spend searching for the things you need among all your piles of stuff. And you end up having less free time than when you had a job!</p>

<p>Not exactly what you envisioned when you started your business, is it?</p>

<p>If you're tired of this routine but you're having trouble getting motivated to clean out your closets or de-clutter your office, I have a great suggestion for you.</p>

<p>My friend Carrie Greene is hosting an <a href="http://www.CarrieThru.com/product/bootcamp" target="_blank">"Escape Your Clutter" Boot Camp</a> starting next Friday, January 16th that you can participate in from the comfort and convenience of your home or office and that will give you the motivation and support you need to get that clutter out of your life so you can make 2009 a much more productive and profitable year. </p>

<p>You can get all the details and reserve your spot at <a href="http://www.CarrieThru.com/product/bootcamp" target="_blank">www.CarrieThru.com/product/bootcamp</a></p>

<p>Just imagine what it would be like to be able to go into your office and simply grab what you need because you know exactly where it is.</p>

<p>Or, imagine what it would be like to use those 400 hours that everyone else is wasting, to serve more clients, do more marketing to grow your business, or simply take some extra time off to spend with your family.</p>

<p>Now, you may be thinking ... okay, getting organized is a good idea, and I've been meaning to do it for a while, but who the heck has the time to do it.</p>

<p>Well, it doesn't have to take a lot of time.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.CarrieThru.com/product/bootcamp" target="_blank">"Escape Your Clutter" Boot Camp </a> is a unique 3-phase program designed to give you everything you need to get you out from under your piles quickly and easily.</p>

<p>This program provides you with expert advice, leadership and team support in real time.  You won't get side tracked and you won't get discouraged because you will be able to get all of your questions answered WHEN you have them.</p>

<p>And what's best is that this is a virtual program. You can participate from anywhere in the world -- your office, your home, your car -- wherever YOUR clutter is.</p>

<p>Just think, you could be organized BEFORE January is over.</p>

<p>So if you're sick and tired of looking at your stacks of dreams just sitting around in piles laughing at you while they wait to be achieved, then this program is for you.</p>

<p>It's already priced incredibly low, however Carrie has agreed to offer a special 20% discount to my clients. Just enter the coupon code "Debbie" at check out to get your 20% savings.</p>

<p>You can get all the details and reserve your spot at <a href="http://www.CarrieThru.com/product/bootcamp" target="_blank">www.CarrieThru.com/product/bootcamp</a></p>

<p>There's nothing in it for me if you sign up. I just know what a HUGE difference being organized and clutter-free has made to me and my business ... and the success it's allowed me to achieve, that I wanted to pass along this opportunity for you to realize the same success.</p>

<p>And I also know that some people need a little extra help getting motivated to get those closets cleaned out and those desks cleared off.  And Carrie is definitely the woman who can provide that help and motivation.</p>

<p>So if you have clutter that's holding you back, I highly encourage you to check out the <a href="http://www.CarrieThru.com/product/bootcamp" target="_blank">CarrieThru "Escape Your Clutter" Boot Camp </a>today, so you can be organized and clutterfree by the end of January.</p>

<p>Here's to Escaping Your Clutter and reaching your full potential in 2009!<br />

         <title>Tired of failing on your New Year's Resolutions?</title>
         <description><![CDATA[<p>I know how hard it is to eat healthy and stay on track with your fitness routine during the holidays. Even though I had some time off, there were always plenty of goodies around and exercise didn't seem to be as much of a priority as spending time with my family and just relaxing.</p>

<p>So then January rolls around and we're trying to "get back on track" with eating right and exercising. I don't happen to be one of those people who creates resolutions, but I know many people do. I'm usually the one joking that the gym will be bearable again after all those well-intentioned people "fall off" their exercise resolution. And usually around February or March, the crowd at the gym is much lighter. Amazing - it's so predictable.</p>

<p>But it's not good for those people who really need to improve their health and well-being.</p>

<p>The good news is, there is help for all of us with good intentions for taking better care of ourselves this year.</p>

<p>My friend Michi Story of <a href="http://www.kenzenwellness.com" target="_blank">KenZen Wellness </a>is offering a FREE Teleseminar called, "Jump Start Your Wellness" on Tuesday, January 13th, and it's just for us moms!</p>

<p>I plan to be there and if you'd like to join me, you can register at <a href="http://www.kenzenwellness.com/teleseminar" target="_blank">www.kenzenwellness.com/teleseminar</a></p>

<p>Here's what Michi will be helping us moms with on this Free Call:</p>

<p>*** How to accomplish your New Year's resolutions, whatever they may be.</p>

<p>*** How to no longer feel like a failure - because you are moving forward accomplishing your goals.</p>

<p>*** How to have the motivation to exercise, eat healthy and lose weight.</p>

<p>*** How to have the energy to play with your kids and cook dinner (if you want).</p>

<p>When you join Michi on January 13th you will learn how you can be all of this and more!  And I know Michi - as a working mother of a toddler, she LIVES this stuff so she's a great role model for us all, and a great teacher we can learn from and be inspired by.</p>

<p>To register for the FREE call (space is limited) go to <a href="http://www.kenzenwellness.com/teleseminar" target="_blank">www.kenzenwellness.com/teleseminar</a></p>

<p>All moms that sign up for the free call will also receive a FREE subscription to "Inspired Living" a monthly eZine full of wellness tips to make your life healthy, happy and harmonious (wouldn't you love for your life to be healthy, happy and harmonious?!) PLUS you will receive a special GIFT just for visiting <a href="http://www.kenzenwellness.com" target="_blank">www.kenzenwellness.com</a></p>

<p>I hope you'll join me in kicking off 2009 in a healthy way by joining me and Michi on this free call!<br />

         <title>Happy Holidays from Debbie LaChusa, 10stepmarketing &amp; 6-Figure Work-at-Home Mom</title>
         <description><![CDATA[<p>As the year comes to a close, I just wanted to take a moment to wish everyone Happy Holidays and to thank you for being a part of my circle of friends on the Internet.</p>

<p>I do not take it lightly that you allow me to share my marketing and business tips and advice with you, and I hope that through that sharing I have been able to add value to you and your business over the past year.</p>

<p>As 2008 comes to a close and we get ready to welcome 2009, I encourage you to reflect back on all that you have to be grateful for.</p>

<p>For it is through our gratitude that we attract more good things into our lives.</p>

<p>As for me, I will be spending the better part of the next two weeks enjoying some time off with my family, reflecting on 2008 and creating my vision for 2009.</p>

<p>I encourage you to do the same.</p>

<p>Here's to unlimited joy and abundance in 2009!</p>

         <title>Transformations and Quantum Leaps</title>
         <description><![CDATA[<p>For every quantum leap in ability, achievement or growth, there is a gateway. <br />
 <br />
The gateway to each successive level of more, is transformation.<br />
 <br />
My friend Harrison Klein of True Millionaire Stories is holding a special 2-day weekend gateway event entitled: <br />
 <br />
             TRANSFORMATION AND QUANTUM LEAPS<br />
 <br />
in Fort Lauderdale Florida, November 8th and 9th and we want you to attend. <br />
 <br />
We want you to attend if:<br />
 <br />
* You are a student of Personal Growth and Development </p>

<p>* You need a rocket-boost in your life regarding... <br />
           love <br />
           joy<br />
           success<br />
           wealth<br />
           relationships<br />
           career <br />
           genius <br />
           spirituality<br />
           integrity<br />
           higher awareness <br />
           and/or<br />
           passion<br />
 <br />
* Or, if you want to be your own life's creator rather than being sculpted by other forces.<br />
 <br />
We have 8 great speakers, including me, who not only have been through awesome transformations in the consciousness and success of all of the above themselves, but also know how to stimulate and catalyze it in others.<br />
 <br />
On top of that it's going to be joyfully held in beautiful sunny Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the ocean playground of the stars.  <br />
 <br />
If you're even a little bit inclined to grow by a quantum leap you won't want to miss this. <br />
 <br />
Why? <br />
 <br />
Because its intimately different. Check it out at <a href="http://www.tms27.com/debbie/" target="_blank">http://www.tms27.com/debbie/</a></p>

<p>Won't you join me and the others in Florida? I'd love to meet you in person and watch you take a quantum leap!<br />

         <title>Don't fall victim to the economy, elections and worldwide meltdown</title>
         <description><![CDATA[<p>Listen. When you hear all this talk about worldwide economic meltdowns, volatile elections and Depression looming, I want you to feel nothing less than ECSTATIC ... and you want to know why? <br />
 <br />
The people who pulled entire economies and world markets out of the LAST Great Depression were the quantum leapers and transformationalists of the world. <br />
 <br />
While most were gnashing their teeth, the transformationalists stayed on track and moved forward with confidence, focus, big dreams, advanced consciousness and the whole world began to pivot in a new direction.<br />
 <br />
My friend Harrison Klein and 8 transformationalists, including me, got together a few days ago to talk about you and the need to change the world one person at a time through transformation and quantum leaps. <br />
 <br />
Now more than ever, it's imperative that you stay on track, stay unaffected by external conditions and understand how the universe works to achieve your biggest desires, your happiness and raise your consciousness to create the most profound life you can imagine. </p>

<p>So, we've decided to help you do so in one super transformational weekend. November 8th and 9th in sunny Fort Lauderdale, Florida! <br />
 <br />
They've created a very unique program, calling it ...  <br />
 <br />
          "TRANSFORMATIONS AND QUANTUM LEAPS" <br />
 <br />
... and I'm getting involved to help them help you. <br />
 <br />
We're going to get your biggest life going and rolling in the right direction in a LIVE 2 day seminar: <br />
 <br />
                   Saturday and Sunday 9-5<br />
                     November 8th and 9th<br />
 <br />
It's important that you RSVP for the event. Reserve your own place there NOW at:  <br />
<a href="http://www.tms27.com/debbie/" target="_blank">http://www.tms27.com/debbie/</a><br />
