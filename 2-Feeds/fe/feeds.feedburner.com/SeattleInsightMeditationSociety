      <title>Fundamentals of the Dharma: Wise Intention</title>

      <description>Wise Intention is the energy that moves all spiritual practices forward. &amp;nbsp;We mistakenly think it is our willpower but it is always and only our intention. There are two expressions of intention, the primary intention associated with the longing to be free, and the secondary intention for gain and acquisition. The secondary is formed by the mind from the primary intention, and that is the reason we believe that satisfaction can come through desire. The mind tells us that. For the energy to be reinvested back into the primary we have to prove to ourselves that secondary gains will never be truly fulfilling. That is what is left for many of us to do.

      <title>Fundamentals of the Dharma: Wise View</title>

      <description>Wise view is fundamental to every thing we do in the dharma. Having a&amp;nbsp;direction establishes a context for all dharma activities. Without it we&amp;nbsp;flounder and move in the direction of our conditioning toward pleasure&amp;nbsp;and ease. Simply stated, wise view is the view that our thoughts distort&amp;nbsp;our perceptions away from the inherent interconnection of all things.&amp;nbsp;Working in clear alignment with interconnection allows us the courage&amp;nbsp;and intention to move toward the difficult, toward that which seems to&amp;nbsp;separate, and confirm the truth of oneness. All dharma activity must be&amp;nbsp;in accordance with that intention, or it will further support the&amp;nbsp;conditioned sense of separation.

      <title>Fundamentals of the Dharma: Generosity</title>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://seattleinsight.org/Talks/BrowseTalks/DharmaTalk/tabid/90/TalkID/567/Default.aspx</guid>
      <description>Why is generosity a fundamental dharma issue? The dharma opens us beyond our self-limitations, and generosity is the essential direction of that opening. There is a balance between staying within ourselves and our understanding without idealizing the dharma while working with our edges that keep us contained within ourselves. Generosity is the authentic journey out of that container where we realize we were never alone or isolated. Generosity is the manifestation in action of connectedness and is the fundamental conduit of a life lived from the heart.

      <description>We usually approach ethical conduct (sila) from either righteousness (morality) or idealism (I must never harm any living thing!) but not often from stability and unification of heart. From the heart we just see what is appropriate to do and do it within the context of connection and nonharm. When we transgress we learn and move on and never expect anything miraculous or perfect in any way. We simply live within the fullness of our humanity, and that is enough.
