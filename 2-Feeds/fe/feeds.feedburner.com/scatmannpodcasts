      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick word from me before year 2010 becomes a thing of a past:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wish you, your family and friends a happy and a healthy year of 2011!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, I hope that (online) poker has been treating you well in 2010 and will continue to do so in year 2011 as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you've had a rough year playing poker this year, I've got a piece of advice for you – after all, this is a blog about poker, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, when it comes to poker luck can be a bitch as well. Sometimes, she's your best friend, helping you hit miracle cards on the river…other times, she mercilessly helps your opponent knock down your pocket Aces with a 910suited allin preflop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure you have experienced that before, and have a pretty good understanding of how upsetting something like this can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But fortunately for you and me (as poker players who rely more on skill than luck), lady luck plays only a small part in the game of poker - you can keep minimizing the effect of luck by constantly improving your skills of playing poker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, do not forget to devote some of your time in 2011 towards becoming (even) better poker player!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers to winning as many massive pots as you can in year 2011! : )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a post from: &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net" title="Online poker guide - poker bonuses and promotions, poker room reviews"&gt;online poker guide - scatmann.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;The Benefits &amp;#038; Pitfalls Of Slowplaying Big Hands In Poker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, I stumbled upon a poker video where Chris Ferguson talks about slowplaying in poker (you can &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/slowplayingvideo/"&gt;click here to watch the video&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I havent written anything about slowplaying big hands in poker, I though this might be the right  moment to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;Now You Can Play Rush Poker Games From Your Mobile Phone!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online poker room &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FullTiltPoker/"&gt;Full Tilt Poker&lt;/a&gt; has introduced an interesting novelty in the world of online poker. The novelty I have in mind is called Rush Poker Mobile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I though you may want to know about it (perhaps you already do?), so here I am, giving you a quick shout out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, you can now play the fastest online poker game from your mobile phone – which means you can play free or real-money poker games anytime you want, wherever you want!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Not sure what Rush Poker is? Read &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/how-to-play-rush-poker-basics-tips-from-howard-lederer/"&gt;how to play Rush Poker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/rush-poker-tournaments-introduction-at-full-tilt-poker/"&gt;Rush Poker tournaments&lt;/a&gt; then.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid isPermaLink="false">http://scatmann.net/?p=973</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I wrote quite some blog posts on Lucky Ace Poker, I figured it would be good idea to sum all of them up in one place. As a result, this Lucky Ace Poker Room review was written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with Lucky Ace yet or would like to find out what my previous posts related to this online poker room were, I invite you to keep on reading!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Introduction To Lucky Ace Poker Room&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post served as an official announcement that scatmann.net has started to promote another online poker room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important thing to note from &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/new-online-poker-site-lucky-ace-poker/"&gt;new online poker site Lucky Ace poker&lt;/a&gt; is that they do not accept players from United States Of America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Poker Sign-up Bonus At Lucky Ace Poker Room&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When deciding which online poker room to join, most players want to know about the available sign-up or first deposit bonuses available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out more about &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/poker-sign-up-bonus-at-lucky-ace-poker/"&gt;poker sign up bonus at Lucky Ace Poker&lt;/a&gt;, I suggest clicking previous link and reading about it there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Lucky Ace Poker Loyalty Program&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to bonuses, we as poker players are also interested in long-term benefits of playing at certain (online) poker room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will best understand Lucky Ace from this perspective by taking a closer look at &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/lucky-ace-poker-loyalty-program/"&gt;lucky ace poker loyalty program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Freerolls For New Players At Lucky Ace Poker&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a new player at Lucky Ace you are not only eligible to their awesome first deposit bonus, but you get bunch of other great stuff as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reading this post: &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/poker-freeroll-for-new-players-at-lucky-ace-poker/"&gt;exclusive poker freeroll for new players at Lucky Ace&lt;/a&gt; you will discover that this online poker site gives new players a ticket for &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/5000-online-freeroll-tournament-at-lucky-ace-poker/"&gt;$5000 online poker freeroll tournament&lt;/a&gt; with no strings attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is sign up with them, wait until the freeroll is announced and then sign up for it. You will find all additional information in the above blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Guaranteed Online Poker Tournaments At Lucky Ace&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post will introduce you to regular &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/regular-guaranteed-prize-pool-online-poker-tournaments-at-lucky-ace-poker/"&gt;guaranteed prize pool online poker tournaments at Lucky Ace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will discover, this particular internet poker site has some great variety of guaranteed tourneys, with range not only in prizepools and buyins, but in structure as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following post: &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/lucky-ace-poker-promotions-in-march-2010/"&gt;Lucky Ace Poker Promotions In March 2010&lt;/a&gt; also includes some additional information on their guaranteed tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Lucky Ace Promotions For New Poker Players&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, Lucky Ace has lots of additional promotions for their new players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have summarized them in &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/lucky-ace-poker-room-promotions-for-new-players/"&gt;Lucky Ace poker room promotions for new players&lt;/a&gt;. You should definitely read this one if you plan to sign up with this online poker site in near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Mixing Casino And Poker At Lucky Ace&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are like some of the poker players, then I am sure you like to mix things up by playing other, more »gambling« types of games as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky Ace gives you great opportunity to do that. Read how to &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/play-online-casino-games-get-entry-to-3000-online-poker-tournament/"&gt;get entry to $2000 online poker tournament&lt;/a&gt; just by playing casino games for additional information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you got all the information you need abouts Lucky Ace Poker Room in this review. If you have anything to add, I will be glad to read about it in the comment below! &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;Full Tilt Online Poker Series Keep Getting Bigger And Bigger!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been three (3) months since &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/full-tilt-online-poker-series-ftops-xvi-april-2010/"&gt;FTOPS XVI&lt;/a&gt; have been announced on scatmann.net. Guess what? Full Tilt Poker is preparing another Full Tilt Online Poker Series event - FTOPS XVII!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I am (almost) certain you want to know more about this online poker event, it is time to make another announcement! Read my words below to find out what FTOPS XVII has to offer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FTOPS XVII: 34 Events - $19 million in prizepool!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, FTOPS XVII will take place online at &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FullTiltPoker/"&gt;Full Tilt Poker&lt;/a&gt;, beginning on 4th of August 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 30 events with guranteed prizepool of $18 million in the last series. This time there will be 34 events altogether with the guranteed prizepool of $19 million! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means more events and more money to be won in Full Tilt Online Poker Series XVII. One more reason to join the action, isnt it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Biggest Online Poker Tournaments on FTOPS XVII&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two huge FTOPS XVII online poker tournaments that you definitely need to know about!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two-Day Event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The first tournament is called »Two-Day Event« and has a guaranteed prizepool of at least $2 million. It is scheduled to start at August 14th 2010 at 14:00 ET.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can buying directly for $2,000 + $100 or play satellites to get the seat. The lowest buyin for the satellite is $1 or 50 FTP points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure of the tournament is unique by itself as well. The blinds change every 30 minutes and you get 6,000 chips to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name suggest, the tourney is going to be played for two days. The first day will continue until level 17 or until all the players get into the money. The second day starts at 14:00 ET and will be played to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FTOPS XVII Main Event&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This tourney is huge as well - The guaranteed prizepool for the FTOPS XVII Main Event is $3 million!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rush Poker Tournaments on FTOPS XVII&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first time that rush poker tournaments are going to be played at &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FullTiltPoker/"&gt;Full Tilt&lt;/a&gt; Online Poker Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six (6) events are going to be played in rush poker mode and they all have guaranteed prize pools. The lowest guaranteed prize pool rush poker event is $150,000 (Event #27) and the highest guranteed prizepool is $750,000 (Event #33).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Satellites And Additional Information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get tickets for all FTOPS XVII events through satellites and qualifiers as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially interesting is Satellite Challenge, where you can win not only one, but several tickets for Full Tilt Online Poker Series XVII events. For all additional information, I suggest visiting and registering at &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FullTiltPoker/"&gt;Full Tilt Poker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;Full Tilt Poker's Big Little $100,000 Guaranteed Tournaments Are Back – Not For Long Though!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Little Tournaments at &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FullTiltPoker/"&gt;Full Tilt Poker&lt;/a&gt; are back! Not familiar with these types of tournaments yet? No problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just read this blog posts and you will soon know everything you need to know about these low buyin – high prizepool online poker tournaments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Buyins For Big Little Tournaments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, Big Little Tournament is an online poker tournament that has a very low buy-in of $2 + $0.20 on one hand, and a very high guaranteed prize pool of $100,000 on the other hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prize money for the winner of the tournament is $9,000!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason why you should start playing these poker tournaments is because it gives you an opportunity to win big without having to spend hundreds of dollars for the buyin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are not many online poker tournaments that would give you a chance to turn a $2 buyin into $9000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are currently grinding on micro &amp;#038; low stakes players, then I am sure you will recognize your opportunity here and join in at least one of the seven (7) Big Little Tournaments left to be played!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where &amp;#038; When &amp;#038; How Often Are Big Little Tournaments Going To Be Played?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Little Tournaments are played online at &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FullTiltPoker/"&gt;Full Tilt Poker&lt;/a&gt; room. Altogether, eight (8) $100,000 poker tournaments are scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one was played on 18th of July 2010 and the last one is going to be played on 24th of October 2010 (every second Sunday). The start time of every tournament is 12:30 ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Play Satellites To Get Tickets For Big Little Tournament!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your bankroll is too small and does not allow you to buy into the tournament directly, then consider playing satellites!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many satellites available that can help you get a ticket for big little tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, you can join 180 players Sit &amp;#038; Go qualifier for as little as 5 FTP points. Or you could join 9 players Sit &amp;#038; Go Turbo satellite for $0.30 + $0.05.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice is definitely yours! But I would definitely recommend you to take part in these kinds of &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FullTiltPoker/"&gt;Full Tilt Poker&lt;/a&gt; tournaments as the prizes are worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can register for Big Little Tournament by logging into the software (or register at &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FullTiltPoker/"&gt;Full Tilt Poker&lt;/a&gt; first) and then use navigation: Tournament / Guarantee / Hold'em / No Limit / Micro to find it.

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;Discover Five (5) Rush Poker Tips From Full Tilt Poker Pro Andy Bloch!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rush Poker is catching on quickly, that is a fact. It seems like every one wants to experience the rush and excitement that this very unique form of poker has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you one of my readers who enjoy playing and making money out of &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FullTiltPoker/"&gt;Rush Poker on FTP&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You just have to read today's blog post then! Keep reading to find out why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy Bloch, Full Tilt Poker Pro who has up to date earned more than $4.2 million in tournament winnings and has also finished 2nd in WSOP 2006 H.O.R.S.E. Event (buy-in for this live poker event was $50 000!), has published very interesting and helpful rush poker video lesson that you do not want to miss out on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch the lesson for free at &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FTPokerAcademy/"&gt;FTP Academy&lt;/a&gt;. Simply log into FTP Academy (or register first), find Andy Bloch's video titled »5 Tips on Rush Poker« and watch it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What You Will Learn About Rush Poker From Andy Bloch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already watched the video and I must say I like it! The tips Andy Bloch is talking about can definitely help you win (more) at rush poker if you put them in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the quick review of the first three (out of five) lessons that Andy is going share with you in the video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Rush Poker Tip: Play Solid Poker&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first advice about rush poker that Andy Bloch is going to tell you about is: You need to play solid poker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should play solid game because Rush poker attracts lots of action players. Therefore, there is no need for you to be (too) creative, if you want to beat these action players. All you need to take home the money is to play solid poker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Rush Poker Tip: Players Play Tighter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know, rush poker has a quick fold option. Once you press that button, you are immediately taken to a new table with new players and a new hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, (most) players will be folding a lot more than they would in a normal game of poker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means for you as a rush poker player? It means once you raise and get called or someone raises preflop, chances that your opponent has a solid hand are much higher than in usual online poker games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Rush Poker Tip: There Is Nothing Wrong With Slowing Down&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing with rush poker is that it is a very fast game. You are either folding until you get a hand that is worth playing or you are actually playing it. There is no time for waiting or observing others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not until you actually take that time. Andy Bloch therefore suggests you take some time off by clicking »deal me out« or use a time bank (for tough decisions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, these are just three (3) out of five (5) rush poker tips that Andy Bloch is going to introduce you to in the discussed video. To see the actual video, go to &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FTPokerAcademy/"&gt;Full Tilt Poker Academy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those of you who have been playing poker for quite some time now are completely familiar with the fact that bad beats and down swings are part of (online) poker games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downswing can be defined as losing quite some amount of money in short period of time due to so called bad beats or cold decks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, I am pretty certain you have at some point in your poker »career« had or experience a previously defined downswing (if you haven't then I guess you are quite new to poker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nothing unusal of course, but (as mentioned above) rather something that every poker player can expect to happen (sooner or later). In this post, I am going to give you a couple of ideas about how to deal with downswings and bad beats in poker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I do that, let me quickly give you one or two example of bad beat or cold deck situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An Example Of Bad Beat And Downswing In Poker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you are holding pocket Aces on the Button (position before Small Blind). Players on the first two positions fold their cards the the player in the early middle position raises four (4) times big blind (standard open raise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every body folds and the turn to act comes your way. Naturally, you raise that player making it 10 times big blind. Small blind and big blind both fold and the turn to act gets back to the original raiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thinks for about two (2) seconds and then shoves (goes allin) for the rest of his chips. Of course, you call very quickly (after all, you are holding pocket Aces, which is the best possible preflop hand you can get).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see that original raisor is holding pocket Fives. You have him on the leash as only two remaining Fives can save him from getting busted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dealer spreads the cards and your opponent hits another 5 on the river, which means your pocket Aces just got cracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an example of so called bad beat or cold deck situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such situations happen quite commonly when playing poker. When you experience several situations like that in short period of time (like 20 times in a week), this can be defined as downswing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How To Deal With Bad Beats, Cold Decks And Downswings When Playing Poker?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said, lets now see what is the best way to deal with such situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below I share a couple of tips or hints that are not necessarily the best way of handling bad beats and downswings, but can be useful if you apply them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Expect Bad Beats And Downswings To Happen&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having bad beats and downswings when playing poker is something you can not and will not avoid in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking it will not affect you is like sticking your head into the sand in the middle of nowhere and imagining you are on Bahamas. While you certainly can convince yourself that you are indeed on Bahamas, the reality will get you sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore better to expect bad beats and downswings to happen. In such way, you will not look at them as the end of the world, but it will be easier for you to accept them as part of the poker game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Eliminate Emotions From Your Poker Game&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest »problem« that players have to face when having a downswing is the emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that you have just lost a full buyin to some idiot who could not fold pocket Fives to your big reraise can be really frustrating, I know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When this happens, try to deal with it without going nuts. By doing this, you will not only preserve your good mood, but also protect yourself from tilting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing you want to do is going on tilt and risking additional buyin to get that money back in the next hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you cant stop yourself from being mad, pissed off or whatever you do after experiencing a bad beat, then the best thing you can do is stop playing poker for a while and instead go for a walk, call your girlfriend or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Stay Focused&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, do not let bad beats and downswings affect the way you play your next hand and the hand after that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, you should stay focused and keep playing according to your (hopefully winning) strategy as this is the only way to make money in the poker in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your concentration drops, you could potentially lose more money in that session but not due to bad beat but due to bad decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all for now from me about how to handle bad beats and downswings in poker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be more than happy to hear it from you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you handle bad beats and downswings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have any other advice regarding this matter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Downswing can be defined as losing quite some amount of money in short period of time due to so called bad beats or cold decks. With that said, I am pretty certain you have at some point in your poker »career« had or experience a previously defined downswing (if you haven't then I guess you are quite new to poker). This is nothing unusal of course, but (as mentioned above) rather something that every poker player can expect to happen (sooner or later). In this post, I am going to give you a couple of ideas about how to deal with downswings and bad beats in poker. Before I do that, let me quickly give you one or two example of bad beat or cold deck situation. An Example Of Bad Beat And Downswing In Poker Imagine that you are holding pocket Aces on the Button (position before Small Blind). Players on the first two positions fold their cards the the player in the early middle position raises four (4) times big blind (standard open raise). Every body folds and the turn to act comes your way. Naturally, you raise that player making it 10 times big blind. Small blind and big blind both fold and the turn to act gets back to the original raiser. He thinks for about two (2) seconds and then shoves (goes allin) for the rest of his chips. Of course, you call very quickly (after all, you are holding pocket Aces, which is the best possible preflop hand you can get). You see that original raisor is holding pocket Fives. You have him on the leash as only two remaining Fives can save him from getting busted. The dealer spreads the cards and your opponent hits another 5 on the river, which means your pocket Aces just got cracked. This is an example of so called bad beat or cold deck situation. Such situations happen quite commonly when playing poker. When you experience several situations like that in short period of time (like 20 times in a week), this can be defined as downswing. How To Deal With Bad Beats, Cold Decks And Downswings When Playing Poker? With that said, lets now see what is the best way to deal with such situations. Below I share a couple of tips or hints that are not necessarily the best way of handling bad beats and downswings, but can be useful if you apply them. 1. Expect Bad Beats And Downswings To Happen Having bad beats and downswings when playing poker is something you can not and will not avoid in the long run. Thinking it will not affect you is like sticking your head into the sand in the middle of nowhere and imagining you are on Bahamas. While you certainly can convince yourself that you are indeed on Bahamas, the reality will get you sooner or later. It is therefore better to expect bad beats and downswings to happen. In such way, you will not look at them as the end of the world, but it will be easier for you to accept them as part of the poker game. 2. Eliminate Emotions From Your Poker Game The biggest »problem« that players have to face when having a downswing is the emotions. The fact that you have just lost a full buyin to some idiot who could not fold pocket Fives to your big reraise can be really frustrating, I know! When this happens, try to deal with it without going nuts. By doing this, you will not only preserve your good mood, but also protect yourself from tilting. The last thing you want to do is going on tilt and risking additional buyin to get that money back in the next hand. If you cant stop yourself from being mad, pissed off or whatever you do after experiencing a bad beat, then the best thing you can do is stop playing poker for a while and instead go for a walk, call your girlfriend or whatever. 3. Stay Focused Again, do not let bad beats and downswings affect the way you play your next hand and the hand after that one.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I want to inform you about pretty cool promotion that is going on at the &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FullTiltPoker/"&gt;Full Tilt Poker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, this online poker room has some of the best poker players in their team. To name just a couple of them: Phil Ivey, Gus Hansen, Tom Dwan, Chris Ferguson, Patrik Antonius and Allen Cunningham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let me ask you this: &lt;strong&gt;Would you like to play live poker tournament with these guys for a total prize of $120,000?&lt;/strong&gt; Who wouldn't want to do that, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure it would be great to talk to some of these players and ask them whats up with them! In case you win the tournament, getting those $120,000 would be nice addition to the whole experience as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think playing live poker with the Pros is impossible, then you have probably not heard of the &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FullTiltPoker/"&gt;Full Tilt Poker&lt;/a&gt; promotion called Poker Lounge before! Let me explain this a little bit further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the Poker Lounge is a series of 10 TV Poker shows (like High Stakes Poker for example) that will be airing on Chanel 4 on Tuesdays from June 22nd 2010 to Avgust 24th 2010 and will be featuring 5 FTP professionals + 1 FTP player playing eachother in live poker tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part about the Poker Lounge is the fact that you can participate in one of these shows too! Here is how you can get an entry to the above mentioned TV Poker show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to qualify for the Poker Lounge TV Show&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way of qualifying for this TV Show is by playing Poker Lounge online qualifiers at &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FullTiltPoker/"&gt;Full Tilt Poker&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These qualifiers have been running there from April 4th and will continue to do so until the July 4th 2010. Basically, 4 qualifiers are still to be played: two (2) on June 13th, one (1) on June 20th and the last one on July 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can buy into these qualifiers directly for $600 + $40 (exception: the buyin for the qualifier on June 13th is $300 + $22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not worry if this sum of money is more than your bankroll allows you to buyin at this moment. There are also satellites available. The lowest satellite buyin is $10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a long way to buyin into the satellite for $10, win it, get a ticket for Poker Lounge Qualifier, win it, get a ticket for Poker Lounge TW Show, win it and get a prize of $120,000 but nonetheless, it can be done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find the qualifiers and satellites in the &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net/go/FullTiltPoker/"&gt;Full Tilt Poker&lt;/a&gt; lobby under Tournaments / Live Events / All / All Types / Highest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish you all the best! In case you do get a ticket for Poker Lounge TV Show, say hi to the FTP Pros from me as well! : ) Good luck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a post from: &lt;a href="http://scatmann.net" title="Online poker guide - poker bonuses and promotions, poker room reviews"&gt;online poker guide - scatmann.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
