		<itunes:summary>SHONOTES!!!
Oh…My…Goodness….as we all enter the dog days of summer in the northern hemisphere, the Trans-Atlantic duo finally got their act together and completed the long awaited Episode 101.  So begins the E-phase! Run time for this Episode is 48:33.
So what’s in store for this Episode?  The NPC Hosts, Steve and Rob, give us a gaming update focusing on Steve’s Victopia Campaign and they talk about the mechanics of his homebrew system for it.  They also talk about a new campaign they started up with Rob as GM for Pathfinder using the Kingmaker Adventure path.  That along with our regular features of News and Questions.  
News
All things Star Wars…
1.  Fantasy Flight Games scores the Star Wars gaming Liscense!  Is their a new Star Wars RPG in development?
2.  Could a possible RPG be set in the Old Republic?  The new MMO by Bioware is check it out.
3.  Steve’s been busy, check out his web comic for the TOROCast!
4.  A Star Wars Comic by Dark Horse.
5.  Which do you prefer?
  
And now for Pathfinder!
6.  Check out the Pathfinder RPG by Paizo and their Kingmaker Adventure Path.  Here is the Pathfinder SRD to keep you Frugal!
 
7.  For added fun and to streamline your games take a look at Hero Lab from Lone Wolf and Fantasy Grounds II from Smite Works.
8.  A must see comes from our own Lord Zed, who has done quite well with his entry into the Splicers RPG contest over at Palladium Books called the Soothsayer Cult.

Frugal Gamer
Speaking of Frugal, while Steve and Rob didn’t get to this on the show, we figured we’d post these for you to take advantage of.
1.  Get some old school magazine love with a free issue of Fight On! and Oubliette.
2.  The Star Wars RPG was once D6, get d6 Space and d6 Space Ships free to see what it was like over at RPGNow
Question Corner
1.  The NPC Hosts try to answer the question from one of our listeners, “How about what do you do when something happens and your dm kills a character, not someone dies fighting but the dm actually kills the character off.”  How about you?  How do you deal with your PC being killed by the GM?  Is it their fault? Is it yours? Join the discussion!

“Black Snow” for “Sword_Slice_15″ (and 16 and 17)

This is TheMetal1 and Glinbog from the forums writing to inform you that the hosts of this podcast have been tied up and thrown overboard. At least, we’ve turned them into NPC’s until they are able to return and do another game session. No Chupacabras have been harmed in the making of this podcast. Bob is still being cared for, don’t worry. (If we didn’t, he’d probably eat us…)
What’s in Store?
This episode we’ll talk about Mutants and Masterminds, thrown in a Frugal Gamer, discuss the Green Ronin Gamer Stimulus Package, virtual tabletops and much more!</itunes:summary>

On the podcast this week, we step back into the player’s shoes, and look at ways to try and remedy common game problems from the player’s point of view. We’ve talked about this before from the Game Master’s point of view, but there are definitely things that can be done as a player to kick the campaign back into gear.
Captain Drake is back
And he’s got some great advice to hand out. We were lucky enough to have him in-studio while recording and it worked out great. We hope to have him back again.</itunes:summary>

		<description><![CDATA[Dynamic Terrains. To me this phrase brings up a picture of the ground moving and shaking beneath the character&#8217;s feet. And this wouldn&#8217;t be too far from the truth. Dynamic Terrains are a phrase that Chuck and I coined over at the Dragon&#8217;s Landing Podcast. At least, if it&#8217;s been used elsewhere, we don&#8217;t know [...]]]></description>

		<itunes:summary>D is for Drake
Or Eric. Yeah, confusing, we know. This week’s guest is Eric Williams, a band-mate of Chuck’s in Captain Black’s Sea Dogges, and a long-timer gamer of 25+ years. The character he plays in the RenFest circuit is Capt. Drake. Hence the D. He was kind enough to fill in on very short notice when our scheduled guest came down sick. Thanks Eric!
And It’s Your Turn
It’s time for your voice to be heard once again in the Dragon’s Landing Inn. Since we had several good voicemails, we didn’t have time for any emails. Listen in to find out how to make sure your voice gets heard next time.
Birthing Another Podcast
Just like we’ve done in the past, we get to host a short mini-cast for you. This is called The Game Mechanics that aims to discuss game mechanics (eh, what else?) in an abstract way. The audio has some weird artifacts happening throughout that I don’t know if they’re there from my end or theirs, but we’ll work on getting that fixed up for the next time.
Turn Up The Peace
As I noted yesterday, Eric is also involved in a project that aims to bring conscious evolution of Peace, Unity and Loving Kindness to humanity around the globe. Listen in for more information, or visit the Turn Up The Peace website.</itunes:summary>

David’s Back
Not History Dave, he’s almost always here anymore! Nope. David Moore is our guest host again this week. He used to run the After Serenity podcast, and currently is hard at work on the Game Master Show, as well as working behind the scenes on Buffy Between the Lines.
And You’re Hooked
By listener demand, we present the first of our “Hook of the Month” episodes. We each gathered around the fireside and gave ideas for new situations, characters, and more. Sure to get your creative juices flowing.</itunes:summary>

Gaming Style
Every campaign could use some style. Not Gucci or Pierre Cardin, but it should have a unique take on the genre that it’s being played in.
This week’s round-table discussion is all about gaming with style.

		<itunes:summary>D is for Different
It’s the start of a brand new format here at the Dragon’s Landing Inn! That’s right, you’ll now get a brand-spanking new episode damn near every week from us, once again. Granted, they won’t be as long as they have been in the past, but we’ve had listeners clamoring for shorter shows for years now, and we finally found a way to give it to you. The only question in our mind was “Why didn’t we think of this sooner?”
Along with the new format we’ll be having special guests take part with us. Stay tuned until next week to find out who this month’s guest is.
News and Notes
This week we fill you in on the new format, and it also turned into a pimping session, with Chuck letting us listen to one of his original songs on Captain Black’s Sea Dogges new album. Yup. You heard it right, you can now get your grubby little hands on your very own copy. Then Lonnie let us know that his fantasy thriller novel, Daughter of the Sun, will very shortly be available to purchase on the iPhone/iPod Touch App Store. Sweet news for both of them!
Guest Segment
Chris Perrin, co-host of the Canon Puncture podcast stops by, once again, to give us a review of Box Ninja’s 3:16. Thanks, Chris! Great as always!
And the Norm
As always, our trademark zaniness is well in play.
Enjoy, and Game on!

		<itunes:summary>After fighting off swarms of pirates, batting through forests of code, and NOT doing mounds of laundry for those Fear-the-Boot guys, the DLI crew have made it back to civilization with a new treasure! That’s right – a new episode for the faithful that have waited with baited breath (or not…).
This episode marks the beginning of a new season, here at DLI: Phase D. You read that right, it’s not Delta, or Deltoid, or even Django, just D. Why? Because those were all too taken…and because we want to know what you want it to be called. What do you think D should stand for this season?
This also marks our anniversary! Not with the wife, but the podcast itself. That’s 3 years (more or less) of gaming goodness.
We discuss how “summer vacation” was for everyone, discuss DnD 4e, and more in over 2 hours of zany gaming goodness!
We hope you enjoy it and are glad to be back!</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>First off, let’s bid our awesome sponsor, RPGNow.com a sad farewell, and thanks for the support! 
The episode is late. If you were on the forums you know that Lonnie got a new iMac and Garageband crashed when we first tried recording. That’s all good, though, since History Dave wasn’t able to make it that time, but this time he did. The hoorays can quit now…
This time around we’re discussing the great things — and say Thanks! — to Mr. Gary Gygax now that he’s passed away. Something we should have done long before. We also get back to a little discussion about our new world. Lots of goodness!
Just a couple of notes this week:

From Josh – Mid East Con in Richmond, VA – Trying to get this new Con started. If you’re in the area, or willing to drive, be sure to visit his site and tell him what you’d love to see.
The guys from Midnight Syndicate sent us their new soundtrack for the upcoming movie Rage. We give you a small peak, but you can always grab your own copy.

		<itunes:summary>Where’s Dave-o? That’s right, back to the basics this week as we were not able to get together with History Dave. Darn Kobolds!
You’ve got a great reason to jump over to our sponsor’s site, this week, RPGNow.com. Flying Buffalo has become a part of the site, and they’re releasing the Tunnels and Trolls RPG for free!
Since we were without History Dave, the feature this week is a grab-bag of questions that our listeners have asked over the years that we felt we hadn’t touched on enough.
This week’s news:

RivCa has started a Play By Post on the boards. Looks like it’s going to be fun, and I believe there’s still room for you!
Kobold Quarterly – http://www.koboldquarterly.com – by Wolfgang Baur
Among others, Judd, Gary, Arcangel, and Dan all recognized that Marshall Will and Holly were the characters from Land of the Lost.  Dan went on to mention that Will Farell’s character from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was named Willenhollie, and he was a feredal marshall.
We’ve played a bit of their music for you all before, but Erdenstern – Into The Green is available on iTunes, and they are working on their fifth album, “Into the Gold”. Pretty good mood music for gamers.
Yax from www.dungeonmastering.com is writing a blurb about us this month.  Very cool website…
New gaming podcast – Wap Caplets is an audio-blog of my opinions and thoughts on gaming.

		<itunes:summary>Happy Holidays to all of our wonderful listeners!
Be sure to check out all of the great deals at RPGNow.com, especially if you’re looking for some of that Reverse Dungeon goodness (thanks Nor’Morgwae)!
In the feature this week, we took our listeners advice and actually start creating a new world which will ultimately be the default world for CORE! It’s a fun and lively discussion, and we think we’ve got some interesting ideas brewing…
And now… the news:

New RPG podcast, and the only all-Hebrew RPG podcast – Hamishakia
Justinthebig has a new podcast – All Things Medieval. Way to go Justin!
Arriving with little to no fanfare, the Dragonlance DVD “Dragon’s of Autumn Twilight” is available for purchase
We hate to report it, but Erik Wujcik is dying of cancer…

		<itunes:summary>Wow! How the time gets away from you at the holidays. We’ve actually had this recorded for a couple of weeks, and edited for about a week. I’m such a slacker. So think of it as a great way to start the new year!
Once again, we have to give a huge thanks to our sponsor, RPGNow.com. These guys have always had the best selection and price and digital (and occasionally print) RPG products.
In the feature this week, we take a break from the Campaign Creation series and do a segment on bards.
[NEWS]

Along the lines of our Legend of the Green Dragon, here’s another old favorite: Hack n’ Slash.
History mentioned that Australian’s are more American than Americans. According to Pete, here’s funny proof that Australian’s wouldn’t take that as a compliment!
Chuck got interviewed for an article that appeared in our local paper. And you thought we could talk!
Jim in Buffalo pointed us to a hilarious spoof on the Chick Tracts.

[FRUGAL LINKS]

the Mind Unveiled Dreamscape at RPGNow.com. It’s a great companion to Lonnie’s own Liber Sodalitas: Dream Healers.
d20 to FATE conversion manual.
Wikipedia article on Bards. Good info, if a little dry.
Highmoon Media’s Bardic Lore: Ogham
Some free info on the Ogham.
the Bard’s Guild – songs, midi, history and fantasy, good stories, and more!
Cariadoc’s Miscellany – from an SCA source, lots of good information from recipes to stories to great info to keep you in character.

The links are sparse this week, but here they are:

Tim contacted us to let us know about a tool he has created for gaming over the internet, including voice chat. It looks pretty nice, and isn’t just for RPGs.
Glinbog has updated his CORE Module maker as well as the first draft of additional options for character generation. He’s looking for feedback, so be sure to stop by the forums and let him know what you think.

		<itunes:summary>Wow. We didn’t mean for it to take that long! Between extremely busy schedules, we did manage to get Chuck, Lonnie and History Dave all around the table again, though! 
This week’s feature continues the Campaign Creation series (that’s #2 for you counting along at home.) We pick 4 characters from our listeners post over on the forums, and discuss how we would go about creating a campaign from the information they gave us. We’ve got some great ideas, but we want to hear yours, too! Stop by the forums, and leave your ideas for a campaign around these characters. And feel free to think outside of the box!

The opening this week is from Anim5, and man – it absolutely rocks! Thanks so much Anim5!
For the feature this week, we start into a new series on Campaign Creation. This will be an extension on our much-loved World Building series that we did many moons ago. This week we look into where to get your ideas from. Don’t forget to stop by the forums and leave a short character idea. If the dice are on your side, we’ll use it the upcoming episodes.
Those of you that didn’t make it to GenCon to see the Ennies are in for a special treat. Dan from Fear The Boot gave an excellent speech at the Ennies. A must see.
Yes, the rumors are true. D&amp;D 4th Edition is to be released next year. Find out more information at Wizards official site.
History Dave passed on a little fun from the other side of the world. While it’s a pretty humorous take on old-school gaming, it is definitely not family-friendly in parts. 
We are honored to have a new segment – the Dragon’s Landing IndieBrew! Chris Perrin from the Canon Puncture podcast will be providing semi-regular reviews of the best in Indie Games.
We are thrilled to be back and hanging out with all of you wonderful gamers!</itunes:summary>

A Special Note 
A popular podcaster and friend to many in the podosphere, Joe Murphy died on Sunday from cancer. He will be missed very much, but there’s a way we can all make his death into something meaningful: www.joemurphymemorialfund.org has been set up both to help the family out financially during this time of loss and provide a place for everyone’s memories of this great guy to be put where friends and family can read through. Any money raised above and beyond what is needed for his expenses will go toward a setting up a charity fund in his name for the research of the type of cancer he died from. If you can spare a few dollars, please consider donating.

New podcast – The Art of Roleplaying
April/May issue of the Geek Gazette is out
Chupa (CORE) Basic and advanced finally available!
One of our recent fave commercials: Alltell Ad – What level Dungeon Master are you?

We’d like to thank Pen And Paper Games, once again, for helping us out by sponsoring. After the first few days of air time, they had already gained nearly 100 new members. Thank you, listeners for visiting their site and signing up. That will make their site — especially the gamer locater — that much more effective! You all are awesome.

And this week, we actually have a second sponsor as well. You’ve heard us talk about them before. You’ve probably even heard their promos a time or two or three. That’s right, it’s the ultra-funky Geek Label Tees guys. If you haven’t been to their site, it’s a must visit. They have some of the coolest, funnest, and just plain geekiest shirts (and more!) around. Chuck and I both own some ourselves, and the quality is awesome. Check them out. ‘Nuff said.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>First, the good news. We made it! Thank you for your patience as our schedules kept us too busy to actually edit the crazy thing!
Now, the not-so-great news. You’ll hear this on the show, but I wanted to post it here, also. For the immediate future, the show will be going to an every other week schedule (unless you count snafu’s like this one). They’ll probably grow a little longer, possible even back to the 1:30 or 1:45 range, just so we can still fit in plenty of the gaming goodness you’ve come to expect.
And now for the absolutely fantastic news. We’d like to give a huge shout out to the great guys over and PenAndPaperGames.com for being our first sponsor. We had a blast working up an audio ad for him, and we hope you enjoy it. And thanks for helping us keep the show running!
Well, as promised, this week was another great Free Talk week, but we do have some news to share, so here goes:

From Hamhara and Mollarom- someone got caught up in the moment
From Patrick – Another gamers seeking gamers website
Games Expo 2007 in Las Vegas – March 18-22
YourGamesNow.com is the official sponsor of the Ennies at GenCon
RapidPOD has opened the POD publishing section with good prices and a wide variety of products – including card game type … stuff.
Britain to ban the sale and importation of Samurai Swords?
The First episode of the Gamer Traveler podcast is now available
The Zero episode of the Dragonlance Canticle is also now available
Congrats to Chad over at Fear The Boot for becoming a new daddy!

This week’s podcast has rogues as the theme. In the Frugal Gamer, we go over some various links we found across the internet that could help your knowledge and increase your roleplaying possibilities when playing the rogue, or thief. Warning: This information is linked to for entertainment and educational purposes. In other words, don’t try any of this at home! Okay, legal mumbo-jumbo out of the way!
In our feature, we take a look at various styles of rogues, and things to consider when playing them on TV. Or in your game. Your pick.
But first, some news:

March 4th was GM’s Day – Thanks to Mark Clover from Creative MUNTAIN Games for coming up with that

New expansion for Lootin’ Wizards by Dragavan – Curses! Foiled Again!

And here’s the nefarious items from the Frugal Gamer. You did read the warning above right? No? Go read it, and then come back. Good. Now have fun.

Thieves Cant – dictionary of cant from the 1700s
English to Cant and Cant to English translations, with advanced cant to make it into a full language.
The rest of the above website has netbooks, maps, a thieves campaign setting called Tarkecia, PBP forums, etc.

		<itunes:summary>As promised – this week is a different breed! We did the show live over SkypeCast and that proved to provide quite a few challenges. Please forgive some of the noise that crept into the episode towards the end.
This is mostly a Q&amp;A session that answers the questions raised over at UnCon in a round-table style format with the 8 or 10 listeners that showed up this time. We decided we will be doing these live shows again, though the format’s likely to change to something more standard and . . .aw heck. . . go listen to the podcast. You’ll get the answers there.
Oh – and adding to the fun – the ghost of Stevie Ray Vaughn joined us for a little while. You’ll have to listen to the bloopers to hear what he had to say, though.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Light on links for you this week, but the episode itself is not even close to being light on content. Here’s a few items from the weekly DLI news:

Gametap (a service that lets you play hundreds of games for a small monthly fee) has an interview with Gary Gygax about the origins of D&amp;D 
From David Schwarz – Swiss man speeding because of lack of Goats in Canada?  I guess we know where the Chupacabea is hanging out… 
Another sighting from David – White Wolf Quarterly – looks like the Shadows of Mexico supplement will actually contain Chupacabras.  Yay! 
Daniel got us the Gamer Traveller Episode 4, which provides a fascinating look at Brugge, Belgium; and ways to use it in your game.

This week we take you through building and using the elements of the Thriller story in your campaigns. Also, Mick from the Round Table brings up an awesome question about another gaming style that should have had its own feature. Maybe we can do that at some point in the future. 
A quick reminder – all donations get you a custom title over at our forums! And speaking of donations, one of listeners, Mark, was actually paying us not to change our opening music. If you feel strongly enough one way or the other – the contest is on! When you make a donation for the next few weeks, be sure to let us know if you think the intro should be changed or not, and how; you think it should be changed (if you do at all!) At the end of the "contest" we’ll tally up the votes obey our listeners! </itunes:summary>
