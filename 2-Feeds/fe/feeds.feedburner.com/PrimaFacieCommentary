 &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;i style=""&gt;“But of that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone (Mk.13:32).&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;People are strange but Christians are peculiar.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Who else but God’s own would try to figure out what Jesus said so clearly that not even He knew?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But like little Johnny who can’t resist touching the hot stove when he’s been warned, history is filled with the stories of those who thought they knew and got burned in the end.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The story of William Miller and the Millerites is our American version of this story.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Miller was a preacher and pillar of his &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;New England&lt;/st1:place&gt; community and was converted in the waves of revival that had come to the east coast and frontiers in the 1820’s.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If you were to ask him what he believed especially concerning the Scriptures and the significance of Christ, William Miller would seem to you a typical modern evangelical.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But if secrets are things we keep to ourselves (whether good or bad), Miller had a secret:&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;through his commonsense reading of the Bible particularly the books of Daniel and Revelation, and a careful study of historic chronology and current events, Jesus Christ had to be returning to earth no later than 1843.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;For at least 20 years Miller more or less kept his own counsels on this but eventually his views became known in a wider circle and he was soon made into a bit of a celebrity with the help of several publicists and organizers.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Of course his prophecy seminars with elaborate charts and weeks of nightly meetings came to many of &lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;America&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;’s big cities and Miller gained a devoted following of true believers.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;To his credit, William Miller was an effective evangelist and no charlatan.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He believed the end really was near and his message was so compelling that thousands were converted and preparing to meet the savior very soon.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;As the year drew nigh, people were interested in a specific date and Miller calculated it to early spring but no further.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;When spring came and went without the Second Coming, he suggested an error in his calculations and that it would happen the following year.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;When the inevitable came to pass, many of Miller’s followers gave up and others offered alternative explanations such as that Christ came spiritually (an excellent fall back position for people who like to overreach on an issue) and began a new work on earth.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Two groups which descend from Miller’s teaching are the Seventh Day Adventists and the Jehovah’s Witnesses who continue their teaching based on a spiritual second-coming in the mid 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Miller himself died a few years after the failed prophecy but held on to his beliefs to the very end.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;William Miller and the Millerites have three lessons to teach that are worth considering:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="1" type="1"&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;The      Second Coming of Christ is going to happen but it’s timing is not within      the purview of God’s will for humanity, but is in reality part of the      secret counsels of His will.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If we      were to know, we would probably behave badly, act faithlessly, and no      doubt try to figure out a way to profit from it.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We need to trust God that there are some      things we are not intended to know and that it is for our well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;Good,      solid, life-giving interpretation of the Bible is not done in a      vacuum.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;William Miller ignored a      legacy of nearly two millennia of Bible teaching to come up with his      views.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It is always good to read      the word for oneself and as a Christian you have every right to expect the      Holy Spirit’s assistance in understanding.&lt;span style=""&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;But the New Testament clearly teaches that the Church will have      expert teachers to explain the scriptures.&lt;span style=""&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;This doesn’t mean everyone is right about everything but it does      mean that over time consensus does build about certain ideas and wisdom would      dictate it to be prudent to at least consider the teaching of others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="MsoNormal" style=""&gt;When a      man goes out on a limb and makes a prediction in the name of the Lord the      standard of the Bible is 100% accuracy or the person is a false      teacher.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I personally believe      Miller had good intentions and motives and actually tried to avoid this      pitfall.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But to the other side of      the equation, many people who claim “God spoke to me that this is going to      come to pass….” Often equivocate when it doesn’t and spiritualize it in      some sense.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It’s a nice,      face-saving gesture (and of course saves the Lord from embarrassment at      the same time!) but it needs to be seen for what it is: a bad mistake and presumptuous      behavior.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This needs public      confession if it was a public statement, and needs to be repented of nor      recycled as a ‘spiritual event’.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25987935-4570037866286236706?l=primafaciecommentary.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><media:thumbnail url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OZWvQH0ygEU/SmYqgbNx4VI/AAAAAAAAAK8/ANWco4OQ8tw/s72-c/miller_later2.jpg" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>Why Study History?</title><link>http://primafaciecommentary.blogspot.com/2008/12/why-study-history.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Chris White)</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2009 15:38:43 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25987935.post-6379676253255048194</guid><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_OZWvQH0ygEU/SWegHS3A7vI/AAAAAAAAAGM/C6knylew6GI/s1600-h/gilgameshtablet.jpg"&gt;&lt;img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5289372334552051442" style="FLOAT: right;

Here’s a podcast about a movement within Christianity that is still going strong 100 years later. The 1906 Revival on Azusa Street in Los Angeles was seen as a dramatic hoax by the news media, an apocalyptic sign of the end of the world by some, and for others it was a revival of the glory days of Christianity as recorded in the New Testament book of Acts. Listen in as Matt and Chris uncover the story of William Seymour and the Azusa Street Revival.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.trail.org/primafaciecommentary/revival.mp3"&gt;Azusa Street Revival&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;em&gt;(Podcast time = 26:25)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25987935-114868004382810989?l=primafaciecommentary.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>Improve Your Reading by 25%</title><link>http://primafaciecommentary.blogspot.com/2006/04/improve-your-reading-by-25.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Chris White)</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2006 22:40:02 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-25987935.post-114618300863474762</guid><description>&lt;a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3725/2721/1600/bookshelf.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 0px 10px 10px 0px; CURSOR: hand" alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3725/2721/320/bookshelf.jpg" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if you could improve anything by 25%? Imagine if you could enhance your investment portfolio by that much or lose 25% of your body fat without dieting (if I knew how to do that I certainly wouldn't be writing a blog page today)! What about a 25% drop in your golf score or a 25% increase in your bowling average? How about a 25% drop in your bad cholestorol or 25% more hair on your head? Wouldn't you be ecstatic if gas prices dropped by 25%? But now we've moved from possibilities to fantasies haven't we?

There are some things that are probably best done when one is young, but most things worth doing in life can be done at any age. One of those worthwhile things is simply learning. As a matter of fact many colleges and learning institutions have long recognized and encouraged the participation of "mature students" along with those just finishing secondary school. Some are there gaining a new set of skills for a mid-life career change, while many others are taking classes for personal enrichment or a desire to complete an academic degree started in youth but discontinued out of necessity. Whether you are a young or mature student, this podcast will help you study more effectively and thus make the most of your learning experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://trail.org/primafaciecommentary/art_of_academic.mp3"&gt;The Art of Academic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Podcast - time = 26:32) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/25987935-114618189637049935?l=primafaciecommentary.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><media:rating>nonadult</media:rating></channel></rss>
