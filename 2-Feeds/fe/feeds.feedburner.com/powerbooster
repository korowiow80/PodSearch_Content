<p align="justify">I always wanted to find out what it takes to be an Entrepreneur and a Great Leader. The most fitting person was Ms. Vandana of the The Banyan. Having a &#8220;Bigger Purpose&#8221; of helping the society and also wanting to build an organization around the same purpose is not dreamt of by many people and she was a visionary. Starting with her friend Vaishnavi (See below for her interview) Vandana, carved a niche for herself and went to be a great leader.</p>
<p align="justify">She has mentioned in the interview that &#8220;A leader must attract respect&#8221;. We went on to discuss about lots of things, like how to motivate employees and so! Listen to it and drop in your comments.</p>

<p align="justify">But there is a different set of People who say &#8220;<strong>So What???</strong>&#8221; loud and clear and act with their Strengths to achieve Success in their life. More importantly they live a fulfilled life and life rewards them with abundance. Listen to one such person, <strong>Vaishnavi Jayakumar </strong>of The Banyan (<a href="http://www.thebanyan.org">www.thebanyan.org</a>). Vaishnavi is one such person for whom &#8220;<em><strong>Success is the only choice Left even for survival</strong></em>&#8220;. Listen to this amazing interview. Actually the conversation was so interesting that we went on and on. I just could not stop. Somehow I managed to present it to you in two parts. Listen to this and let me know your views.</p>
