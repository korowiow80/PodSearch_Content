Show Notes:
Unlike PC's, Mac's have a very different Kind of bios called a Extensible Firmware Interface or EFI for short. This is a set of interfaces that defines how software will interface with future firmware. Intel developed EFI as a part of the Intel Boot Initiative program that began in 1998. This program was designed to modernize firmware technology in today's computers in order to move past the limitations of a legacy BIOS. It offers features similar to the Open Firmware used on older PowerPC-based Macs. Beyond that, it is extensible and quite flexible. 
You might be asking your self why did I need to know all that stuff? The reason is that the computer needs to be told what to do whan you turn it on when it comes to booting to different peripherals 

Here’s a list of system startup hot keys to press while Mac OS X is booting, and their various effects:

Pressing C when Booting, boots a CD or DVD like a Mac OS X disc 
Pressing T Boots in Target Disk mode, this allows you to boot off a external Hard Drive but only works with FireWire.
Pressing N Boots from an attached network server or better known as a NetBoot server
Pressing X Attempts to force Mac OS X to boot, if non-Mac OS X startup volumes are present.
Pressing Shift Boots the mac into ‘Safe Mode’ which has limited functionality
Pressing Option Displays all bootable volumes kinda like a Startup Manager which is good for multiple versions of OSX .
Pressing Command+V Boots into Verbose mode, These may be used for troubleshooting or software development.
Pressing Command+S Boots in Single user mode if you used the Command+V 

Its kinda strange how the mac hardware is different from the pc world, but thats why we choose the mac

And that going to do it for this episode of Mac Tip Podcast I hope you enjoyed it.The music for this podcast, preformed by Professor Kliq and announced by Josh Philpott.If you have any comments, questions or tips? Please leave them on the Web site, send them to feedback@qetuo.me, or you can also call into the hot-line at (304) 449-4335.Have twitter?

Show Notes:

I use an application called Appzapper, found at appzapper.com (http://www.appzapper.com). this app allows you to get rid of the useless cruft that apps have left on mac, What Appzapper does is once you have dragged an app into the app; it preforms a scan the app to see whether there are any extra files that the app may have placed on your system when you launched or installed an app. Once the scan has been preformed, it allows you delete the cruft with a single click. It can't get any easier than that.
But, some times what will happen is a file or app will be locked or protected, and will not allow you to remove it from your trash.
This may happen with any file including applications, documents, movies, or music, it all depends on where or whom you got the file from.
This next tip uses a hidden feature of Mac OS X to force the Trash to empty, weather or not the files are protected or locked.

To do this perform the following steps in the order specified:

	* Press and hold the mouse button on the Trash icon in the Dock. The context menu for Trash will display.
	* Press and hold the Option key also known as the alt Key.
	* Select Empty Trash from the context menu.
	* Click and release Empty Trash.
	* And finely release the Option key.

Now your mac will completely trash anything that might have been protected or locked.

And that going to do it for this episode of Mac Tip Podcast I hope you enjoyed it.

Show Notes:
Recently I had a problem with a game crashing. After I hit the OK button when trying to register the game the game would just disappear, not a thing in the dock or any tasks running JUST GONE.
In trying to find out what was making the Game repeatedly crash, I wanted to find out what was going on.
There are 2 ways to find this out The first is Console This is found in Applications &gt; Utilities.
The Console tells you a just a little about what happened when the App crashed. It will tell you the time and date, The PID, and the Crash message. Like it said not much.

There is a full crash log that tells you EVERYTHING in which happened when the app crashed.
You can find the log by Opening Finder.
Click "Go" in the menu, then select "Go to Folder".
Type this path into the Finder dialog:
 ~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/
All one word.
Now click the Go button.

The Finder will open the folder containing all the crash logs for you mac. Look for a the crash file with the name of the app and the date field that looks like the most recent.
On opening, it will show you the name of an app, path, version, date, time, Bunch of gobble gook, and a bunch of other stuff. Most of which that is in the file, maybe junk to you. But to some one like developers or programmers, they my want to look at this file to find out why their app is misbehaving on your mac.
This file is gold to these guys and gals, so don't feel bad if you cant read it.

You also want to Make an archive of the log before sending it to to the developer of the app, It makes their lives a little bit easier if they loose the log. This can be done by right-clicking (or Ctrl+clicking) the crash log file and selecting duplicate. Copy that duplicate to another folder or hard disk and your done.

And that going to do it for this episode of Mac Tip Podcast I hope you enjoyed it

Show Notes:
The bouncing of an dock Icon is to notify you of an event,  like some ones is trying to get a hold of you via Instant massage or a proses that is done,
But it can be annoying at times.
You can make the Dock icons stop bouncing off the walls, even when an application is trying to notify you of something, by entering the following command in the terminal. But first you may need to know where terminal is located at! This is found in Applications &gt; Utilities.
Now you can type the following:
defaults write com.apple.dock no-bouncing -bool TRUE
Then you’ll want to restart the Dock by killing it for the changes to take effect:
killall Dock
You can get the bouncy Dock icons back by changing the command to FALSE rather than TRUE, and of course kill the Dock again.
It makes you wonder why didn't apple call the DOCK a PLANK it sure looks like a plank to me!

And that going to do it for this episode of Mac Tip Podcast I hope you enjoyed it

One of the worst things about Quicktime (in my opinion) is  that when I want to play a video it doesn't play automatically play.

In older versions you have an option with in QuickTime's preference pane to automatically play videos at first opening, but as of QuickTime X the option no-longer exists

This next trick only works in Snow Leopard in where the new QuickTime X app is found.

To run this trick open Terminal. This is found in Applications &gt; Utilities.
With in Terminal type the following.

defaults write com.apple.QuickTimePlayerX MGPlayMovieOnOpen 1

This will turn the autoplay option on. Now restart your QuickTime Player, if it is open. Now when you play a video you should see that the movie plays on open.
If you want to reverse the process repeat the prosses but this time you want to replace the 1 with a 0

Although we all hope that Apple adds this option back to QuickTime X's preference pane in an future update but who knows it is Apple after all.

And that going to do it for this episode of Mac Tip Podcast I hope you enjoyed it.

Show Notes:
I'm getting ready to install snow leopard here in a few weeks after I back everything up and I wanted to make sure that everything was in order, One of the things I came across while I was checking was to see if my mac was 64 bit compatible. Even though Snowie runns in 32 bit its not bad to be future proof
According to Apple all you have to do is look in your "About This Mac" from your Apple () menu, and seeing if the processor is a Intel Core 2 Duo or higher
But come on apple we want a more Geekier way of checking, Well... They have Muhahaha
So... The other way to check to see if your Mac is 64 bit compatible by using the command line. You will need to Launch terminal which is located in '/Applications/Utilities' and type 'sysctl hw |grep 64bit' Note: There is not a space after the vertical line.

After pressing enter you should see

hw.cpu64bit_capable: #

At the end of the string that is printed out there will be one of 2 numbers

0 which means the cpu is not 64 bit and 1 means it is 64 bit... YAY

As I was doing more research on the subject at had I found a cool app Called Startup Mode Selector (http://www.ahatfullofsky.comuv.com/English/Programs/SMS/SMS.html) the link is in the show notes.

What this neat little app does it shows whether you have a 32-bit or a 64-bit processor, 32-bit or a 64-bit EFI, MacOS X Kernel is set to boot in 32-bit or in 64-bit mode, MacOS X Kernel is running in 32-bit or in 64-bit mode, If your Mac officially supports booting a 64-bit kernel, it allows you to select whether you want to start the MacOS X Kernel in 32-bit or in 64-bit mode, and more

If you are running Leopard this app wont work for you, Snowie users only.. Sorry I didn't develop this app.

And that going to do it for this episode of Mac Tip Podcast I hope you enjoyed it

Show Notes:
Not to brag or anything, but unless I’ve run Software Update, I rarely have to reboot my Mac, this might not be that exciting Mac users who have been running Macs for years, but as a recent Windows convert, I find this sweet and informative to check the uptime and reboot history of my Mac, it’s also easy to do and useful too for troubleshooting certain Mac problems.
Here’s how to do both via the Command Line:
browse to your "Application folder" and under "Utilitys" you will fined "Terminal"

To check your Macs uptime, simply type ‘uptime’ in the Terminal. On my mac I have it has been up for 6 Days, 23 hours, and 36 minutes. Thats a long time in windows years.

17:56  up 6 days, 23:36, 2 users, load averages: 0.21 0.18 0.18

Now to Check your Macs reboot history.

To check the reboot history of your Mac, type ‘last reboot’ or if that doesn't work 'last | grep reboot' in the Terminal. This will provide you with the dates and times of the last reboots the machine has gone through.
reboot    ~                         Sun Oct 11 18:20
reboot    ~                         Tue Oct  6 19:13
reboot    ~                         Wed Sep 30 15:52
reboot    ~                         Mon Sep 28 04:18
reboot    ~                         Wed Sep 23 17:53
reboot    ~                         Sat Sep 19 10:37
reboot    ~                         Fri Sep 18 18:54
reboot    ~                         Mon Sep 14 15:34
reboot    ~                         Fri Sep 11 04:49

like I said before, it may not be useful to some people but its good information to know.

And that going to do it for this episode of Mac Tip Podcast I hope you enjoyed it

Show Notes:

I’m a terrible typist and once in a blue moon hit the Caps Lock key while aiming for something else. And on those extremely rare occasions where I actually want a run of Upper Case letters I seldom think to use Caps Lock, preferring to keep my finger on the Shift key instead.
But we all hate those people who JUST LOVE TO USE THE CAPS LOCK ALL THE TIME DO WE NOT?
I don't and hate to be accused of being one, Well my next tip is about disabling the caps lock key altogether
In the depths of System Preferences lies a easily but overlooked option; to change what happens when you press a modifier key. Open System Preferences.

Go to the "Keyboard and Mouse" Preference Pane.
Make sure you’re on the "Keyboard" tab.
Click the "Modifier Keys" button. A window will appear where you can change what happens when you press the various modifier keys.
From the drop-down menu beside the Caps Lock key choose "No Action".
Click OK. And the new setting is saved.
If you wish, close the System Preferences window.

Now when you type the "Caps Lock" key nothing happens. It’s dead as a door nail.

And that going to do it for this episode of Mac Tip Podcast I hope you enjoyed it

Show Notes:

If you often find yourself changing file extensions, As I do, you might be tired of the annoying "Are you sure you want to change the extension" dialog box. I often end up changing the extensions of text files from .txt to .html or .php which I find that I do quite often.

Luckily, you can disable this warning quite easily. Just go to your Finder's Preferences or Press "Command + ," and click on the Advanced tab. Un-check the option labeled "Show warning before changing an extension"

Now when you attempt to change a file extension, Leopard will no longer nag you by inquiring if you’re really sure that’s what you wish to do.

Keep in mind that if you add the wrong extension to a document you may not be able to open the file until you change it back. Changing an extension does not convert a document into a different format.

And that going to do it for this episode of Mac Tip Podcast I hope you enjoyed it

Show Notes:

Okay, so you’re working in a program which takes up every vertical inch of the screen, like Final Cut Pro or iMovie, and when you go to adjust something near the bottom, the Dock keeps popping up. Oh sure, you could move the Dock to where it’s anchored on the left or right side of the screen, but most people dont like the look or feel of having the dock on the sides of the screen. But what if you could move it temporarily to the left or right, and then put it back on the bottom when your done?, and do this with one click and one key?

Here’s how: Hold the Shift key, click on your Dock’s divider line (the one to the far right side of the Dock), and drag the Dock to the left or right side of your screen. Then, once you quit with the program, just Shift/click on that divider line and place it back on the bottom.

You can even shrink or enlarge the dock by clicking on the divider and move your mouse up to enlarge or move you mouse down to shrink the dock, man I can even see the dock
isnt that cool or what?

And that going to do it for this episode of Mac Tip Podcast I hope you enjoyed it.
