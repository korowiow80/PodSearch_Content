<p>I&#8217;m looking to have another challenge soon (I&#8217;ve spoken about &#8220;<a title="The Top Weight Loss Competition Sites" href="http://logicalloss.com/the-top-weight-loss-competition-sites/" target="_blank">Free weight loss competitions</a>&#8221; in the past. In looking over the Internet I found a few new sites that I had never heard of. These are geared toward using money as a motivator.  Some of them are a way to challenge yourself, and others are ways to have a &#8220;Biggest Loser&#8221; style challenge.So if you hate losing money, then these sites will help you lose weight.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stickk.com" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2436" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="Stickk" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/stickk_logo.jpg" alt="Stickk" width="229" height="101" /></a><a title="Stikk Weight Loss Motivation" href="http://www.stikk.com" target="_blank">Stickk</a> was started by Yale University project who came up with a system for you to make a contract with yourself. It&#8217;s free to use. All you do is pick a goal you would like to meet. This could be health, finance, career, relationships, etc. For my example it might be, &#8220;Lose 1 lbs a week.&#8221; I pick how many weeks I want to do this, and every week that I don&#8217;t meet my goal it sends my wager to the following possibilities:</p>
<p>1. A person</p>
<p>2. A charity that I like (not really good motivation &#8211; when you lose they win)</p>
<p>3. A Charity I hate (a political, religious, lifestyle, etc) organization. This might motivate you.</p>
<p>You enter your credit card number, and it shows you how much money you will lose if you fail. I set up a contract to lose 1 lb a week for a six weeks. If I fail to weigh myself weekly, and if I miss my goal it will pay my wife $5. In reality this is not a great contract. You want it to HURT if you lose. This is why I love the idea of picking a charity you do not agree with.</p>
<p>You can pick a referee. Think of this as you accountability partner. This is another tactic to help you stay on track.</p>
<p>This site is one of the most professional looking sites, and it was super easy to sign up, and start setting up my first contract.</p>
<p>According to the site, people that create a contract are 70% more likely to achieve it. This is a great tool for those who can&#8217;t do a &#8220;Biggest Loser at work&#8221; competition because you work for yourself or at home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dietbet.com"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2437" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="Diet Bet - Weight Loss Competition" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/diet-bet2-300x111.jpg" alt="Diet Bet - Weight Loss Competition" width="300" height="111" /></a> <a title="Diet Bet" href="http://www.dietbet.com" target="_blank">Diet Bet</a> is a website for &#8220;Social Dieting.&#8221; This is a Biggest Loser Competition ready to go. The website offer a quick challenge (28 days &#8211; four weeks in other words) to lose 4% of your body weight. You pick how much people have to enter to register ($10, $25, etc) and they handle the rest. They do charge a fee of 5%. If more than one person achieves their goal they split the pot. I was super impressed with this site.</p>
<p>The one thing that they have in place (I&#8217;m sure to help keep people honest) is you have an organizer who enters all the weigh in information. Once the initial weigh in is done, you can weigh yourself. From the looks of their video, you can keep up with the bet on your iPhone (I could not find and android version).  I really like this site, and immediate setup a &#8220;bet&#8221; for the podcast. While I&#8217;ve only done a few 12 week challenges, those can be hard to maintain interest and I love the short length.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.healthywage,cin"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2438" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="Healthy Wage" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/imgHealthyWageLogo.gif" alt="Healthy Wage" width="221" height="57" /></a>This is a website that offers weight loss challenges. You basically bet your own money that you will make your goal. For instance, there&#8217;s a 10% challenge where you pay $100 to participate, and if you lose 10% of your body weight over six months, you win $200. People who move from an obese BMI (over 30) to a normal BMI (less than 25) in a year can earn up to $1,000. <a title="Healthy Wage" href="http://www.HealthyWage.com" target="_blank">HealthyWage.com</a> also offers more lucrative team challenges. They have given out over $200,000 in prize money. Their website is easy to navigate and seems pretty easy to use. I did not go through the process of setting up a challenge on this site (plans to do so in the future).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gym-pact.com"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2333" title="gympact" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gympact.png" alt="gympact" width="288" height="58" /></a>I&#8217;ve already spoken about <a title="Gym Pact" href="http://www.gym-pact.com" target="_blank">Gym Pact</a> in the past. Here you again make a pact with yourself. For example you might say &#8220;I will go to the gym 3 times a week.&#8221; Using your iPhone the system stops you from cheating. You check in when you are at the gym (verified by the GPS) you check out will only count if you stay at least 30 minutes. Those who keep their pact with themselves keep their money &#8211; along with the money of those who did not keep their pact. The larger this site gets it could be some serious funds being tossed around. I just wish they would hurry up with their Android app (it was listed as coming soon in January&#8230;).</p>
<h3>No Thanks</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned <a title="Weight Loss Wars" href="http://www.weightlosswars.com" target="_blank">weight loss wars</a> in the past, but their system will allow you to add a prize, but their system does not manage it. Their website is simple, and a bit to advertising heavy for me. Comparing it to dietbet.com blow it out of the water.</p>
<p>Some new websites have sprouted up. One is <a title="Fat Bet" href="http://fatbet.net" target="_blank">fatbet.ne</a>t needs work. Their website looks like its half done, and they allow people to pick their own goal and you decide if its fair if July loses 6 lbs while Kevin loses 10. Seems hoaky. I&#8217;m not sure why people don&#8217;t stick to the percentage of weight loss. You can add money, etc but the interface looked so juvenile I didn&#8217;t even kick the tires on this site.</p>
<h3>Future Tests</h3>
<p>I am currently testing bietbet.com and stikk.com and look forward to trying healthy wage.</p>

Well that is the feeling I get when I watch &#8220;Ruby&#8221; a television show that recently was added to Netflix (finally something I want to watch on Netflix). When her story started she weigh 477 lbs, and I&#8217;m only in the middle of season one, but she&#8217;s already lost 60 lbs (and I&#8217;ve seen pictures of her now, and I see where she&#8217;s been successful). I believe at one point in her life she weight 700 lbs.</p>
<p>If you want to watch the program the seasons are available in iTunes. Ruby Gettinger is just another example of a wonderful, kind-hearted person who is trapped under her body. Her &#8220;turning point&#8221; was when her doctor told her she is going to die going down the road she is on. It is a REAL do OR DIE situation.</p>

So now I have to handle her dispute even though she and I are both saying to paypal &#8220;Never mind&#8221;. Its fun. Banks and customer service are not two things that go together very often.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really enjoying the book Overcoming Overeating by Lisa Monroe. In the last few chapters I read she talks about being a food addict. When we overlook the consequences of over eating and do it anyway, as not be able to control ourselves, we have the signs of being a food addict. In the last episode we talked about WHY we are eating too much and how our food makes us HIGH. Today we look at what I call the crazy cycle of food.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2426" title="Overcoming Overeating" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/overeating_cycle.jpg" alt="Overcoming Overeating" width="400" height="284" /></p>
<p>We start off making a mistake. We eat food. Then we step on the scale and see the consequences. Then we feel guilty. This is dealing with the fact that we made a mistake. Shames is different. This is where were start to think We are a mistake. If we continue with this negative momentum, we will end up hating ourselves. When we hate ourselves we generally don&#8217;t care about <em>anything</em> and we may feel we don&#8217;t deserve happiness, and how do we make ourselves feel better? You guessed it, we go back to step one and repeat.</p>
<p>In the book she points out something that we have spoken about in the past. This is that most of us who are overweight do not have a food problem. Food is being used to fill a hole that exists due to something else. Food is the symptom &#8211; not the solution.</p>
<p>This means that sometimes to move forward, we have to go backward and take a long look at ourselves to understand what makes us tick. Peter Gabriel has a great song called &#8220;Digging in the Dirt&#8221; that was written around the time of his divorce. If you think about a compost pile it is made up of garbage. For the compost pile to create fertilizer, you need to overturn the dirt. You need to work the dirt for it to be productive. Sometimes we are the same, we need to dig in the dirt so we can understand where we came from, and then see where we need to go.</p>
<p>The hard part is we may be in &#8220;self hatred&#8221; mode, and doing the right things (exercising, eating the right things) requires faith in the system, and faith in the process. In the end you will be sacrificing for the FUTURE YOU, and RIGHT NOW, you don&#8217;t put a lot of value in the future you. However, your future you will thank you IMMENSELY for the actions you take today. If you can&#8217;t do it for you, do it for future you.</p>

<h2>Book Mentioned In This Episode</h2>
<p>I really like this book. It&#8217;s making so much sense. It has a Christian slant, but even if you&#8217;re not a Christian there is a lot of good material in this book.</p>

		<itunes:summary>I'm really enjoying the book Overcoming Overeating by Lisa Monroe. In the last few chapters I read she talks about being a food addict. When we overlook the consequences of over eating and do it anyway, as not be able to control ourselves, we have the signs of being a food addict. In the last episode we talked about WHY we are eating too much and how our food makes us HIGH. Today we look at what I call the crazy cycle of food.



We start off making a mistake. We eat food. Then we step on the scale and see the consequences. Then we feel guilty. This is dealing with the fact that we made a mistake. Shames is different. This is where were start to think We are a mistake. If we continue with this negative momentum, we will end up hating ourselves. When we hate ourselves we generally don't care about anything and we may feel we don't deserve happiness, and how do we make ourselves feel better? You guessed it, we go back to step one and repeat.

In the book she points out something that we have spoken about in the past. This is that most of us who are overweight do not have a food problem. Food is being used to fill a hole that exists due to something else. Food is the symptom - not the solution.

This means that sometimes to move forward, we have to go backward and take a long look at ourselves to understand what makes us tick. Peter Gabriel has a great song called "Digging in the Dirt" that was written around the time of his divorce. If you think about a compost pile it is made up of garbage. For the compost pile to create fertilizer, you need to overturn the dirt. You need to work the dirt for it to be productive. Sometimes we are the same, we need to dig in the dirt so we can understand where we came from, and then see where we need to go.

The hard part is we may be in "self hatred" mode, and doing the right things (exercising, eating the right things) requires faith in the system, and faith in the process. In the end you will be sacrificing for the FUTURE YOU, and RIGHT NOW, you don't put a lot of value in the future you. However, your future you will thank you IMMENSELY for the actions you take today. If you can't do it for you, do it for future you.

Also mentioned in this episode is to Motoactiv. Check out a video here

Book Mentioned In This Episode
I really like this book. It's making so much sense. It has a Christian slant, but even if you're not a Christian there is a lot of good material in this book.

<p>Many moons ago I had a basic pedometer for about $35. Then I graduated to my fitbit (which I still love) for about $99. I loved the auto sync feature of the fitbit, and the extra motivation that came from all the information. I was recently reading about cool fitness gadgets and they mentioned the MotoActiv from Motorola. It&#8217;s pretty intense. Here are some of the things it can do.</p>
<p>1. It&#8217;s a pedometer that track steps, calories burned, etc.</p>
<p>2. It&#8217;s a <a title="Garmin Forerunner 110 GPS-Enabled Unisex Sport Watch " href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JNYULA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003JNYULA" target="_blank">GPS unit</a>, so if you are a walker, jogger, cyclist, you can now track yoru routes and track your progress.</p>
<p>3. It&#8217;s an mp3 player with 8 gigs of space, playlists, etc.</p>
<p>4. It can sync with your phone and you can actually receive calls and text messages on it.</p>
<p>5. It automatically syncs your information to the motoactiv website when you get near a wi-fi signal.</p>
<p>6. It then has &#8220;graphs o&#8217; plenty&#8221; showing your steps, calories, etc over time, your routes and much more. The one unique feature is it tracks which music (songs) you burn the most calories to, and can use that information to assemble the ultimate workout playlist.</p>
<p>7. It can (with an optional accessory) track your hear rate.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t find out if their website is free or has an additional fee (like the body bugg). It&#8217;s cool, and stops you from having to carry your mp3 player, your heart rate monitor, and your GPS watch. If you look at it this way the price is good (starting at $249) it&#8217;s about the same price if you had to buy them separately. However, if you are counting on the heart rate monitor strap, it&#8217;s an additional $49.</p>

<p>I like this tool for the person who is really into running. I would be interested in it if it tied into Lose It, or My Fitness pal so I could compare my calories in with my calories out (like my fitbit).</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;m at the<a title="Rocky River nature Center" href="http://www.clemetparks.com/" target="_blank"> Rocky River Nature Center</a> where they have what I call the &#8220;Stairway to Heaven&#8221; so I&#8217;m trying to walk around here and talk to you about the book <a title="Overcoming Overeating" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0736927026/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0736927026" target="_blank">Over coming Overeating</a> by by Lisa Monroe. I&#8217;m through the first couple of chapters and I&#8217;m finding it very motivating. Here&#8217;s why:</p>

While I love to break weight loss into small goals (lets focus on losing that next pound instead of the 30 total we need), there are times when we need to look at the big picutre that being overweight casts. Its amazing all the things that are linked to being overweight. Cancer, strokes, high blood pressure, Diabetes, dimentia, and many more.</p>
<p>2. As Type 2 diabetes is increasing so quickly, I thought I&#8217;d look into it (and I&#8217;m also at a higher risk as my Mother was diabetic) I thought I&#8217;d look into this. It turns out that there are certain organs that help pull the sugar out of your blood. The problem is the food we are eating is so high in sugar that it gets tried of hearing the body say, &#8220;We need to you catch some sugar.&#8221; It hears it so much it can eventually just ignore all the cries for &#8220;Here comes some more sugar&#8221; and the sugar stays in your bloodstream and makes it thick. In a nutshell it sounds like we are turning our blood into sludge. Becuase our blood is in such bad shape, <strong>our chance of heart attack increases by 10.</strong></p>
<p>3. Studies are showing that the chemical reaction in the brain is similar to the reaction you have when you do drugs such as marijuanna. In a nutshell, why do we overeat? Because we want to get high.</p>
<p>4. Throw on top of this EVERYWHERE you go you are bomarded with fast food. I also find it interestng that on one end of the street we have McDonald&#8217;s, Burger King, Wendy&#8217;s, KFC, and Taco Bell. On the other end of the street we have CVS, Wallgreens, Rite Aid and all the other pharmacies.</p>
<p>5. When we come home we turn on the TV and see all the thin people, and becuase we don&#8217;t look like them we want to feel better so we reach for the comfort foods. This leads to a temporary solution, but a long term problem.</p>
<p>6. In the 1980s microwave ovens came into every household. The question is does the &#8220;microwave generation&#8221; have a smaller ability to wait for gratification?</p>

<p>I just found out about a TV show that starts tomorrow night on HBO it&#8217;s called the Weight of the Nation and you can find out more about it <strong><a title="The Weight of the Nation" href="http://theweightofthenation.hbo.com/" target="_blank">on the HBO site</a></strong>. There is also a companinion book, and you can get the speical on DVD (it spans four hours of material). From the trailer, it appears that the US obesity epidemic will ruin our country very soon (if we have national health coverage and we are all sick, we will tax ourselve to feath to pay for our bad eating habits). We need to fix this today.</p>

On those days that I ate more than my targeted 1700 calroies, I exercised more. At the end of the week I had gone up 1 lb. When I looked into it I saw where I was averageing 1880 calories a day. We know these are fairly acurate as we are going by the information on the labels and paying attention to serving sizes. So what gives? Well the only other piece of the puzzle is the calroies burned during exercise. With this in mind, I will focus on hitting my goal for calories in, and ignore (kind of) how many calories I burn off.

<p>The key to this is brutal honesty when entering food. A difference of 150 calories a day can add up over a month.</p>
<p>Remember the only thing you have absolute control over is you. While I found all this effort frustrating, I know in the end if I watch my calories in, and keep exercises the weight will drop off eventually. Quitting will not get me where I need to go.</p>

<h3> FitBolt &#8211; Nuges You To Get Out of your Chair</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be interviewing a representative from Fitbolt.com this week, but couldn&#8217;t wait to tell you about this cool website. It is a timer that alerts you to get up and stretch and do exercises. It&#8217;s free, and is a great way to keep you focused (not to mention burn a few extra calories while you&#8217;re at your desk). I&#8217;ll talk more about this in the future, but for now check out <a title="Fitbolt" href="http://www.fitbolt.com" target="_blank">www.fitbolt.com</a></p>

We need to fix this today.

What If You tracked Everything And Your Still Not Losing Weight?
I treally tracked all of my food and activity last week. On those days that I ate more than my targeted 1700 calroies, I exercised more. At the end of the week I had gone up 1 lb. When I looked into it I saw where I was averageing 1880 calories a day. We know these are fairly acurate as we are going by the information on the labels and paying attention to serving sizes. So what gives? Well the only other piece of the puzzle is the calroies burned during exercise. With this in mind, I will focus on hitting my goal for calories in, and ignore (kind of) how many calories I burn off. In the end its calories in vs calories out. If I track all my calories in, and still gain weight, then I nkow I can cut back on the calroies and I should lose.

The key to this is brutal honesty when entering food. A difference of 150 calories a day can add up over a month.

We feel, &#8220;What&#8217;s the point?&#8221; We ponder the thought of quitting. I&#8217;ve said it over and over. It&#8217;s hard to beat someone who refuses to quit. I did a quick search on quitting, and found some inspirational stories to help us over the quitting hump.</p>

<h2>Abraham Lincoln Didn&#8217;t Quit</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-2362 alignright" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;" title="I Quit" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/quit.jpg" alt="I Quit" width="210" height="210" />Probably the greatest example of persistence is Abraham Lincoln. If you want to learn about somebody who didn&#8217;t quit, look no further.</p>
<p>Born into poverty, Lincoln was faced with defeat throughout his life. He lost eight elections, twice failed in business and suffered a nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>He could have quit many times &#8211; but he didn&#8217;t and because he didn&#8217;t quit, he became one of the greatest presidents in the history of our country.</p>
<p>Lincoln was a champion and he never gave up. Here is a sketch of Lincoln&#8217;s road to the White House:</p>
<ul>
<li>1816 His family was forced out of their home. He had to work to support them.</li>
<li>1818 His mother died.</li>
<li>1831 Failed in business.</li>
<li>1832 Ran for state legislature &#8211; lost.</li>
<li>l832 Also lost his job &#8211; wanted to go to law school but couldn&#8217;t get in.</li>
<li>1833 Borrowed some money from a friend to begin a business and by the end of the year he was bankrupt. He spent the next 17 years of his life paying off this debt.</li>
<li>1834 Ran for state legislature again &#8211; won.</li>
<li>1835 Was engaged to be married, sweetheart died and his heart was broken.</li>
<li>1836 Had a total nervous breakdown and was in bed for six months.</li>
<li>1838 Sought to become speaker of the state legislature &#8211; defeated.</li>
<li>1840 Sought to become elector &#8211; defeated.</li>
<li>1843 Ran for Congress &#8211; lost.</li>
<li>1846 Ran for Congress again &#8211; this time he won &#8211; went to Washington and did a good job.</li>
<li>1848 Ran for re-election to Congress &#8211; lost.</li>
<li>1849 Sought the job of land officer in his home state &#8211; rejected.</li>
<li>1854 Ran for Senate of the United States &#8211; lost.</li>
<li>1856 Sought the Vice-Presidential nomination at his party&#8217;s national convention &#8211; get less than 100 votes.</li>
<li>1858 Ran for U.S. Senate again &#8211; again he lost.</li>
<li>1860 Elected president of the United States.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lincoln could&#8217;ve easily quit many times in his life. I&#8217;m so glad he didn&#8217;t. When you don&#8217;t quit on health, your children, and your friends, your family thank you.</p>
<h2>The Old Mule in the Well</h2>
<div>Once upon a time a farmer owned an old mule who tripped and fell into the farmer&#8217;s well. The farmer heard the mule braying and was unable to figure out how to bring up the old animal. It grieved him that he could not pull the animal out. He&#8217;d been a good worker around the farm. Although the farmer sympathized with the mule, he called his neighbors together and told them what had happened. He had them help haul dirt to bury the old mule in the well and quietly put him out of his misery.</div>
<div></div>
<div>At first, the old mule was puzzled, but as the farmer and his neighbors continued shoveling and the dirt hit his back, he had a thought: he ought to shake off the dirt and step up. And he did just that.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Shake it off and step up&#8230;shake it off and step up&#8230;shake it off and step up.&#8221; Even though he took painful blows of dirt and fought panic, he just kept right on shaking it off and stepping up!</div>
<div></div>
<div>It wasn&#8217;t long before the old mule stepped up and over the lip of that well. What could have buried him actually blessed him&#8230;all because of the manner in which he handled his adversity.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You can focus on the negative, or focus on the postive. Don&#8217;t feed the weeds &#8211; feed the flowers. Also notice that the mule had to WORK to get out of that well. Nobody did it for him.</div>

<p>I was never aware how some people DREAD stepping on scale. Even when they lose weight they get depressed they get filled with self-hatred because they see how far they need to go. There is a new produce on the market called the Quantum Scale. This has been on the Tara show, Dr. Oz, and others. Its a new twist on stepping on the scale. Here is how it works:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.logicalloss.com/quantum"><img class="size-full wp-image-2351 alignright" title="quantumscale" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/quantumscale.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></a>1. You press the program button and then step on the scale.</p>
<p>2. The Scale measures you and records your weight.</p>
<p>3. The next time you step on the scale it only shows your progress &#8211; NOT your weight.</p>
<p>The thought being that this helps you focus on the positive and highlights where you&#8217;ve come &#8211; not so much how far you need to go. I love this idea, and I am intrigued on how motivational this would be. I have a similar app for my android phone that does make me feel better when it displays how far I&#8217;ve come. It&#8217;s currently not available at Amazon.com but is available internationally, and you can order with paypal or a credit car from their website at <a title="Quantum Scale" href="http://www.logicalloss.com/quantum" target="_blank">quantumscale.com</a></p>
<p>If you have one of these, please let me know what you think of it. If there is a drawback its that it only tracks weight for one person, but at $59 its affordable enough for everyone to buy one for each person. It comes in six different colors to help match you home.</p>
<h2>Getting Your Body Ready For Summer</h2>
<p>With Spring upon us, its only a matter of time until Summer arrives with swim suit season. Here are some tips from the people at <a title="Fit Day" href="http://www.logicalloss.com/fitday" target="_blank">fitday.com</a> for shedding some pounds between now and then:</p>
<p>Avoid drinking your calories (that 20 oz bottle of Mountain Dew is 290 calories).</p>
<p>Opt for fruit instead of desert. Go for what and gum instead of the pastry.</p>
<p>Leave a few bites on your plate. Your Mom said clean your plate, fitday is saying not to if you want to shed some pounds. Those bites add up.</p>
<p>Snack smart. Search for healthier snacks as many times its these &#8220;small&#8221; treats that up to big weight issues. Cut your snack calories in half and see how the weight drops off.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve never heard of Fitday, that have a website where you can track your calories, foods, and moods. There is a version you can install locally on your computer if you&#8217;d rather not have to use the Internet to put in your information.</p>
<h2>Fit or Fat Book From Covert Bailey</h2>
<p>Steve from Idaho loves the podcast and wanted to let me know he went to <a title="Support This Show" href="http://www.supportthisshow.com" target="_blank">supporthisshow.com</a> before making the purchase of Fit or Fat from Covert Bailey (one of my favorite books on weight loss).</p>

		<itunes:summary>I was never aware how some people DREAD stepping on scale. Even when they lose weight they get depressed they get filled with self-hatred because they see how far they need to go. There is a new produce on the market called the Quantum Scale. This has been on the Tara show, Dr. Oz, and others. Its a new twist on stepping on the scale. Here is how it works:

1. You press the program button and then step on the scale.

2. The Scale measures you and records your weight.

3. The next time you step on the scale it only shows your progress - NOT your weight.

The thought being that this helps you focus on the positive and highlights where you've come - not so much how far you need to go. I love this idea, and I am intrigued on how motivational this would be. I have a similar app for my android phone that does make me feel better when it displays how far I've come. It's currently not available at Amazon.com but is available internationally, and you can order with paypal or a credit car from their website at quantumscale.com

If you have one of these, please let me know what you think of it. If there is a drawback its that it only tracks weight for one person, but at $59 its affordable enough for everyone to buy one for each person. It comes in six different colors to help match you home.
Getting Your Body Ready For Summer
With Spring upon us, its only a matter of time until Summer arrives with swim suit season. Here are some tips from the people at fitday.com for shedding some pounds between now and then:

Avoid drinking your calories (that 20 oz bottle of Mountain Dew is 290 calories).

Opt for fruit instead of desert. Go for what and gum instead of the pastry.

Leave a few bites on your plate. Your Mom said clean your plate, fitday is saying not to if you want to shed some pounds. Those bites add up.

Snack smart. Search for healthier snacks as many times its these "small" treats that up to big weight issues. Cut your snack calories in half and see how the weight drops off.

If you've never heard of Fitday, that have a website where you can track your calories, foods, and moods. There is a version you can install locally on your computer if you'd rather not have to use the Internet to put in your information.
Fit or Fat Book From Covert Bailey
Steve from Idaho loves the podcast and wanted to let me know he went to supporthisshow.com before making the purchase of Fit or Fat from Covert Bailey (one of my favorite books on weight loss).</itunes:summary>

<h2>Seven Habits of Weight Loss</h2>
<p>I saw a video with Dr Oz on Yahoo where he mentioned the seven habits of people who are thin. If you give yourself 15 points for each one of these you do, you can grade yourself. For example I do two of these. This gives me a score fo 30% out of 100. Then I wonder why I&#8217;m over-weight.</p>
<p>1. Exercise in the morning<br />
2. Eat Smaller meals through the day<br />
3. Eat Slower and Walk away when full<br />
4. Not skipping breakfast<br />
5. Better Monitors of their health &#8211; Journals<br />
6. Fitness hobby outside of the gym Bike, Swim, Baseball, etc<br />
7. Water, Water, and Water</p>

<p>It turns out this new book will be a first ins series. He said this about the book (coming out May 15, you can pre order now)</p>
<p>  Here is what is coming from Bob.</p>
<div><strong>&#8220;<em>THIS ISN&#8217;T ONLY A RULEBOOK.</em></strong><em> Part I of the book is T<strong>he Skinny Rules—the 20 principles you need to read</strong>, understand, and make an effort to really live by. But then I&#8217;ve also created Part II, <strong>The Skinny Way, which is a day-by-day menu plan</strong> that will get you through the first 30 days of living by the Rules. And Part III, <strong>The Skinny Tools, houses the recipes and tips that you&#8217;ll be called on to look at, cook, and consume! </strong>My intention has been to take the guess work out of losing weight for you. After the first 30 days on the program you will have lost weight and you&#8217;ll be more confident in eating and living according to my Rules. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it won&#8217;t be easy. &#8216;Easy&#8217; does not work. But it will be liberating</em>.&#8221;</div>

<p><a title="Successful Weight Loss Among Adults in the US" href="http://www.ajpmonline.org/webfiles/images/journals/amepre/AMEPRE_3338[3]-stamped.pdf" target="_blank">A new study was published </a>. The goal was to determine what obese people did to lose 5-10% of their body weight. For me (currently at 207 lbs) that would be losing 10 &#8211; 21 lbs. Here is what they found after studying 4021 Obese Adults:</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-2344 alignright" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;" title="Quick-weight-loss" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Quick-weight-loss-208x300.jpg" alt="Quick-weight-loss" width="208" height="300" />63% had tried to lose weight the previous year</p>
<p>40% lost 5% of their body weight and 20% lost 10% of their body weight.</p>
<p>Those that lost 5% reported eating less fat and exercising more and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">small percent</span> used <em>prescription</em> weight loss pills.</p>
<p>The above strategies were also mention in the people who lost 10% along with joining commercial weight loss programs (like <a title="eDiets" href="http://www.tkqlhce.com/click-2703426-10641968" target="_blank">ediets.com</a> or <a title="Mediafast" href="http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-2703426-10415095" target="_blank">mediafast.com</a> etc).</p>
<p>Adults eating diet products were <em>less likely</em>  to achieve 10% weight loss.</p>
<h2>My Favorite Line from the Whole Study</h2>
<p>&#8220;Liquid diets, nonprescription diet pills, and popular diets had <strong>no association</strong> with successful weight loss.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Nuggets Pulled From the Report</h2>
<p><strong>Even a weight loss of 5% leads to health benefits.</strong><br />
So if you think, &#8220;I may start but I&#8217;ll never finish,&#8221; take the small success as it will benefit you. Then see if the confidence of making a small goal helps propel you to keep going.</p>
<p><strong>Most Common Strategies Used in Successfully Losing Weight<br />
</strong>Limiting quantity of food, and counting calories, and restricting types of food.</p>
<p>Exercised 30 minutes per day, and added physical activities to their day. They also planned and cooked their own meals. They also weighted their food.</p>
<p>Eat less &#8211; exercise more. Shocking.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2333" title="gympact" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gympact.png" alt="" width="288" height="58" />We&#8217;ve seen a lot of technology on this blog. I love things that motivate you and keep you focused. I don&#8217;t know about you but I enjoy the benefits of money, and I feel I work pretty hard for the money I get (especially when you owe 17,000 in student loans still). I read about a new service that started this year called Gympact. THeir website is Here is the bottom line on this.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2334" style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;" title="Gympact Profile" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gympactprofile-200x300.jpg" alt="Gympact Profile" width="200" height="300" />1. You need an iphone. If your gym has wi-fi you can get by with an iPad, or iPod touch</p>
<p>2. You make a &#8220;pact&#8221; with yourself to go to the gym &#8220;X amount of times&#8221; in a week.</p>
<p>3. You set how much you&#8217;re willing to pay if you miss it.</p>
<p>4. If you make your pact you lose nothing.</p>
<p>5. If you miss your gym dates you pay.</p>
<p>6. those who made their commitments share the money that was paid by the people who didn&#8217;t. Gym-pact takes 3%.</p>
<p>7. When you check in, it used GPS technology (hence why you need an iPhone or a gym with wireless). When you check in, you have to wait 30 minutes to check out of the gym for it to &#8220;Count.&#8221; So in reality you will be at the gym for 30 minutes. No cheating.</p>
<p>According to a review in iTunes, the person has made $34 so far. If you&#8217;re using an inexpensive gym like Planet Fitness, it sounds like you might have some of your gym membership paid for. The typical payout is .50 &#8211; .70 per day for each day committed. So if you committed to one day of exercise, you might earn .50-.70 for meeting your pact (and save whatever you put up as collateral which starts at $5 a day).</p>
<p>According to their website 90% of the people who sign up make their gym appointments. Here is a promo video<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1ZoRT9iYPn4" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Here is a another video showing the actual software on an iPhone.<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/R9o1Of4hpEY?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>The Gympact even works internationally. According to their site, &#8220;Yes, GymPact works internationally! GymPact’s iPhone app is launched worldwide so just sign up and download the app to get started. If we don’t have your gym listed, simply add it the first time you check in there.&#8221; According to their support site they are working on creating an HTML5 version that will work with the Android system, and also tools like Fitbit and Runkeeper.</p>
<p>You only get charged if you missed the gyms session you said you would attend. Each week you set a goal for the coming week (but once that week starts you can&#8217;t change). In terms of getting paid, they pay you via paypal. How cool is that?</p>
<p>The only thing I would be aware of it is only counts workouts at gyms. Gyms at universities count, but the one at your condo probably doesn&#8217;t. I will definitely be keeping my eye on this, as I love the idea of getting rewarded in cash.</p>

<p>I had a listener email me and ask me what I look like. I went and looked and the last time I took a picture of myself as a &#8220;before&#8221; picture it was a while ago.</p>
<p>This is a picture of me back at the end of 2010. The bad news is I&#8217;m not a whole lot different than what I was in this picture (and its two years ago). It&#8217;s amazing how much a picture can motivate you though, so if you haven&#8217;t busted out the camera (or phone) lately, today would be a good day to take your &#8220;before&#8221; picture and realize in a few months you&#8217;ll be able to see the difference between today&#8217;s picture and the picture you take in the future. Just believe, practice doing the right thing on a consistent basis, and track your calories. You can do this.</p>
<p>Set a date on the calendar. Mine will be 7-9-2012. I hope be have that gut under control, and hopefully I won&#8217;t need a training bra anymore.</p>

<p>In looking at <a title="Is Carnie Wilson an Attention Whore?" href="http://logicalloss.com/is-carnie-wilson-an-attention-whore/">Carnie Wilson and her choice to get a second weight loss surgery</a>, I found this information about Weight Loss Surgery regarding <a title="Weight Loss Surgery" href="http://www.obesityhelp.com/content/wlsurgery.html" target="_blank">Vertical Banded Gastroplasty</a>.</p>
<p><em><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2324" title="Lap Band Surgery" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Ethicon-Lap-Band.jpg" alt="Lap band Surgery" width="211" height="219" />Patients generally lose about half of their excess body weight in the first year after restrictive procedures. However, in the first 3 to 5 years after VBG patients may regain some of the weight they lost. By 10 years, as few as 20 percent of patients have kept the weight off. (Although there is less information about long-term results with AGB, there is some evidence that weight loss results are better than with VBG.) Some patients regain weight by eating high-calorie soft foods that easily pass through the opening to the stomach. Others are unable to change their eating habits and do not lose much weight to begin with. Successful results depend on the patient&#8217;s willingness to adopt a long-term plan of healthy eating and regular physical activity.</em></p>
<p><em>Between 15 and 20 percent of VBG patients may have to undergo a second operation for a problem related to the procedure. Although restrictive operations are the safest of the bariatric procedures, they still carry risk in less than 1 percent of all cases, complications can result in death.</em></p>
<p>Total operations performed according to the American Society for Bariatric Surgery are as follows:</p>
<p>2005    171,000</p>
<p>2004    140,000</p>
<p>2003    103,200</p>
<p align="left">Jacqueline Odom, PhD, the psychological director of the Beaumont Weight Control Center in Royal Oak, Mich., evaluates patients that are on the path to weight loss surgery to help make sure they are ready for this step and to handle the life afterward. <a title="Surgery Stats" href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/weight-loss-surgery/features/life-after-weight-loss-surgery?page=2" target="_blank">In this article</a> she stated&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">&#8220;A lot of people want a magic bullet and really don&#8217;t understand what is involved,&#8221; she tells WebMD.</p>
<p align="left">The new stomach requires several tiny, nutrient-rich meals a day supplemented with additional vitamins and minerals. Eating too much or indulging in rich, sugary or fried foods can overload the pouch and cause dumping &#8212; a term used to describe the sweats, chills and nausea that result from food filling the pouch and overflowing straight into the small intestine.</p>
<p align="left">The re-feeding process starts with getting in protein because that will repair the cells and help them heal after surgery. &#8220;We use liquid protein supplements to start, then pureed foods, then soft foods like scrambled eggs and then eventually graduate to other foods,&#8221; Odom says.</p>
<p align="left">&#8220;It&#8217;s not glamorous,&#8217; she says. &#8220;You have to chew your food more thoroughly then you ever did and really emulsify it. You must eat very slowly and in small portions.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left">Emory&#8217;s Smith adds: &#8220;The volume of food they can eat and the types of food they can eat changes dramatically. And there are indirect changes surrounding eating. Many people who eat for social reasons have significant changes in interpersonal relationships.&#8221;</p>
<p align="left"><a title="After Bypass Surgery" href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/weight-loss-surgery/features/life-after-weight-loss-surgery?page=3" target="_blank">Another Article on WebMD</a> stated this:</p>
<p align="left">For starters, Odom tells WebMD, there are the chemical changes that are causing a loss in appetite. The hormone ghrelin decreases in patients after gastric bypass surgery. This contributes to the decrease in appetite, which helps people not crave foods they used to.</p>
<p align="left">However, she adds, most of the patients report that this stabilizes and that their urges for food start coming back within six to nine months.</p>
<p align="left">Three months after her surgery, Kathy, 43, a home health care specialist in Watervliet, Mich., eats by the clock.</p>
<p align="left">&#8220;You are on a really strict regimen of eating six times day,&#8221; she says. But &#8220;I have no desire to eat.&#8221;</p>

		<itunes:summary>In looking at Carnie Wilson and her choice to get a second weight loss surgery, I found this information about Weight Loss Surgery regarding Vertical Banded Gastroplasty.

Patients generally lose about half of their excess body weight in the first year after restrictive procedures. However, in the first 3 to 5 years after VBG patients may regain some of the weight they lost. By 10 years, as few as 20 percent of patients have kept the weight off. (Although there is less information about long-term results with AGB, there is some evidence that weight loss results are better than with VBG.)

Between 15 and 20 percent of VBG patients may have to undergo a second operation for a problem related to the procedure. Although restrictive operations are the safest of the bariatric procedures, they still carry risk in less than 1 percent of all cases, complications can result in death.

Total operations performed according to the American Society for Bariatric Surgery are as follows:

2005    171,000

2004    140,000

2003    103,200
Jacqueline Odom, PhD, the psychological director of the Beaumont Weight Control Center in Royal Oak, Mich., evaluates patients that are on the path to weight loss surgery to help make sure they are ready for this step and to handle the life afterward. In this article she stated"
"A lot of people want a magic bullet and really don't understand what is involved," she tells WebMD.
The new stomach requires several tiny, nutrient-rich meals a day supplemented with additional vitamins and minerals. Eating too much or indulging in rich, sugary or fried foods can overload the pouch and cause dumping -- a term used to describe the sweats, chills and nausea that result from food filling the pouch and overflowing straight into the small intestine.
The re-feeding process starts with getting in protein because that will repair the cells and help them heal after surgery. "We use liquid protein supplements to start, then pureed foods, then soft foods like scrambled eggs and then eventually graduate to other foods," Odom says.
"It's not glamorous,' she says. "You have to chew your food more thoroughly then you ever did and really emulsify it. You must eat very slowly and in small portions."
Emory's Smith adds: "The volume of food they can eat and the types of food they can eat changes dramatically. And there are indirect changes surrounding eating. Many people who eat for social reasons have significant changes in interpersonal relationships."
Another Article on WebMD stated this:
For starters, Odom tells WebMD, there are the chemical changes that are causing a loss in appetite. The hormone ghrelin decreases in patients after gastric bypass surgery. This contributes to the decrease in appetite, which helps people not crave foods they used to.
However, she adds, most of the patients report that this stabilizes and that their urges for food start coming back within six to nine months.
Three months after her surgery, Kathy, 43, a home health care specialist in Watervliet, Mich., eats by the clock.
"You are on a really strict regimen of eating six times day," she says. But "I have no desire to eat."</itunes:summary>

<p>I just read where Carnie Wilson is going to have a SECOND weight loss surgery. Wilson, who lost 150 pounds via gastric bypass in August 1999, underwent lap-band surgery in January after gaining back two-thirds of the weight and learning last year that she was borderline diabetic.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2315" title="Carnie Wilson " src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/120321-carnie-wilson.380-300x234.jpg" alt="Carnie Wilson Media Whore" width="300" height="234" />So let me get this straight, the first surgery reduced the size of your stomach. Now you&#8217;re going to &#8220;Choke&#8221; the entrance to your stomach so you can&#8217;t eat as much. Then I noticed something.</p>
<p>Her first bypass surgery was broadcast on the Internet.</p>
<p>She posed for playboy after losing the weight.</p>
<p>She appeared on Celebrity Fit club on VH1.</p>
<p>Now with <a title="Wilson Phillips Dedicated New Album" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0077HDLFA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0077HDLFA" target="_blank">a new album from Wilson Phillips</a> out (featuring them singing old songs, many form their famous fathers), and <em>a new reality show starting this month</em> Carnie is choosing another surgery. Why? Because the media is convinced we care. Do I care about Carnie Wilson? No. Do I want to slap her in the face and tell her to put down the twinkie? Yes. She blames having children on her weight problems. While child bearing poses obvious challenges to the female body, I do find it ironic that in the clip below it shows her telling her band mates about her surgery <em>as she&#8217;s eating.</em></p>
<p>The clip also states that the surgery has better success when followed by diet and exercise. HELLO? In fact she&#8217;s already lost 30 pound preparing for the surgery.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>You lost 30 lbs to prepare you for the surgery that you want because you can&#8217;t lose weight. Something doesn&#8217;t add up here. She says she&#8217;s not afraid to talk about this in public as she is doing this to help other people. She needs to help herself by stepping away from the twinkie and stepping toward the treadmill. The doctor in this clips mentions that she requires a lifestyle change. She is worried about being pre-diabetic. This can be helped by changing your diet.</p>
<p>She says we need to ask for help. Carnie you can help yourself by exercising more and eating less. Oh and while you&#8217;re on the Today show you&#8217;re going to sing with your band from your new album. Would Wilson Phillips be on TV without this story? I don&#8217;t know the New Edition (another harmony group from the 80s) is back touring and I don&#8217;t see them on the Today show. The only reason I know they exist is because Bobby Brown was on tour when Whitney Huston died.</p>
<p>The new show is on the TV Guide Network on Sundays. It will be interesting to see what happens when (not if) this flops.</p>
<p>Lastly, I know the word &#8220;Whore&#8221; is a bit harsh. A Whore is a prostitute, or someone who benefits via money from using/selling her body. Is Carnie Wilson using her body to get money?</p>

<h2>Obeying May Not Be Our Nature</h2>
<p>I was listening to Mark Gungor who is the man behind the Laugh Your Way to a Better Marriage (a great DVD set), and in <a title="Mark Gungor" href="http://celebrationchurch.tv/media.php?pageID=5" target="_blank">one of his sermons</a> he mentioned that many Christians haven&#8217;t read any of the gospels from start to finish, and if he have read it, we still don&#8217;t want to do what Jesus said to do. <span>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span> <span><sup id="en-NIV-24216">20</sup> and teaching them to <strong>obey</strong> everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”</span></p>
<p>This country (US) was started by people who basically said, &#8220;You can&#8217;t tell me what to do!&#8221; Keep in mind that you don&#8217;t always have to understand something to obey it. We also don&#8217;t have to agree with something to obey it. In general it is our nature to do what we want. However, that may not be what is best for you (i.e. Chocolate cake). When we fight the urge to &#8220;do what we want&#8221; we are actually putting ourselves first. It doesn&#8217;t feel that way, but in the long run you will feel better.</p>
<p>When I was in my 20s I was told to start putting &#8220;just a little&#8221; part of my paychecks aside into a savings account and I would be REALLY glad I did when I was older. I didn&#8217;t &#8211; I sure wish I had. It was great advice. But I &#8220;did what I wanted&#8221; and now later I regret some of those financial decisions. We are all going to follow this and be feeling the same way about our health. Time and time again we read to eat less and exercise more. We need to obey this command and realzie that we may not agree with it, and we may not understand it, but we need to OBEY the truth that is the fact that if you eat more calories than you burn you gain weight. Consequently, we need to exercise more and eat less.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Today we get some insights from a listener who has lost over 63 lbs. Way to go Nancy. Also special thanks to Gail from Australia who got a fitbit, and a gymboss.
Quick Notes:

Runkeeper now allows you to set goals, and alert friends.

My Stiiv took a nasty dive, and lived to tell. Woo-hoo!

You can get your own personal trainer at Fitorbit.com Plans go from $10 -$20 a week.

Jillian Michaels now has a show on Youtube.

 
Obeying May Not Be Our Nature
I was listening to Mark Gungor who is the man behind the Laugh Your Way to a Better Marriage (a great DVD set), and in one of his sermons he mentioned that many Christians haven't read any of the gospels from start to finish, and if he have read it, we still don't want to do what Jesus said to do. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

This country (US) was started by people who basically said, "You can't tell me what to do!" Keep in mind that you don't always have to understand something to obey it. We also don't have to agree with something to obey it. In general it is our nature to do what we want. However, that may not be what is best for you (i.e. Chocolate cake). When we fight the urge to "do what we want" we are actually putting ourselves first. It doesn't feel that way, but in the long run you will feel better.

When I was in my 20s I was told to start putting "just a little" part of my paychecks aside into a savings account and I would be REALLY glad I did when I was older. I didn't - I sure wish I had. It was great advice. But I "did what I wanted" and now later I regret some of those financial decisions. We are all going to follow this and be feeling the same way about our health. Time and time again we read to eat less and exercise more. We need to obey this command and realzie that we may not agree with it, and we may not understand it, but we need to OBEY the truth that is the fact that if you eat more calories than you burn you gain weight. Consequently, we need to exercise more and eat less.

<h3>Healthy Eating Starts at the Grocery Store</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2308" title="Grocery-List" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Grocery-List-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" />If you don&#8217;t buy chips and ice cream, you can&#8217;t eat chips and ice cream. In almost every book I&#8217;ve read about losing weight and staying healthy they always note that one of the worst things you can do is go to the grocery store when you are hungry. If you want to take a bad idea to the next level, go to the grocery store when you&#8217;re hungry, and you didn&#8217;t create a list.</p>
<p>By having a shipping list you can look at it and know if you&#8217;re headed in the right direction.</p>
<h3>High Tech Grocery Lists</h3>
<p><a title="MIghty Grocery" href="http://www.mightygrocery.com" target="_blank">Mighty Grocery<br />
</a>I decided to see what kind of grocery list tools I could get on my phone (android). I found Mighty Grocery. I love it as it uses the voice recognition to enter items into my list. If you put out the money for the pro version (just a few bucks) you can use your scanner on your phone to scan in items as you create your meals, and then they are already on your list. If you want to get super specific, you can enter what aisle and amount for each item. There is a web based version so I can add items to my list (or my family could add items to the list after I leave for the store). If you enter the pricing information you can see how much your trip to the store will cost. You check items off as you go. It&#8217;s pretty cool. The voice recognition is pretty spot on.</p>
<p><a title="Food on the Table" href="http://www.foodonthetable.com" target="_blank">Food on the Table</a></p>
<p>Food on the table allows you to select your local grocery store, select your favorite foods, and select your motivation for shopping (healthy, etc). It then provides meals and recipes and grocery lists. It also has an android and iPhone app. You can print your list, or view it on your smart phone.</p>
<p><a title="Meals Matter" href="http://www.mealsmatter.com" target="_blank">Meals Matter</a></p>
<p>Meals Matter promotes nutrient-rich food choices from all five food groups, and strives to equip family meal preparers with the tools and resources they need to make meal planning decisions that lead to better health.  When you sign up you are provided with recipe ideas and more information focused on meal planning. No smart phone required.</p>
<p><a title="Plan To Eat" href="http://www.plantoeat.com" target="_blank">Plan To Eat</a></p>
<p>Plan to Eat was born out of our desire to eat real food — great food — prepared at home, together as a family. But without planning, it just didn’t happen as often as we wanted. Plan to Eat organizes all of your recipies in one place. You can drag and drop recipes into a food planner. YOur food planner then automatically creates your shopping list. It&#8217;s $4.95 a month, or $40 a year.</p>
<p><a title="Spark People" href="http://www.sparkpeople.com" target="_blank">SparkPeople</a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using Sparkpeople to track your food, you can create a grocery list based on the items you&#8217;ve consumed.</p>

<h3>Fitness Tips from the Audience</h3>
<p><a title="Kelly Preston on Lose It" href="http://www.loseit.com/index.jsp#Friends:Profile!id=1788513|name=Kelly%20Pelton" target="_blank">Kelly Preston</a> said this on the Lose it Forums&#8221; &#8221; I&#8217;m making one of my family&#8217;s favorites Alton Brown&#8217;s swiss steak. Out of curiosity I looked it up on LINE before entering my recipe. If you order the swiss steak at Dennys you will pay a whopping 1000 calories no sides included. If you make your own swiss steak and modify the amount of fat you brown your meat in (1/4 cup bacon grease, uh no) and watch the serving size you can have an entire meal for half that. I&#8217;m talking about a decadent meal with real mashed potatoes or none if you are low carbing it. The point is do they give you a lumberjack size serving or just put a block of lard in all the food? BTW if you work for Dennys I am in no way meaning to insult you. Just my observations&#8221;</p>
<h3>Quick Fitness Motivation</h3>
<p>&#8220;Now matter how slow you go, you are still lapping everybody on the couch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Losers look at what they are going through, Winners look at where they are going TO.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;People who say it couldn&#8217;t be done, should get out of the way of the people who are doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hey everybody, I&#8217;m not feeling well (got a case of the flu). This is probably due to a lack of sleep this past week. I need to go back to the past episode where we talked about the <a title="Lack of Sleep Made Me Sick" href="http://logicalloss.com/lack-of-sleep-made-me-sick/">importance of sleep</a>. Once again when we forget to say &#8220;no&#8221; and try to take care of everyone else, we end up ignoring the person who needs the most attention &#8211; ourselves. If we don&#8217;t take care of oursleves, we won&#8217;t be around to help take care of others. In the meantime I found an interesting video on Youtube that&#8217;s all about going back to the gym.<br />

<p>If you&#8217;ve listened to the show before, you know that I&#8217;m a huge fan of the fitbit. In today&#8217;s podcast I talk about using a Striiv unit. It&#8217;s SUPER easy, and super motivational. It doesn&#8217;t need a computer and when you turn it on it walks you through setting it up. From there as you start moving it tracks your movements, and rewards you for moving, while motivating to move more. There are challenges that are organized by difficulty. When you win these you are awarded bonus points (for example take 200 steps in 15 minutes). This can be huge for your self-esteem. The easy challenges are just that &#8211; easy (at least for me). This means when you&#8217;re first starting out you will be able to complete these challenges and boost your confidence. The Stiiv makes fitness a fun game that you play against yourself.  The thing that I found very cool is it politely nudges you to do just a little more. When I got done walking for 15 minutes, it asked me to walk three more minutes. I accepted the challenge. By doing &#8220;just a little more&#8221; I can see where these little challenges will add up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that the Average Striiv users walk 60 minutes a day&#8211;almost double the national average. The other thing that makes the unit easy to use is the display is two inches. For me it makes it easy to read. It even has a small speaker for the &#8220;Myland&#8221; video game that is built into the unit (where you earn points and unlock different aspects of the game by moving).</p>
<p>If I had one concern (but not really) it would be about its accuracy. To make a long story short, I did three tests of walking on a flat hallway where I counted 50 steps. In those three tests of 50 steps, the fitbit was only off by one step. The strivv was off by 7. By the end of the day, my fitbit said I had 1000 more steps than the striiv. As I look at my readout now, my fitbit says I&#8217;ve taken 1565 steps. The striiv says I&#8217;ve taken 1097. When you think about it, if you want your tracking device to be inaccurate you want it to report LESS so you walk MORE (most treadmills grossly exagerate calories burned).  Likewise there is a fairly large discrepancy in terms of calories burned at the end of the day. I don&#8217;t count this as a huge negative as I&#8217;m not sure <em>any</em> device is going to accurately calculate how many calories I burn based on my age, height, and weight. It&#8217;s always a guestimate.</p>
<p>It takes 2 hours to charge the unit if you&#8217;re plugging it into the wall, and four hours if you&#8217;re charging it via a USB cable plugged into a computer. Once charged, it should last about a week without needing recharged.</p>
<p>The one thing that motivated me (that I didn&#8217;t expect to motivate me)  was the &#8220;Walkathon&#8221; where I signed up (for free) to have water donated for people in Africa every time I go 18,000 steps. That moved me to keep moving when I got up to 17,000 steps. And I can always see how close I am to my next water donation.</p>

<p>If someone said &#8220;which one would you pick&#8221; in regards to the Striiv vs Fitbit, its hard. The one thing that a fitbit does is you can use their website (for free) to track your calories, sleep, and much more and if you really want to diagnose your weight loss efforts, it&#8217;s a great tool. If I&#8217;m looking for motivation to keep moving? I really liked the Striiv and its ever so polite &#8220;nudging.&#8221; I liked the easy to read graphics, stats, etc <em>without </em>needing a computer. With the different levels of challenges, and all the stats I don&#8217;t see myself getting bored with this unit any time soon. I can see where I&#8217;m much less likely to lose the Strivv (being bigger and white), but the flip slide to that is when you are wearing the clip you are aware of it (which is why I&#8217;ve been putting it in my pocket instead). I guess it depends on what you are looking to do. Both are great motivational tools.</p>

<h3>Fitdeck Nutrition</h3>
<p>Fitdeeck has come out with a new set of cards and tools in their &#8220;Fitdeck Nutrition&#8221; section. Fitdeck nutrition focuses on portion control, eating balanced meals, and getting plenty of hydration. To help you with these goals, there is the Fitdeck nutrition which coaches you on good nutritional choices, and you can pickup a Fitdeck Plate. This plate is divided into a proteain, frutis, vegetables on the plate. This solves the problem of portion control. They also have the fitdcup. This has a system to help you track how many 16 glasses of water you&#8217;re consumed throughout the day (it&#8217;s cool, but it&#8217;s no <a title="Hydrocoach" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N7HGMK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000N7HGMK" target="_blank">hydrocoach</a> or <a title="Thermos with an Intak Meter" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EGGQB6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001EGGQB6" target="_blank">Thermos with a meter</a>) the Fitcup goes for $15. The fitplate goes for $15 as well. I love my fitdeck cards as they are very portable, it stops workouts from being boring, and you don&#8217;t need any weights (for me at least I use the body weight deck). Best of all they are inexpensive. If you&#8217;re interested head on over to fitdeck.com and use the fitdeck coupon code logical10 to get 10% off your purchase.</p>

With the different levels of challenges, and all the stats I don't see myself getting bored with this unit any time soon. I can see where I'm much less likely to lose the Strivv (being bigger and white), but the flip slide to that is when you are wearing the clip you are aware of it (which is why I've been putting it in my pocket instead). I guess it depends on what you are looking to do. Both are great motivational tools.

Check out fitbit.com and watch pick up a Striiv at Amazon.com

<p>Today we find out that if you want to burn some serious calories, well in the immortal words of David Lee Roth &#8211; JUMP. It incinerated 100 calories in fewer than 8 minutes. &#8220;When it comes to cardio, nothing burns better than jumping rope, and it tones head-to-toe,&#8221; says Gerald Calvo, group fitness manager of Equinox in New York City and creator of its Rope Burn class. Fine-tune your form with his tips, then hop to it for up to 5 minutes for a warm-up, 20 minutes for a full cardio session, or 30 seconds between strength sets to drop pounds by leaps and bounds.  <a title="Jumping Rope Burns Calories" href="http://shine.yahoo.com/healthy-living/1-way-melt-fat-161300725.html" target="_blank">read full article</a>.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2266" title="Shamrock-Shake" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Shamrock-Shake.jpeg" alt="" width="240" height="196" />With March around the corner, McDonald&#8217;s announced that the Shamrock shake is going <a title="Shamrock Shake." href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/08/news/companies/mcdonalds_shamrock_shake/index.htm" target="_blank">nationwide</a>. before you get in line, lets look at what&#8217;s in that mysterious green goo has in store for you.</p>
<p><strong>For a 16 oz. Shamrock Shake…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>550 calories</li>
<li>16 grams of fat (8 of which are saturated, and<strong> 1 that’s trans fat</strong>)</li>
<li>96 grams of carbohydrates</li>
<li>72 grams of sugar (or 72/4 = <strong>18 teaspoons</strong> of sugar &#8211; or put another way 6 TABLESPOONS).</li>
<li>13 grams of protein (from the milk)</li>
<li>190 mg of sodium</li>
<li>And then these ingredients for the special Shamrock Shake <em>syrup</em>: high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, water, sugar, natural plant flavoring (plant source), xanthan gum, citric acid, sodium benzoate (preservative), yellow 5, blue 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is another way to look at it. It&#8217;s 26% fat ( 9 calories X 16 grams of fat) / 550 calories.</p>
<p>Here is another way to look at it. You burn 3.8 calories a minute walkign at 4 mph. That means you&#8217;ll need to walk for <strong>2 hours an d 24 minutes at 4 mph</strong> to burn off the calories.</p>

<p>In the past we talked about the <a title="S2H Replay Sport Band" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FJZ6SM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005FJZ6SM" target="_blank">S2H products</a> that you kids can wear and earn points to redeem for prizes. There is even a<a title="S2H Pedometer" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HQAH5A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005HQAH5A" target="_blank"> S2H Pedometer</a> that gives you a code when you walk 10,000 steps.  Earlier this week I discovered via the Biggest Loser their Slimcoach device (it&#8217;s actually a MyTrak device). It has some great features like the ability to use a hear rate monitor in tandom with its pedometer features.  You can also use it if you swim. It&#8217;s got ONE button to make it super easy to use. It is $129 a year. You can read <a title="What is a Biggest Loser SlimCoach? It’s a MyTrak" href="http://logicalloss.com/what-is-a-biggest-loser-slimcoach-its-a-mytrak/" target="_blank">more details here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://logicalloss.com/striiv" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2251" title="Striiv Personal Trainer" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Striiv-views-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>In looking at some articles about this device I found a new device that should excite those people who want it easy, and do NOT want to mess with a computer. It&#8217;s called the <a title="Striiv Personal Trainer" href="http://logicalloss.com/striiv" target="_blank">Striiv Personal Trainer</a>. I can see this as a great tool for both adults and children. In fact they just came out with a new feature where you can challenge another Stiiv user to a challenge (again without a computer). It seems really cool. It&#8217;s super easy and every night at midnight it resets your stats.  There are multiple ways to motivate you to move.</p>
<p>1. If you are a person who cares about the suffering in the world, when you walk you can donate your steps towards goals such a vaccines, water, and the rain forest.</p>
<p>2. If you are a competitive person, you can track your best efforts and try to better them.</p>
<p>3. There are challenges that you can do (again very game based) that make it fun as well as challenging.</p>
<p>4. There is a &#8220;myland&#8221; game where you walk to generate energy and then use the energy in the game to build things. If you&#8217;ve see &#8220;the SIMS&#8221; video game, this reminds me of that, or Farmville. Two words: very cool. I love this thinking outside the box. I have a niece who graduate high school with a year of college credits as she started learning very early when we bought her computer games. When you&#8217;re having fun, it doesn&#8217;t seem like work.</p>
<p>It does track both your steps, stairs, calories burned, and distance. It can be carried on your hip, pockets, purses, or even clipped to a key chain (how cool). It has multiple sensors to detect your activity. The price is $99, and I could see this being something that parents could use to introduce fitness back into the family (assuming you don&#8217;t have 5 kids).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to contact the company about getting my hands on one for some real life experience with the unit. From the videos I&#8217;ve watched this could be a very cool product.</p>

<h3>Rebounding From a Bad Week</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m bummed that after losing weight fora few weeks, in just a few days I seem to have gained a lot of it back. It reminds me of standing on a treadmill. When you walk on it, you don&#8217;t seem to get anywhere but if you stop, you will go backwards. With me, I took my focus on my health for a few days and that weight came right back. Am I upset? Sure. But lets harness that frustration at the gym, and instead take a look at the week and analyze it. For me this coming week I will be traveling. I need to pack some food, and find something to do if I get bored (luckily a planet fitness is about 5 minutes from the hotel.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t beat yourself up. Learn from your mistakes, and design future steps to avoid repeating your mistakes. many times this starts with getting some sleep.</p>

		<itunes:summary>In the past we talked about the S2H products that you kids can wear and earn points to redeem for prizes. There is even a S2H Pedometer that gives you a code when you walk 10,000 steps.  Earlier this week I discovered via the Biggest Loser their Slimcoach device (it's actually a MyTrak device). It has some great features like the ability to use a hear rate monitor in tandom with its pedometer features.  You can also use it if you swim. It's got ONE button to make it super easy to use. It is $129 a year. You can read more details here.

In looking at some articles about this device I found a new device that should excite those people who want it easy, and do NOT want to mess with a computer. It's called the Striiv Personal Trainer. I can see this as a great tool for both adults and children. In fact they just came out with a new feature where you can challenge another Stiiv user to a challenge (again without a computer). It seems really cool. It's super easy and every night at midnight it resets your stats.  There are multiple ways to motivate you to move.

1. If you are a person who cares about the suffering in the world, when you walk you can donate your steps towards goals such a vaccines, water, and the rain forest.

2. If you are a competitive person, you can track your best efforts and try to better them.

3. There are challenges that you can do (again very game based) that make it fun as well as challenging.

4. There is a "myland" game where you walk to generate energy and then use the energy in the game to build things. If you've see "the SIMS" video game, this reminds me of that, or Farmville. Two words: very cool. I love this thinking outside the box. I have a niece who graduate high school with a year of college credits as she started learning very early when we bought her computer games. When you're having fun, it doesn't seem like work.

It does track both your steps, stairs, calories burned, and distance. It can be carried on your hip, pockets, purses, or even clipped to a key chain (how cool). It has multiple sensors to detect your activity. The price is $99, and I could see this being something that parents could use to introduce fitness back into the family (assuming you don't have 5 kids).

I'm going to contact the company about getting my hands on one for some real life experience with the unit. From the videos I've watched this could be a very cool product.

Rebounding From a Bad Week
I'm bummed that after losing weight fora few weeks, in just a few days I seem to have gained a lot of it back. It reminds me of standing on a treadmill. When you walk on it, you don't seem to get anywhere but if you stop, you will go backwards. With me, I took my focus on my health for a few days and that weight came right back. Am I upset? Sure. But lets harness that frustration at the gym, and instead take a look at the week and analyze it. For me this coming week I will be traveling. I need to pack some food, and find something to do if I get bored (luckily a planet fitness is about 5 minutes from the hotel.

Don't beat yourself up. Learn from your mistakes, and design future steps to avoid repeating your mistakes. many times this starts with getting some sleep.</itunes:summary>

<p>This week on the Biggest Loser you will notice more changes. 24 Hour Fitness is no longer sponsoring the gym (and you&#8217;ll notice that nobody is wearing a bodybugg &#8211; a 24 hour fitness product &#8211; anymore). What was introduced this week was the SlimCoach. It is being billed as the Biggest Loser SlimCoach, but the reality is this comes from a company called MyTrak. There are some interesting points to this device.</p>
<p>It tracks your steps (no surprise) so you can see your steps, and how many miles you taken as well as &#8220;Heart Minutes.&#8221; Heart Minutes are minutes you have completed where the activity was energetic enough that it elevates the heart to a level that has positive health benefits. You can set up goals for yourself. Slimcoach/MyTrak calculates how much you need to move to reach your goal. All you need to do is push the giant button on the device to get instant feedback. Red is<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ODMEGA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006ODMEGA"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2240" title="mytrack_slimcoach" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/mytrack_slimcoach.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="368" /></a> bad, yellow is better, and green means you&#8217;ve reached your goal that&#8217;s simple. To get a &#8220;Bigger Picture&#8221; you sync the unit via USB, and it uploads to their website (which is where you set your goals and such).  It senses not only your movement but the intensity of your movements.</p>
<p>Here are some thing that set it apart. First if you are a swimmer you can purchase an accessory to take the unit in the pool with you. Secondly, some pedometers aren&#8217;t much help if you get on a stationary bike. You can purchase an optional polar heart rate chest strap and the Slimcoach/MyTrak and it will track your heart rate while you exercise.According to their website, &#8220;Since MYTRAK relies on hip movement to calculate energy expenditure, a heart rate belt would be a valuable tool to capture energy expenditure on these types of activities.  When combined with MYTRAK, a heart rate belt will convert your heart rate to calories equivalent and credit you on your MYTRAK. &#8220;  When using an optional heart rate belt, MYTRAK displays whether your current heart rate is within the suggested range, in real time. Online, your My Heart results are plotted over time and training zone. View your ideal range within one easy glance. When you plug in the Slimcoach/MyTrak to sync your updates, it also charges the unit (5 to 10 minutes).</p>
<p>The videos I viewed state that you can log your weight on the website, and since it knows how active you were it adjusts your recommended activity level. All you do is keep moving until it turns green. There is not calorie tracking. They have webinars, and personal trainers on their site. Like many other sites there is a forum.</p>
<p>The price is $129 for the unit which comes with a year of the service. The optional heart rate strap is $49, the Aquapac for swimmers is $29, and for an &#8220;Advanced Membership&#8221; you can spend $69 for &#8220;access to advanced charting such as Daily activities, Heart Activity, Heart Rate training, and Online Personal Activity Advisors.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t mention if this is for a year (I&#8217;m assuming) or a month (I doubt it).</p>
<p>While I like the idea of having an easy to read display, and the ability to have it tie in with a heart rate monitor, for me I&#8217;m not sure this is a &#8220;Fitbit killer.&#8221; The fitbit has a display that you can read (although the Red/Yellow/Green system beats the &#8220;flower&#8221;), the Fitbit syncs Wirelessly. The fitbit is NOT waterproof (I know this first hand). The Fitbit is less expensive and their website allows you to use it for free (and is only $49 a year for additional stats). The Fitbit also tracks how many steps you go up/down a day. The Fitbit can also be worn on (for example) a Bra strap where the SLimCoach is recommended to wear on your hip for better accuracy. TheFitbit can also be worn and track your sleep. If you are not looking to track your calories, want the ability to track exercise that doesn&#8217;t use your hips, and want a super easy to understand display this might be your choice. This may be something you want to investigate.The unit comes in black or white. and is available at <a title="SlimCoach" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ODMEGA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006ODMEGA" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got an email into the company to see if I can get more information.</p>

<p>Today we have a guest, and not just any guest! Jimmy Pena is the founder of Prayfit and has worked with people like Mario Lopez, LL Cool J, and Tyler Perry to create National Best Selling Books and DVDs. Today we talk about his new DVD called <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005NHQ1WQ?tag=logical-20">Prayfit: 33-Day Total Body Challenge</a> its a great DVD that has you focusing on delivering your personal best for 33 Days for 33 minutes. Each workout contains challenges that last for 33 seconds. It will make you sweat.</p>
<p><a  target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005NHQ1WQ?tag=logical-20"><img src='http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51d6G-tKv7L._SL160_.jpg' rel='B005NHQ1WQ' class='alignleft' width='114' height='160' alt='Prayfit: 33-Day Total Body Challenge'  /></a> PrayFit 33-Day Total Body Challenge utilizes the Christian faith to inspire those with weight loss goals and is a complete workout and motivational system designed to burn calories, build lean muscle and bolster your faith, helping to reshape your entire body in 33 minutes a day for 33 days.  Ideal for any fitness level, the workout includes a highly efficient 33-minute workout that combines cardio, strength and core moves for total body results in a limited amount of time, requiring no extra equipment.  The program works because it demands progression and challenges you to give your best effort.

		</div>
<p>I created an <a title="Biggest Loser At Work Spreadhseat" href="http://logicalloss.com/biggest-loser-kit" target="_blank">Excel spreadsheet</a> a while ago that people can download and use to have a Biggest Loser Competition at work, church, home, etc. The &#8220;bad&#8221; news is you either have one person acting as the Manager of the competition (which can be a hassle asking everyone for their weigh in information), or you let everyone enter their own information each week (for example at a job where the Excel file was stored on a shared network drive), and now everyone can see each other&#8217;s weight. With the success of the biggest loser, I knew their had to be other people like myself who had taken upon themselves to make having a Biggest Loser contest at work easier. There are, but before we get into that let me state a couple of things.</p>
<p>1. In the end if someone really wants to cheat, they will (you could always strap your fitbit to your dog&#8230;). Cheaters never win&#8230; in the long run.<br />
2. There are more sites than these, but some of them were obviously just a tool to splash TONS of advertisements in front of you. I have one of those listed in this review, and I&#8217;ll tell you when we get there.<br />
3. Each has its own charm with different features.</p>
<p><strong>After looking at these I created some competitions.</strong></p>
<p>1. Skinnyo.com is completely free. <a title="Logical Weight Loss Competition" href="http://www.skinnyo.com/challenges/join/4f16fbce522da" target="_blank">It only has room for 16 people so hurry.</a></p>
<p>2. Thintopia.com is asking for $5 per person (if you want to play for free you can, but the prize money will go to the highest percentage of weight loss who paid).<a title="Logical Weight Loss Podcast -Challenge" href="http://www.thintopia.com/competitions/view/1938" target="_blank">Check it out.</a></p>
<p>3. If you have a tracking device (like a fitbit, or bodymedia), we have a $5 entry fee at the <a title="Logical Weight Loss Earndit Challenge." href="http://earnd.it/x9qRMO" target="_blank">earndit.com</a> site. This one should be interesting. The person with the most points wins. <a title="Logical Weight Loss Competition" href="http://earnd.it/x9qRMO" target="_blank">Sign up</a></p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look at some of the sites:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fitocracy.com"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2210" title="fitocracy" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/fitocracy-e1326922716383.png" alt="" width="200" height="124" /></a><a title="Fitocracy" href="http://ftcy.co/pXpfIR" target="_blank">Fitocracy </a>is the game you play to improve your fitness. Play it to track your progress, compete against your friends, and get real results in your physical fitness. They are working on having a droid app (there is a mobile site). It&#8217;s free, but you can be a &#8220;hero&#8221; for $5 a month to help support the site.  You can create a group, and the look at the leaders in your group for a certain period of time. The focus of fitocracy is exercise. You can track your workout stats (reps, weight, etc). You can track cardio, and you can create routines that you repeat. Depending on what you do, you earn points. I was playing with it Internet Explorer 8 and it seemed to have some formatting issues. When I tried it on my phone, I had some issues (droid). Looks cool, and has potential. It just needs a little touch up. I will definitely check it out in a few months. It is in Beta, and you need an invite to play (contact me, or use the link above). Lots of potential here, especially for those gym rats. Even if this wasn&#8217;t a competition, having a web site that can track your exercise for free is cool.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.weightlosswars.com"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2209" title="weightlosswars" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/weightlosswars-e1326922607594.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="137" /></a> In the past I&#8217;ve used <a title="Weight Loss Wars" href="http://www.weightlosswars.com" target="_blank">Weight Loss Wars</a>. It is a website where you can join a challenge, or start your own. It costs $10 to participate, but it does all the calculations for you. You can even create a &#8220;private&#8221; challenge (for say your church group, work group, etc).  The competition only shows the change in weight, and you can choose to hide your weight in your profile (or only reveal it to friends). Visiting this site you will see a fair amount of ads. The site itself is somewhat &#8220;ho-hum&#8221; on the looks side but it does the job. There are blogs, journals, and other tools there as well. You can have it set to have a cash prize, but you would handle that outside of their site (using something like paypal).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.skinnyo.com"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2208" title="skinnyo" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/skinnyo.png" alt="" width="157" height="70" /></a><a title="Skinnyo Weight Loss Competition" href="http://www.skinnyo.com" target="_blank">Skinnyo.com</a> is also free to use (unless you want a private competition where you select who is participating which costs $10). Skinnyo.com limits you to 16 people (either playing against each other or you can have up to 8 teams).  Skinnyo only shows your weight differences to other users not your weight. If don&#8217;t have a giant group, and want to have teams this is a cool option. The way they calculate challenge winners is by the total weight lost during the challenge (which I think means percentage of weight loss?). If you&#8217;re looking to do teams, this would be my choice. I&#8217;m currently kicking the tires on this site and will let you know.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thintopia.com"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2207" title="thintopia" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/thintopia-logo.png" alt="" width="191" height="43" /></a><a title="Thintopica Weight Loss Competition Site" href="http://www.thintopia.com" target="_blank">Thintopia.com</a> is another great site that is 100% completely free, and yet not overrun with ads (there are some, but a tolerable amount).  It&#8217;s from a software engineer named Micah Stubblefield. I love that it&#8217;s just some dude in his basement (like me), and he is struggling with his weight (like me). There are no limits to the number of people you can have in your competition. I don&#8217;t see an option for teams, but again your weight is not displayed only your change. Micah answered all my emails, and seems like a very cool dude. If you want to have a &#8220;Private&#8221; competition all you need to do is assign a password, and only those people who you give the password to will have access to join. Unless I needed teams, (and without using the site yet) <strong>this to me seems to be the clear winner</strong>. The site has great content. It&#8217;s easy to navigate. While it lacks a &#8220;FAQ&#8221; page, my questions were answered in minutes &#8211; not days. I&#8217;m currently kicking the tires on this site and will let you know.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.earndit.com"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2211" title="earndit" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/earndit-e1326922859751.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></a><a title="Earndit.com" href="http://www.earndit.com" target="_blank">Earndit.com</a> is a great site for those who are worried about people cheating. earndit.com assigns points that come from people who are using a tracking device like a <a title="Fitbit" href="http://www.logicalloss.com/fit-bit" target="_blank">Fitbit</a>, or <a title="Body Media Bodybugg" href="http://logicalloss.com/bodymedia" target="_blank">bodymedia</a>, or <a title="Nike+" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004D4Y37U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004D4Y37U" target="_blank">Nike+</a>, <a title="Gamin Forerunner" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JNYULA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003JNYULA" target="_blank">Garmin</a>, Runkeeper, etc. You get 10 points for running a mile, and 3 points for biking a mile. You get 15 points for checking in at the gym using foursquare.com. You get .10 point for being fairly active on a <a title="Fitbit" href="http://www.logicalloss.com/fit-bit" target="_blank">Fitbit</a>, and .75 for every <em>very active </em>minute on a <a title="Fitbit" href="http://www.logicalloss.com/fit-bit" target="_blank">Fitbit</a>. You get the idea. You can set a number of points and the first person to it wins, or set a date range and the person with the most points wins.  You can set a maximum number of points per day a person can earn to keep things close. You can compete for bragging rights, or you can have people pay to get in, and the winner automatically gets a gift card (a <a title="Tango Card" href="http://youtu.be/XADoBO-ZJnc" target="_blank">tango card</a>  which is a pretty cool prize). This is the only site that takes care of collecting fees, and distributing payouts. If you&#8217;re not looking for a competition, you can use earndit.com by yourself and earn points that can be used towards shopping. I am also kicking the tires on this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.corporatefitnessleague.com"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-2212" title="cfl_logo" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/cfl_logo-150x150.gif" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>Another free option (not really worth looking into) is <a title="Corporate Fitness League" href="http://www.corporatefitnessleague.com" target="_blank">Corporate Fitness League</a> (this is the site with LOTS of Ads). You can take on your family, or go department against department if you have more than 10 people and want to go teams. You designate a captain, who then has to enter everyone&#8217;s weight (As someone who as done this &#8211; that&#8217;s a deal breaker ladies!). You can &#8220;Sweeten&#8221; the pot with $, but in the end  you will need a picture of the participants scale (some organizers also require a &#8220;word of the day&#8221; so you can&#8217;t find a thin picture on Google Images) to keep people honest. I just spent about 10 minutes playing with the site and found it clunky (it seems every click opens a new window). Due to the massive amount of ads (disorganized at that), and the requirement of a &#8220;Captain,&#8221; I would not recommend this site.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m inspired by what people are doing to help us be competitive. If you&#8217;re a person who wants motivation to get to the gym, check out <a title="Fitocracy" href="http://www.fitocracy.com" target="_blank">Fitocracy</a>. If you&#8217;re worried about cheaters, or looking for a third party to handle the prizes then go to <a title="Earndit.com" href="http://www.earndit.com" target="_blank">earndit.com</a> If you want to set up teams, check out <a title="Skinnyo.com" href="http://www.skinnyo.com" target="_blank">skinnyo.com </a>(they say in special circumstances they will remove the 16 people limit). If you want to have a large group for free (and avoid a billion ads) I really liked <a title="Thintopia" href="http://www.thintopia.com" target="_blank">thintopia.com</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m doing some research about different &#8220;Weight Loss Challenges&#8221; and I found Skinnyo.com which I really like. Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>1. It&#8217;s free unless you want a private challenge (which is 10).</p>
<p>2. It&#8217;s not completely cluttered with ads.</p>
<p>3. You&#8217;re weight isn&#8217;t shown, only your change.</p>
<p>4. Everyone puts in their own info (no &#8220;Captain&#8221; that gets to spend Sunday night hounding people for their weigh in information).</p>
<p><a title="Logical Weight Loss Competition" href="http://www.skinnyo.com/challenges/view/4f16fbce522da" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2202" title="logicalloss_skinnyo" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/logicalloss_skinnyo.png" alt="" width="374" height="134" /></a>So I&#8217;m going to give it a shot. Let&#8217;s kick the tires on this bad boy and see how it performs. We can only have 16 people in the competition (you can divide into teams, but we&#8217;re going sinlges). So sign up today as it starts on Sunday Januar 29th and runs for 12 weeks. It should be fun. Right now there is no prize, but we may vote to change that.</p>
<p><a title="Logical Weight Loss 12 Week Challenge" href="http://www.skinnyo.com/challenges/view/4f16fbce522da" target="_blank">Sign up today.</a></p>

<h3>The Best Video Game That Burns Almost the Same Amount of Calories as Running</h3>
<p><a  target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003O6EE4U?tag=logical-20"><img src='http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EKidYBcdL._SL160_.jpg' rel='B003O6EE4U' class='alignleft' width='160' height='152' alt='Xbox 360 4GB Console with Kinect'  /></a>An article <a title="Do Video Games Burn Serious Calories" href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/upgrade-your-life/lose-weight-playing-video-games-192328132.html" target="_blank"><strong>(and video)</strong> </a>at yahoo reports that when it comes to comparing the Wii with an Xbox with the kinect system, that there is no comparison. The test consisted of using a Heart Rate Monitor (I recommend Timex Heart Rate Monitors as you can replace the batteries) and see how many calories she burned running, and then compare it to the calories burned using the video games. She burned 259 calories in 20 minutes wen she was running. When she played the game Dance Central on the Xbox with the Kinect system she burned 251 calories. That&#8217;s only 8 calories less, and it&#8217;s FUN. The Kinect adventures had her jumping and ducking. She burned 216 calories, but her heart rate went thruogh the roof (its interval training basically). Compare these to the Wii Sword fighting game (149 calories &#8211; over 100 calories less than running), and you can see where the Wii isn&#8217;t in the same league. She did like the <a title="Biggest Loser Game For Kinect" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003S2SQFS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003S2SQFS" target="_blank">Biggest Loser game</a> even though she only burned 175 calroies in 20 minutes as it mixed cardio and strength training. The games are around $40. As of this writing the Xbox with the Kinect system goes for $258 at Amazon.com</p>

		<itunes:summary>Inspirational Quotes
God grant me the serenity to accept the people I cannot change,
the courage to change the one I can,
and the wisdom to know it's me.

or...
Grant me the serenity to accept the past I cannot change,
the courage to change the future I can,
and the wisdom to start today.

"Even if you fall on your face, you're still moving forward."
*Victor Kiam*

The reason why people give up so fast is because they tend to look at how far they still have to go, instead of how far they have gotten.

The Best Video Game That Burns Almost the Same Amount of Calories as Running
An article (and video) at yahoo reports that when it comes to comparing the Wii with an Xbox with the kinect system, that there is no comparison. The test consisted of using a Heart Rate Monitor (I recommend Timex Heart Rate Monitors as you can replace the batteries) and see how many calories she burned running, and then compare it to the calories burned using the video games. She burned 259 calories in 20 minutes wen she was running. When she played the game Dance Central on the Xbox with the Kinect system she burned 251 calories. That's only 8 calories less, and it's FUN. The Kinect adventures had her jumping and ducking. She burned 216 calories, but her heart rate went thruogh the roof (its interval training basically). Compare these to the Wii Sword fighting game (149 calories - over 100 calories less than running), and you can see where the Wii isn't in the same league. She did like the Biggest Loser game even though she only burned 175 calroies in 20 minutes as it mixed cardio and strength training. The games are around $40. As of this writing the Xbox with the Kinect system goes for $258 at Amazon.com

<p><a  href="http://logicalloss.com/links/links.php?lid=12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" >Jillian Michaels</a> has said in her book &#8220;<a title="Master Your Metabolism" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307450740/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307450740" target="_blank">Master Your Metabolism</a>&#8221; that soft drinks are basically poison (I&#8217;m paraphrasing).  Yesterday a story surface where a man is using Pepsi for allegedly having a mouse in a can of mountain dew. He said he drank it, immediately through up,and when he poured out the can the mouse fell out. To this I ask, &#8220;How did the mouse fit through that tiny hole?&#8221; Here is where things get really bizarre, <em>in their defense</em> Pepsi is saying (again in y words) that the mouse would have turned into a jelly like substance.</p>
<p>Acid and an ingredient called brominated vegetable oil or BVO are what likely lead to Mountain Dew’s supposed rodent dissolving powers. BVO is banned in some other areas of the world like Europe and Japan but allowed in limited quantities in sodas like Mountain Dew, Squirt and Fanta Orange.</p>
<p>Mountain Dew is a vice of mine. I treat it like alcohol. If I drink one, I want to drink 12. At my worst, I would drink 6-10 cans<em>  a day</em>. This story will help me &#8220;stay on the wagon&#8221; (I now drink 1-2 a day, and need to make that number &#8220;0&#8243;). Watch this video from the Huffing Post for exact quotes.</p>

I&#8217;m still reading Get Healthy For Heaven&#8217;s Sake by Lisa Marrone.

A Lot of it has to do with how we stand, sleep, and sit. That&#8217;s right. Mom was right when she said &#8220;Quit Slouching!&#8221;</p>
<p>While reading about how to stand up straight, this clip of Lisa on TV make it a little easier to understand the &#8220;blocks&#8221; and how they line up.</p>

<p>We have a long road ahead. We need to go into this with both eyes open. One of the ways we will dodge failure is by setting S.M.A.R.T. Goals</p>
<p><strong>S</strong> = Specific<br />
<strong>M</strong> = Measurable<br />
<strong>A</strong> = Attainable<br />
<strong>R</strong> = Realistic<br />
<strong>T</strong> = Timely</p>
<p>Let’s look at those a little more specifically. A poor goal is “I want to lose weight.” Then you lose a pound. Are you done?</p>
<p>It has to be measurable. When something is measurable you now know if you are ahead or behind schedule. I want to lose “X” amount of pounds, or “X” number of inches of my waist.</p>
<p>Some say the “A” stands for Attainable, Achievable, or Agreed upon. I often use Appropriate. It doesn’t make any sense to say I’m going to swim 20 minutes a day if you do not have access to water. It also has to be something that is attainable in your mind. If you don’t think you can do it, you probably won’t.</p>
<p>We need Realistic goals so we don’t set ourselves up to be discouraged. If we say, “I want to lose 10 pounds in 10 days,” that is not realistic (or healthy).</p>
<p>A goal without a timeline is a dream. You need to add time to your goals. I usually tell people just starting out to shoot for easy goals. This might be something like,  “I will walk for 10 minutes five times this week.” It’s specific. It is measurable. It’s realistic. It has a time line. Many people try, “I will lose 10 pounds in a month.” I prefer to put time elements on action items. If you do the action items, then you will be putting yourself in place to lose weight and get healthy.</p>
<p><strong>               Example Goal:</strong></p>
<p><strong>               </strong>“I will walk on the treadmill for 30 minutes (specific), 4 days this week. “</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it. This goal is something that you need to believe you can do. It needs to be something that you want, and something you feel you can achieve. It needs to be achievable (notice I didn’t say easy). We just need to avoid those times when we set up something that is so hard that we give up.  Then we need to add a time element so we can measure ourselves and see if we are on time.</p>
<p>Don’t fret if you get behind. A guided missile is “Wrong” most of its path. It radios back and sees that it’s off path and adjusts. It then radios back, and makes more adjustments. Eventually it hits the target and everyone applauds. Nobody noticed that the missile was “wrong” for most of the flight. Make your adjustments, and continue on toward your goal.</p>
<h3>Resources to Help You Kick Off the Year In The Right Direction</h3>
<p>I used a <a title="Myotape" href="http://astore.amazon.com/logical-20/detail/B000G7YW7Y" target="_blank">Myotape to measure myself</a> so I can see where I am starting at (so I can celebrate when these numbers go down in the future). I basically measure areas at the thickest part.<a title="How To Measure Yourself For Weight Loss" href="http://www.sparkpeople.com/resource/fitness_articles.asp?id=1281" target="_blank"> Here are some directions </a>from SparkPeople.</p>
<p>If you need calorie tracking software check out our <a title="Weight Loss Resources" href="http://logicalloss.com/resources/" target="_blank">resources</a></p>
<p>My favorite Gadget for motivation is the <a title="Fitbit" href="http://www.logicalloss.com/fitbit" target="_blank">Fitbit </a>(it&#8217;s kind of like a pedometer on steriods).</p>
<p>Today at the gym I used my <a title="Hear Rate Monitors" href="http://astore.amazon.com/logical-20?_encoding=UTF8&amp;node=45" target="_blank">Heart Rate Monitor</a> to push me to get my hear rate up.  I like the Timex models as you can change the batteries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Focus on the Activity and the Results Will Follow</strong></h3>
<p>Some times we get fixated on the scale. Then if things don&#8217;t go the way we want, we can get discouraged and want to quit. What you may want to do is to put an activity into your goal. Such as I will walk on the treadmill for 30 minutes. This is measurable. Then after you establish that habit you can start focusing on the distance you are covering in that 30 minutes.</p>
<h3>Fat, Sick, and Almost Dead</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004V4ASGC/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004V4ASGC" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ASIN=B004V4ASGC&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822" alt="" width="104" height="160" border="0" /></a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=logical-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004V4ASGC" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /><br />
I watched the movie Fat Sick and Nearly Dead. This was an inspiring movie that you can watch on netflix, or watch on Hulu (which I&#8217;ve put here). The thing I found very interesting. In once scene a person who has had a heart attack starts to reboot his life by juicing. He then talks about the medication he is taking post-hart attack $571 a month.</p>
<p>The heart attack cost $56,424 –<br />
Juicing For a Month $420</p>
<p>I liked the movie, but I&#8217;m not sure Juicing (while healthy when done right to avoid spiking your blood sugar) is a true way of life. I&#8217;m looking for lifestyle change, and I think going ALL juicing would not be able to be maintained by most people.</p>

I started reading the book, and then had to move. The book somehow didn&#8217;t make the trip. I liked the book so much, I bought a second copy so I could finish it (it&#8217;s around $10, and only $9 for the kindle version). Lisa is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0736927026/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0736927026">Overcoming Overeating: It&#8217;s Not What You Eat, It&#8217;s What&#8217;s Eating You!</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=logical-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0736927026" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> This book is doing a great job of making see food in a completely different light.</p>
<p>The book hints that when you lose to fulfill a goal (fit into jeans, or see Grandchildren) that you may still miss what your <em>lifelong</em> task is, and thus the results may be temporary. The book states that what we should be focusing on is what God wants us to do, and realize his plans don&#8217;t include the extra weight we are carrying.</p>
<p><em><strong>We are God’s workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. EPHESIANS 2:10</strong></em></p>
<p>In looking at our schedule, are the activities we partake in something that God wants us involved in? When someone asks you to do something, have you ever asked God if it&#8217;s a good idea?</p>

Why you should take care of your body. The Apostle Paul writes in<em><strong> 1 Corinthians 6:19: Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?</strong></em> If my body is a temple for God, then what I put into it can be an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">act of worship</span>. A way to obey God, and a way to put God first. Another great analogy in the books talks about how our bodies are on loan from God. What if your mother in-laws loaned you their prized family punch bowl. When you use this, you probably don&#8217;t have any small children at the table. You handle it with care. You hand wash it. You make absolutely sure not to drop it or break it. Why? Because you know how much your mother in law values that piece. She also knows how hard it would be to replace.</p>
<p><em><strong>Corinthians 6:19 Paul lets us know that honoring the Lord with our physical being is a command: Therefore honor God with your body.</strong></em></p>
<p>We all know that we use food for fuel. We get hung up on how food makes US feel. This book made me change my complete outlook on fuel. Food and eating are now a way for me to praise God. It&#8217;s a way to say thank you for my body. To appreciate the one of a kind gift that he has given me. <em><strong>Romans 12:1: I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God—this is your spiritual act of worship.</strong></em><br />
Instead of worshipping food, food can be used to worship God.</p>
<p>The book talks about the story of Nehemiah, and points out how his quest to rebuild Jerusalem. The same steps that Nehemiah took to rebuild the city, we can use to rebuild our bodies. Nehemiah built walls (to block bad things) and gates (to let in good things). She then breaks down the seven steps of rebuilding yourself.</p>
<p><strong>1. Cry out to God.</strong></p>
<p>We have talked about accepting responsibility for you actions. Acknowledge what you&#8217;ve done, and realize that this won&#8217;t be fixed over night. Cry out to God for the strength to rebuild your body.</p>
<p><strong>2. Seek Forgiveness</strong></p>
<p>Proverbs mentions that gluttony is a sin. Take some time to identify the habits you have, and how these are not helping you take care of the gift that is your body. Ask God to forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>3. Ask for Empowerment</strong></p>
<p>The author makes a great point here, &#8220;God Himself. God will always grant us the power to do that which is according to His will—and by now I hope you are convinced that your improved health is most certainly God’s will for you. And the wonderful thing is that all you have to do.&#8221; The key to do this every morning, <em>before</em> temptation is in front of you.</p>
<p><strong>4. Take an honest Assessment of your health</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before when you are getting directions to some place, the first piece of information is your current location so you can figure out how to get from HERE to THERE. Sit down with some quiet time with God, and take a good long look at yourself.</p>
<p><strong>5. Verbalize your commitment to change.</strong></p>
<p>Nehemiah publicly spoke of his plans to rebuild the city walls. He did this to let people know of his plans, and to also enlist their help.</p>
<p><strong>6. Develop a Detailed Action Plan.</strong></p>
<p>Nehemiah knew what was broken, and who was going to rebuild that section. Not sure where to start? Ask God. When in doubt pray first.</p>
<p><strong>7. Use the Buddy System</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</strong></em>, where Solomon observes, <em><strong>Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work: If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up!…Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves.</strong></em></p>
<p>There is another step I would add. When Nehemiah finished the rebuilding of the city walls, he celebrated. <strong>So I say celebrate</strong> when you reach a goal. If you say, &#8220;But that&#8217;s in 30 pounds!&#8221; I say, &#8220;Set goals of two pounds, and you&#8217;ll celebrate 15 times more (and you&#8217;ll build momentum and confidence along the way).</p>
<h3>And They&#8217;ll Know We Are Christians By Our Bloat</h3>
<p>If Christians are supposed to follow God&#8217;s guidelines (the bible), we should look and act differently from those who do not. I once got a &#8220;Are you kidding me?&#8221; look at a Christmas party where I explained that I do not drink alcohol. While the bible doesn&#8217;t say &#8220;do not drink alcohol&#8221; (it says don&#8217;t get drunk), I prefer to avoid it all together. I stood out. The problem is many people think this is a Christian trying to be self-righteous. This is not the case in my situation. My point being, that in some situation we should stick out like a sore thumb. Instead according to the book Christians are <em>more likely</em>to be obese than non church goers (with my old denomination the Baptists leading the way).</p>
<p>If we live a way that most people do not (eating healthy, honoring God for the gift of our bodies) we will live a way that most people don&#8217;t (void of medications, surgeries, and disease) in the future.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to make changes for the better in our life. Listen to Isaiah, <em><strong>&#8220;I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.&#8221; ISAIAH 43:19</strong></em></p>
<h3>For Those Who are Not Fans of God</h3>
<p>If you are not a fan of all this God talk, most post modernism people tend to view themselves as the creator of all things good in their lives. To this I would say, &#8220;You get one body. Take care of it. Do not put your faith in science to save you in the future. It&#8217;s not going to matter how much money you make to get the best doctors. Sadly, that didn&#8217;t work for Steve Jobs (I have no idea what Steve&#8217;s spiritual side was, my point being science can&#8217;t always save you). Honor yourself by putting good things into your body.</p>

<p>For me, I never understood why they brough Anna Kournikova on to the biggest loser. While she is/was an athlete, I never saw her as a trainer. However, while watching the show and the support she received from her contestants I thought I might be wrong. It turns how that she may have been hired to tr to fill Jillian Michael&#8217;s shoes (who always appeared as &#8220;TV&#8217;s Toughest Trainer&#8221;) but if you listen to Jillian&#8217;s podcast, or watched her &#8220;Losting It&#8221; show you know that Jillian also has a software side that allows her to get inside the heads of her contestants. Apparently not the case with Anna.</p>
<p>Anna Kournikova had a hard childhood growing up in Russia. From what I&#8217;ve read, she may not have been so sympathetic to her overweight contestants who were complaining about the trainin beging to hard. One report stated she was a &#8220;Nightmare.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad they are keeping Dolvett Quince who I feel is a qualified trainer. It will be interesting to see if the squeak in another female as they have almost always had a female be it Jillian, Anna, or going back <a title="Kim Lyons" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003IWYLNY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003IWYLNY" target="_blank">Kim Lyons</a> who replaced Jillian when she left the first time.</p>
<p>What did you think of Anna? Will you miss her?</p>

<p>I just found out about a new service that if you are using a tracking tool such as a fitbit or the <a title="Bodyfit Media" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049POHK6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0049POHK6" target="_blank">bodyfit media</a>, you can sign up for a free account at <a title="Earndit.com" href="http://www.earndit.com" target="_blank">earndit.com</a> and earn points for your activity that can learn to rewards which includes points to go shopping. These include great healthy treats, as well as shoes, outdoor items, and many more. This even works with international listeners. For me I love the Bodybugg, and the Bodybuggsp, but if you are looking for something that doesn&#8217;t require a monthly fee, check out the <a title="Fitbit Fitness Tracking Tool" href="http://www.logicalloss.com/fitbit" target="_blank">Fit bit</a>. To earn points at <a title="Earndit.com" href="http://www.earndit.com" target="_blank">earndit.com</a> you need a track device (if you had to manually enter the data, it might be easy to cheat).</p>

<p>Dave mentions that he likes <a title="Halloween Aftermath – Truth About Eggs" href="http://logicalloss.com/halloween-aftermath-truth-about-eggs/">Eggies</a>, you just have to clean them out, and spray them be before using them.</p>

<h3>The Good Old Days</h3>
<p>In moving into a new location I had my share of looking at old pictures, etc. I realized that much like the Billy Joel song, &#8220;The Good old days weren&#8217;t always good, and tomorrow ain&#8217;t as bad as it seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>Today I did some research and found two doctors who foudn a study from the New England Jounral of Medicine that did some research and hsowed that while people do gain weight over the year, the &#8220;10 lbs between Thanksgiving and New Years&#8221; seems to be a bit of an urban legend. <a title="The Truth About Holiday Weight Gain" href="http://blogs.plos.org/obesitypanacea/2010/12/17/the-truth-about-holiday-weight-gain/" target="_blank">You can read the full article here</a>.</p>
<p>It was interesting tat an article at Fitday stated the &#8220;gain 10 lbs: meam. It did have some<a title="FitDay - Satying Lean During the Holiday Season" href="http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/fitness/start-the-new-year-ahead-of-the-game.html" target="_blank"> interesting options </a>for staying lean duringthe holiday season. As I was over there I see where Fitday has added some new features. Mainly:</p>
<p><a href="http://logicalloss.com/FitDay" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px; border: 0pt none;" src="http://www.shareasale.com/image/Button_GoodChoices.gif" alt="" width="127" height="127" border="0" /></a>1. You can use their desktop verison and it will sync iwth their website. Very cool.</p>
<p>2. They have an iPhone app.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always liked Fitday&#8217;s application for tracking Exercise and Fitness as it added an emotional tracking (how dod you feel). This makes it easy to see that when you are not so happy, you are vulnerable to emotional eating. You can try a free tiral at <a title="Fitday" href="http://logicalloss.com/FitDay" target="_blank">www.logicalloss.com/fitday</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>I Lost My Fitbit</h3>
<p><a title="Fitbit Ultra" href="http://www.logicalloss.com/fitbit" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" src="http://www.shareasale.com/image/31379/A-Banner-125-by-125-2b-3.jpg" alt="Fitbit Ultra" width="125" height="125" border="0" /></a>I really loved my Fitbit. It was like a cross between a BodybuggSP and a Pedometer. I had one, and I unfortunately sent it through a trip in the washing machine. It actually still worked, but the battery life was very bad. Someone donated one to me, and I loved it (it was the new fitbit ultra), and it track not only steps, but stairs, and it has a bult in timer, and can track you sleep. It was a very cool tool, and I didn&#8217;t realize how much of a motivational tool it was until I didn&#8217;t have it. I finaly dug out my old <a title="Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometer with Health Management Software 	 Omron HJ-720ITC Pocket Pedometer with Health Management Software" href="http://astore.amazon.com/logical-20/detail/B000MN92WM" target="_blank">Omron unit </a>(which was a good unit, but not as fun as the fit bit), and I found out that I was only taking about 3,00 steps a day.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I&#8217;ve defintely added a fitbit to my <a title="Wish List" href="http://amzn.com/w/3C2LD1KFRAF6J" target="_blank">Wish list for Santa</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stuffbak.com" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="Stuff Bak Sticker Use Coupon Dave 10 to Save 10%" src="http://davidjackson.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/lobby_large_rectangle.gif" alt="" width="181" height="57" /></a></p>
<p>In the meantime you might want to consider purchaisng some <a title="Stuff Bak" href="http://www.stuffbak.com" target="_blank">Stuff Bak stickers</a> (that increase your chance of getting something back that you lost by 70%). Use the coupon code <strong>Dave10</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Are there Times When Weight Loss Should Not Be Attempted?</h3>
<p>As I&#8217;m up three lbs since our last podcast, I started to wonder if there are time when we should put off weight loss until we have other priorities in palce. When I think about Maslow&#8217;s Heirchy of needs, the first one is shelter, food, safety, etc. Recently with my job situation this has been a huge concern (we are actually moving into a less expensive housing). So I thought, maybe its wong to try and lose weight now. I&#8217;m so focused on this other very important NEEDS that i&#8217;m really setting myself up for failure.</p>
<p>This is dangerous thinking. Whenever we give ourselves the &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it later&#8221; or &#8220;It&#8217;s ok,&#8221; light we open up the flood gates to future health issues. I live in Cleveland. We haven&#8217;t had a sports championship team here in my lifetime (I beleive the browns won before I was born).  Howver, year after year our teams take the field knowing that they are probably not going home with a trophy. They still play to win. You don&#8217;t win if you don&#8217;t try. While you may not be moving forward as fast as you want, you are not aiding the urge to move backwars towards unhealthy habits and meals. Never give up.</p>
<p>What do you think? Are there times when you should put weight loss on hold, so you can get the rest of your life together? Is it pointless?</p>

		<itunes:summary>Today I did some research and found two doctors who foudn a study from the New England Jounral of Medicine that did some research and hsowed that while people do gain weight over the year, the "10 lbs between Thanksgiving and New Years" seems to be a bit of an urban legend. You can read the full article here.

It was interesting tat an article at Fitday stated the "gain 10 lbs: meam. It did have some interesting options for staying lean duringthe holiday season. As I was over there I see where Fitday has added some new features. Mainly:

1. You can use their desktop verison and it will sync iwth their website. Very cool.

2. They have an iPhone app.

I've always liked Fitday's application for tracking Exercise and Fitness as it added an emotional tracking (how dod you feel). This makes it easy to see that when you are not so happy, you are vulnerable to emotional eating. You can try a free tiral at www.logicalloss.com/fitday.

 
I Lost My Fitbit
I really loved my Fitbit. It was like a cross between a BodybuggSP and a Pedometer. I had one, and I unfortunately sent it through a trip in the washing machine. It actually still worked, but the battery life was very bad. Someone donated one to me, and I loved it (it was the new fitbit ultra), and it track not only steps, but stairs, and it has a bult in timer, and can track you sleep. It was a very cool tool, and I didn't realize how much of a motivational tool it was until I didn't have it. I finaly dug out my old Omron unit (which was a good unit, but not as fun as the fit bit), and I found out that I was only taking about 3,00 steps a day.

With this in mind, I've defintely added a fitbit to my Wish list for Santa.



In the meantime you might want to consider purchaisng some Stuff Bak stickers (that increase your chance of getting something back that you lost by 70%). Use the coupon code Dave10

 
Are there Times When Weight Loss Should Not Be Attempted?
As I'm up three lbs since our last podcast, I started to wonder if there are time when we should put off weight loss until we have other priorities in palce. When I think about Maslow's Heirchy of needs, the first one is shelter, food, safety, etc. Recently with my job situation this has been a huge concern (we are actually moving into a less expensive housing). So I thought, maybe its wong to try and lose weight now. I'm so focused on this other very important NEEDS that i'm really setting myself up for failure.

This is dangerous thinking. Whenever we give ourselves the "I'll do it later" or "It's ok," light we open up the flood gates to future health issues. I live in Cleveland. We haven't had a sports championship team here in my lifetime (I beleive the browns won before I was born).  Howver, year after year our teams take the field knowing that they are probably not going home with a trophy. They still play to win. You don't win if you don't try. While you may not be moving forward as fast as you want, you are not aiding the urge to move backwars towards unhealthy habits and meals. Never give up.

What do you think? Are there times when you should put weight loss on hold, so you can get the rest of your life together? Is it pointless?</itunes:summary>

<h3><a href="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/egg.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2120" title="egg" src="http://logicalloss.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/egg.png" alt="" width="250" height="166" /></a>The Truth About Eggs</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, Eggs don&#8217;t deserve the bad wrap they get. The bad part of the Egg is the yolk, but if you eat 2 eggs (or less) a day <em>in conjunction with a low-fat diet</em> you&#8217;re fine and enjoy the many benefits of eggs. For me, I just hard boil mine, and don&#8217;t eat the yolk. I found a great article about <a title="Hard Boiled Eggs" href="http://www.askmen.com/sports/foodcourt_60/66b_eating_well.html" target="_blank">Eggs at Men&#8217;s Health</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Egg Cookers</strong></h3>
<p>I watched an <a title="Eggies" href="http://logicalloss.com/eggies" target="_blank">Eggies </a>commercial and got sucked into finding a way to microwave eggs and not have to deal with the Shells. In the end I&#8217;m not sure this exists. In doing some research, the eggies system is made for really small eggs. We don&#8217;t have really small eggs, and you still have to wait for the water to boil.</p>
<p>Currently I use an <a title="Egg Genie" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RXLGU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0026RXLGU" target="_blank">EggGenie. </a>Which works well. It&#8217;s a great &#8220;hands off&#8221; way to cook eggs. In looking at Amazon.com they had some other options there is a <a title="Microwave Egg Cooker" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007M2BN0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=logical-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B0007M2BN0" target="_blank">Microwave Egg cooker</a> which sounds like it works fine once you get the time right. Just be careful with the unit as its very hot when you take it out.</p>
