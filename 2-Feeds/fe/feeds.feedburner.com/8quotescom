<p style="clear: both">Believe it or not…life is not fair. Occasionally the bad guy wins, people do play favorites, some good people die young, some people will let you down and not everyone is honest. While we can accept this, it shouldn’t stop us from dreaming big, working hard and doing what is right.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Sometimes it’s who you know and not what you know that matters. It won’t matter that you are the better qualified or the obvious choice. Some will always select people who they personally like better than you. Others who you rely on will let you down. The is especially hard to accept if you are someone who always keeps their word and does what is right. If you’re like that, you automatically think others should too. We could have all saved ourselves a lot of emotional stress if we’d had known all this before we venture out into the real world.</p>
<p style="clear: both">If we’d have learned the way the world worked a young age, we’d have never invested so much in the opinions others have about us. We’d have realized that it’s simply not advantageous to always try to please others. However, it’s still important to keep in mind that life is worth living. The secret is to always keep an optimistic outlook. You simply have to learn how to deal with the negative while seeking out the positive. Once you’ve learned this lesson, you will have the ability to still go out and enjoy a full and rewarding existence no matter how unfair life treats you.</p>

<p style="clear: both">
<p style="clear: both">Once you’ve decided to make a lasting change in your life, you need to accurately identify the reasons that are motivating this change and why the change is important to you. This is key because motivation is sometimes fleeting. It comes and goes without warning. One minute it’s there, the next it’s gone. In order to make lasting changes, you must control this motivation.</p>
<p style="clear: both">This can be accomplished by reaffirming your motivation each and every day. With daily reaffirmation, you are in effect renewing the promise you made to yourself to institute a change. This is something that should be included in your daily ritual….take a shower, brush your teeth, reaffirm your motivation, etc.</p>
<p style="clear: both">It often helps to relive previous successes by remembering the feeling of accomplishment you had when you succeeded in the past. Also, write down a plan for making this change. By putting your plan in writing, you create a continual reminder of what needs to be done.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Making a lasting change requires both motivation and commitment. When your motivation starts to fade, take out your written plan and review it. Try to renew the excitement you had when initially decide a change was needed. Acknowledge that the change will promote your personal growth. By doing this, the change you’re planning today will eventually become habit later on.</p>

<p style="clear: both">Greatness means different things to different people. If you want to choose greatness for yourself you must start out by defining what it means to you. While greatness may have some basic general qualities that most would consider unique, there is a broader definition each individual must identify for themselves. But if you don’t know what it is, you’ll never achieve it.</p>
<p style="clear: both">So what is the primary quality of greatness? Most would say the ability to distinguish yourself by rising above the rest of your peers by means of your efforts toward, and dealings with other people. Believing that everything you do moves you a little closer towards the goal of achieving this distinction will take you a long way on your journey to being great!</p>
<p style="clear: both">The very first step toward greatness is to create a plan. Many hope to achieve greatness, but never have a plan for doing so. You need to map your goals and what you must accomplish in order to realize those goals. Your plan will need to be periodically evaluated. How else can you objectively decide if you are proceeding toward your goals? So, every six months, step back and evaluate your progress to see if you are proceeding as planned.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Remember, achieving greatness is not easy. You will probably work harder and incur more setbacks than most others. Also, keep in mind that real greatness is not an individual accomplishment. Those who wish to be truly great will share the rewards of greatness. Bring along as many people as you can so everyone can eat from the tree of success.</p>

<p style="clear: both">I have been receiving a few emails from listeners to 8Quotes about the current economic situation. Most of the emails revolve around the fact that people are in jobs they don’t like and want to get out. However the economic crisis is preventing them from taking that jump. Without knowing all the details it’s hard to help people in this area. However, I can offer some advice on how to stay motivated during these times. First let me share an article I recently wrote about this.</p>
<blockquote style="clear: both"><p>When we were young, we all knew what we wanted to be when we grew up. All my friends wanted to be policemen, firemen, pilots or rock stars. Yet, none of us ever became any of those things. As we grew older, we realized that our occupations must provide adequate income to pay our financial obligations. So we stopped dreaming and took the first job that provided us with some sort of financial security. We rationalized this by reasoning that a job is a job and we’ll find fun and happiness after work or on the weekends. But do we really find happiness this way? Wouldn’t it be better if we could work at what we really love to do instead of complaining about our work? Is it still possible to find a job that makes you truly happy? It’s never too late to try to find a job that we actually enjoy doing, but it does take a little time and effort.</p>
<p>Start out by finding what you’re good at and what talents you actually possess. Recall your youth and what you once loved to do. Remember the things that always came easier to you than others. Analyze which values are important and how these could all translate into possible occupations or careers. Be creative and don’t rule something out just because it’s not very “sensible.” Remember, you’re just exploring the possibilities. Once you have some ideas, share this information with those who offer the kind of positions you might be interested in. You might be surprised about the positive response you receive.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t you really rather enjoy what you do? Wouldn’t you prefer an environment where work becomes effortless, instead of draining? A job where you can grow and develop while tapping into your personal creativity. Wouldn’t that make you a better father, mother or spouse in the long run? Allowing yourself to realize your own ambitions can have a positive affect on everyone around you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="clear: both">Now it’s not always realistic to run off and quit a good job that provides for you and your family. I am not saying you should do that at all. Instead take advantage of your down time and find your passion. I myself was in this exact situation. I was working as a Financial Adviser in one of the worlds largest banks. I was earning a significant income and at that time this industry had a very secure future.</p>
<p style="clear: both">But I had a calling. My biggest joy in life was helping people improve their lives. Whenever an opportunity came to help one of my friends or coworkers I got excited. The problem was, I couldn’t just quit a job that paid well and spend my time wandering the streets helping random people. So instead I used my free time to figure out what I wanted to do and then I slowly implemented my plan.</p>
<p style="clear: both">It all started with lunch hours. I’d spend my lunch working on my new business. I’d watch the clock counting down the minutes until I could take my laptop and head the cafeteria to work. It was in that crowded cafeteria that I built the my current business. After about a year of building and preparing I was finally in a position where I could leave and work on what I was truly passionate about.</p>
<p style="clear: both">It doesn’t matter what your goal or dream is… if you’re not working towards it in some small way then it just won’t happen. You can’t wish things true, you have to work them true. So figure out what it is you want and then find a way to go for it. Work on it during your lunch like I did, or stay up until midnight doing it. You are never given the gift of a goal or a dream without the accompanying ability to achieve it. So figure it out and find a way. I know you can make it happen.</p>
<p style="clear: both">And to the listeners that emailed me… How do you stay motivated? You start by figuring out what you’d like to do with your life, finding your passion, finding your voice. Once you’ve done that you work your bum off to make it happen. When you are moving in the direction of your dreams staying motivated is effortless.</p>
<p style="clear: both">If you have a question or something you’d like answered feel free to email me through my website and I’d be happy to help.</p>

<p style="clear: both">Why do some people become extremely successful and others do not? Mainly because successful people found it easy to do the things that were needed to make them successful, while the others found it easier not to do those things. Those achieving unlimited success found it easy to attend seminars, read books, attend classes and associate themselves with successful people. But the unsuccessful found it much easier not to do these things, or any other of the things necessary to ensure their own success.</p>
<p style="clear: both">While some become rich and successful, other sit around and blame their parents, the government, the economy or someone else, even though they were the ones that neglected to do the basic things needed to achieve success. The primary reason some never achieve their desired level of accomplishment can be summed up with one simple word… neglect!</p>
<p style="clear: both">Some people just seem to neglect the fact that everything they could ever need to become successful was well within their reach. Neglect is like a cancer that if left unchecked will circulate throughout the body and mind leading to a loss of life just as with any other malignant tumor. A loss of the life they could have had if they had only done the things they knew they should have. As a result, they began to feel guilty and guilt always erodes self-confidence. As self-confidence declines, so does attitude which ultimately results in complacency and mediocrity.</p>

<p style="clear: both">Most of us seek to achieve positive outcomes in our lives. However, many of us attempt to achieve this without having a specific plan to do so. There are several factors that influence how we reach our positive goals and our friendships are one of the most influential factors of all. Because friends tend to have access to our innermost thoughts and desires, this gives them the ability to exert undue influence on our actions.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Since our friends can have substantial influence over our actions, it might be a good idea to consider exactly who your friends are. It’s often said that if you wish to be happy, you should hang around with happy people. The opposite is also true! If your friends are always complaining and hold a pessimistic view of life, you may want to re-evaluate these friendships. Take a good look at each of those you regularly associate with. Are they the positive and encouraging types, or do they spend a lot of time blaming others for adversity? If you look around and don’t like what you see, it may be time to find some new friends.</p>
<p style="clear: both">Happy people with positive attitudes are not that hard to find. You can recognize them as the ones who always handle pressure and stress well. These are the same people who are always willing to help and can brush off adversity with a smile. It’s no secret…if you want to be successful and content, then hang around with people who are happy and positive. Since your friends can have a significant influence on your actions, choose those who will provide the positive support you need. Remember, others can tell a lot about you by looking at the friends you choose to associate with.</p>

<p><strong>Credibility</strong><br />
<em>by, Corey Wells</em> </p>
<p>The key ingredients for developing credibility are honesty and integrity. Credibility is at the core of our ability to provide strong leadership and influence the acts of others. Trustworthiness and credibility are the hallmark characteristics of any strong leader.</p>
<p>While honesty and integrity are terms usually mentioned when we speak of leadership, there are some who seem to think these are things you can slide on and off like a coat. They’ll talk about personal honesty and business integrity as if they are just different jackets you can slip on depending on which environment you’re in. They confuse “showing honesty” with “being honest.” This amounts to no more than just “acting honest.” People can easily see through this and respond accordingly. So which is the real you?</p>
<p>One good thing about fear and greed is they often reveal our true character. When we face a disaster or unforeseen difficulty, how do we react? If we encounter a great opportunity for a big financial, career, or power gain, what do we do? How we deal with these situations where the stakes are extremely high will reveal our true character. The choices we make during those moments of tough decision will expose the extent of our integrity. Are we going to display honesty and integrity when it’s convenient or if we think others are watching…or do we still exercise these traits no matter what the situation? It’s what we do in the dark that truly defines us.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s  get started.</p>

<li>“Never continue in a job you don’t enjoy. If you’re happy in what you’re doing, you’ll like yourself, you’ll have inner peace. And if you have that, along with physical health, you will have had more success than you could possibly have imagined.”<br />
Johnny Carson</li>
<p></p>
<li>“Write something to suit yourself and many people will like it; write something to suit everybody and scarcely anyone will care for it.”<br />

<p><strong>Can You Handle Success</strong><br />
<em>by, Corey Wells</em> </p>
<p>Every time you get close to achieving your goal and ultimate success, something pops up to ruin your focus, kill your motivation or sabotage your confidence. Something always stops you from taking that one last step and suddenly you have to start all over. Of course this something has a name; “Fear of Success.” Fear of Success is often even more dangerous than the fear of failure. More dangerous because it hides in the subconscious. Since we’re not fully aware of it, it keeps sneaking up on us. And as time passes, it becomes increasingly more difficult to take action and get motivated.</p>
<p>So what’s causing you subconscious to behave this way? It could be that you are associating success with a negative result. You subconscious may be thinking “Once I become successful I’ll have to put in 15 hours a day, seven days a week.” Or maybe “I’m not really ready to handle the responsibility of managing a huge successful business.” Deep down inside your subconscious is protecting you by pointing out possible results you don’t find desirable. But it doesn’t have to be like that. You are capable of creating your own reality and the subsequent outcomes. So what can be done to defeat these fears?</p>
<p>The first step is to acknowledge the fear. Ask yourself, what are the negative thoughts you fear will ruin your dream. Make a list. Now develop 2 or 3 positive affirmations you are ready to embrace. Every time you feel the negative beliefs stirring, recite your affirmations until the feeling goes away. Eventually the negative beliefs will be replaced by the positive. Remember, what ever you want you can have, as soon as you conquer your fear of success.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s  get started.</p>

<li>” Beauty is unbearable, drives us to despair, offers us for a minute the glimpse of an eternity that we should like to stretch out over the whole of time.”<br />
Albert Camus
</li>
<p></p>
<li>” But what is Hope? Nothing but the paint on the face of Existence; the least touch of truth rubs it off, and then we see what a hollow-cheeked harlot we have got hold of.”<br />

Alexis Carrel </li>
<p></p>
<li>“I feel my belief in sacrifice and struggle getting stronger. I despise the kind of existence that clings to the miserly trifles of comfort and self-interest. I think that a man should not live beyond the age when he begins to deteriorate, when the flame that lighted the brightest moment of his life has weakened.”<br />
Fidel Castro</li>

<p><strong>The Secret to Happiness</strong><br />
<em>by, Corey Wells</em> </p>
<p>Technically, happiness is the easiest thing in the world to achieve. All you have to do is simply choose to be happy. However, there are many who will tell you that you can’t be happy unless you possess specific things or act in a certain way. We’ve been brought up to believe that being happy is dependent upon the way we act or our acquisition of possessions. But true happiness is achieved when you live your life according to your own desires. You’ll inevitably feel unfulfilled if you live your life according to desires of others.</p>
<p>Happiness in life is accomplished when what you do is in perfect harmony with your ideals and beliefs, no matter what they are. Since our choices create results, it is very important to first understand what it is you really want and how you are going to achieve it.</p>
<p>A positive attitude plays a huge role in being successful, fulfilled and happy. Choosing to always adopt a positive attitude, no matter what happens, allows you to easily incorporate the ideals and desires you wish to manifest in your life. The marriage of attitude with ideals ends up attracting more of what you desire and true happiness will be the ultimate result.</p>

<p><strong>When Opportunity Knocks</strong><br />
<em>by, Corey Wells</em> </p>
<p>If an opportunity were to present itself later today, will you be ready? When the phone rings later tonight and you are asked to make a presentation to a huge client in the morning, will you be prepared? If you were offered a job at double your current responsibility, would you take it? If the boss quits tomorrow and the company looks to you as a replacement, are you ready?</p>
<p>As often happens in life, opportunities sometimes seem to come out of nowhere. You may be technically competent to take advantage of a situation, but will you be mentally ready. Some will make excuses why they can’t grab an opportunity when it lands in their lap with comments like, “I don’t think I have the experience”, or “There’s not enough time to prepare.” Do any of these sound familiar?</p>
<p>The perfect alignment between the availability of opportunity and your preparedness rarely occurs. You need to be ready when opportunity knocks, because most times, it only knocks once and you need to get to the door. So how do you get prepared? Practice! You must prepare your body, mind and skills as if every day there will come a knock at the door. Search your soul to discover what you really want. Then ask yourself, “Am I ready?”</p>
