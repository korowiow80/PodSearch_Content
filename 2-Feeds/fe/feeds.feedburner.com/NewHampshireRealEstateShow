      <description>Less than an hour north of Boston is Hollis, New Hampshire, a bedroom community for many commuters who work in Massachusetts but choose to live in tax free New Hampshire. With a population of just over 7000 residents, Hollis is perfectly situated to enjoy all of the best of what living in New England has to offer - the seacoast, the mountains, the Lakes Region and Boston are easily accessible from Hollis. The town center village of Hollis is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;br/&gt;This stunning mint condition home is located in the superior Crestwood Estates neighborhood of Hollis. Extensive landscaping plus an irrigation system keeps the grounds green and lush all summer long.&lt;br/&gt;Completely renovated, this home boasts over 4,000 square feet of living space.&lt;br/&gt;As you enter the home, the formal dining room is elegant and conveniently located near the new, beautiful eat in kitchen. Crown Point cherry cabinetry is accented by top of the line stainless steel Wolf and SubZero appliances and set off by gleaming granite countertops.&lt;br/&gt;A half bath and mudroom is located off the kitchen.&lt;br/&gt;The extra large family room boasts an exquisite coffered ceiling, with a wall to wall brick fireplace - the perfect compliment to our beautiful New England winters. A small wet bar near the kitchen makes entertaining a breeze.&lt;br/&gt;The formal living room is elegant and located just to the left of the foyer.&lt;br/&gt;The large den is dramatic and sun drenched thanks to skylights and floor to ceiling windows throughout. The adjacent office shares a 'see through' fireplace with the living space, and the glass doors open to the fenced in Gunite swimming pool.&lt;br/&gt;The hospitality of this home extends to the second level, where you'll find the master bedroom suite, offering his and hers closets plus a full attached bathroom.&lt;br/&gt;There are also 3 additional, good sized bedrooms, and another full bathroom completing this level.&lt;br/&gt;The finished lower level is perfect for a media room or game room and features a walkout. An attached 2 car garage and an additional 1 car heated garage for the hobbyist is located in the lower level as well. A 20KVA propane auto switch generator powers the whole home in case of a power outage. Additional features include a security system, central vacuum and air conditioning.&lt;br/&gt;For a personal tour of this home, call Rudy Mayer (603) 466-7316 or visit &lt;a href="http://www.HollisHomesForSale.com/"&gt;HollisHomesForSale.com&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>The Town of Hudson is located on the east bank of the Merrimack river in southern New Hampshire. It covers approximately 29 square miles and is home to about 25,000 people. Hudson offers quiet open spaces and an abundance of recreational opportunities including two golf courses, the Robinson Pond recreation area, a skate park, and a number of sports fields and facilities. In addition, Hudson has developed into an industrial and commercial center thanks in part to its proximity to critical highways: the F. E. Everett Turnpike on the west and Interstate 93 on the east.</description>

      <description>Exemplifying the town's colonial flair, Amherst's centerpiece is the Village Green. Visitors strolling past beautiful colonial-era homes and the magnificent town center, can feel the town's deep sense of history. One of only two towns in the country listed in its entirety as a Historic District, Amherst exemplifies late 18th- and early 19th-century architecture and charm.&lt;br/&gt;The homes of Amherst signify appreciation for the heritage of the town, a heritage that goes back to its early days as a Narragansett township. At that time, land was granted by the state of Massachusetts for service rendered in the Narragansett wars. From this grant, Amherst began as part of Dunstable, Massachusetts, then became Dunstable, New Hampshire, and finally Amherst.</description>

      <description>As the only city twice voted by Money Magazine as the “Number One City” to call home, Nashua has unique appeal. Nicknamed “The Gate City,” Nashua is considered the gateway to New Hampshire. The second largest city in the state and the center of a diverse and dynamic region of over 187,000 people, Nashua is endowed with urban amenities as well as retaining the charm of the traditional New England landscape. Nashua’s population has nearly doubled since 1960. The combination of an excellent quality of life and proximity to Boston, the seacoast and the White Mountains makes Nashua an attractive growth center for New England.&lt;br/&gt;The construction boom of the mid 80’s with it attendant escalation of real estate costs, has reversed. More than any other community in the region, Nashua offers diversity of housing choices for rental or purchase, ranging from historic properties to new condominiums and subdivisions.&lt;br/&gt;Housing is largely comprised of three bedroom, multi-family developments with pools, tennis courts and playgrounds. Prices range from below $250,000 to $400,000. The average three bedroom home costs $250,000. The areas are exquisitely planned, providing beautiful, spacious neighborhoods with excellent views.&lt;br/&gt;Nashua’s North End, including the Nashville Historic District, has been the City’s most affluent residential neighborhood for more than a century. The handsome homes in this area line the edge of Concord Street near Greeley park. They range from the early 19th to the early 20th Century, with a particular emphasis on Victorian architecture.&lt;br/&gt;The older textile mills lining the Nashua River have been renovated into condominiums, popular for their proximity to downtown’s Main Street. Spit Brook Road in south Nashua is home to many condominium developments with pools, tennis courts and playgrounds which are conveniently located close to Route 3.&lt;br/&gt;Nashua is in the midst of a five-year revitalization plan focused on improving its already outstanding educational system. The district consists of twelve elementary schools (K-5)three middle schools (6-8) one alternative school (6-10) and two comprehensive senior high schools (9-12).&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 13,225 students attend. Parental involvement is important to the schools, as is community and business involvement. State-of-the-art computer systems are in place in the schools with their own web sites.&lt;br/&gt;There are also many options for private school education. There are eight private and parochial schools in the city of Nashua, and another 93 within thirty miles. These institutions offer smaller class sizes and specialized curricula.&lt;br/&gt;Higher education opportunities also abound in Nashua. Students can pursue a degree in aviation, engineering or computer technology, or study a health-care profession.&lt;br/&gt;Residents in Nashua have access to the best health care providers in the area.&lt;br/&gt;St. Joseph Healthcare includes a 208-bed acute care emergency and Level 2 Trauma Center. Their regional healthcare system encompasses a satellite emergency center in Milford, six family medical centers, a large network of primary care and specialty physician practices; Rockingham Ambulance, Granite State Mediquip, Adult Day Health Center, Souhegan Home &amp;amp; Hospice Care and the SurgiCenter and Community Health Education programs. St. Joseph Healthcare is a member of Covenant Health Systems, owned by the Sisters of Charity of Montreal.&lt;br/&gt;For more than 100 years, Southern New Hampshire Medical Center has literally been at the heart of better health for Greater Nashua. A familiar landmark long known as the “downtown hospital,” their main campus has grown along with the city.&lt;br/&gt;Today, the Medical Center’s modern facilities, including the new, glass-walled Health and Education Building, occupy several blocks surrounding their original location.&lt;br/&gt;They run a Level II Trauma Center, as well as a number of innovative programs, including The New England Institute for Health and Wellness. They deliver convenient local access to comprehensive health care, with preventive, diagnostic, treatment and support services.&lt;br/&gt;Despite its over 87,000 people and many tourists, Nashua is still incredibly safe. The overall crime rate is recorded at 35.5 incidents per 1,000 residents, far below the national average. However, the vast majority of these crimes are committed against property and not people. The violent crime in Nashua is an amazing 84% below the national average, and Nashua can proudly proclaim its streets and neighborhoods safe.&lt;br/&gt;Locals credit much of the low crime rate to active public awareness and a proactive Police force. Programs such as the “ Senior Citizens Police Academy” increase public awareness and knowledge in the Nashua community. A new police station and cyber-crime unit make Nashua’s finest, finer.&lt;br/&gt;Nashua’s menu of cultural and recreational offering defies a quality of life which natives have always cherished and which continues to attract new residents.&lt;br/&gt;Nashua’s two large parks, Greeley Park and Mine Falls Park, are important cornerstones for community activities.&lt;br/&gt;Greeley Park’s Band Shell is a favorite area to go during special evening for Nashuans. Locals spread out blankets, bring a basket of goodies and relax under the stars as they wait for the evening’s performance to begin. Here you can enjoy anything from a Shakespeare play, the sixty member Nashua Symphony or a jazz ensemble.&lt;br/&gt;Near the center of town is the historic Holman Stadium, which serves as home field for the Nashua Pride, an independent league baseball team.&lt;br/&gt;Around Mine Falls Park you will find residents walking, jogging, biking, cross-country skiing and enjoying other favorite outdoor pastimes.&lt;br/&gt;Downtown, along brick-paved sidewalks, the city celebrates throughout the year. A brisk November evening might find Nashua locals on a holiday candlelight stroll, while April or June brings celebrations for the “Taste of Downtown”. Rarely is such an active and vibrant downtown found in a city the size of Nashua.&lt;br/&gt;Nashua is undeniably charming, with its Railroad Square and brick-paved sidewalks this city has a personality that is all its own. Nashua is not your typical New England town, for those who still need a taste of a Currier and Ives village scene, a visit to anyone of the following ten neighboring towns should do the trick. There you can experience historic New England and delight in the charm of towns unchanged since the 1800’s.</description>

      <itunes:summary>As the only city twice voted by Money Magazine as the “Number One City” to call home, Nashua has unique appeal. Nicknamed “The Gate City,” Nashua is considered the gateway to New Hampshire. The second largest city in the state and the center of a diverse and dynamic region of over 187,000 people, Nashua is endowed with urban amenities as well as retaining the charm of the traditional New England landscape. Nashua’s population has nearly doubled since 1960. The combination of an excellent quality of life and proximity to Boston, the seacoast and the White Mountains makes Nashua an attractive growth center for New England.&#xD;The construction boom of the mid 80’s with it attendant escalation of real estate costs, has reversed. More than any other community in the region, Nashua offers diversity of housing choices for rental or purchase, ranging from historic properties to new condominiums and subdivisions.&#xD;Housing is largely comprised of three bedroom, multi-family developments with pools, tennis courts and playgrounds. Prices range from below $250,000 to $400,000. The average three bedroom home costs $250,000. The areas are exquisitely planned, providing beautiful, spacious neighborhoods with excellent views.&#xD;Nashua’s North End, including the Nashville Historic District, has been the City’s most affluent residential neighborhood for more than a century. The handsome homes in this area line the edge of Concord Street near Greeley park. They range from the early 19th to the early 20th Century, with a particular emphasis on Victorian architecture.&#xD;The older textile mills lining the Nashua River have been renovated into condominiums, popular for their proximity to downtown’s Main Street. Spit Brook Road in south Nashua is home to many condominium developments with pools, tennis courts and playgrounds which are conveniently located close to Route 3.&#xD;Nashua is in the midst of a five-year revitalization plan focused on improving its already outstanding educational system. The district consists of twelve elementary schools (K-5)three middle schools (6-8) one alternative school (6-10) and two comprehensive senior high schools (9-12).&#xD;Approximately 13,225 students attend. Parental involvement is important to the schools, as is community and business involvement. State-of-the-art computer systems are in place in the schools with their own web sites.&#xD;There are also many options for private school education. There are eight private and parochial schools in the city of Nashua, and another 93 within thirty miles. These institutions offer smaller class sizes and specialized curricula.&#xD;Higher education opportunities also abound in Nashua. Students can pursue a degree in aviation, engineering or computer technology, or study a health-care profession.&#xD;Residents in Nashua have access to the best health care providers in the area.&#xD;St. Joseph Healthcare includes a 208-bed acute care emergency and Level 2 Trauma Center.

      <description>Bedford is one of New Hampshire's most desirable towns.&lt;br/&gt;The town's Village Center is uncommonly pretty, blending antique colonial structures and beautiful new homes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formerly farmland has evolved into graceful homesteads for those commuting to nearby Manchester and other cities; notably, Nashua, Boston and even Concord. With an 80/20 residential-to-business ratio, Bedford's real estate profile doesn't automatically evoke a booming business town. However, commerce in Bedford is growing featuring the Bedford Village Inn and Restaurant, one of the top Bed and Breakfasts in New Hampshire as well as one of the finest restaurants, C.R. Sparks. Business activity in Bedford is focused along Route 3, otherwise known as "the performance zone." Premium office parks and shopping centers such as the Bedford Mall along with Macy's department store, the Wayfarer Inn and the Country Club line this road, which runs south from Manchester into Merrimack and Nashua. Bedford's other commercial clusters are along Route 101, which extends westward. With a reputation for a first-rate school system, Bedford has turned its focus toward town recreational facilities featuring a 70-acre park with several ballfields, ski trails, fishing and ice skating.</description>

      <description>Located in south central New Hampshire along the Merrimack River, Manchester NH is the largest city in northern New England. Manchester and the surrounding communities (including Auburn, Bedford, Candia, Derry, Goffstown, Hooksett, Litchfield, Londonderry and Merrimack) contain a rich and diverse history that can still be seen today in the unique architecture, museums, culture, and demographics of the region. Manchester is&lt;br/&gt;  • twenty miles from the Massachusetts border,  • fifty-eight miles from Boston and  • an hours drive of destinations such as the seacoast and the lakes region.&lt;br/&gt; Manchester residents point with pride to the fact that the area is “close to everything”, yet many people find they never have to leave home to pursue their favorite activities. In fact Manchester has recently been ranked among the top cities by a number of different Magazines. The Manchester metro area was selected as one of America’s “Best Places to Live and Work” and rated as a “Four-Star Community” by Expansion Management in May of 2003. But this is nothing new to the residents of Manchester. They know that Manchester has seen a renaissance of restoration, renovation, and rebirth, and is positioned well for continued growth and prosperity.</description>

      <description>With a landscape of rolling fields, apple orchards and stately colonial homes, Hollis is a picture perfect example of the New England small town. Hollis lies to the immediate west of Nashua (10 miles) along the Massachusetts border. With a population of 7,489 the town is largely an agricultural community known for its apples, strawberries and corn. Silver Lake State Park on Route 122 offers a beach and swimming lessons during the summer months and town lands provide trails for hiking, cross-country skiing and horse riding. With education being a high priority for residents the town has realigned its elementary schools for grades K-6.&lt;br/&gt;Secondary facilities, which are shared with neighboring Brookline, include a new high school building which opened in 1996 and a renovated junior high school. Home prices reflect some of the highest in the region, $375,000 average costs, but the town has been able to control growth and development without sacrificing the scenic roads, rural neighborhoods and colonial charm for which it has always been famous.</description>

With education being a high priority for residents the town has realigned its elementary schools for grades K-6.&#xD;Secondary facilities, which are shared with neighboring Brookline, include a new high school building which opened in 1996 and a renovated junior high school. Home prices reflect some of the highest in the region, $375,000 average costs, but the town has been able to control growth and development without sacrificing the scenic roads, rural neighborhoods and colonial charm for which it has always been famous.</itunes:summary>

      <description>Amherst has one of the most popular town centers in all of New Hampshire. A stroll through the center is not only a stroll past beautiful colonial-era homes and a magnificent village green, but it is a stroll through history as well. One of two towns in the country listed in its entirety as an Historic District, Amherst is steeped in late 18th and early 19th century architecture and charm. The town supports an excellent educational system which includes the award winning Souhegan High School. In addition, the larger housing lots and the colonial architecture perpetuated throughout the town combine to make Amherst an elegant, yet comfortable, place to call home. Residents are only 14 miles from Nashua and have easy access to a variety of excellent hospitals and colleges.</description>
