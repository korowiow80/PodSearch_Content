<p>&#8230;in the whole wide universe. July is ice cream month, so when I&#8217;m feeling overheated and need a little something, I break out my ice cream maker.</p>
<p>This recipe was created during our first year of The Gilded Fork, crafted by Donna Marie Desfor. The basil and orange combination is like sunshine screaming in your mouth, so it&#8217;s the perfect taste of summer.</p>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: If you are gluten-free, skip the cinnamon tuiles. If you are lactose intolerant or dairy-free, you can substitute the cream with 3 cups of full-fat coconut milk (canned).</strong></em></p>
<h2>recipe: basil &amp; orange ice cream with cinnamon tuiles</h2>
<p><span id="more-2050"></span><br />
<em>Serves 8</em></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>3 cups heavy cream<br />
1 vanilla bean pod, split<br />
6 fresh large basil leaves, coarsely torn or chopped<br />
Zest of ½ orange<br />
2/3 cup sugar</p>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Place a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Combine the cream, vanilla, and basil to the pot. Gently warm the cream over the heat, but do not let it come to a boil. Remove the saucepan from the heat when the mixture is just coming to a simmer: you should see steam rising from the surface and small bubbles forming along the edges. Add the sugar and the orange zest, and stir until combined. Remove from the heat, set aside and allow the mixture to infuse while cooling to room temperature.</p>
<p><em>Optional: </em>Strain into a clean container. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours until cold, or overnight.</p>
<p>Stir the chilled mixture and then freeze in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer’s directions. Transfer ice cream to a container and freeze until solid, about 2 hours. Remove to the refrigerator to “cure” about 20 minutes before serving.</p>
<p><strong>Cinnamon Tuiles</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Tuiles are thin, crisp cookies that are meant to imitate the shape of a French roof tile. While the “classic” preparation is to drape the hot tuiles over a rolling pin to shape them, you can get adventurous and use underside of a muffin tin to form a cup.</em></p>
<p><em></em><em>Makes approx. 2 dozen (24) tuiles</em></p>
<p><em></em><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>4 tablespoons butter at room temperature<br />
2 egg whites<br />
½ cup flour<br />
2/3 cup confectioners’ sugar<br />
Scant 1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla</p>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Preheat the oven to 350˚ F. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper.</p>
<p>In a medium bowl, combine the butter and egg whites with a whisk. Whisk until smooth. In a larger bowl, combine the flour, confectioners’ sugar, and cinnamon. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and whisk until smooth. Add the vanilla and whisk until well combined.</p>
<p>Using an offset spatula, drop one tablespoon of the batter onto the prepared cookie sheet and spread very thin to form about a 6” diameter circle. The batter will look translucent in some spots. Repeat spacing each tuile about 3” apart.</p>
<p>Bake each cookie sheet separately for about 6 to 8 minutes, until the edges are just beginning to brown. Remove the cookies from the oven. Working quickly, drape the hot cookies over a rolling pin or the side of an empty wine bottle, making sure they do not touch. Once the cookies are firm, transfer to a wire cooling rack and cool completely.</p>
<p>Prepare the other cookie sheet for baking while the first is in the oven. Repeat. Make sure the cookie sheet is cool before spreading the next round of batter on it.</p>

<p><strong></strong>Interestingly enough, celiac, fibromyalgia and food allergy awareness all happen in May, so I could technically do a trifecta post and cover all bases. However, as one of the bloggers contributing to <a href="http://celiaccentral.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">A Blogger A Day, the Gluten-Free Way</a> for the <em>National Foundation for Celiac Awareness</em>, I&#8217;ll stick with the gluten today. I know. Pun.</p>
<p>One year ago I went gluten-free in an effort to get my fibromyalgia symptoms under a semblance of control. After asking my online community for holistic approaches, I&#8217;ve received tremendous support from NFCA and the gluten-free community at large. What a wonderful, loving group of people you all are. I&#8217;ve learned oodles about reading labels and educating others, and get so much out of encouraging people with aches and pains to give it a try for themselves. My brother has recovered by leaps and bounds from his various conditions, and the catalyst was seeing my results, so all of your efforts have had a multiplier effect, not the least of which is my new project, <a href="http://zenfullydelicious.com" target="_blank">Zenfully Delicious</a>. I love when that happens.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.celiaccentral.org/awarenessmonth/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2000" title="CeliacCentral" src="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/CeliacCentral.gif" alt="" width="125" height="125" /></a>I wish I could say that making one change in my diet resulted in a complete turnaround of my health, but alas, there are yet miles to go. Immediately after eliminating the gluten, I was soaring. My body felt great, my skin was lovely, and the pounds were melting off. However, I always let the stress get the best of me, and sometimes the road feels endless.  I&#8217;ll save that for the fibromyalgia post.</p>
<p>Avoiding gluten has definitely improved things, however. I&#8217;ve learned that it has a significant effect on my body, from swelling (think Violet Beauregard) to mood swings and skin reactions. To better understand this, and to be of any help to you, I&#8217;ve used myself as a guinea pig over the past 12 months, because after finding myself terrified to dine anywhere but home, I realized the gluten fear was starting to rule my life, and that just would not do. So I experimented with low levels to see how much my body could tolerate before <em>bad things</em> happened, and discovered that a small dose is manageable. This alleviates the panic of discovering that I&#8217;ve taken a few bites of something dredged in flour, or the fear of ordering something that may have been fried in the same oil as breaded food. I experience some swelling, but the reaction doesn&#8217;t take me out.</p>
<p>Of course, as I am wont to do, I took experimentation to the extreme over the Christmas holidays, from pasta to cookies and bread, and that was not a good idea. I was in bed for a few days reminding myself <em>not to do that any more</em>. Ever. But because humans can be dumb animals, I also indulged while I was in Vienna earlier this year. At a 5-star Relais Gourmand restaurant, they rolled out a <em>bread cart. </em>I mean, come on! It had at least 20 kinds of bread, beckoning to me like sirens from a world of crusty fantasy and crumb-coated dreams. Olive bread, lavender and honey bread, pretzel bread&#8230;lust.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was already in the midst of heavy stress, so the past few months have been something from my nightmares (hence my lack of posts). I&#8217;ve learned that if I&#8217;m not in optimal shape in other areas &#8212; calm, implementing regular fitness, sleeping well &#8212; the gluten serves as a kind of systemic atom bomb. I&#8217;m chalking this up as tuition, and setting up systems to pull all of the other areas of my life into alignment.</p>
<p>Now, mileage varies with gluten intolerance, so if you are new to this, or unsure, don&#8217;t take my word for it. For some, even one bite causes migraines, hives, or an extreme reaction requiring an Epi pen. This is where the <a href="http://www.celiaccentral.org/why-donate/" target="_blank">National Foundation for Celiac Awareness</a> comes in. They are doing a magnificent job whether you are a gluten-free veteran, someone in the inquiry, or a restaurant owner looking to train your staff. Here&#8217;s a great look at <a href="http://www.celiaccentral.org/Get-Involved/Donate/Where-We-re-Headed/504/" target="_blank">where they&#8217;re headed</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve committed myself to posting again on a regular basis, no matter what I&#8217;m feeling like, because I realize that my silence isn&#8217;t helping anyone &#8212; least of all myself. Last time I broke the silence it led to huge breakthroughs in my health, so I&#8217;m climbing back on that train, because I like where it was headed.</p>
<p><strong>Now my question to you: Have you gone gluten-free? If so, why, and what has been your experience? What are you struggling with, or what sense of freedom have you found? </strong></p>

<p>At 12:01 AM on January 1, 2010, I had no idea what was in store for the coming year. I chose to be open to whatever, and hoped things would largely work out for the better, but felt like I essentially knew where I was headed.</p>
<p>12 months later, I sit here with an entirely different existence than what I had envisioned. And for that, I&#8217;m grateful. This has been the most extraordinary, challenging, adventurous, soul-enriching year of my life to date, and with that has come catharsis. Since lots of people post their lists of things at the end of the year, this time I&#8217;ll play. Here are the 5 major things I learned in 2010:</p>
<p><strong>1. It doesn&#8217;t have to look a certain way.</strong><br />
I was always a planner. A perfectionist. An unrelenting taskmaster, mostly toward myself, in creating what I thought was the life that would make me happy. It had to look a certain way, with particular parameters, and anything less was complete and utter failure. There was no room for me the person &#8212; just for the tasks that kept me running on the hamster wheel. And that is what led me, in part, to a chronic illness (see #4). Now I&#8217;m learning to simply be, and use the planning as a guideline with room for adjustments along the way. There is much more freedom, creativity and well-being in that.</p>
<p><strong>2. People are inherently good.</strong><br />
When my apartment was robbed back in April, I thought the very worst of humanity. In the midst of my devastation, and in fact on the <em>same day</em>, humanity &#8212; you &#8212; showed up to prove otherwise. I am still blown away by the fact that YOU replaced my stolen laptop, which to this day moves me to the point of tears. I&#8217;ve spent the rest of the year crafting new projects that will help others with the challenges they face, and created <a href="http://zenfullydelicious.com" target="_blank"><strong>Zenfully Delicious</strong></a> to put that in motion.</p>
<p><strong>3. Manage the process, not the person, and get out of the way.</strong><br />
Up until August or so, I was still trying to do it all by myself. The Lone Ranger was exhausted, wondering why nothing was moving forward. Turns out it was because said Ranger (me) was standing in the way. Then I began the Team Management &amp; Leadership Program offered by <a href="http://www.landmarkeducation.com" target="_blank"><strong>Landmark Education</strong></a> &#8212; it&#8217;s essentially entrepreneurial boot camp &#8212; and saw that every management &#8220;skill&#8221; I was <em>trying</em> to use was only causing me to spin in circles. Now I am stretching myself to my entrepreneurial limits, learning things that business schools never even touch upon, and hey, things are moving forward in grander ways than I ever imagined. Where I was once overwhelmed by 1 company and side work in web design, I now have 3 companies with teams of people to make them run efficiently. I got out of the way, and am mastering the skills to make myself the most effective leader possible. I am diving into the uncomfortable, and the ride is never dull! But being willing to dive into the uncomfortable has opened doors to things like being asked to keynote my first conference next year. In Vienna.</p>
<p><strong>4. Don&#8217;t sweat the small stuff. No, really.</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve been doing a little research, and it has become ridiculously apparent to me that stress is the leading factor for our nation&#8217;s health problems. I am a living case study in the subject. Since discovering I needed to go gluten-free to get my fibromyalgia under control, I&#8217;ve looked at all areas of my life where stress plays a role. It should win an Oscar. My new outlook, and I&#8217;m getting better at it every day, involves taking on a sense of peacefulness and well-being every single day. I&#8217;ve managed to keep that state of being intact even after getting &#8220;glutened&#8221; in a restaurant, and had nary a symptom. I&#8217;m learning just how much the mind affects the body, and just how much say I have in that.</p>
<p><strong>5. You can have everything you want.</strong><br />
The real question is, who are you willing to be to have it? Note I did not say &#8220;What are you willing to do?&#8221; The doing is just the busy work; it&#8217;s who we <em>are </em>that inspires (or repels) people to play with us and help bring our vision to life. This week I was able to check off a bucket list item, as I got a last-second invitation to the Prince concert at Madison Square Garden. Everywhere I turn, great things are coming into my life, because I invite people to play in my world with me. My commitment to those willing to play is that they get even more out of that than I do. And I get a lot.</p>
<p>So those are the broad strokes for this year. I&#8217;ve already got things rolling for 2011, with the biggest project I have ever undertaken, and I am chomping at the bit to get it in motion. So 2010 &#8212; and the years going forward &#8212; will best be summed up, when I am old and reflecting upon them, by the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body—but rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming, ‘Wow, what a ride!’<br />
- Anonymous</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Oh my, yes. I wish you the very best in 2011, and cannot wait to see where the road takes us. Thank you for being a fellow traveler!</p>
<p>Love,<br />
Jennifer</p>

<p>Yes, darlings, at long last, <a href="http://zenfullydelicious.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Zenfully Delicious</strong></span></a> is up and running! I&#8217;m so excited about this project, and extremely encouraged by the response we&#8217;ve gotten since our soft launch on Sunday during the Appetite for Awareness event presented by the <a href="http://celiaccentral.org" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">National Foundation for Celiac Awareness</span></a> in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>It has really struck me how many people there are in search of answers and relief, and I&#8217;ve pulled together a fantastic team to take on that mission. We are addressing a range of chronic illnesses, from Fibromyalgia and Celiac to Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Diabetes and all of their siblings. We love that a holistic approach is possible for all of them, and offers an alternative to medications that can sometimes do more harm than good (I am a living case study for that). The site is free for right now, but we will unveil a membership program in the coming months comprising menu planning, health &amp; lifestyle coaching and great content from our contributors.</p>
<p>This is a very exciting time, and I really hope we can help to make a difference. It makes my soul smile to know that it&#8217;s possible thanks to technology and the spirit of the team with which I&#8217;ve surrounded myself. I hope you will join us on a journey to wellness.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t at work that day. I had a doctor&#8217;s appointment. When I first heard the news I made a joke, saying &#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing I didn&#8217;t commute in.&#8221; My office was in midtown, but I knew the train schedules would be a mess. It wasn&#8217;t until I turned on my car radio that the gravity of the situation hit me. People were jumping from the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>I backed out of my parking spot so fast I almost hit an oncoming car, and drove home with the pedal floored to see what in hell was happening. The rest played out before my eyes. The phone began to ring off the hook as relatives called from Australia and Scotland. Every time I answered the phone, my friends and family members burst into tears. They didn&#8217;t know I was home.</p>
<p>My first reaction was to try and find a way to get into the city. My beloved city. But I couldn&#8217;t get in, and I couldn&#8217;t phone in. So I sat like everyone else and watched the news until I was delirious with fatigue.</p>
<p>Wednesday night I saw a segment on the news &#8212; the James Beard House kitchen was up and running. I left a message for my friend Shelley Menaged, who organizes the kitchen volunteers for visiting chefs. I offered to do absolutely anything they needed help with, and packed my kitchen gear to take to work on Thursday.</p>
<p>When she called me back, she had just heard about the staff of Windows on the World, and had been without sleep for thirty-six hours. &#8220;I&#8217;m at my breaking point,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Can you come down tomorrow and keep me company?&#8221; At last, I could do <em>something</em>.</p>
<p>I was in no way prepared for what I would see. Watching it on television was slightly more bearable, but to see the streets of Manhattan empty &#8212; to cross Madison Avenue freely because there was no traffic to be seen &#8212; was the most eerie experience I have ever known. The silence was deafening.</p>
<p>It was worse downtown. When I got to the Beard House I was choking on the acrid smoke, and stood in shock as a convoy of Hummers came racing down 12th street. This was like a bad movie. Even so, it had less of an emotional impact than what I would see in the hours to come.</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0pt none;" src="http://www.theatlasphere.com/images/line-break-diamonds.gif" alt="" width="48" height="15" /></div>
<p>The Beard House&#8217;s main focus through those few days was to provide meals for the doctors at St. Vincent&#8217;s Hospital (located across the street) and the policemen who were stationed nearby. Food was donated from practically every restaurant in town, and we were tripping over the supply of goods.</p>
<p>Every few hours someone would show up at the door with donations in hand; sometimes it was a shopping cart full of food, other times boxes of toothpaste and toothbrushes. We threw ourselves into the task of organizing everything that came in, restocking the buffet to ensure the food was always hot, and keeping a general sense of calm and quiet about the place.</p>
<p>Since there were so many volunteers in the kitchen, I decided to head to the dining room. There I discovered what my role would be for the next eighteen hours: I would provide comfort, a friendly face, and a warm plate of food for those who came to eat and rest. For a distraction I would give them a brief tour, showing them Beard&#8217;s mirrored bedroom and his open shower, with a glass wall as its only shelter from the outdoors. They got a kick out of that.</p>
<p>I fondly remember Vic, a young doctor who felt guilty that he was eating a decadent meal as he waited for patients who would never come. He loved to cook, and was thinking about changing careers. I wonder if he ever did.</p>
<p>I shared food stories with two detectives who would be guarding the President of the United States at sunup. The weather was horrible, and they were embarrassed that their suits would be wrinkled. They took great pride in their work, and wanted to be at their best when protecting the man in charge of this crisis.</p>
<p>But the policemen broke my heart. Like handsome characters from Central Casting they paraded into the dining room, with uniforms soaked but faces warm and friendly. The television was on, and as they sat down to eat, Howard Lutnick&#8217;s heart-wrenching interview came on. The officers visibly blanched as they listened to his story, and I realized in watching their faces that they were hearing it for the first time. We were seeing all of this unfold on television, but they were out there in the pouring rain, living it. In a way, it protected them from hearing stories like this. They had enough to contend with.</p>
<p>What affected me more than anything else, though, was the attitude of every person who walked through that front door to eat a hot meal. They were so grateful that people were kind enough to take care of them. They couldn&#8217;t believe they were eating soup from Le Cirque and sandwiches from Daniel, and thanked us profusely for what we were doing. I was speechless. I wanted to throw myself at their feet for what <em>they</em> were doing, and they were thanking <em>us</em>.</p>
<p>It then hit me that food is, in fact, life&#8217;s true comfort. A hot meal can lend solace when we truly need it, and providing such a meal can be the most effective way to show one&#8217;s caring for another human being. I feel fortunate that I was able to serve those men and women I will never see again, but with whom I feel eternally bonded.</p>
<p>I have never visited Ground Zero; I&#8217;m not sure I ever will. The faces I saw over the course of those eighteen hours told me all I needed to know.</p>

Everyone thought fat was the culprit adding unwanted pounds to our tummies and thighs &#8212; until everyone realized that those products screaming &#8220;LOW-FAT&#8221; were filled with extra sugars, unhealthy carbs and glue-like substances to make up for the missing texture. Guess what&#8217;s going to happen to gluten-free when Big Food gets its hands on the genre? I&#8217;ve already passed over the &#8220;Wonder Breads&#8221; of gluten-free, which are sickly sweet and have a grotesque, soft-sticky texture.</p>
<p>For those of us who must eat this way by necessity, or will soon need to, this muddies the waters terribly, and people suddenly faced with a life-changing health decision may find themselves in over their heads. When I&#8217;m looking for a gluten- or dairy-free product, I look first to manufacturers who have a reason for being so &#8212; typically it&#8217;s because someone in their family, or they themselves, have become ill. Same goes for restaurants. There is a vested interest in creating a product or dish that not only tastes good, but is also resplendent with health benefits.</p>
<p>Big Food just wants your dollars. All 4 billion of them.</p>
<p>Having said all of that, I firmly believe in <em>caveat emptor</em> &#8212; but I also feel compelled to help consumers make that decision based on solid, unbiased information with the goal of health. And as someone who has stood, overwhelmed, in the grocery aisle, I know that this is one big honking task to take on. That&#8217;s what Zenfully Delicious is for, but holy hell is there a lot of work ahead. The <a href="http://www.celiaccentral.org" target="_blank"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">National Foundation for Celiac Awareness</span></strong></a> is already doing a great job, so I&#8217;ll stick to the bigger issues.</p>
<p>So until the new site launches, I encourage you to <em>read your supermarket labels</em>. Know what all the gooey and unhealthy additives are, and be on the lookout for them. We&#8217;ll be doing product reviews to help you with the process, but for now, keep it natural!</p>

<p><a href="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/daisy.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1913" title="daisy" src="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/daisy.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>Four months ago I was in misery. My fibromyalgia pain had reached epic proportions, I couldn&#8217;t think straight, and I was attempting to put on a brave face so the rest of the world would not know there was something &#8220;broken&#8221; within me. After all, I was an entrepreneur and world traveler &#8212; a connoisseur of life&#8217;s decadent pleasures. But that facade was crumbling before me, and I knew I could not accept another invitation to travel until I got this situation under control, because my body simply could not handle it.</p>
<p>So I outed myself. It was the best thing, bar none, I have ever done. If I had kept quiet and suffered in silence, I would not be sitting here four months later with glowing skin, almost no pain, an effervescent spirit, and a desire to change the world. In sharing my experience with you, you shared with me, and helped me out of a very dark pit of anger, physical pain and hopelessness. You have no idea just how big my gratitude is for that, but suffice it to say that it served as the seed idea for another company, because now it&#8217;s my turn to help you, and contribute to <em>your</em> quality of life.</p>
<p>As a bonus, since I cut out most dairy and sugar in June, 15 lbs have melted off with no effort whatsoever. If I could take a snapshot of this moment and go back in time to my April self, I would let her know that it was going to be ok, that it <em>would </em>get better. That is what I will now share with the world at large, and people who need to hear it.</p>
<p>I will get into more detail about the exact hows and whys when <a href="http://zenfullydelicious.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Zenfully Delicious</strong></span></a> launches next month, and I&#8217;ve never been so excited about a project in my life. It seems that everywhere I turn now, people are developing problems with food, allergens &#8212; and don&#8217;t even get me started on the stress. But I have discovered in 4 short months that holistic methods are the way to manage these problems best, because rather than focusing on a specific symptom or problem, I am healing my system at large. And guess what? Anyone can do this.</p>
<p>What magnificent freedom I have found thanks to <a href="http://coactivehealth.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dr. Alex Rinehart</strong></span></a>, who has been my teammate all the way. You&#8217;ll be hearing a lot more about him, and we&#8217;re developing webinars to help you transform yourself to wellness, so sit tight a little longer as we get this show on the road. I also have one more big hurdle to go, which I&#8217;m taking on this week, but you&#8217;ll have to wait a few days for that post. First I want to relish that challenge for myself a little bit.</p>
<p>Be well this weekend &#8212; and go play with your food!</p>

Every culture seems to have a fried dough, and that&#8217;s as good as street food gets. I thought from Maricel&#8217;s description that these were gluten-free, but alas, they do have flour. This presents a fabulous challenge for me to come up with a substitute &#8212; I bet tapioca flour would be ideal. Light and fluffy, and slathered with sugary syrup, picarones are made from sweet potato or squash. You can see a sample recipe <a href="http://southamericanfood.about.com/od/snacksstreetfood/r/picarones.htm" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>here</strong></span></a>.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/cucumber-girl.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1875" title="cucumber-girl" src="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/cucumber-girl.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="337" /></a>Oh, crunchy cucumber, how I love thee. And I love thee naked, pickled, puréed, sliced or diced. You give me reprieve from the disgusting heat of summer, and sometimes you just offer a little pick-me-up. That is why, when feasting on your natural beauty, with just a hint of sea salt, my 6-year-old niece approached, and I offered her a pony to go away. I needed you all to myself.</em></p>
<p>***<br />
Yes, I dig the cucumber. I admit it shamelessly and with reckless abandon. In recent years, given how sensitive my palate has become, I&#8217;ve found it impossible to eat anything but organic cucumbers &#8212; otherwise I can taste the chemicals. This is not only good news for my body, but also for my eyes, because cukes are more than just a beauty treatment cliché. Rich with liquid, they offer soothing hydration to tired eyes (particularly the skin underneath). So the next time you need a little pick-me-up, have a seat, pour a cocktail, lean back and put a couple of cuke slices on your eyes. Please close them first. And bring a straw for the cocktail.</p>
<p>There are some other natural beauty treatments that can be crafted with cukes as well (including a cucumber body pizza for sunburned or itchy skin), which I stumbled upon at <a href="http://www.care2.com/greenliving/cucumber-kitchen-cupboard-beauty.html" target="_blank"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vegetable Drawer Beauty</span></strong></a>. Here is my favorite:</p>
<p><strong>Radiant Facial Treatment</strong><br />
If your complexion is dull and oily, this easy formula will help you look glowing and radiant.</p>
<p>1 teaspoon grated cucumber<br />
splash of rosewater</p>
<p>Apply to face and allow to stay for 15 minutes, then rinse with warm water.</p>

<strong><a href="../wp-content/uploads/summerfest.jpg"><img class="alignright" title="summerfest" src="../wp-content/uploads/summerfest.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="222" /></a></strong>Now, if you are more interested in <em>eating </em>the actual cucumbers, my cohorts at Summer Fest 2010 have plenty of options for you, including what we&#8217;ve rustled up on The Gilded Fork | Culinary Media Network. I&#8217;m off to sit by the pool with my slices, but do feel free to bring me a dish of something tasty. Here&#8217;s what they have to offer:</p>

<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN JOIN IN SUMMER FEST:<br />
</strong>Each Wednesday for the rest of the summer (and probably longer), a group of blogging friends including those above will swap our recipes and tips about the following harvest-fresh ingredients. Here&#8217;s the schedule:</p>
<p>7/28: Cukes &#8216;n Zukes<br />
8/4: Corn<br />
8/11: Herbs, Greens and Beans<br />
8/18: Stone Fruit<br />
8/25 Tomatoes</p>
<p>We each post something and then link to one another, so that you can travel around the combined effort, gathering the goodies. Sharing makes the experience even better, so if you have a recipe or tip that fits any of our weekly themes, you can do either of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave a comment on participating blogs with a link to your recipe/tip</li>
<li>Publish a post of your own, and grab the juicy Summer Fest 2010 tomato badge (illustrated by Matt Armendariz of <a href="http://mattbites.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mattbites</strong></span></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to see you in the kitchen!</p>

I was wrestling with it, hoping things would change&#8230;soon.</p>
<p>Little did I know that just one day later, the clouds would break.</p>
<p>Now I feel fantastic. I&#8217;m thinking clearly. My body is no longer creaking and aching with every movement. Given how good I feel, no piece of bread or glass of wine seems important enough to worry about.</p>
<p>So now I can focus on the next part of my mission to help those with chronic illness live a delicious life. And let&#8217;s not forget those who are stressed out, because let&#8217;s face it: <em>Stress is a major contributor to chronic illness</em>. It&#8217;s time we all took a great big deep breath. Together.</p>
<p>It is with so much excitement and pride that I offer you a sneak preview of my new baby, <a href="http://zenfullydelicious.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Zenfully Delicious</strong></span></a>. I am creating a home online for us all to take that breath, and rediscover how delicious life can be no matter what our challenges. Yes, there will be food. But there will be so much more. Excited? Me too.</p>
<p>Right now you can get a little taste and sign up for updates as we get closer to launching the site. I have a magnificent team of people helping me, and we&#8217;d love for you to join us if you want to take part. If so, please don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out to me here or at <em>foodphilosophy [at] gmail [dot] com</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/toast.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1850" title="toast" src="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/toast.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="282" /></a>Today started off as one of those days. I got into a flow working on my new site last night, and before I knew it the sun was up. Designing all night can leave a person feeling&#8230;vulnerable&#8230;so when it was time for breakfast, I was hit with a sledgehammer-level craving for coffee with half &#8216;n half, and a nice plate of toast with unsalted butter.</p>
<p>Then I burst into tears. The Italian kind.</p>
<p>Though each day seems to get a bit easier, there are times when my new lifestyle catches me off guard, and if I&#8217;m not 100% on my game, a wave of misery can knock me right on my ass.  So I must channel Mad-Eye Moody and have CONSTANT VIGILANCE! I realize to some people this might seem ridiculous, but when your life has revolved around food for this long, hey, it&#8217;s tough. This would be hard for anyone, never mind an <em>intensely</em> intense food person.</p>
<p>At least my doctor and I seem to be on the right track. I&#8217;ll tell you more about him tomorrow. In the interim, in the words of my favorite Spanish philosopher Inigo Montoya, lemme &#8216;splain:</p>
<p>My blood tests came back last week, and everything looked great except for one big thing, as we expected: My adrenal system is exhausted, and has gone on strike. Given that I&#8217;ve been perpetually stressed out from about the age of 5, my body has come to consider it quite normal to be fighting a saber-toothed tiger &#8212; even if the translation is &#8220;Jennifer is reading a book.&#8221; Unfortunately, the body can only hold that kind of baseline for so long, and frankly I&#8217;m surprised my system lasted <em>this</em> long under such conditions.</p>
<p>Since going gluten-free, and beginning the healing process, a few interesting things have happened. The good news is that I&#8217;ve lost about 10 lbs this month, and now only look like a puffer fish occasionally. The not-so-good news is that while my stomach is healing from the gluten fiesta, it is hypersensitive, so to avoid excruciating fibromyalgia pain of all sorts, I&#8217;ve also needed to eliminate caffeine, dairy, eggs and peanuts. Wine is also a definite no, discovered via a moment of rebellion earlier this week. So we&#8217;re hoping that after a solid 6 months of detox, my body can heal to the point where I can introduce some of those things back into my life.</p>
<p>C&#8217;mon, Christmas!</p>
<p>As my body repairs itself, there are physical ups and downs, some quite painful, but thankfully those moments seem to be short-lived. The other day I worked from my bed, as the humidity in NYC this week was epic, and that makes my body very unhappy. I&#8217;m now looking at what else I might need to do in order to live at my fullest, whether that means moving to a drier, cooler climate or at least spending summers in a more friendly one. (Anybody want to trade an NYC apartment for July &amp; August?)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also hard at work pulling together the pieces for my new site, and I can&#8217;t wait to tell you about it! I hope that a year from now I&#8217;ll be well on my way to making chronic illness a well-behaved, leashed bitch. And not just my illness, but the ones <em>out there</em>. Like maybe yours.</p>
<p>Once I&#8217;m feeling a bit more spry I will get back to the food itself. I&#8217;ve been subsisting on whatever I can figure out, and haven&#8217;t felt like cooking much, so there haven&#8217;t been too many fun discoveries yet. But they will come. Oh yes, they will come.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div class="tweetmeme_button" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
			<a href="http://api.tweetmeme.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoodphilosophy.com%2Ffancy-food-show-recap-allergy-gluten-free-goodies%2F"><br />
				<img src="http://api.tweetmeme.com/imagebutton.gif?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoodphilosophy.com%2Ffancy-food-show-recap-allergy-gluten-free-goodies%2F&amp;source=foodphilosophy&amp;style=normal&amp;service=bit.ly&amp;b=2" height="61" width="50" /><br />

<p>I walked into this year&#8217;s Fancy Food Show with trepidation. I made sure I had a good breakfast, because I expected there would not be much to sample on the show floor that would fit within my current parameters of gluten- and dairy-free (among other things). Color me happy, because everywhere I looked, there were great big, blue signs saying &#8220;Certified Gluten-Free.&#8221; It seemed that every row had one, and some were completely allergen-free. I felt like a kid at Christmas.</p>
<p>I tasted a lot, and made Madeline taste what I could not, and though as usual there was a lot of mediocre, there were some serious standouts. All of their sites have store locators, so please indulge yourself in textures and tastes that will absolutely delight you. I promise.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/divvies.png"><img title="divvies" src="../wp-content/uploads/divvies-300x216.png" alt="" width="300" height="216" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Divvies</strong>: <a href="http://www.divvies.com" target="_blank"><strong>www.divvies.com</strong></a></p>
<p>Oh, chocolate. Even though I&#8217;m not a huge chocolate eater, sometimes I just want a little something sweet (I&#8217;m looking at you, ladies). Lately, however, I&#8217;ve had to remove dairy from my diet in order to heal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also a sucker for beautiful packaging. So when I stumbled upon the Divvies booth, I was a little overexcited. As is typically the case with outstanding allergy-free products, there was a personally compelling story behind it all. Founder Robin Sandler&#8217;s son often spent birthdays and Easter celebrations without chocolate due to his extensive food allergies, and was unable to partake in the comfort of sharing food, as so many of us do. So she decided to do something about it, and created Divvies, a completely allergy-free bakery in South Salem, NY from which everything is designed to be shared. There are giant popcorn boxes with scoops and individual bags, trays of cupcakes, cookies and&#8230;wait for it&#8230;chocolate mint crunch bars.</p>
<p>Lori has just released her first cookbook, so look for more on her on an upcoming Food Philosophy podcast. There might just be a cookbook in it for you. You can order her products online via the web link above.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/gilberts-goodies.png"><img title="gilberts-goodies" src="../wp-content/uploads/gilberts-goodies-300x175.png" alt="" width="300" height="175" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Gilbert&#8217;s Gourmet Goodies: <a href="http://www.gilbertsgourmetgoodies.com" target="_blank">www.gilbertsgourmetgoodies.com</a></strong></p>
<p>It is often with hesitation that I bite into a gluten-free cookie. Usually they&#8217;re crumbly, taste like beans, or just aren&#8217;t worth the bother. Not these. Gilbert&#8217;s Goodies dairy-free chocolate chip, snickerdoodle and chocolate cookies are soft and luxurious like a normal, soft-baked cookie. I nearly lost my head for a minute.</p>
<p>Much like me, Liz Gilbert was an avid cook who developed food allergies later in life. And, like me, she found the offerings out there less than appealing, so she got to work in the kitchen. Her cookies have no wheat, gluten, peanuts, nuts, soy, milk, corn, corn syrup, transfats or  preservatives, and gawd are they good. I could kiss her for her efforts, because those bites of cookie made all the bad go away.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/aunt-gussies.png"><img title="aunt-gussies" src="../wp-content/uploads/aunt-gussies-300x196.png" alt="" width="300" height="196" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Aunt Gussie&#8217;s: <a href="http://www.auntgussies.com" target="_blank">www.auntgussies.com</a></strong></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had an English muffin in months. I&#8217;m a total hog for English muffins. And while I was an avid whole-grain bread eater before, I&#8217;ve found that much of the gluten-free breads out there are essentially Wonder Bread without the wheat. White, tasteless &#8212; blech. So I was delighted to meet David Caine of Aunt Gussie&#8217;s Cookes &amp; Crackers, because his whole grain rosemary focaccia bread and English muffins were gorgeous without anything else on them. Gorgeous.</p>
<p>The best part? His company didn&#8217;t start out making gluten-free products &#8212; his mother made him do it. I need to shake that woman&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p><a href="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/against-the-grain.png"><img title="against-the-grain" src="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/against-the-grain-300x212.png" alt="" width="300" height="212" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Against the Grain Gourmet: <a href="http://www.againstthegraingourmet.com/" target="_blank">www.againstthegraingourmet.com</a><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Pizza? Certo. Baguettes? Mais oui. Bagels? I was verklempt.</p>
<p>Though it contained dairy, I did have to sneak a few bites of dough from Against the Grain Gourmet, as the yellow color drew in my eye like a handsome cabana boy. The mozzarella added such flavor that I wanted to snarf the whole tray of samples. The texture was light, airy and a bit firmer than conventional baguettes, but the flavor made up for what I miss in a baguette.</p>
<p>I made Madeline try the pizza, as too much cheese would have sent my body to bad places, but given how she was raving about the pesto pizza (sans pine nuts) for the rest of the afternoon &#8212; and her unabashed love for cheese &#8212; I&#8217;m going to take her word for it.</p>

<p><a href="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/aromatherapy1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1811" title="Spa Mineral Salts" src="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/aromatherapy1.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="337" /></a>It&#8217;s taken me a while, but I have come to a place of peace with the idea that my life has been forever altered. There are still ups and downs as I work my way through eliminating the foods that presently cause my body pain (more on that in another post), but I accept the downs with the knowledge that my health and body will not always be in a state of breakdown, and that wellness is on the horizon. Sometimes a good cry is remarkably cathartic in those moments.</p>
<p>I entered into a food-restricted world kicking and screaming, but the way has become clearer. What I now see, instead of limitation, is the  opportunity that exists not only for me, but for any of you who live in the realm of chronic illness &#8212; whether it&#8217;s yours or someone else&#8217;s. And while there are some great resources presently available to manage it all, there is much work to be done in this area. It is with that premise in mind that I&#8217;d like to share my new mission with you:</p>
<p><strong>I am committed to helping every person who has a chronic illness live a delicious life.</strong></p>
<p>It is not enough to simply exist, to endure &#8212; to survive. Life at its fullest is about thriving, about getting out of bed each day ready to take on the world in the pursuit of one&#8217;s passion. It&#8217;s about celebrating the sensual pleasures that make life sweeter. After living for many months in a state of endurance, rather than one of passionate pursuit, I powerfully realize that it isn&#8217;t enough. I won&#8217;t live that way &#8212; and I don&#8217;t want others with chronic illness to, either.</p>
<p>There are many pieces of this new mission, but the easiest and  most obvious involves the food. In the immediate future, I will be  adding resources to this blog, as well as to our <a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com" target="_blank">Culinary  Media Network</a> site, and we will continue to add recipes, videos and  other media to our current content for those of us with dietary restrictions. I have a lot more than gluten-free going on right now, and you might, too.</p>
<p>There are other things in the works  that will roll out slowly, one of which includes an entirely new site  I&#8217;m creating. Look for an announcement on that very soon.</p>
<p>I am excited about this new phase, because a whole new universe of sensory discovery awaits. I&#8217;ve heard from enough of you publicly and privately to know that I am not alone in this need for something beyond survival. If you are struggling, know that I&#8217;ve heard you.</p>
<p>In fact, I&#8217;ve told Oprah about you.</p>
<p>Oprah is currently holding an open casting call for a new star on her OWN network, so I&#8217;ve uploaded an audition video to her site announcing my mission to create a show to help people with chronic illness live a delicious life &#8212; where the illness takes a back seat to LIVING.</p>
<p>Is it a long shot? Sure. But if I&#8217;m going to create a national platform, I needed to get the momentum started somewhere, so I&#8217;ve thrown my hat in the ring. If you support my mission (or hell, even if you just like my strawberry photo in the blog header), I ask that you please click and vote for me. No registration is required &#8212; just a click. You can vote multiple times. You can vote by clicking the link below, or the image in the top of my sidebar.</p>
<p><a href="http://myown.oprah.com/audition/index.html?request=video_details&amp;response_id=18505&amp;promo_id=1" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>VOTE for Jennifer&#8217;s Audition Video to be Oprah&#8217;s Next Star</strong></span></a></p>
<p>(Chef Mark is also auditioning with his new &#8220;Share Your Plate&#8221; concept, so you can <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://myown.oprah.com/audition/index.html?request=video_details&amp;response_id=18019&amp;promo_id=1" target="_blank"><strong>vote for him too</strong></a></span>.)</p>
<p>Thanks so much to every one of you who has left a comment, sent me a note or a word of encouragement. Your support means so much to me, and the knowledge that there are others out there who can benefit from my efforts to give chronic illness a loud, powerful voice gets me out of bed every day &#8212; even when I need to drag myself to my feet.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s do this.</p>

<p><a href="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/spoons.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1793" title="spoons" src="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/spoons.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>Dear Chef/Restaurant Owner:</p>
<p>We have had a long and loving relationship, you and I. For as long as I can remember, you have been an integral part of my passion for living. I have worked in your kitchen, eaten in your dining room &#8212; and championed your philosophy from different corners of the world. You have given me so much pleasure, and I hope I’ve been able to show that appreciation in some tangible way. Your passion has often been my reason for getting up in the morning, and for that I thank you.</p>
<p>Our relationship of late, however, has hit a road bump. You see, for medical reasons, I’ve recently needed to eliminate gluten from my diet. This is not a phase I’m going through, or a low-carb diet &#8212; it is a matter of living as a fully functional human being vs. being in excruciating physical pain. It&#8217;s been a difficult adjustment, but I&#8217;m getting better with it every day.</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle, however, is this: I’ve tried to dine in your restaurant lately, but I have often left your dining room in tears, because there isn’t much for me to eat. Some of your dishes send my mental mouth whirling, where I crave a taste of your yuzu sauce, or a bite of your scallops &#8212; but I cannot order them, because one of the ingredients in that dish will make the rest of the evening &#8212; and the next few days &#8212; a veritable hell for me.</p>
<p>At first, I didn’t want to pester you. I am the last person who wants to diminish your creativity and dedication to texture, to flavor&#8230;to an incredible experience for the palate. I did not want to be <em>that customer</em>. I’ve discovered something important, however, and I thought it was critical to tell you: There are many more of me in your dining public than I had ever imagined.</p>
<p>May I request that we work together?</p>
<p>If you could give me a dish that would satiate my palate, yet be totally safe for me, I would joyfully enter your dining room as often as possible. I would tell others like me that your restaurant is the place where we can enjoy a meal anxiety-free, where choosing from the menu is not an exercise in futility, and where the chef is not cursing at me for ruining his combination of ingredients. Where the kitchen staff understands that if bread has even touched what I’m eating, there could be trouble for me.</p>
<p>Where the servers do not see me as a difficulty to be dealt with &#8212; but as someone who supports and champions what you all do for a living.</p>
<p>I’m not asking for a whole menu of my own. I simply would love a couple of dishes that would leave my mouth giddy. Much of what you’re already cooking is 80% there, so I’m hoping this is not an unreasonable request. (I do, however, need to recognize <a href="http://tintorestaurant.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tinto</strong></span></a> in Philadelphia for a most unexpected treat: An entire menu of gluten-free tapas dishes. What an evening that was.)</p>
<p>And if you could please, please teach your servers that an errant chunk of cookie in my whipped cream is not just an “oops,” but a mistake that will leave me doubled over in pain on the subway ride home, I would be ever grateful.</p>
<p>Will you work with me?</p>
<p>And if you are already working with me, but I don’t know it, will you tell me so? I’d like to know &#8212; and share with these gluten-free brethren of mine &#8212; where you are, so that we might thank you with our patronage.</p>
<p>With love and respect,<br />
Jennifer</p>

<p><a href="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/cobbler-sm.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1781" title="Finished Cobbler" src="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/cobbler-sm.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>Yes, I&#8217;ve been pretty quiet. As my body has adjusted to the past few weeks of living gluten-free, my mind and emotions have been on a pretty steep, twisty roller coaster. I&#8217;ve also been in LA with consulting clients, which involves a lot of dining out, so by Day 2 of this trip the most familiar words out of my mouth were &#8220;I can&#8217;t have that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cue meltdown.</p>
<p>What do you do when your life revolves around food and drink, and said objects are suddenly the enemy? If you are like me, you go straight to DEFCON 1: <em>Life sucks, I will never experience pleasure again andIhateeveryone.</em> If you are fortunate like me, there are good friends standing by to talk you off the ledge, give you a hug and a pat on the butt. Then you breathe, regroup, and move along the path to wellness, even if one itty bitty little step at a time.</p>
<p>Though I was feeling great when I wrote my last post, that initial nirvana has subsided, and I now live in a cloud of uncertainty, never knowing what will happen with my body from one moment to the next. (This makes scheduling activities particularly interesting.) I&#8217;ve also found that gluten-free mixes, for the most part, make me violently  ill within minutes. So the unfortunate next step is to eliminate all grains for a certain period, along with dairy, eggs &#8212; and my precious coffee.</p>
<p>I have begun to HATE dining in restaurants, because invariably the dish I want has one ingredient I can&#8217;t have, and is incorporated into a key component of the dish, so it can&#8217;t just be removed. Or the stuff I <em>can </em>have holds no appeal. Or even better, some servers just forget about the gluten-free thing altogether, so an accidental chunk of cookie in my whipped cream renders me doubled over in pain within an hour.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really trying to be a trouper here, but this sucks in every possible  way. I find myself in tears a lot.</p>
<p>It would be groovy if all my symptoms were gone and I could say, &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s the gluten! No more pain!&#8221; But that isn&#8217;t the case. The searing leg cramps, the swelling, the stomach nightmares &#8212; they all still linger. So now comes the dreaded part, where we get rid of everything else that brings me pleasure. The other night, out of spite, I ate almost a whole tray of brownies  because I was just so ANGRY. The next day was less than fun.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a hedonist by philosophy. I embrace the rational pursuit of my pleasures. Living my life well is <em>incredibly </em>important to me, so in the face of having my definition of that turned upside down, I&#8217;m reacting less than optimally. But I am not lamenting long-gone orgiastic meals and jeroboams of the finest bubbly; I am missing a crust of bread. And soon it will be a piece of cheese, and a glass of wine. Where will it stop? And for how long?</p>
<p>I have a memory etched into my head from my Gramma Crucitti, who had a heart attack in her late 60s and had to go on a special diet. As I watched her slather a piece of toast with low-fat cottage cheese one morning, I looked her in the eye and said, &#8220;How does that taste?&#8221; She cringed at me with the most pitiful face, and said &#8220;Please. No wanna talk about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I know how she felt.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, however, I&#8217;ve been trying to see how I can leverage this nightmare so the information is of some use to others &#8212; to you, to a friend, a loved one, a dinner guest, or even a customer. The challenges I&#8217;m encountering are not new, certainly, but I&#8217;ve got a few hoops to jump through here if I intend to keep traveling and exploring the planet. Since you might one day find yourself in those same locations, I&#8217;ve started taking notes. And since I want to have guests over to dinner while not compromising my health, I need to learn to cook different foods. I&#8217;m taking notes on that, too.</p>
<p>So I will make lemonade, however begrudgingly I might do so at first. It is not in my nature to feel sorry for myself, and I&#8217;m trying not to be in that mindset, so I will keep the whining to a minimum; but there may be a few more rants as I navigate a path that is often rocky and uncomfortable. I&#8217;m trying to remind myself that this may not be forever, though right now it certainly feels that way. Of course, after eating 3/4 of a tray of brownies, I know 100% certainly for certain that gluten is a fibromyalgia trigger for me, so I can check that box.</p>
<p>What? You thought I learned that with the <a href="http://foodphilosophy.com/my-new-gluten-free-world/"><strong>Bread Pudding Incident</strong></a>? Or the mini-muffins? Welcome to my definition of the Calabrese <em>testa dura</em>, darlings.</p>

<p><em>In my quest for deliciousness via gluten-free goodness, I&#8217;ve been experimenting with a lot of international flavors. A friend suggested I begin with the regions of the world where wheat isn&#8217;t grown, such as Thailand, and as a huge fan of Thai food, I thought this was a capital idea. One of my favorite dishes is laab, a spicy beef dish (a salad, really) which is normally made with ground pork, beef or chicken. I&#8217;m a beef girl, and prefer a sliced steak for texture, so this is my riff on the idea.</em></p>
<p><em>Warning: Be careful with fish sauce. The one I buy is from an Asian market, and its ingredients are simply anchovies, salt and sugar. Check the label to ensure there are no wheat derivatives.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/spicybeefsalad-lg.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1776 alignright" title="spicybeefsalad-lg" src="http://foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/spicybeefsalad-lg-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>1-2 tablespoons toasted Jasmine rice (instructions below)<br />
6 oz. skirt steak<br />
1 teaspoon olive oil<br />
juice of 2 limes, divided<br />
2 tablespoons fish sauce<br />
1-2 teaspoons dried chile peppers, ground, to taste <em>[See Chef's Note]</em><br />
1 small red onion, thinly sliced<br />
1 cup cilantro, finely chopped<br />
1 medium head of cabbage<br />
Mint sprigs (optional)<br />
Additional cilantro sprigs (optional)</p>
<p><strong>Special Equipment</strong></p>
<p>Mortar &amp; pestle</p>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<p><em>For the toasted rice:</em><br />
Heat a small skillet and add in rice, swirling occasionally as it begins to toast. Let the rice toast to a golden brown, then transfer to a mortar and pestle. With a twisting motion, grind the rice into very small pieces. If you pound the rice you will end up with one hell of a mess in your kitchen, so be gentle. The toasted rice adds texture to the dish, but is very crunchy, so you don&#8217;t want large pieces. Transfer to small dish and set aside.</p>
<p><em>[Chef's Note: You can grind the chile peppers in the same manner.]</em></p>
<p><em>For the beef:</em><br />
Slice the skirt steak into very thin slices. Add to a bowl along with the juice from one lime. Stir and let sit for 5 minutes. Heat medium-sized skillet over a medium-high flame and add olive oil, heating until the oil shimmers. Add in the beef and stir until just cooked. Remove the beef and its juices to a large bowl.</p>
<p><em>Assemble the salad:</em><br />
Add the onions, remaining lime juice, ground chile peppers, fish sauce, cilantro and mint leaves, and half the toasted rice. Stir until well mixed. Serve on a large plate with additional fresh herbs, if desired, and sprinkle some of the remaining toasted rice on top.</p>
<p><strong>Service</strong></p>
<p>Remove the outer leaves from the cabbage and cut in half. Pull away largest outer leaves and serve on a platter with additional mint and cilantro sprigs. To eat, take a large cabbage leaf and spoon some of the beef salad into the center. Add fresh mint or cilantro sprigs if desired. Wrap up into a small bundle and crunch away!</p>

		</div>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/salad.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1765" title="Walnut &amp; Goat Cheese Salad" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/salad.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>While I&#8217;ve been trying to get my health in order over the past few weeks, a few people suggested that I look into gluten as a potential culprit for some of my <a href="http://foodphilosophy.com/fibromyalgia-an-inside-look/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>fibromyalgia</strong></span></a> aches and pains; apparently gluten intolerance can sometimes trigger a fibro flare-up. I figured that at this point, I had little to lose, and gave it a shot. Much to my surprise, within a couple of days I was feeling far more energetic again, and the physical pain was almost nil. Dubious, I ate a few organic mini-muffins, because surely this was a fluke.</p>
<p>My body told me otherwise.</p>
<p>Concerned about my upcoming press trip to Ireland, I reached out to our hosts and asked if they might be able to accommodate a gluten-free menu. I was a bit nervous about it, as I wasn&#8217;t sure how the chefs would react &#8212; this was a culinary weekend, after all. Again, to my surprise, every one of them was happily prepared for me, and I savored delicious meals along with everyone else, with slight modifications to the relevant courses. They even brought me my own basket of gluten-free breads and crackers each night, which I&#8217;ll admit made me a little verklempt because it was so sweet.</p>
<p>But because there is a part of me inside that is railing against such a restriction on my livelihood, I sampled a few bites of bread pudding just before leaving the hotel in Ireland. And because sometimes it takes me a while to learn the lesson, I sat through some pretty wicked physical and stomach pains on the way home, along with a body that swelled with an additional 6 lbs. of water. That&#8217;s a lotta liquid.</p>
<p>So now that I&#8217;m home again, I&#8217;m looking at all of this from a big-picture perspective. And since I&#8217;ve been paying careful attention to my body&#8217;s reaction to food, I also noticed severe swelling each time I had wine during the trip, so I&#8217;m faced with some difficult choices. I&#8217;m not going to sugarcoat it &#8212; this is not happy effing news. For more than 20 years, my life and career have revolved around food and drink. Now there are whole categories that must be eliminated if I&#8217;m to be well again, and I&#8217;m struggling with it. As a very emotional person, I am trying to stem the melodrama and powerfully accept what is so in order to create a new path. I&#8217;m just not sure what that is yet.</p>
<p>It does make me very happy and relieved to see the number of gluten-free products out there, and so far the going has been quite easy in terms of finding things to eat &#8212; even in airports. I&#8217;m learning how to eat and not be ravenous in between meals, and am enjoying some gorgeous seasonal flavors. But I would cut a bitch for a slice of freshly-baked artisan bread. Thankfully, I&#8217;m not much of a sweets eater, so the prospect of limited desserts doesn&#8217;t bother me much (and foie gras creme brulee is gluten-free, praise the gods). The wine problem, however, troubles me intensely. I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s happening there, so I&#8217;ll table it until I get the rest of my system in order, but inside me there is a little girl in pigtails and Mary Janes throwing a <em>complete</em> hissy fit.</p>
<p>There have been moments over the past few weeks when I&#8217;ve been willing to trade just about any other illness for this one &#8212; for something not food-related. However, that kind of thinking isn&#8217;t going to do me much good, and irrational is not my preferred state of being. I&#8217;ve found some fantastic resources thanks to people like <a href="http://glutenfreegirl.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gluten-Free Girl</strong></span></a>, <a href="http://www.celiacteen.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Celiac Teen</strong></span></a> and my Twitter pals, and I&#8217;m trying to go a step at a time so as not to be overwhelmed. In fact, I was quite fine with it until today, as it was all theoretical until The Bread Pudding Incident. Now reality is setting in, so I&#8217;ll put on my big girl pants and learn the new set of rules.</p>
<p>The toughest part career-wise is that I now have to ask if I can be accommodated for every invitation I receive to a press luncheon, cocktail event or tasting. I&#8217;m <em>that girl</em>. Wine tasting events? I can&#8217;t even go there in my head right now. We get at least 10 invitations a week to things.</p>
<p>But for now I&#8217;ll take a deep breath and focus on the good stuff, and be thankful that I&#8217;ve experienced some of the best there is to be had in fine cuisine and wines from around the world. It&#8217;s more than some have in a lifetime, and for that I am grateful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also thankful to you for being here as I walk along this new road. You&#8217;ve been wonderfully supportive and helpful, and I can&#8217;t thank you enough for that. So I guess we&#8217;ll take this little walk together.</p>

Chef Mark and I are once again running amok throughout the countryside to bring you our favorite flavors, colors and delights from the other side of the pond. We&#8217;re spending a few days in the lovely County Kerry, with its ever-varying landscape of craggy hills and verdant hues. We&#8217;re here to participate in a Culinary Celebration of Ireland weekend at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.parkkenmare.com/" target="_blank">Park Hotel Kenmare</a></strong></span> featuring some of Ireland&#8217;s most renowned chefs, including the hotel&#8217;s Head Chef Mark Johnston, who is joined by Dublin restaurateurs Ross Lewis of Chapter One and Derry Clarke of L&#8217;Ecrivain, as well as Mickael Viljanen of Gregans Castle in County Clare. As always, we&#8217;ll have audio, video and photos of the experience, but here&#8217;s a little rundown of what&#8217;s on the agenda:</p>
<p>Tonight: &#8220;One by Three&#8221; dinner featuring 1 Ingredient, 3 Interpretations, 9 Courses and 1 Result</p>
<p>Tomorrow:<br />
Chef Mark will hit the Kerry Way trail on his way to a cheese tasting at the top of the hill, while I&#8217;ll be sampling a variety of the hotel&#8217;s SAMAS Deluxe Destination Spa offerings. We then have a food and heritage walk of the town of Kenmare, then a whiskey tasting and a surprise dinner menu from the chefs.</p>
<p>Sunday we&#8217;ll depart for home!</p>
<p>On our way here, we took a day to wind our way through County Clare to see some of the spectacular views, and enjoyed a night at the Moy House hotel in Lahinch, near the Cliffs of Moher. We both fell in love with the Moy House, which was wonderfully elegant with nary a hint of pretense, so our stay was relaxing and comfortable. We woke to views of the ocean and those famous cliffs, so it was hard to leave! Photos of our mini-tour, followed by dinner crafted by Chef Daniel O&#8217;Brien, are in my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=211302&amp;id=625869702&amp;l=035f083d95" target="_blank"><strong>Facebook album</strong></a> as well as Chef Mark&#8217;s.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have more on that County Clare visit, along with Chef Mark&#8217;s interview with Chef Daniel, in the coming days, but we wanted to give you a sneak peek from the road. We hope you&#8217;ll follow along with us as Chef Mark revisits his favorite Irish tastes and sights, and as I experience my first (but definitely not last!).</p>

I&#8217;m still a bit overwhelmed by all the love that has been shown to me in the past couple of weeks, and though it might sound strange, it was almost worth the price of what I&#8217;ve gone through to be sitting here so filled with gratitude. On that <a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/the-power-of-people/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>very difficult Monday</strong></span></a>, I never imagined that in little more than a week, I&#8217;d be up and running again.</p>
<p>But the best part? Every piece of media I create on this new machine &#8212; from blog posts to videos, podcasts and even business proposals &#8212; will be created in a state of thankfulness. Every key stroke is a reminder of you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very interested to see how this affects the dynamic of my work, as I was already in love with what I&#8217;m doing. But now I know that you dig it, too, so it takes the experience from the creator&#8217;s point of view to a different level. I&#8217;m looking forward to the next part of the journey.</p>
<p>So now, because of your help, we can get back to the good stuff. Like food, wellness, sex on a plate, and this magnificent exploration of the senses &#8212; which we&#8217;re all doing together. Thank you for being here.</p>
<p>With gratitude,<br />
Jennifer</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/heart.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1736" title="heart" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/heart.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="149" /></a>In what has been one of the most trying weeks of my life, I&#8217;ve learned more about the goodness of people than I had ever hoped to find.</p>
<p>When I began to talk about my <a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/fibromyalgia-an-inside-look/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>struggle with fibromyalgia</strong></span></a> last week, I did it in the hopes that someone out there might have a better method for dealing with it than the path I&#8217;ve taken, and I asked for help. What I got in return was a truckload of e-mails offering support, thanking me for putting a spotlight on the disease, and helpful suggestions for managing it from those in the trenches with me. What <em>really</em> blew me away, however, was that within hours, I had a doctor offering to help me and get to the root of what was happening with my body. We&#8217;re now working on it.</p>
<p>I was so excited, because what really hit home was the value of the relationships I&#8217;ve made through my food and philosophical meanderings. Turns out people were listening, after all.</p>
<p>Then this Monday morning, while I was out for a meeting, my apartment was robbed. The bastards took my laptop &#8212; the source of my livelihood &#8212; along with a precious family heirloom, and rifled through everything I own. Even my panty drawer. Worse, my mother was visiting this week, and narrowly missed walking in on them in the act.</p>
<p>Enraged and needing to vent , I took to Twitter and Facebook to let off some steam about what was happening.  And as my world was spinning off its axis, a sea of friends, family, and &#8220;strangers&#8221; were there to offer support, share in my anger and offer solutions to help me through one of my worst moments. Offers to borrow laptops came from all over the country.</p>
<p>I put the word &#8220;strangers&#8221; in quotes because for me, the people with whom I interact online &#8212; this means you &#8212; are not strangers to me. You are as real as if you were sitting next to me having a face-to-face conversation.</p>
<p>A stranger does not do what superhero <a href="http://blog.cogito-enterprises.com/2010/04/truly-worthy-cause.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shea Levy</strong></span></a> did. Of his own volition, because he values me not only as an online face, but as a human being, he set up a donation fund to help me buy a new laptop. In two days he has raised more than $1200. So now instead of panicking, I am within reach of being able to purchase new equipment and get back to work.</p>
<p>There are not words to describe how it feels to be on the receiving end of such kindness. With the help of people like <a href="http://remarkablepalate.com/blog" target="_blank"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chef Mark</span></strong></a> (from whose old PC I&#8217;m writing this), <a href="http://www.dianahsieh.com/blog/2010/04/worthy-cause.shtml" target="_blank"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Diana Hsieh</span></strong></a>, <a href="http://mrhoopers.squarespace.com/epic-meandering/2010/4/14/twitter-love.html" target="_blank"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eric Zinn</span></strong></a>, my intrepid editorial assistant <a href="http://cheeseforbreakfast.com/2010/04/give-your-coffee-to-foodphilosophy/" target="_blank"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Madeline Shores</span></strong></a> and countless others, Shea and everyone participating has turned a moment of personal disaster into a poignant moment in which to witness human greatness.</p>
<p>For those who are naysayers of the value of social media &#8212; that it doesn&#8217;t achieve any results, and that it&#8217;s a pointless waste of time &#8212; I beg to differ.</p>
<p>Whatever the technology, it is nothing without a human being behind it to keep the system going. Twitter, Facebook and other online outlets are about PEOPLE. People who care, people who help a friend &#8212; or &#8220;stranger&#8221; &#8212; in need.</p>
<p>I am touched beyond measure that I&#8217;ve brought enough value to the lives of others that they&#8217;ve offered such help in my time of crisis. There have been many times over the past year when I almost threw in the towel, wondering why I was struggling to get my message out there, and whether anyone was listening. Whether it was all worth it.</p>
<p>Turns out the answer is yes. And so with your help I now have options I didn&#8217;t have two days ago, and can focus on getting back to work instead of focusing on what happened. That will be my repayment to you.</p>
<p>And for those naysayers of one philosopher named Ayn Rand, who is often vilified for seemingly promoting self-absorption and no concern for others, I&#8217;d like to point out that the first responders in this situation were those who share in my admiration of her ideas and philosophy. Those selfish, greedy people (and I mean this, in its proper definition) changed my life this week. They took action not out of pity, but because I and my work represent value to them in some form. That feels so much better than pity.</p>
<p>To every person who has donated, spread the word, offered to lend me equipment, hugs or anything else I need right now: Thank you. For being the kinds of human beings with whom it is a pleasure to share my passion and my life&#8217;s work. Without you, my life would be far less inspiring and fulfilling, and for that you have my unending gratitude.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000010310479XSmall.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1727" title="Roses" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000010310479XSmall.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="339" /></a>You might have noticed I&#8217;ve included a few non-food items lately. That&#8217;s because my life is about more than just food; I take great delight in sharing all of my passions, and most importantly, in learning about yours.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if you are an engineer, an elementary school teacher, a massage therapist or a chef &#8212; your passion sets mine on fire.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of those conversations this week. I met a new friend, Nancy Ricci, whose enthusiasm for knitting and appreciation of aesthetics jumps off the page of her blog, <a href="http://gettingpurlywithit.wordpress.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Getting Purly with It</strong></span></a>.  After our conversation she reflected on <a href="http://gettingpurlywithit.wordpress.com/2010/04/08/our-ability-to-inspire/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our Ability to Inspire</strong></span></a> others by sharing, and how it&#8217;s taking her goals to the next level. In just the past few days, people have communicated with me about their desire to help others achieve wellness, change the educational system, and <a href="http://cultivatingthevirtues.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>bring a new level of consciousness to parenting</strong></span></a>.</p>
<p>My dear friend <a href="http://www.kclinephotography.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kelly Cline</strong></span></a>&#8216;s brilliant photography is now appearing on Burt&#8217;s Bees displays nationwide, and a bunch of my other gal pals are on their own mission to embrace health and wellness, with a call to <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23GTFU" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GTFU</strong></span></a>. Their excitement is kicking my own butt into gear. And I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of times <a href="http://remarkablepalate.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chef Mark</strong></span></a> inspires me daily, taking our ideas to the next level and bringing our vision to life while being a true and supportive friend.</p>
<p>This is what life is all about, people. Getting UP and making something HAPPEN.</p>
<p>It gets my emotions so fired up that I&#8217;m sitting here a little bit misty.</p>
<p>What makes your soul smile? What makes you jump out of bed in the morning ready to kick ass and take names? If you&#8217;re still searching for it, can I &#8212; and this magnificent group of people &#8212; help you find it?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/curtain.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1708" title="curtain" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/curtain.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>I tend to keep pretty quiet about the fact that I have fibromyalgia. It is likely due to my stubborn sense of bravado (nothing to see here!), that it&#8217;s just something to suck up and deal with, but lately I&#8217;ve found that sharing my experience has helped me to find new resources with which to manage what has become more than a nuisance.</p>
<p>The disease itself can be quite insidious. Things first appeared to go awry when I was in college, when I slept through most of my first winter break. I found it odd, but chalked it up to depression from losing my dad and mental fatigue from my first semester in a competitive business school. Upon returning to classes, my body seemed to readjust, and any fatigue was taken in stride as part of the life of a college student.</p>
<p>But god, did I hate getting up in the morning. Worse yet, I would &#8220;sleep-talk&#8221; and have full conversations with no recollection, so if I woke up and found my car missing, I&#8217;d later find out I gave my brother permission to borrow it (confirmed by my mother). Who knows how much money I lent out. I dreaded having a corporate life, because my body just did not seem to like that whole 9-to-5 thing, so I knew I needed to find a lifestyle with some flexibility. As it turned out, I was an entrepreneur at heart anyway, so yay for the universe aligning.</p>
<p>I did go the corporate route for a short time, however, which ultimately led to the disease appearing in full bloom. Circa spring 2001, my office was located right in the heart of midtown Manhattan, and it was the happiest time in my life. I was traveling to Paris for business, eating in the best restaurants, and having a grand old time with some of the biggest food superstars in the world. Then the world changed.</p>
<p>Obviously, post-9/11 New York was a tough climate in which to work &#8212; stress levels were unbelievably high, and those of us traveling in and out of Grand Central had the joy of an occasional evacuation to go with the evening commute. I found that my thinking was a little foggy, and I was feeling achy, so I went to the doctor to see if it was the flu. He told me I was too stressed out, and that it was all in my head. Undaunted, I made him test me for everything from lupus to thyroid disease. Nada.</p>
<p>Around Christmas time I noticed that I was feeling unwell <em>most</em> of the time, and one evening as I shopped for gifts, my legs suddenly gave out. I managed to get myself home, but spent the entirety of Christmas Eve on my mother&#8217;s couch, unable to move. Feeling terrified, I rested up and proceeded to ignore the problem, hoping it would just go away.</p>
<p>But when my brain began to fail me, alarm bells started going off. My brain was the one thing I had always counted on, and suddenly I couldn&#8217;t remember the simplest of tasks. Like a critical conference call with the international division heads of my company &#8212; of which I was one. Oops. Realizing I could no longer ignore said problem, and riddled with physical pain, I called an orthopedist.</p>
<p>On September 11, 2002, this orthopedist listened to my symptoms. She was particularly intrigued by the sleep-talking, and mentioned that I probably had a number of sleep disorders. Awesome. After touching some very tender points on my upper body, she looked me in the eye and said, &#8220;This is easy. You have fibromyalgia.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry, what?</p>
<p>I felt simultaneous elation and depression. At last, this damn thing had a name &#8212; but no cure. And I had&#8230;a disease. One with barely any history of medical research, placed in the seemingly &#8220;random&#8221; category of illnesses that can&#8217;t be fully defined. The doctor started me on a tricyclic anti-depressant (Elavil) to regulate my sleep cycle, and it was as if my life were transformed overnight. No pain, clear head &#8212; all good. I struggled with the idea of being medicated this way, however. I&#8217;m not a pill-popper, and the idea of being on an anti-depressant made my skin crawl.</p>
<p>I soon found that if I worked out regularly, I could wean myself off the pills and take the natural route, which was preferable, and it worked well for a few years &#8212; until I started what is now the <a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Culinary Media Network</strong></span></a>. Working out was replaced by hundreds of hours at my desk, and the pain set in. Sometimes I would wake up unable to stand, and would crawl to the kitchen to pop a few Aleve and get back to my desk, body screaming for mercy. I knew this could not go on, and once again returned to the medicine &#8212; only now, it didn&#8217;t work so well. Eff.</p>
<p>For the past few years I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of international travel, and keeping the insane hours of the entrepreneur, and every once in a while I pay dearly for it. I try to keep the stress at bay, as it is the biggest trigger, but sometimes I lose that game of chess. The fluctuations in the economy over the past year have not helped, so I once again tried returning to the medication to get the symptoms under control. It set off six months of insomnia. Six. Months.</p>
<p>And though much work has been accomplished thanks to said insomnia, I cannot begin to describe what it feels like to have my entire spine in a vice grip, where even a bra strap is a source of agony, and where it perpetually feels like I&#8217;m coming down with the flu. Where hugs hurt. And I really, really like hugs. Poor <a href="http://remarkablepalate.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chef Mark</strong></span></a> has had to experience it in real-time, where I can forget things from one minute to the next, and become a raving bitch at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;m committed to finding a natural solution, because I could go on playing through the pain, but to me that is not an optimal existence &#8212; for me or those around me. The symptoms tend to appear in cycles, and sometimes I can go for months with no problems, but there has got to be a better way. I&#8217;ve resumed yoga, am heading back to the gym this week, and have made significant changes to my diet, but I don&#8217;t want to leave any stone unturned. I will make myself better&#8230;or die trying. No matter what the result, I will continue to live my life at full-throttle, but it would be great if I could do that with a bit more physical comfort and mental acuity. And no way in hell am I giving up the hugs.</p>
<p>If you are a fibromyalgia sufferer (or play one on TV), what natural methods have worked for you?</p>

Given the fact that most of my plants are bent over, begging for attention and care, this seems like a good plan. But it doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">melt</span> have an affinity for my 9 nieces, nephews and great-nephews. At times like this, when I&#8217;ve been working almost &#8217;round the clock for weeks, and could really use a hug from a little person, I miss them terribly. I feel like I&#8217;m missing important stuff, like my godson&#8217;s touchdowns, or the twins&#8217; wrestling matches and fivehundredwordaminute stories. Smiles and giggles. OK, and yelling and screaming &#8212; but that&#8217;s how they&#8217;re built. I&#8217;ve learned to accept it.</p>
<p>When I learned about Melanie Notkin&#8217;s site, <a href="http://www.savvyauntie.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Savvy Auntie</strong></span></a>, I thought, <em>Hey, I&#8217;m not the only one who feels this way!</em> Melanie has created a community where we can seek and offer advice/ideas, and a place where we can share our experience from this very unique perspective. I revel in being an aunt because these are children I adore and sometimes crave, but I get to give them back. It&#8217;s like a rental car, but way better.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/nick-samantha.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1667" title="nick-samantha" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/nick-samantha.jpg" alt="" width="285" height="199" /></a>My (non)kids range from 1 1/2 to 31 years old, and I&#8217;ve been around them as long as they&#8217;ve been around. Fed them, changed them, walked the floors with them, helped them learn to read. I&#8217;ve had all of them with me in the kitchen at some point, sniffing cardamom, rolling meatballs or trying to pronounce &#8220;gastronomy.&#8221;</p>
<p>And let us not forget the one-liners, such as Zachary&#8217;s famous quip, upon being asked to wash his hands before we baked: <em>&#8220;We need to wash our hands so the bread doesn&#8217;t taste like &#8216;hand,&#8217; right Jen?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>But most importantly, because I don&#8217;t have my own children to distract me, I have the opportunity to be there for them in a different way: As a helping hand, or someone to listen if they need advice. <em>I live for this.</em> That I can contribute to their happiness, and help create who they are as human beings, is worth every minute of my time. I love them ridiculously and endlessly.</p>
<p>Are you an auntie (or an uncle) like me? Do you revel in the rental kid? Do tell, especially if you&#8217;ve got some good one-liners.</p>

<p>Kitchens excite me. Really well-designed ones titillate me. There is something luscious in the feel of a smooth counter, and a stove with 17,000 BTU burners elicits that *rowr* inside. Needless to say, this assignment was a favorite.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, I found that designers and architects were wholeheartedly embracing the &#8220;green&#8221; kitchen &#8212; with lots of caveats. I also learned that people are beginning to incorporate the living space right into the kitchen, to create more of a centralized location for family activities.</p>
<p>Viking came up with a luxury kitchen design that suits this need perfectly, with sleek lines, stainless steel finishes&#8230;and couches. I explored their new line at an event in the Food Network studio kitchens, and fell in love with the cabinetry. I&#8217;m a sucker for good handles.</p>

We were in for a delightful interpretation of Galician cuisine, many of which came with a variety of textures, flavors and colors. After dinner I sat down with the chef to talk about his food philosophy and the way he plays with his food. You can see the photos of our various courses below.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.restaurantesolla.com" target="_blank"><strong>www.restaurantesolla.com</strong></a></p>
<p>Two exciting announcements this week: Our new <a href="http://academy.culinarymedianetwork.com/course/968/register" target="_blank"><strong>Knife Skills 101</strong></a> course is live in our new CMN Academy, so learn the correct techniques (along with some tips) from Chef Mark. We&#8217;ve also added Brian Franklin&#8217;s DoubleShot Coffee Company coffees to our <a href="https://shop.gildedfork.com/cp-app.cgi?usr=51J8304483&amp;rnd=8927238&amp;rrc=N&amp;affl=&amp;cip=74.68.111.175&amp;act=&amp;aff=&amp;pg=cat&amp;ref=COFFEE" target="_blank"><strong>Gilded Fork Boutique</strong></a>, so oh my, yes, get to sipping.</p>
<p>And in the world of rants, I share my thoughts on the latest piece of inane legislature to be introduced: A ban on salt. You read that correctly.</p>

<p>Now, the self-appointed police of all things have decided to attack&#8230;salt. Yes, salt. That mainstay of cooking, that critical ingredient to every baker on the planet, and flavor enhancer to every dish that comes out of a kitchen, professional or otherwise.</p>
<p><a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=051" target="_blank"><strong>Brooklyn Assemblyman Felix Ortiz</strong></a>, potentially the most unintelligent man related to food (or government) in any form, proposes in bill <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&amp;bn=A10129&amp;Summary=Y&amp;Text=Y" target="_blank"> <strong>A. 10129</strong></a> that <em>&#8220;No owner or operator of a restaurant in this state shall use salt in any form in the preparation of any food for consumption by customers of such restaurant, including food prepared to be consumed on the premises of such restaurant or off of such premises.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Mr. Ortiz is single-handedly trying to destroy the restaurant industry by &#8220;acting for the public good.&#8221; I won&#8217;t even get into what he&#8217;s trying to do to our palates.</p>
<p>What Mr. Ortiz fails to understand is that salt is an essential component of cooking and flavor enhancement. In baking, it is a chemical necessity. But such things are irrelevant to legislators of his ilk, who are trying to save us from ourselves. <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&amp;bn=A10129&amp;Summary=Y&amp;Text=Y" target="_blank"><strong></strong></a>Alas, this is simply the latest in the government&#8217;s attempt to tell us what we can&#8217;t do, and to regulate our health by means of being an evil Nanny.</p>
<p>Chefs are rightfully up in arms, but it is we, the people, who need to take action. Many will shake their heads and wonder why the government is doing such a thing, but then they&#8217;ll go back to working 60-hour weeks and forget that our lives and liberties are eroding before our very eyes, as we anxiously await the next episode of <em>Desperate Housewives</em>.</p>
<p>We have become so lazy and complacent as a culture that the government now finds it appropriate to introduce such measures, so the blame rests solidly on our shoulders. We did this. And we are the only ones who can undo it. Lest you think I&#8217;m being hyperbolic, I encourage you to brush up on American history, and pay attention to the evolution of the Nanny State.</p>
<p>If you are outraged by the actions of Mr. Ortiz &#8212; and I hope you are, I encourage you to <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=051&amp;sh=contact" target="_blank"><strong>start writing, start calling</strong></a>, and <a href="http://assembly.state.ny.us/" target="_blank"><strong>let the New York State legislature know</strong></a> that this bill is not only a waste of taxpayer dollars, but an infringement on our rights of the most insidious nature.</p>
<p><a href="http://myfoodmychoice.org/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1571" title="myfoodmychoice" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/myfoodmychoice-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" /></a>Now, some of you might say &#8220;but too much salt is unhealthy!&#8221; I have news for you: Firstly, if a chef is using that much salt, he isn&#8217;t going to be in business for long, because his guests won&#8217;t eat his food. It won&#8217;t taste good. Secondly, too much of anything is unhealthy, and that&#8217;s where we come in: <em>We</em> are the ones consuming, so <em>we</em> must pay attention to what&#8217;s going in our mouths. Eat too much salt over a lifetime and it may have adverse effects &#8212; but <em>we</em> are the ones holding the fork.</p>
<p>If the idea of the government rationing your food makes you bristle, recognize that much worse measures are not far away. Unless we act now. A coalition called <a href="http://myfoodmychoice.org/" target="_blank"><strong>My Food, My Choice</strong></a> has gotten together to fight such inanities &#8212; I&#8217;m signing up right this minute.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/Think-Albert.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1551" title="Think-Albert" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/Think-Albert-220x300.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="300" /></a>This Apple advertisement came out when I was getting my first &#8220;grownup&#8221; business off the ground. I was living in Boston, struggling through the often overwhelming days of startup, and here came <em>Think Different</em>.</p>
<p>It hit me so hard that I froze on my couch and burst into tears. If there was ever a moment that a brand had made me its bitch, that was it. I had the text version of the ad posted on the wall until it yellowed and curled.</p>
<p>Yesterday <strong><a href="http://www.chrisbrogan.com" target="_blank">Chris Brogan</a></strong>&#8216;s weekly dose of genius hit my inbox, and it spoke to this very theme. There isn&#8217;t a week where I don&#8217;t get some kind of insight or tremendous value from Chris&#8217; newsletter &#8212; even when it&#8217;s just a reminder that it&#8217;s OK to be a misfit. Good deals are a rare find (it&#8217;s free), so if you don&#8217;t sign up, well, that&#8217;s just silly.</p>
<p>If you are one of those crazy ones, and you have a vision that makes you burn with passion, I salute you and everything you represent in this world. It is you to whom I look for inspiration on my dark days, and you to whom I raise my glass on the bright ones. What would this planet be without those who have said &#8220;I can do it better!&#8221; or &#8220;This could use a tweak.&#8221; Or even more poignant, &#8220;Let&#8217;s throw out the model and start over. The old one is broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those are the words of the heroic, the courageous &#8212; and the ones who keep me going. Thank you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440178592?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gastronomicme-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0440178592" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1542" title="sensuouswoman" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/sensuouswoman.jpg" alt="" width="137" height="187" /></a>During one of my trips to Halifax, Nova Scotia (one of my favorite places on the planet), I savored a late breakfast in one of those quintessential used book stores with tasty scones and perfectly brewed tea. The store was literally stuffed with books, some dating back to the early 20th Century.</p>
<p>As I perused one of the stacks, a title screamed at me from its humble placement: <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440178592?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gastronomicme-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0440178592" target="_blank">The Sensuous Woman</a></strong></p>
<p>Written by &#8220;J&#8221; in 1969, the back cover had the following review from Playboy:</p>
<blockquote><p>The author of this book is not especially pretty.</p>
<p>Before &#8220;J&#8221; became &#8220;The Sensuous Woman&#8221; she went through life unnoticed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very different now. &#8220;J&#8221; is called &#8220;ravishingly sexy&#8221; by some of the world&#8217;s most exciting males. They describe her as &#8220;all woman, maddeningly exciting, a modern Aphrodite, a perfect bed-made and life-mate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now &#8220;J&#8221; reveals her secret, step-by-step program that allows every woman to free her body, train her senses, and realize her tremendous feminine capacity for giving and receiving pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;J&#8221; is unmistakably female; no man could possibly be so exquisitely knowing about how a woman can make the most of what she&#8217;s got.</p></blockquote>
<p>Have you ever wondered what it was like to stumble upon a parallel universe? That moment was something like it, I think.</p>
<p>After perusing the book&#8217;s contents, which expounded on the delights of masturbation, training the senses, sexual exploration and the like, I tried to imagine how this must have gone over in the late 60s. It was a #1 bestseller, so clearly women were aching for some kind of knowledge to break the monotony of sex-for-procreation and craft a more pleasurable life for themselves. The fact that &#8220;J&#8221; took on such a daring topic gave me a thrill I rarely experience. Oh yes, this book was coming home with me.</p>
<p>As a product of the late 70s, it is a bit foreign to imagine what it would be like to consider marriage solely for procreation and sex as a necessary chore. Happily, Garrity focuses on the importance of bringing pleasure to the self, and why it&#8217;s important for a woman to feel that on the inside in order to reflect it on the outside. The back cover copy may seem to be an effort at sensationalism, but its words are truthful: When you radiate sensuality, those extra 5 lbs. really don&#8217;t make a difference. If they do, that partner isn&#8217;t going to be very good in bed anyway, as the focus is not on the pleasure, but on the formula. Yawn.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as if &#8220;J&#8221; is inside my head, explaining how we must awaken our senses to ignite higher levels of bodily pleasure. She gets it. She got it. I love her.</p>
<p>Incidentally, &#8220;J&#8221; now appears comfortable going by her full name, Joan Garrity, which appears in the updated version from 1982. I need to get my hands on that copy, too, so I can compare notes.</p>
<p>You might be wondering if I&#8217;m going to make any food references in this post. Why yes, in fact, I am. <em>The Sensuous Woman</em> has a section on awakening the senses, and it&#8217;s serendipitous that I read it last night, as her process is very close to what I envisioned when designing my new workshop <em>Awakening the Mental Mouth</em>™.  In fact, Chef Mark and I are crafting a two-parter out of the idea: In the first workshop, I will take you through a series of exercises and explorations to awaken your palate, hone your senses and help you learn more about your taste preferences. In the second workshop, <em>Cooking with the Senses</em>, he will show you how to take those flavors and create customized goodies for yourself, from marinades to spice rubs and sauces.</p>
<p>So while my exercises are focused on the sensuality of food, and Garrity&#8217;s on the sexuality of the body, they both have the same root: In order to experience the highest levels of pleasure, we must first awaken the pleasure receptors. By focusing on &#8212; and exploring &#8212; the self.</p>

The first birds have come out of hiding, and their gentle melodies offer a counterpoint to the drip, drip, drip of melting snow. That means we are almost to the end of what feels like the longest winter in history. Those first few 50-degree days are a vicious tease, however, because we know they aren&#8217;t yet here to stay.</p>
<p>My palate gets a little bit excited when this happens, as the yearning commences for the baby vegetables of spring, and the vivid hues of new flowers in bloom. And yet we must wait just a bit longer. Needless to say, I&#8217;m firing up the grill today, because I simply must have a taste of meat cooked on the fire to soothe my inner cavewoman.</p>
<p>What do you crave on a day like today? Is spring tickling your tongue? The other night I unabashedly ate 3 bowls of salad because the crunch compelled me to keep going back for more.</p>
<p>What meal do you most look forward to in the coming warmer days?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/bday.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1475" title="bday" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/bday.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="301" /></a>Six years ago today I experienced one of those moments that will stand out as a big red dot on the timeline of my life. I had just finished my stint launching the <em>Ecole des Chefs</em> program for <a href="http://www.relaischateaux.com" target="_blank"><strong>Relais &amp; Chateaux</strong></a>, and found myself at an odd crossroads: How could I possibly top an international gig working with chefs like Thomas Keller, Guy Savoy and Daniel Boulud? I was actually afraid that my career had peaked early. <em>What now?</em></p>
<p>I looked at the laptop and tray table before me, and wondered if a career in food writing was the next step. I was hesitant &#8212; I knew it wouldn&#8217;t pay very well, but I had started this thing called &#8220;blogging&#8221; <a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/2004/02/" target="_blank"><strong>a couple of weeks before</strong></a> to test the waters and develop my writing style. My first newsletter had 50 or so subscribers, and I knew every one of them personally. I signed up for a recreational cooking class to get my hands back to work in the kitchen, and hoped that something in the course of all this would inspire me; otherwise I&#8217;d need to look at a big career shift.</p>
<p>I quickly got antsy &#8212; it&#8217;s not in my nature to sit and write all the time. I knew I&#8217;d be bored out of my mind soon enough, so I had a fleeting thought: <em>Why not turn this blog into a little food magazine?</em> I knew that its name, <em>Gastronomic Meditations</em>, was a bit confusing for people (sometimes they asked if I was a doctor&#8230;sigh), but I pushed forward anyway, knowing that the people who &#8220;got it&#8221; would continue to get it, and we could explore together. I somehow convinced <a href="http://www.kclinephotography.com" target="_blank"><strong>Kelly Cline</strong></a>, <a href="http://www.vinography.com" target="_blank"><strong>Alder Yarrow</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.theresachefinmykitchen.com" target="_blank"><strong>Donna Desfor</strong></a> to play along, and we forged ahead. A few months in, I heard from Go Daddy&#8217;s marketing director, who asked if I&#8217;d like to be in one of their new customer-focused commercials, and the site got nominated for a World Food Media Award, so I thought <em>hey, this is pretty neat</em>. It seemed like things were off to a decent start.</p>
<p>Not long after, I got an e-mail from a friend of mine:<em> There&#8217;s someone I think you should meet. His name is Mark, and he&#8217;s a chef.</em> That someone was creating these newfangled things called podcasts. <a href="http://www.remarkablepalate.com" target="_blank"><strong>Chef Mark Tafoya</strong></a> is now the person with whom I&#8217;ve traveled the world, expanded the vision of what things are possible in this little space called &#8220;new media,&#8221; and founded the companies that have brought all of our ideas together in one place. In the course of that history there have been some epic arguments and differences of opinion, but when Chef Mark and I find ourselves in that place, we always come back to the root of why we created this: Together we are a powerful team of creativity and passion, and the love and respect we have for that dynamic &#8212; and for each other &#8212; is what has given us the wherewithal to stay in it and move the dream forward. I likely wouldn&#8217;t be sitting here right now if it weren&#8217;t for him.</p>
<p>As I sat at that tray table six years ago, I had no inclination of what was ahead. Traveling the world was a goal, being on camera was a pipe dream (and a scary one), and Twitter was something birds did to annoy me.</p>
<p>But here we are. There are six years of our creativity for you to explore on what started as that food blog, but is now the <a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com" target="_blank"><strong>Culinary Media Network</strong></a> &#8212; a living travelogue of our adventures from farm to plate, around the globe, with articles, recipes and audio/video programming. This blog, <em><strong>Food Philosophy</strong></em>, is more of my own personal exploration of the connections between food and sensuality, but you&#8217;ll see that the posts date back to &#8217;04, so nothing has been lost along the way. At CMN we&#8217;re also in the thick of creating how-to courses for our new <a href="http://academy.culinarymedianetwork.com" target="_blank"><strong>online cooking academy</strong></a>, and there&#8217;s even a <a href="http://bit.ly/GFCookbook" target="_blank"><em><strong>Gilded Fork: Entertaining at Home cookbook</strong></em></a> for you to explore those ideas in tactile form (<em>The Gilded Fork</em> was our second name, pre-network). The years have gone by in a blur, and the ride has been very rocky at times, but I wouldn&#8217;t trade it for anything.</p>
<p>There have been recent, familiar moments, however, when I&#8217;ve found myself facing a question: <em>What now?</em> Now that I&#8217;ve flown all over the planet eating, drinking and learning, how can I possibly top it?</p>
<p>Only now, I have a better way to answer that question, which is in the form of a plaque my sister gave me for Christmas. Its call to action is one that will shape the next six years:</p>
<p><em><strong>Think big. If that doesn&#8217;t work, think bigger!</strong></em></p>
<p>Thank you for being here to be part of the journey with us, and most importantly, for your words of encouragement each time we take on a new challenge and reach a new benchmark. You are what makes the ride worthwhile.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve followed my musings for any length of time, you probably know that I&#8217;m a first-generation American. As such, I&#8217;ve made it a mission to learn as much as I can about my family pre-emigration, so the past few years have entailed a lot of research. My mother&#8217;s Scottish side has been quite easy to trace, as our clan (Forbes) is a prominent one with a well-documented history. On my father&#8217;s Italian side, however, the road has been an emotional one, and at times quite frustrating.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/Serafino.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1462" title="Serafino" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/Serafino.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="208" /></a>I find that you never really recover from losing a parent; it simply becomes part of the fabric of your history, and at times that material can feel a bit delicate. My father died suddenly when I was 18 years old, at a time in my life when I was absorbed in college and building my future, so I didn&#8217;t have a whole lot of interest in <em>his</em> history. The Calabrese are also known for their hard-headedness (&#8220;testa dura&#8221;), a trait I clearly inherited, so we weren&#8217;t always the best of friends.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m older, and traveling the world exploring food and culture, it&#8217;s as if there&#8217;s a giant question mark floating above my head; since my father isn&#8217;t here to answer my myriad questions, I&#8217;m on my own to find out more about his homeland. Oddly enough, I&#8217;ve been to almost every other region of Italy, yet I seem to be saving Calabria. Perhaps because I&#8217;m trying to prepare myself.</p>
<p>In the interim, I&#8217;m happy to say that the rest of the world has also, at last, taken note of Calabrian cuisine, so I&#8217;ve been able to sample some of it from American soil while gathering the information to make my pilgrimage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/italy-map.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1465" title="italy-map" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/italy-map.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="289" /></a>On the map of Italy, Calabria is the &#8220;toe&#8221; of the boot and home to the renowned bergamot orange, used in so many perfumes, and of course as the main accent in Earl Grey tea. Calabria&#8217;s landscape is lush, and was highly prized by the ancient Greeks as well as the broad collection of invaders who chose to call the region home throughout its colorful history.</p>
<p>As part of Vino 2010, Italy&#8217;s showcase of its regional winemakers, the Italian Trade Commission and the Region of Calabria held a winemaker&#8217;s dinner enabling me to explore how Calabrian wines were paired with its foods. The meal was prepared by guest chef Vito Gnazzo of <a href="http://www.ilgattopardonyc.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Il Gattopardo</strong></a> restaurant.</p>
<p>During the welcome reception, we were served some of my favorite flavors, like <em>Bruschetta con N&#8217;duja</em>, the spicy sausage so indicative of Calabria. We also had <em>Piccoli Peperoni Ripieni di Tonno</em> (peppers filled with tuna) and <em>Arancini di Riso</em> (rice balls filled with veal, peas and Pecorino cheese).</p>
<p>When we sat down to dinner, our antipasto was a welcoming remembrance of childhood: <em>Carciofi e Patate in Tortiera</em>. Though this particular combination paired braised baby artichokes and potatoes, when I was growing up we often had a variation of this with eggplant, peppers and potatoes (which I featured on the Culinary Media Network as <a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/serafinos-sofrito/" target="_blank"><strong>Serafino&#8217;s Sofrito</strong></a>). I could see this was going to be an evening of comfort.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/calabria-potatoes.jpg"><img title="calabria-potatoes" src="../wp-content/uploads/calabria-potatoes.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></p>
<p>The first course took the memories a step further with <em>Lagane e Ceci</em>, a thick chickpea soup with pasta. The dish had a fantastic peppery kick so familiar in Calabrian cuisine, and was paired with a big red wine, <em>Ippolito 1845 Ciro Rosso &#8220;Liber Pater&#8221; DOC 2007</em>. Ippolito is the oldest winery in Calabria, and this particular wine had one spicy profile. I think I may have preferred with the soup with a contrasting wine rather than another layer of spice, but I would love this wine served with beef.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/calabria-chickpeas.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1455" title="calabria-chickpeas" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/calabria-chickpeas.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The ever-familiar dried cod appeared in our second course as <em>Lo Stocco di Mammola</em>, a cod fish salad with parsley and extra virgin olive oil from Calabria. This dish was bright and sunny, just like its home region, and would be perfect on a summer afternoon. It was paired with <em>Statti Lamezia Greco Bianco IGT 2008</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/calabria-codsalad.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1456" title="calabria-codsalad" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/calabria-codsalad.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>After a lemon sorbetto to cleanse the palate, we moved on to <em>Cosciotto d&#8217;Agnello Lardellato al Polline di Finocchio Selvatico</em>, a lamb shank scented with wild fennel pollen. (I do love the word finocchio, incidentally, as it is a perfect representation of Italian&#8217;s melodic lingual expression.) This mild dish was paired with <em>Cantina Val di Neto Rosso &#8220;Arke&#8221; IGT 2005</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/calabria-lamb.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1457" title="calabria-lamb" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/calabria-lamb.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>To cap the evening, we finished with a lightly sweet dish that finished things on a lovely, mellow note: <em>Panzarotti Ripieni di Ricotta con Gelato al Miele</em>, a crispy, flaky pastry filled with ricotta and served with honey ice cream.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/calabria-dessert.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1458" title="calabria-dessert" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/calabria-dessert.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>This was paired with Amaro, perhaps the most indicative drink of Calabria. This rich, sweet dessert wine, <em>F.lli Caffo Vecchio Amaro del Capo</em>, added the perfect ending to a memorable evening.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/calabria-amaro.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1459" title="calabria-amaro" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/calabria-amaro.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>There is much to come as I share my discoveries of the region of Calabria, but if you&#8217;d like to learn a bit more for yourself, you can visit <a href="http://italianmade.com/home.cfm" target="_blank"><strong>ItalianMade.com</strong></a> to learn about all of Italy&#8217;s wines and regional specialties. Many thanks to the Italian Trade Commission, the Region of Calabria and Chef Gnazzo for enabling me to get a taste of it for myself, and for the comfort it brought me.</p>

Though I suppose it could be, as I likely wouldn&#8217;t throw you out of bed.</p>
<p>My friends over at <em>Toy with Me</em>, a delightfully sassy sex blog, asked me to come up with a menu idea for Valentine&#8217;s Day seduction. As I&#8217;m not one to say no to such an opportunity, I suggested a menu from our <a href="http://bit.ly/GFCookbook" target="_blank"><em><strong>Gilded Fork: Entertaining at Home</strong></em></a> cookbook along with some thoughts on the why behind the sexy (read: more rants on aphrodisiacs).</p>
<p>Since my mission encompasses doing my part to ensure the people of Earth enjoy better food and better sex, I&#8217;m delighted to be part of their efforts toward improving the better sex portion of the equation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/figs-open.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1435 alignright" title="Misson Figs on a Leaf" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/figs-open.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="295" /></a>Here we go. It&#8217;s almost Valentine&#8217;s Day, so expect to see no less than 20 articles on the topic of aphrodisiacs and how they can improve your love life. Per the usual, I call B.S.</p>
<p>Yes, there are ways in which food chemically affects our senses, and these facts have been scientifically proven in a number of studies. Hot peppers <em>do</em> make our blood run faster, men and women <em>are</em> aroused by certain smells, etc. However &#8212; and this is the very premise of my work &#8212; the mind is what drives the senses at their roots. If you aren&#8217;t sexy between the ears first, by knowing yourself, your mind, your body and its reactions, the food can only do so much. If you are a sensually-repressed individual, a bite of avocado is not going to suddenly transform you into Casanova. Sorry to disappoint.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/dining/10erotic.html?WT.mc_id=fb_nyt1313&amp;WT.mc_ev=click" target="_blank"><strong>The New York Times</strong></a> has an article today on the subject, and my favorite quote was from none other than Dr. Ruth: &#8220;The most important sex organ lies between the ears.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of trying to achieve nirvana via the fig, how about via your soul? What awakens it? What is your approach to life? Your philosophy?</p>
<p>If you pull those things into alignment, and understand who you are at your core, the food then becomes a delicious accompaniment to life itself, where beauty is more vivid, sex more fulfilling &#8212; and the senses the catalyst for a journey of satiety in new forms.</p>
<p>The unencumbered mind and spirit provide the best aphrodisiacs I&#8217;ve found to date.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/chocolatetruffle.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1426 alignright" title="Chocolate Truffles" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/chocolatetruffle.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="304" /></a>It&#8217;s been a rough day. I&#8217;ve spent months working with my team on the Sex on a Plate event concept, trying to bring it to life in a way that was compelling, satiating, and generally a blast. All the pieces seemed to fit together nicely, so I decided to try my hand in NYC first. It&#8217;s my backyard, I have dear friends at the <strong><a href="http://www.rogersmith.com" target="_blank">Roger Smith Hotel</a></strong>, and it seemed feasible to pull this off as a launch to my series of Sex on a Plate events. Ambitiously (perhaps overly so), I thought we could offer a compelling alternative on one of the most <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Hallmark</span> romantic holidays of them all.</p>
<p>I was mistaken. Even with a crackerjack team, a talented chef and a price of $85 for 7+ exquisite courses with wines and tequila, we couldn&#8217;t sell enough tickets, so today we had to cancel the Valentine&#8217;s Day event. Interestingly, there are, at this moment, other cities wanting Sex on a Plate, ready to put the pieces in motion.</p>
<p>So what went wrong in NYC? Well, I think it might have been a perfect convergence of not enough lead time to market between Christmas and Valentine&#8217;s Day, a non-existent advertising budget, not enough outreach, and too much else going on here that day. A perfect storm of fail.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll consider it my tuition. The next one will be planned much more carefully, with more lead time and a lot more momentum. If you build it, they will come &#8212; <em>but only if you build it well</em>.</p>
<p>And so we will begin again. I know the concept is a worthy one, as enough of you have said so &#8212; sometimes very loudly! &#8212; that I believe you. And you believe in what I&#8217;m doing here, which is more important &#8212; and why I refuse to let this idea fizzle away. Instead it will be refined, re-mixed and relaunched.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a part of my rollercoaster ride. You make it worthwhile. Stay tuned.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/ayn_rand.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1368 alignright" title="ayn_rand" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/ayn_rand.jpg" alt="" width="204" height="320" /></a>Today is Ayn Rand&#8217;s 105th birthday. I wish she were alive right now to see how many hundreds of thousands of people are reading her books. And so she could say &#8220;I told you so.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>For her Centennial in 2005, I wrote a piece for <a href="http://www.theatlasphere.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the Atlasphere</strong></span></a> to toast this prolific thinker. I&#8217;d like to share it with you today.</em></p>
<p><em>P.S. If you happen to have a copy of our <a href="https://shop.gildedfork.com/cp-app.cgi?usr=51J9395009&amp;rnd=8518684&amp;rrc=N&amp;affl=&amp;cip=&amp;act=&amp;aff=&amp;pg=prod&amp;ref=gfentathome&amp;cat=COOKBOOKS&amp;catstr=" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gilded Fork: Entertaining at Home</strong></span></a> cookbook, you&#8217;ll note she&#8217;s name-checked in the acknowledgments. If it weren&#8217;t for Rand&#8217;s work, I might never have met one Chef Mark Tafoya.</em></p>
<p><em> </em>*****</p>
<p>Today we toast the centennial of a giant &#8212; in thought, character, and sense of life.</p>
<p>Ayn Rand has touched the lives and ignited the minds of millions of people around the globe. Her words are timeless, as are her ideals. Her implacable respect for clear thinking has encouraged others to seek truth in the world around them, and to craft lives based on a foundation of integrity, conviction, and a commitment to reason.</p>
<p>Rand&#8217;s moral defense of individualism and capitalism has been an inspiration to leaders in business, government, the arts, and anywhere else one can see the sparks of integrity and intelligence melded into productive action. Her celebration of the individual compelled men and women of the mind to face the gray cloud of mediocrity and say: <em>&#8220;Not in my name.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>When I discovered her work a decade ago, I knew I had reached an important moment of truth. Her words resounded with such a powerful &#8220;Yes!&#8221; inside me that I had to know the reasons why I felt understood.</p>
<p>Perhaps, like me, after reading <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> you felt more compelled to mold the world to your own ideals; or <em>The Fountainhead</em> inspired you to walk a bit taller. Or maybe, as I did, you found a soul-mate in the character of Francisco d&#8217;Anconia. Such experiences often change the course of a human life.</p>
<p>Ayn Rand set out to spark the minds of those seeking the heroic in mankind. Her novels and non-fiction have now been embraced by three generations looking for better answers, and her ideas continue to be championed by those whose voices can be heard in academia, science, and the media.</p>
<p>That her books remain bestsellers more than fifty years after their publishing only underscores the depth of her impact. The rapid growth of a community like the Atlasphere, the proliferation of discussion sites across the internet, the number of books being published <em>about</em> Rand, and even references to her in pop culture, all demonstrate how widespread the response has been.</p>
<p>Her words are a call to action for those who welcome challenges and attack them with fervor. And when such mountains seem unscalable, the echo of those words provides fuel for another day:</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it&#8217;s yours (Atlas Shrugged, p.979).</em></p></blockquote>
<p><em> </em><br />
Happy hundredth birthday, Ayn Rand. From a little girl who once dreamed of great things, and discovered they need not remain in dreams alone.</p>

<p>Pazo San Mauro Winery:<br />

Wines from Spain:<br />

<p>We also got a wonderful lesson in wine, color and flavor from wine expert Marnie Old, whom I would like to bring with me on every wine tour from now on. She explains wine in a way that is so completely accessible and intelligent, it was like having a personal tutor along with us.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/strawberry-pink.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1184 alignright" title="Strawberry Treat" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/strawberry-pink.jpg" alt="" width="179" height="245" /></a>One of my favorite things about the digital realm: It enables me to encounter like-minded people who often bring a smile to my face and ideas to my busy brain. When I get to know them offline and in person as well, there&#8217;s the added bonus of experiencing them in glorious 3D.</p>
<p>I told you about <a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/why-i-heart-emily"><strong>my darling Emily</strong></a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/EmilysPearl" target="_blank"><strong>@EmilysPearl</strong></a>), with whom I have a sassfully delicious NYC adventure planned next weekend (more to come on that &#8212; *rowr*), but there are also others who ring my bell, and I&#8217;ll be sharing those with you on a regular basis. First up are three lovely ladies who have shown me serious digital love in the past couple of weeks. My turn.</p>
<h3>Sex and the 405</h3>
<p><a href="http://sexandthe405.com/fusing-food-and-sensuality-the-sex-on-a-plate-movement/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1195" title="sexandthe405" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/sexandthe405.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="152" /></a>I love hot, smart women. You&#8217;ve seen me mention Anais before (my dearest <a href="http://www.twitter.com/avflox" target="_blank"><strong>@avflox</strong></a>), whose wordsmithing tends to give me a little shiver. Someone recently quipped that she is the &#8220;Shakespeare of Sex,&#8221; and I can&#8217;t really argue with that. Intelligent and brimming with sensuality, she&#8217;s a sumptuous find for your head candy. She was the first to break the news on Sex on a Plate: LA (details soon) for <a href="http://sexandthe405.com/fusing-food-and-sensuality-the-sex-on-a-plate-movement/" target="_blank"><strong>Sex and the 405</strong></a>, and ran with my <em>holy-crap-she&#8217;s-in-garters</em> photo. That was an interesting blog traffic day. The full version of the photo is on her blog post, and yeah, my mom is OK with it.</p>
<h3>Kitten Lounge</h3>
<p><a href="http://kittenlounge.onsugar.com/page/6128" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1192" title="kitten-lounge" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/kitten-lounge.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="178" /></a>Kimmie (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/cocoabebe" target="_blank"><strong>@cocoabebe</strong></a>) and I have not yet met up for drinks, but that&#8217;s an evening I&#8217;m looking forward to. Her <a href="http://kittenlounge.onsugar.com/page/6128"><strong>Kitten Lounge</strong></a> site is full of delicious treats on fashion, beauty, lifestyle and entertainment, and is well worth a read if you wish to be as fabulous as she. With a history in fashion, accessories and PR, Kimmie has her own line of designs as well as a consulting agency for fashion social media. Kitten Lounge featured my Sex on a Plate event in their <a href="http://kittenlounge.onsugar.com/page/6128" target="_blank"><strong>2nd Annual Love Guide</strong></a>, which gave me a little squee moment.</p>
<h3>Miss Manifesto</h3>
<p><a href="http://food.missmanifesto.com/?p=96" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1201" title="missmanifesto" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/missmanifesto.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="147" /></a>&#8220;Miss Manifesto is every girl you&#8217;ve ever wanted to date. She is dirty sexy, wickedly smart and fantastically blunt. She&#8217;ll tell you exactly what you need to hear, whether you want to hear it or not. She&#8217;s gorgeous, but approachable, never seen without stillettos, and is always dressed to the nines. She expects &#8212; and gets &#8212; men, and women, to do her bidding, usually before she&#8217;s asked for anything. She&#8217;s every woman&#8217;s best friend and every man&#8217;s fantasy, and she&#8217;s the newest blog network for women.&#8221; I think Colleen Coplick (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/ColleenCoplick" target="_blank"><strong>@ColleenCoplick</strong></a>) pretty much captured everything I love about her in the above &#8212; becauseÂ  <strong><a href="http://www.missmanifesto.com" target="_blank">Miss Manifesto</a></strong> captures <em>her</em>.</p>
<p>If you want to indulge in some eye and mind candy, do give these ladies a gander.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/chefmark-felidia-lou.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1169" title="chefmark-felidia-lou" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/chefmark-felidia-lou-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>In his latest <a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/rp230-the-foods-of-basilicata/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ReMARKable Palate</strong></span></a> episode, Chef Mark recapped some of the delicious discoveries we made at a recent dinner at <a href="http://www.felidia-nyc.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Felidia</strong></span></a> highlighting the flavors of Basilicata, Italy, which lies between the Apennine mountains and Tyrrhenian Sea (or the &#8220;instep&#8221; of Italy&#8217;s boot). The event was hosted by Lidia Bastianich and our dear friend Lou DiPalo, whose ancestral roots can be found in Basilicata.</p>
<p>Lou&#8217;s son Sam was recognized as an ambassador to the region that evening, and it was delightful to see the pride on papa&#8217;s face as they both enjoyed that special moment. <a href="http://www.dipaloselects.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DiPalo&#8217;s</strong></span></a> (both the store in little Italy and the online store) features the products we tasted at this event should you find your mouth watering.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/lou-sam-dipalo.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>We would be remiss if we didn&#8217;t share images of the dishes from the menu, as the regional flavors came together at the hands of chefs Mario DeMuro, Rocco Cristiano Pozzulo and Francesca Rondinella to emphasize the beauty of simplicity. We were very taken with the dried Senise peppers (left side of photo below), which we were initially hesitant to bite into lest they be fiery hot. Much to our surprise, they had a delicious sweetness that would replace most snack foods for us. They were crunchy like a potato chip, but flavorful and sweet like a natural food should be.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/basilicata-table.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>Our first course featured a selection of Basilicata cheeses including Caciocavallo Silano DOP (one of my favorites) and Pecorino de Filiano DOP, served with regional honeys, preserves and olive oil. The orange blossom honey was my absolute favorite, with acacia following at a close second. The dish was accompanied by pickled eggplant slices that packed a tart punch, so our mouths were dancing before we reached the last forkful.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/Basilicata-cheeses.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>Next was a dish of comfort food at its finest. Rich yet surprisingly light, the cavatelli with Fagioli di Sarconi IGP, this flavorful bowl of goodness was perfect for a chilly winter&#8217;s night. Pasta e fagioli is a classic combination (&#8220;pasta fazool&#8221; for those who insist on using a dialect&#8230;sigh).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/cavatelli-sarconi.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>Our next pasta course highlighted those lovely dried Senise peppers, sprinkled over stracinati pasta with cacioricotta (a sheep&#8217;s milk cheese) and toasted breadcrumbs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/pasta-Senise-peppers.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>A surprise awaited us with the next dish. As it said &#8220;flan&#8221; on the menu I was expecting the typical flan texture as one might find in a dessert flan; this, however, was firm, composed of Canestrato di Moliterno DOP cheese and with flavors that mimicked the taste of the inside of a ravioli. Decadently rich, the flan&#8217;s accompaniments of tomato sauce and crispy fried basil leaf provided a lovely counterpoint to make for a dish that, for me, screamed Italy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/Basilicata-flan.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>I get a little bit excited about figs. Dessert had me writhing in my chair a little bit, as the honey dessert (described as a tart, but much more like a Madeleine texture) was served with a pistachio sauce and caramelized fig. I would trade chocolate and any other candy for these figs, and must now have them in my pantry. They would be perfection served with a light creamy accompaniment &#8212; even vanilla ice cream.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/Basilicata-dessert.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>Many thanks to the region of Basilicata, Lou DiPalo, Lidia Bastianich and Felidia for inviting us to be a part of this evening. As Lou DiPalo likes to say, Italy is a region of 20 different countries, and we are learning the unique components of each as we taste our way around the boot. There is never a dull flavor moment.</p>

		</div>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/honey.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1161" title="Dripping Honey" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/honey.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="337" /></a>I&#8217;ve just received the first set of menu ideas from the Roger Smith Hotel chefs for my <a href="http://sexonaplate.eventbrite.com" target="_blank"><strong>Sex on a Plate</strong></a> event, and as I review the flavor profiles, my mental mouth is hard at work to determine what I think will work, and what I might like to tweak. So I thought this was a good time to talk more in depth about this phrase to which I&#8217;m constantly referring.</p>
<p>When I talk about the &#8220;mental mouth,&#8221; I mean your little inner chef, who goes to work when you are hungry, or are planning a meal. He&#8217;s the one who calls to you when you&#8217;re craving something like honey-roasted figs stuffed with whipped blue cheese and pine nuts, or who takes stock of your fridge&#8217;s ingredients and says, &#8220;We&#8217;re having a Gruyere omelette with sauteed onions, a side salad with honey Dijon vinaigrette and grilled bread.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also the one who craves things at the most inconvenient times, like homemade Chinese dumplings at 2 AM. (Incidentally, my brother Phil, whose palate blows mine away, will get up and indulge that craving. His dumplings are some of the best I&#8217;ve ever tasted.)</p>
<p>That little inner chef is the keeper of food memories. The storer of flavor profiles.Â  The master of indulgences. And the more you exercise him &#8212; by tasting, exploring, sniffing, touching &#8212; the more skilled he becomes. After many years of training, I can now confidently open any fridge and plan a meal (except for Chef Mark&#8217;s, which has little to work with but bottles of foreign ingredients I can&#8217;t decipher). For example, if I see eggs, flour, cream and some vegetables, it&#8217;s time for pasta primavera accented with whatever herbs and spices I have to work with.</p>
<p>Sometimes the mental mouth can fool us. It can say &#8220;Yes! Try the abc with the xyz!&#8221; &#8212; and it&#8217;s a disaster. Sometimes it&#8217;s a win &#8212; think dark chocolate-dipped bacon.</p>
<p>The mental mouth is what has led us to evolve as a cooking and eating species. It has created the winning flavor combinations of lime, cilantro, chile and beef, or pasta, Pecorino Romano cheese, butter and truffle shavings. Someone had to take a risk &#8212; and we get to benefit. The more you taste, the more data you store in that inner chef&#8217;s recipe files, so when you stumble upon the perfect tomato he goes to work. Do you want to eat that juicy ruby with citrusy cilantro or spicy basil? With red onions or sweet white ones? Alone or with some bread?</p>
<p>As you develop his repertoire, you can then look at a dish named <em>Beef medallion with celery root puree, confit garlic foam and spiced port reduction</em> and give it a &#8220;Hell, yes.&#8221; Right now my inner chef is dancing in the combination of the delicate celery root and sweet garlic foam, knowing a little punch will come from the spicy reduction, all blending together perfectly with the richness of the beef. I can taste it <em>in my head</em>.</p>
<p>So if you want to develop your own little inner chef, start paying closer attention when you eat. See how the flavors play on your tongue, and your palate. Take note of what specifically you like about the flavor or texture. Do avocados make your tongue sing with their delicate, silky texture? Do you like the way noodles feel as they slide down your throat? Does the smell of fresh oregano make you swoon? The world is your laboratory. Go play.</p>
<p>And yes, I&#8217;m serving that beef dish at the event.</p>

After talking with Brian Franklin, I certainly have. Brian is the owner of <strong><a href="http://www.doubleshotcoffee.com" target="_blank">The Double Shot Coffee Company</a></strong> in Tulsa, OK, and he is roasting the best coffee that has ever touched my lips, bar none. He has changed my whole world.</p>
<p>In our chat we discuss everything from picking, roasting, grinding and brewing to why most of the commercial coffee you buy (including from that big chain) is burnt, and why those enticing-looking, oily beans are bad. Step into Brian&#8217;s world with me.</p>

<p>I see the mastering of lesser cuts of meat as the mark of a true cook. Let&#8217;s face it: Anyone can serve a decent filet mignon &#8212; there isn&#8217;t a whole lot of cooking involved. Given both the skyrocketing prices of food and the deep-seated need for me to master those lesser cuts, I have set out to master the art of braising. All-Clad was kind enough to send me a 6-quart saute pan to test from their new <strong><a href="http://www.allcladstainlessd5.com/" target="_blank">Stainless with d5 collection</a></strong>, so it is my new plaything (initial thoughts at the end of the post). I do love a pan that can go directly from stove top to oven, as it makes the cooking and cleaning easier.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-mise.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" title="shortribs-mise" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-mise.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>There is something inherently comforting about slow-cooked, caramelized beef, but it takes a bit of patience &#8212; not my strong suit. Nevertheless, I reminded myself ahead of time that such patience would result in a luscious dinner.</p>
<p>The last time I made beef-back ribs I used an ale and finished them on the stove top, and used a small soup pot. This time I decided to go with a lager and finish them in the oven in the All-Clad pan. In this case I used Foster&#8217;s, as it was the only beer I could find in a single serving, and one can does the whole batch.</p>
<p>The beauty of these ribs is that they are mighty cheap. I bought two packs (about 12 ribs) for a total of $3.00. These are not to be confused with short ribs, which have the meat on top of the bones. These have the meat in between the bones, and are much cheaper. Now, I might be braising these slightly differently from the way others do, but I look at recipes as a guide. Feel free to adapt, add different flavors, or whatever you like.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Caramelize the ribs.</strong><br />
This is the most critical part of the whole process, so don&#8217;t rush it. You want to really get some caramelization on these ribs before they are submerged in liquid, because it&#8217;s a major part of your flavor component. It will take about 20 minutes. Lightly coat the ribs with Kosher salt and a bit of pepper, get your pan really hot, add some olive oil, heat until it shimmers, and place your short ribs in the pan. Leave them alone.</p>
<p>While that&#8217;s happening, pre-heat your oven to 375 F. Resist the urge to move the meat around too much &#8212; let the magic happen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-uncooked.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1121 aligncenter" title="shortribs-uncooked" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-uncooked.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-caramelized.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1122" title="shortribs-caramelized" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-caramelized.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add onions &amp; garlic.</strong><br />
You can also add carrots here, but I forgot to grab one at the supermarket. It happens. Reduce your heat and add the onions and garlic. You may want to wait until the last few minutes to add the garlic because if it burns it will ruin the whole dish. I probably should have been a bit more patient here with the onions, but I added the garlic simultaneously and didn&#8217;t want to burn it. (This photo is before the onions had done their delicious sweating.)</p>
<p>Note: Some recipes call for removing the ribs, draining the fat from the pan, and starting with fresh oil to sweat the onions, garlic and other vegetables. I disagree, because in this case there wasn&#8217;t too much fat left, and I wanted the flavor.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-onions.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1123" title="shortribs-onions" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-onions.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add braising liquid, herbs &amp; spices.</strong><br />
I added a giant can of Foster&#8217;s, some of the <a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/rosemary-scented-hair">rosemary water</a> I made the other day (not just for hair!), some ground coriander and a hint of Chinese five spice. (Add whatever spices tickle your fancy. For whatever reason, my mental mouth liked these.) Stir the liquid and scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen all the yummy bits. These are also important for flavor.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-beer.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1124" title="shortribs-beer" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-beer.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Cover and place in a 375 F oven.</strong><br />
Now go away. For about 3 hours. You can check on the liquid periodically (I do so about every 30 minutes), but let the meat do its thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-oven.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1125" title="shortribs-oven" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-oven.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>When the ribs are finished, the liquid will have reduced considerably, and the meat will be falling off the bone. You shouldn&#8217;t need a knife to cut it apart. Note: This is when you should check the salt flavor in the dish. I tend to go easy on the salt in the beginning, because as the juice reduces the flavors become intensified, and too much salt will ruin it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-cooked.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1127" title="shortribs-cooked" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-cooked.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Serve over something starchy and delicious.</strong><br />
Some people serve these with potatoes or rice, but I am a huge fan of egg noodles. I like the way they slide over my tongue and slither down my throat. Once I remove the bones and there is nothing but meaty goodness, I like to slather this over a pile of noodles and lose myself in silky, meaty goodness.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-finished.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1126" title="shortribs-finished" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/shortribs-finished.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Verdict on the <a href="http://www.allcladstainlessd5.com/" target="_blank">All-Clad Stainless with d5</a> saute pan:</strong></p>
<p>My sentiments about cookware and sports cars are the same: I want sleek design and superior performance. This pan did not disappoint. All-Clad has incorporated some really smart design elements into this collection, including little touches that make for easier logistics, such as lid handles that can accommodate hands wearing oven mitts, cool handles on the pan should you forget said oven mitt (I have done so) and a pouring rim all the way around the edge. The pan is also quite light despite its enormous 6-qt. size.</p>
<p>Most important for me, however, is the even cooking across the surface of the pan. I had ribs inside and outside, and expected to have to move them around so the inner ones wouldn&#8217;t burn, but caramelization transpired in harmony for all the ribs. Glee.</p>
<p>Cleanup with this pan was also effortless, even with caramelized gooey goodness all over the pan and lid. I will be experimenting much more with this pan, so I&#8217;ll share further thoughts as they occur.</p>

Thanks to my darling <a href="http://www.cc-chapman.com/" target="_blank">C.C. Chapman</a>, I was pointed in the direction of one <a href="http://www.twitter.com/EmilysPearl" target="_blank">Emily Cavalier</a>, upon whom I&#8217;ve proceeded to develop a ridiculous girl-crush. I get so excited when I find people who &#8220;get&#8221; life the way I do, and her spirit is one that never ceases to bring a smile to my face. She&#8217;s frank, lusty, appreciates beauty, et elle parles francais comme moi.</p>
<p>Also? She smells really good.</p>
<p>Emily is determined to explore every inch of NYC&#8217;s ethnic foods, and I&#8217;ve become quite eager to follow her along the journey. She chronicles her adventures at <a href="http://www.mouthoftheborder.com" target="_blank">MouthoftheBorder.com</a>.</p>
<p>Aw hell, I don&#8217;t want to follow. I want to be there in real-time. She&#8217;s too purdy for me to miss that part.</p>

I&#8217;ve just finished the redesign on his site, <a href="http://www.honest-food.net" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hunter Angler Gardener Cook</strong></span></a>, and one of the job hazards was to be found in perusing his content whilst re-coding. But oh, the distraction of sausages.</p>
<p>While on this train of thought, I found his chanterelle soup and chortled. Yes, chortled, because he called it &#8220;sex in a bowl.&#8221; This is why I like Hank.</p>
<p>That, and he swears as much as I do, which makes for awesome phone calls. Here&#8217;s how he felt about the soup:</p>
<blockquote><p>Holy sweetÂ Jesus on the cross was this good!Â Â The flavor hammers you with chanterelleâ€™s beguiling flavor, backed with a whiff of saffron, the creamy mouthfeel of a classic veloute (stock whisked with a blond roux), and a slightly slutty wink from the dash of Armagnac I put in, all given added heft from a liaison of cream and egg yolks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sex in a bowl, indeed. <a href="http://www.honest-food.net/blog1/2009/08/31/chanterelles-and-the-sexiest-soup-ever/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Now get going</strong></span></a>.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1084" title="Rosemary Sprig" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/rosemary.jpg" alt="Rosemary Sprig" width="240" height="320" />I am a big proponent of smelling edible, and I&#8217;ve been experimenting with aromatics the past few months to find the scents that really kick my senses into overdrive. The <a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/everyday-indulgences-scent-suality"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>orange and vanilla essential oil</strong></span></a> I mentioned a few months ago has been worn to great effect not only for me, but to a person, the people I&#8217;ve met while wearing it.</p>
<p>Now that my hair is very long, it takes a bit more maintenance, and nothing looks worse than ratty long hair. I read that rosemary water is excellent for shine and a refreshing pick-me-up for the scalp, so off to the kitchen I went. I&#8217;m a fanatic for Aveda&#8217;s Rosemary Mint line of hair products, but as those are a bit pricey, I&#8217;m opting for this method to get the same scent fix. I didn&#8217;t have any mint handy (that WILL go in the next batch), so I just used fresh rosemary for this. UPDATE: I bought the mint. It was worth every penny.</p>
<p>The process is very simple: Boil a kettle of water and pour it over some fresh rosemary sprigsÂ  &amp; mint leaves into a bowl. Let it steep for about 20 minutes, drain and let it cool. Put it in a plastic container and you have a hair rinse. Use it after your shampoo and conditioner (no need to rinse), and style.</p>
<p>Yum.</p>
<p>Have fun sniffing yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I&#8217;ve read in various places that this rinse is best for <strong>dark hair</strong>. Chamomile is recommended for blondes.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1038" title="botanyofdesire" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/botanyofdesire.jpg" alt="botanyofdesire" />I finally got to sit down and watch the PBS documentary crafted from Michael Pollan&#8217;s book, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375760393?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gastronomicme-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0375760393">The Botany of Desire: A Plant&#8217;s-Eye View of the World</a></span><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=gastronomicme-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0375760393" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. Its metaphorical view is intriguing if you think about how well certain plants have succeeded in wooing us &#8212; some so thoroughly that they&#8217;ve been given a world tour and hero&#8217;s welcome.</p>
<p>One particular quip captured the idea succinctly, about how seemingly &#8220;useless&#8221; things of beauty, such as flowers, have captivated to a global marketplace to possess them &#8212; simply so their beauty can be enjoyed.</p>
<p>Principles of pleasure are hard-wired into our psyches as human beings. While some are disinclined to indulge such pleasures (which is fine &#8212; more for me), there is such joy to be had in savoring glimpses of beauty that tickle the senses, even just a bit. It changes my mood if I enter my home and see a beautiful bouquet of flowers in the foyer. And chances are that <em>I </em>put them there. Just because.</p>
<p>Things of beauty are never useless. Whether they are found in the bright orange of a Gerber daisy, the smell of baking bread or our lover&#8217;s cologne, they make us feel <em>alive</em>, and consciously aware of witnessing something to give us pause.</p>
<p>But we have to be paying attention.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been walking around in a haze, focused on work, work, work, or getting the kids to bed, or &#8220;getting it all done&#8221; (psst&#8230;you never will), you are missing out on those moments. But at the end of your life, you will not look back and be thankful that you &#8220;got it all done&#8221; (you won&#8217;t). You will look to things of beauty to remember the precious dotted points along the timeline of your life. The smile of your child. A romantic getaway. The perfect meal.</p>
<p>Make sure there are some dots, OK? Really big ones, if you can manage it.</p>

<p><em>When my friend Paul started talking about this pizza he prepared, I believe I may have dribbled on my shirt. Iâ€™m unsure because I was caught up in the rapture of my mental mouth at that moment. This combination of flavors is veritably sex on a plate.</em></p>
<p><em>This recipe has a lot of steps, but it is the perfect way to spend a snowy or chilly afternoon. </em></p>
<p><em><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1040" title="adair-whitepizza" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/adair-whitepizza.jpg" alt="adair-whitepizza" />Serves 4</em></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p><em>Recipes below for all of the following:</em><br />
Pizza dough<br />
Garlic olive oil<br />
Roasted cherry tomatoes<br />
Sauteed vegetables<br />
Sauteed shrimp</p>
<p>1/2 lb lumb crab meat , picked through and drained if packed in water<br />
2 c mozzarella cheese<br />
1/2 cup parmesan cheese, finely grated</p>
<p><strong>Special equipment</strong></p>
<p>15â€ round pizza stone</p>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<p><em>For the pizza dough:</em><br />
1 cup lukewarm water<br />
2 1/4 teaspoons active yeast<br />
1 teaspoon sugar<br />
2 1/2 cups white unbleached flour (don&#8217;t use whole wheat for this pizza)<br />
3/4 teaspoon salt<br />
2 tablespoons garlic olive oil</p>
<p>Proof yeast in water and sugar. Add remaining ingredients, stir with a fork and incorporate into a ball. Knead a couple times on floured surface (don&#8217;t over mix, as this is not a bread dough). Place in greased bowl, covered in warm place to rise until doubled, about 30-45 minutes.</p>
<p><em>For the garlic olive oil:</em><br />
2 &#8211; 3 cups olive oil<br />
1 head garlic peeled and sliced<br />
Place garlic into oil and simmer under med heat until the garlic starts to brown, about 20-30 minutes. Note: The garlic will boil and begin to settle before it starts to brown if at medium heat. Set aside and let cool. If the garlic continues to brown, remove it with a slotted spoon and set aside. Otherwise remove the garlic when oil is cool, and store oil in an air-tight container.</p>
<p><em>For the roasted tomatoes:</em><br />
12 oz cherry tomatoes<br />
1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar<br />
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt<br />
1/4 teaspoon pepper<br />
1 tablespoon garlic olive oil</p>
<p>Pre-heat the oven to 450 F.</p>
<p>Halve tomatoes and squeeze/scoop out seeds and pulp. Place on baking sheet, drizzle with garlic olive oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Roast 20-30 minutes until beginning to caramelize. Remove and cool on baking sheet.</p>
<p><em>For the sauteed vegetables:</em><br />
8 oz mushrooms, sliced<br />
8 oz asparagus, cut into 1/2-inch lengths<br />
1 tablespoon garlic olive oil<br />
2 tablespoon sherry<br />
1/2 teaspoon thyme, dried</p>
<p>Heat the olive oil in a large saute pan until shimmering. Saute mushrooms until water is released and evaporated. Add sherry, thyme, salt and pepper, and cook until most of the liquid is absorbed. Add asparagus and cook for 2 minutes (keep asparagus under-cooked). Remove from heat and set aside. Add roasted tomatoes and stir. Drain on paper towels if there is any excess liquid.</p>
<p><em>For the shrimp:</em><br />
1/2 lb shrimp, cleaned and deveined (cut up if large)<br />
1/2 teaspoon salt<br />
Pinch of pepper<br />
1 tablespoon garlic olive oil<br />
1 teaspoon Sriracha hot sauce (the one with the rooster â€” do NOT substitute)</p>
<p>Heat olive oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat. Add ingredients and saute shrimp until almost cooked (it will finish cooking in the oven). Drain on paper towels.</p>
<p><em>For the white sauce:</em><br />
2 tablespoons garlic olive oil<br />
1/4 cup unbleached flour<br />
1 cup milk (2% or higher)<br />
1/2 teaspoon salt<br />
1/4 teaspoon pepper</p>
<p>Heat olive oil in a small sauce pan over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add flour and whisk 1-2 minutes until the flour has mixed in and cooked to remove the raw taste. Add milk, increase heat slightly and whisk until thickened. Add salt and pepper, cover and set aside. Note: You may need to re-heat the sauce a bit before adding to the pizza.<br />
<em><br />
Assemble the pizza:</em><br />
Spread pizza dough onto the cold pizza stone, drizzle with garlic olive oil and bake for 8 minutes. Remove the dough from the oven, spread white sauce over the dough and top with veggie mixture. Sprinkle the crab and shrimp over the top. Cover with mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. Bake 15-20 minutes more until cheeses begin to brown.</p>
<p>Devour.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1045" title="twilight" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/twilight.jpg" alt="twilight" />Not the obvious one. Even the illegal immigrants from Jupiter have read, seen or heard about <em>Twilight</em>.</p>
<p>There have been volumes written about the mystique of Edward Cullen â€” why he makes women crazy in ways that perhaps no male, real or fictional, has done save for the blinding presence of Elvis Presley.</p>
<p>What woman wouldnâ€™t swoon at the thought of an old-fashioned romantic with good manners and diction? Or wouldnâ€™t want to be adored so fervently that her boyfriend watches her sleep because she fascinates him? Men roll their eyes when women gush about &#8220;my Edward.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Yes, we call him that.)</p>
<p>On the other side of the cemetery fence, there has been much psychologizing about the potential societal damage of idealizing an obsessed, over-protective, control freak of a boyfriend, and how that might skew the minds of young females in the wrong direction. There is merit in this argument, because when you look at it objectively, Edward and Bellaâ€™s relationship is a little bit creepy. â€¨â€¨But letâ€™s put that aside to get to the root of something very important, shall we?</p>
<p>Given my metier, I see Edward Cullen in a slightly different light, so to me, the secret of his appeal is quite simple, really:</p>
<p><strong>Bella is edible to him â€” <em>and he never lets her forget it</em>.</strong></p>
<p>I have advised many a female friend to smell delicious â€” so much so that a man cannot keep from nibbling on her neck. And given the neckâ€™s prominence as one of the most sensitive erogenous zones in the body, there is no wonder that vampires have such sensual appeal. But Edward takes it to a whole new level.â€¨â€¨ In Bellaâ€™s case, her scent is that perfect combination of pheromones and whatever else it is that attracts him helplessly to her. She is, quite literally, Edward&#8217;s <a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/category/sex-on-a-plate"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>sex on a plate</strong></span></a>.</p>
<p>But it is in the <em>way</em> he titillates them both with that knowledge, and keeps the meal itself just out of reach for both of them, that drives her (and me) mental with desire.</p>
<p>Edwardâ€™s moments of pure sensual indulgence leave me in a state of heady, wanton lust. As a vampire his senses are exponentially more potent, so I can only imagine what it must feel like for him to run his lips along the edge of her jaw, breathing in her bouquet as he gently caresses her neck and collarbones. He compares it to appreciating the aromatics of a fine wine.</p>
<p>I know it must be good for <em>her</em>, because the very notion leaves me breathless. But why is it so heady?</p>
<p>Because there is danger just on the other side of it. At any moment he could completely lose control and have her for lunch.</p>
<p>He drives them both just to the edge, then backs off, heightening the tension just a bit more each time. This is what any good lovemaking session â€” and any good meal â€” strives to achieve. Then the climax is, well, youâ€™ll have to read the books.</p>
<p>My point is that Edwardâ€™s deliciousness, at least in my eyes, is his ability to savor the pleasures of his senses, and to tease them in ways that make life with his beloved a delicious test of will. He figuratively, literally and in all other possible ways, wants to devour her. Believe me when I tell you that every woman wants that.</p>
<p>In the case of Edward it is a dangerous game, yes, but oh, the pleasure&#8230;</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1049" title="meatballs" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/meatballs.jpg" alt="meatballs" />Meatballs are so much more than food to me. They embody a big piece of my childhood, and dear loved ones whose memory I&#8217;m able to keep alive each time I make them. The moment preparation begins, I&#8217;m instantly transported to happy memories, and one ritual in particular.</p>
<p>My late brother Bob was an incredible cook, particularly when it came to Italian food. He spent so much time at the stove, his proclivities earned him the nickname &#8220;Meatball.&#8221; I spent many a Saturday or Sunday watching him at the stove, carefully rolling out each meatball, then rolling each again before it went into the oil. The smell would fill the house, beckoning me like a wanton lover.</p>
<p>When meatballs were on the menu I was never far away; this was a necessity, as I had to strike at the perfect moment. You might say I have a &#8220;thing&#8221; for meatballs, but with seven kids in the family, rations were pretty strict. I also like my meatballs without sauce, so if I wanted to sneak one, I had to do it between the time they came out of the frying pan and went into the pot of sauce. The moment my brother turned his back I would spring, grabbing a scorching hot meatball and running for the bathroom, where I would lock myself in and blow on the meatball to cool it and savor each second of its ambrosia-like qualities. Sometimes I was too hasty, and spent the next couple of days with a burnt tongue.</p>
<p>The batch I made today brought me to what I&#8217;m calling Meatball Nirvana. The texture and flavor were PERFECTION. Since many people have requested the recipe over the years, I thought it was time to share.</p>
<p>This recipe comes from my Gramma Crucciti (dad&#8217;s mother), and there are two important secrets: (1) you must use stale bread; and (2) you must not be squeamish. The only way to ensure the meatballs taste good is to sample the raw mix before it goes into the frying pan. You only need a little pinch to taste. The rest is easy, but a lot of the measuring needs to be done on-the-fly, as your taste preferences may differ from mine. Play with the recipe until you get the flavors where you want them.</p>
<p>Actually, there is a third secret: These must be made with love, and so much of it, it fills the kitchen. It improves the taste ten-fold.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>2 lbs chopped meat (no more than 80% lean &#8212; embrace the fat, it tastes good)<br />
Equal amount of stale Italian bread (approximately 1 1/2 large loaves for 2 lbs meat)<br />
1 egg<br />
1-2 cups Pecorino Romano cheese, finely grated, to taste<br />
2 cloves garlic, finely chopped or pressed<br />
1 Tbsp parsley, finely chopped</p>
<p>Vegetable oil for cooking</p>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Prepare the bread:</em><br />
Soak the stale bread in a large bowl of water until the bread is completely soft. Break the bread apart in large chunks, removing the crust. Squeeze each chunk with your hands to get as much of the water out as possible and set aside on a plate.</p>
<p><em>[Chef's Notes: It is important that you have a 1:1 ratio of bread to chopped meat to achieve the proper texture. Please do not substitute bread crumbs for the squeezed bread, as you will get nowhere near the same results in texture.]</em></p>
<p><em>Prepare the meatball mix:</em><br />
Add the bread to the chopped meat and mix together by hand, squeezing to ensure an even distribution of bread throughout. Add 1 cup of the Pecorino Romano, then the remaining ingredients and mix my hand. Taste a pinch of the mixture to see if the flavors are to your taste. Add more cheese if necessary.</p>
<p><em>Roll the meatballs:<br />
</em>Using a spoon or your fingers, take a scoop of the mixture and roll it between your palms to form the meatball. (The size is entirely up to you, but a soup spoon usually makes a good guide.) Place the raw meatballs on a large platter in a single layer.</p>
<p><em>Fry the meatballs:</em><br />
Half-fill a large saute or cast-iron pan with vegetable oil. Heat under high heat until the oil shimmers. Carefully add the meatballs, re-rolling them if they have fallen out of shape. Fry until a solid brown crust has formed on the bottom half of the meatballs, about 4 minutes, then flip over with a metal slotted spoon. Cook for another 4 minutes. (You can remove one and cut it in half at this point to make sure it&#8217;s fully cooked.) Remove to a plate or bowl lined with paper towels to drain the grease.</p>
<p><em>[Chef's Notes: You can also use a deep-fryer to make these, but you must be careful to load the basket in a single layer at a time or the meatballs will stick together.</em></p>
<p><em>You might be inclined to use olive oil for cooking the meatballs, but I don't recommend it. It imparts an additional layer of flavor that is not necessarily ideal, and doesn't play well at high temperatures.]</em></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve made a pot of sauce (I&#8217;ll save that for another recipe), add the meatballs to the sauce and mangia!</p>

		</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">Twas the night before Christmas, and Jennifer freaked out.<br />
In the middle of cooking, her power went out.<br />
With dozens of guests already en route,<br />
Her feckless attempt at a meal was moot.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She went through her iPhone, Twitter and spam,<br />
Surely someone could spare a ham.<br />
But who would be cooking? That was the key.<br />
With a gasp she knew, and called <strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/cc_chapman" target="_blank">C.C.</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">â€œCode Blue in the kitchen!â€ she frantically said.<br />
â€œIf I donâ€™t come up with a meal, Iâ€™m dead!â€<br />
â€œDonâ€™t worry,â€ said C.C. â€œIâ€™ve got a good vibe,<br />
Let me call <strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/chrisbrogan" target="_blank">Brogan</a></strong> and rally the tribe.â€</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Together they tweeted, and asked and plead,<br />
For able cooks to come load up the sled.<br />
<strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/julien" target="_blank">Julien</a></strong> arrived with tiramisu,<br />
And <strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/cspenn" target="_blank">Chris Penn</a></strong> added a bottle or two.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">From near and far, the dishes arrived,<br />
From soup to mashed potatoes with chives.<br />
â€œWeâ€™d better get going,â€ said C.C. with haste,<br />
â€œThe sledâ€™s almost full, and weâ€™ve no time to waste.â€</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">â€œWhat about <strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/ysnjen" target="_blank">Jen</a></strong> in L.A.?â€ said Chris,<br />
â€œIf we donâ€™t stop by her house, sheâ€™ll be pissed.â€<br />
Quickly they fled to the leftward coast.<br />
They had to hurry â€” this was cutting it close.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">â€œThank heaven youâ€™re here!â€ said the bubbly Miss Jen.<br />
â€œI heard the alert, and prepared a hen.<br />
And <strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/kcline" target="_blank">Kelly Cline</a></strong> dropped by â€” call it fate,<br />
But hereâ€™s a whole platter of sex on a plate.â€</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Meanwhile, back home, Jennifer knew<br />
She needed a space to welcome her crew.<br />
She called dear <strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/BSimi" target="_blank">Brian</a></strong> at the <strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/RSHotel" target="_blank">Roger Smith</a></strong>,<br />
â€œDo you guys have room, or is that just a myth?â€</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thankfully, <strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/ChefMark" target="_blank">Chef Mark</a></strong> called ahead,<br />
So he and <strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/ChazFrench" target="_blank">Chaz</a></strong> set up for the spread.<br />
<strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/MadelineSho" target="_blank">Madeline</a></strong> arrived with cocktails in hand,<br />
And <strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/SusanDickman" target="_blank">Susan</a></strong> showed up with a five-piece band.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">With panic, Jennifer eyed the clock.<br />
Where were the boys â€” and what was in stock?<br />
She ran to the roof to wait for them there,<br />
Hoping thereâ€™d be enough food to share.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Like a beacon of hope the sled appeared<br />
With C.C. and Chris â€” and a few reindeer.<br />
â€œI told you weâ€™d make it!â€ said C.C. with glee.<br />
â€œYou have to believe in friendship, you see.â€</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">â€œNever doubt a crowd,â€ said Chris,<br />
â€œWho believes in eating as well as this.<br />
â€œThereâ€™s turkey and bread, and roast beef too,<br />
But I did take a bite of the tiramisu.â€</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">With a laugh, she gave them both a squeeze.<br />
â€œLetâ€™s get this inside before we freeze.â€<br />
As far as her eye could see, there were treats<br />
To bring to life her Christmas feast.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">As Chef Mark and crew laid out the spread,<br />
Jennifer cleared the thoughts in her head.<br />
She knew it was time for a special toast,<br />
To celebrate friends who mattered the most.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">She knew Chris and C.C. had to run,<br />
To join their own families for holiday fun.<br />
So when each guest had taken a seat,<br />
She clinked her glass and rose to her feet:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">â€œTo my friends,â€ she began with a raise of her glass,<br />
â€œWithout whom Iâ€™d be out on my ass,<br />
I thank you for showing me all through this year<br />
That friendships like yours make life more dear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Through struggles and triumphs I never forgot<br />
That help was right there when my gusto was shot.<br />
My comrades in arms, this toast is true,<br />
From a heart so filled with love, <strong>thank you</strong>!â€</p>

				<img src="http://api.tweetmeme.com/imagebutton.gif?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoodphilosophy.com%2Ffoie-gras-making-informed-choices%2F&amp;source=foodphilosophy&amp;style=normal&amp;service=bit.ly&amp;b=2" height="61" width="50" /><br />

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1051" title="foie-plat" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/foie-plat.jpg" alt="foie-plat" />This past February, an article came out in the Village Voice about foie gras (<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-02-18/news/is-foie-gras-torture/" target="_blank">Is Foie Gras Torture?</a></strong></span></em>), and whether or not ducks are being tortured to produce this delicacy. The debate has raged on for years, which sparked my initial rant in <em><a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/the-duck-stops-here/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Duck Stops Here</strong></span></a></em>. What I think author Sarah DiGregorio brings to light with this piece, however, is something that applies universally to food, and in my opinion, is a method we should all use: Know where your food comes from. Know how it&#8217;s produced. One of the leading doctors raging against the foie gras machine has never actually set foot on a foie gras farm; she simply perpetuates the propaganda from assumptions.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever watched a PETA video, of course the images are disturbing. That&#8217;s their purpose. PETA is going to sensationalize whatever they find in order to make a good video, because they have a very specific intent: They want you to stop eating animals altogether. And that is their prerogative, but when they are harassing members of the public (and their children!) they become their own terrorist force. Bricks have been thrown into restaurant windows, and patrons have been harassed on their way in the door. And you all know about the pies that get thrown. Are they following the equation that two wrongs make a right? How is that going to help, exactly?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve met many artisanal farmers over the years, and to a person they care passionately about their work, their livestock, and for raising them in a humane way. In the end, it makes the food taste better. A stressed out cow or duck is going to have some very tough meat for you to chew, so it is in the farmer&#8217;s best interest to keep his livestock calm and happy.</p>
<p>Hudson Valley Foie Gras seems no different. I&#8217;ve talked to Marcus Henley, the farm&#8217;s manager, numerous times over the past few years, and he has invited me to come see for myself. I haven&#8217;t yet had the time to do so, but I will get there, because I want to know where <em>all</em> my food comes from. I&#8217;ve done the same with heirloom tomatoes, cows and pigs. I invite you to do the same.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this issue?</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t know about you, but we&#8217;d rather avoid the mall this time of year. It&#8217;s simply not in our natures to stand in line at 6AM (unless it&#8217;s for something fabulous at the farmer&#8217;s market).</p>
<p>In case you feel that way, too, we&#8217;re doing something special for this year&#8217;s &#8220;Cyber Monday&#8221; sale day in the <a href="https://shop.gildedfork.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gilded Fork Gourmet Boutique</strong></span></a>, so we invite you to peruse our offers below. Then we can all stay at home and revel in Thanksgiving leftovers and pajamas while everyone else does that standing-in-line thing.</p>
<p>Besides, we have a new venture to unveil in December, so the more time we can spend at the computer in pj&#8217;s, the faster we can share it with you! Happy holidays!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.gildedfork.com/cp-app.cgi?usr=51J1041097&amp;rnd=4888582&amp;rrc=N&amp;affl=&amp;cip=&amp;act=&amp;aff=&amp;pg=prod&amp;ref=bakedge&amp;cat=BAKEWARE&amp;catstr="><img style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/edgebakingpan.png" border="1" alt="" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="250" height="202" align="right" /></a><strong>Living on the Edge&#8230;of Brownies</strong></p>
<p>Is there a brownie lover in your life? One who fights for the ones from the edge of the pan? Inventor Matt Griffin understands those eager souls, and specifically designed his Edge Brownie Pan to deliver an entire batch of perfectly crisp edges and gooey centers. Matt&#8217;s pan has been featured on Martha Stewart&#8217;s daytime show and in just about every major food magazine on the planet, so this is a hot little item. At a price of $35, it&#8217;s also perfect for a smaller budget.</p>
<p><strong>We have a limited number of Edge Brownie Pans available, and are offering free ground shipping for orders placed by midnight EST on Monday, November 30. (Cannot be combined with other discounts.)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.gildedfork.com/cp-app.cgi?usr=51J1041097&amp;rnd=4888582&amp;rrc=N&amp;affl=&amp;cip=&amp;act=&amp;aff=&amp;pg=prod&amp;ref=bakedge&amp;cat=BAKEWARE&amp;catstr="><strong>&gt; Order here!</strong></a></p>

Other Gift Ideas &amp; Tips</strong></p>

These bottles of liquid heaven can stand on their own as a lovely gift &#8212; just wrap them wine-bottle style in some pretty paper, decorate with bows and present them to dear friends.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to make your Tondo bottles part of a gourmet gift basket, we suggest featuring a bottle of Tondo as the &#8220;star,&#8221; then adding a few inexpensive items like cheeses and some elegant crackers. We can&#8217;t think of a palate that would be disappointed.</p>

<p><img class="alignright" title="pulpo" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/pulpo.jpg" alt="pulpo" />My tasting tour of Rias Baixas led to a wonderful discovery: The female winemakers in this region have made an indelible impression upon the quality of the wines and the respect AlbariÃ±o grapes have earned internationally.</p>
<p>I spent an afternoon at Pazo de SeÃ±orÃ¡ns with Marisol Bueno, one of the founders of the AlbariÃ±o D.O., along with her daughter Vicky and their team to learn the history behind the creation of the appellation. Like many of the smaller wine regions around the world, Marisol wanted to showcase the grapes inherent to Rias Baixas, taking advantage of the terroir of Galicia and its unique qualities to craft what has become one of my favorite wines.</p>
<p>Winemakers often become philosophical about the &#8220;struggle of the grapes&#8221; and how it lends character to their flavor profile. In Galicia the grapes do indeed face difficult conditions, as the climate is consistently moist, presenting the ever-present danger of mildew. AlbariÃ±o grapes must be coaxed to grow in a manner that enables sunlight to penetrate the vines and keep them dry, which winery manager Javier Izurieta Romero explains in detail in the following video.</p>

				<img src="http://api.tweetmeme.com/imagebutton.gif?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoodphilosophy.com%2Ffood-vs-sex%2F&amp;source=foodphilosophy&amp;style=normal&amp;service=bit.ly&amp;b=2" height="61" width="50" /><br />

<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/fgs.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="240" />I&#8217;m seeing lots of discussions lately about the connections between food and sex, and I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s simply because I&#8217;m more focused on the subject than ever before, or because others are thinking about it a lot, too. Perhaps both. The question that has my attention right now is whether or not <a href="http://www.blogher.com/food-new-sex" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>food has started to replace sex</strong></span></a> as a means of evoking and pleasing the senses.</p>
<p>Pardon me while I pull myself back together.</p>
<p>The author of the article, my new pal <a href="http://twitter.com/avflox" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>AV Flox</strong></span></a>, suggested that perhaps foodie culture is a result of sexual dissatisfaction. Thankfully she insists on bringing the magic back to sex, which is one of the reasons I like her very, very much. I also think she&#8217;s on to something.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve read any of my posts over the last 5 years (and hey, I hope you&#8217;ve read one or two), then you know that I see food and sex as companions happily intertwined on the journey of the senses. In complementary fashion, they appeal to our deepest pleasure points, arousing, sustaining and nourishing the most important parts of ourselves. Sadly, given the generally prudish nature of American culture, and an overstressed population that tends to operate in a state of blithe self-oblivion, the roots of sensuality and sexual pleasure have been relegated to too many secret conversations, private thoughts and therapy sessions. Instead, we watch reality TV and wonder why we feel dissatisfied.</p>
<p><a href="http://newyork.grubstreet.com/2009/06/are_foodies_still_having_sex.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gael Greene</strong></span></a> thinks lust has headed completely toward the kitchen &#8212; and if she&#8217;s right, this is good news, at least in my opinion.</p>
<p>When I see a person who enjoys fondling vegetables while shopping, or who can appreciate the subtleties of flavor components, I know there is potential (if expertise has not already been achieved) in the bedroom. Sensual pleasure in all its forms is rooted in our philosophy &#8212; in our outlook on life itself. In the anthology <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFood-Philosophy-Eat-Think-Merry%2Fdp%2F1405157755%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1205737237%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=gastronomicme-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><em>Food &amp; Philosophy: Eat, Think &amp; Be Merry</em></strong></span></a> I contributed an essay called <em>Food and Sensuality: A Perfect Pairing </em>comparing bad cooking shows to cheap porn. Momentary thrill, not much left afterward. There is a deeper meaning to all of it, and greater heights to be reached when we can clear our minds of clutter, quick thrills and petty, everyday concerns to get to the good stuff. There is so much good stuff.</p>
<p>There are many blog posts to come on this subject, but I&#8217;m thinking aloud with you as I go, and would love your input. Has food replaced sex for you, or enhanced it? Has playing with food awakened something in you sensually?</p>

				<img src="http://api.tweetmeme.com/imagebutton.gif?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoodphilosophy.com%2Ftech-tools-and-holiday-entertaining%2F&amp;source=foodphilosophy&amp;style=normal&amp;service=bit.ly&amp;b=2" height="61" width="50" /><br />

		</div>
<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/autumnbounty.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="202" />We knew it was coming. In October it seemed far off in the distance, so we put it out of our minds. Now we look at the calendar and start to freak out inside&#8230;just a little bit.</p>
<p>The holiday season is upon us, so it&#8217;s time to get organized for the revelry ahead. Given that a normal holiday gathering with my immediate family means 20-25 guests, we&#8217;ve got this thing down to a science. We also have an industrial meat slicer, so I realize that we are a bit&#8230;unusual. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t pull this off, too.</p>
<p>I joined <a href="http://www.wsradio.com/internet-talk-radio.cfm/shows/Computer-and-Technology-Radio.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Marsha Collier and Mark Cohen</strong></span></a> on KTRB Radio in San Francisco today to talk about tech tools to help manage the chaos, and wanted to give you an expanded list here as a handy reference tool.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Planning:</strong></span><br />
You&#8217;ve heard me say it before, but a little Type A goes a long way. Get it out of your head and on to paper (or your PDA/iPhone/latest gadget). We&#8217;ve created a whole section on <a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/entertaining" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Culinary Media Network</strong></span></a> to help you get started, from the number of guests to the style of your party.</p>
<p>I also discovered an amazing planning resource whose bells and whistles go far deeper than I imagined. You&#8217;ve likely received an invitation from <a href="http://www.evite.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>eVite</strong></span></a>&#8230;but did you know what else is under the hood? Their tools enable everything from managing your guest list to creating a detailed timeline and checklist. They even have decor suggestions.</p>
<p><em><strong>Calendar:<br />
</strong></em>Set up a <a href="http://calendar.google.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Google calendar</strong></span></a> for yourself with the title &#8220;Thanksgiving&#8221; or &#8220;Holidays,&#8221; and you can have e-mail reminders sent right to your inbox each day. You can also sync it to your other calendars so your tasks are like any other items on your to-do list. There are lots of tools online for this, so choose the one you like best, preferably one that is already part of your routine. If your form of organization and planning includes Post-It notes all over your desk, hey, I won&#8217;t judge.</p>
<p><em><strong>Menu:</strong></em><br />
If you need menu ideas, there is no shortage of resources online for finding recipes, from our <a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/recipe-list/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>full recipe list</strong></span></a> to sites like <a href="http://allrecipes.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>allrecipes</strong></span></a> and <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Epicurious</strong></span></a>. If you would rather have a book in your hands, there is still time to order <a href="http://bit.ly/GFCookbook" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Gilded Fork: Entertaining at Home</strong></span></a> to have at your disposal for menu ideas.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shopping</strong></span></p>
<p><em><strong>Ingredients:<br />
</strong></em>Believe it or not, I don&#8217;t particularly enjoy grocery shopping, particularly if I&#8217;m feeling rushed. Thankfully there are now plenty of online delivery services to take care of that piece for you. The downside? If you like fondling your vegetables (the part I actually enjoy), the control freak in you will have to let go and accept that someone else will be picking out your potatoes. If you&#8217;re on the east coast or in Chicago, check out <a href="http://www.peapod.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PeaPod</strong></span></a> (or your local supermarket&#8217;s web site). West coasters can take a look at <a href="http://www.safeway.com/IFL/Grocery/Thanksgiving#iframetop" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Safeway</strong></span></a>, which has created a whole Thanksgiving section just for you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Turkeys:</strong></em><br />
I&#8217;m not a big fan of the frozen bowling balls known as supermarket turkeys, but use them when necessary. If you prefer something a little tastier, here are some options:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.dartagnan.com/51349/565702/Turkey--Goose/Certified-Organic-Free--Range-Turkey.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>D&#8217;Artagnan</strong></span></a>: Gorgeous fresh or frozen turkeys that are delivered to your door, with 14-16 lb frozen turkeys for $65.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lobels.com/store/main/item.asp?item=458" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lobels</strong></span></a>: An NYC staple for Thanksgiving, they ship fresh organic and free-range turkeys for $75 and up</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Wine</strong></em>:<br />
Now this is a favorite, and not just because it was started by some friends of mine. Called the &#8220;Netflix of wine,&#8221; <a href="http://www.wineq.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WineQ</strong></span></a> is a wine-delivery service that lets you queue up your favorites, start your own wine club, and discover what your friends are drinking.</p>
<p><em><strong>Hostess Gifts:</strong></em><br />
If you are the lucky recipient of an invitation to a holiday party, please remember good etiquette and bring along a gift for your host. He or she is working very hard to entertain you, so a little reward is in order.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got some lovely gift ideas in the <a href="https://shop.gildedfork.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gilded Fork Boutique</strong></span></a>, especially our Tondo flavored vinegars, so you can peruse gift options there, or at some other favorites including <a href="http://www.deandeluca.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dean &amp; Deluca</strong></span></a>, <a href="http://www.harryanddavid.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Harry and David</strong></span></a>, or <a href="http://www.igourmet.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>iGourmet</strong></span></a>.</p>
<p>If you want to dress *yourself* up a little, take a look at what <a href="http://www.thehiphostessdish.blogspot.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Hip Hostess</strong></span></a> has on display. She also features some gorgeous home decor finds.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But What If I Can&#8217;t Cook?!</strong></span><br />
Ah, the age-old dilemma. Guess what? There are solutions for that, too. Now, you could make a restaurant reservation, but I&#8217;m a huge proponent of welcoming people into my actual home for the holidays. The good news is that we have an entire country full of personal chefs, and you can find them all on the <a href="http://www.uspca.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>U.S. Personal Chef Association</strong></span></a> web site. Chef Mark is right here in NYC, so don&#8217;t forget to see his offerings at <a href="http://www.remarkablepalate.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ReMARKablePalate.com</strong></span></a>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, remember to take deep breaths and not to panic. Worst-case scenario, open another bottle of wine and pour some more cocktails. It will all be just fine.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1053" title="brand-choc" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/brand-choc.jpg" alt="brand-choc" />It&#8217;s been an intriguing few weeks.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.blogworldexpo.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BlogWorldExpo</span></a> in Las Vegas, I found myself being introduced in the following manner: <em>I&#8217;d like you to meet Jennifer. She does &#8220;Sex on a Plate.&#8221;</em> To my pleasant surprise, many people already knew about it &#8212; or wanted to. <a href="http://www.twitter.com/MarshaCollier" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Marsha Collier</span></a> and I talked about it on her <a href="http://www.wsradio.com/internet-talk-radio.cfm/shows/Computer-and-Technology-Radio/archives/date/selected/10-17-2009.html" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">radio show for KTRB in San Francisco</span></a>, and 4 million more people were let in on the secret. I loved that.</p>
<p>I then spent a few days with <a href="http://www.kclinephotography.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kelly Cline</span></a>, the early inspiration for turning my blog into something more. I am drawn to her food photography like a bee to honey, as she is the only person on earth who can see inside my mind and bring my thoughts to visual, four-color reality. We&#8217;ve had a magnificent five years of collaboration, and I&#8217;m coming away from my time with her newly inspired. It also turns out she takes more than good food photos&#8230;but more on that another time.</p>
<p>Kelly and I breathe a tandem rhythm of sensual stimulation, but we  don&#8217;t want to be the only two in on the melody &#8212; and it looks like many of you feel the same way.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jenniferiannolo" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Facebook</span></a>, in e-mail and at events,  people are asking me what it all means. <em>So what kind of food should I eat? What dish gets you really hot?</em> But that, my friends, is the result, not the cause. Let me explain a bit.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/images/midnightbath.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="376" />On <a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/fp87-from-las-vegas-to-the-cotswolds"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Food Philosophy #87</span></a> I talked about experiencing <em><a href="http://www.zumanity.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Zumanity, the Sensual Side of Cirque du Soleil</span></a></em>. I&#8217;m eternally grateful to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/JessBerlin" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jess Berlin</span></a> for offering me a ticket, because seeing the show brought all my recent thoughts together in a flash of inspiration. <em>Zumanity</em> artfully and powerfully evokes the sensual desires in our minds &#8212; even the ones we hide in the light of day &#8212; and strikes a chord so deep it&#8217;s impossible to leave the theater without an overwhelming need to satiate them. Whether we shiver at the sight of light blue silk rippling in the breeze, or feel a rush of desire at the crack of a whip, something in that show triggers our senses until the hunger in the room is palpable. Every body shape, every sexual preference &#8212; <em>every fantasy</em> &#8212; is captured on stage, drenched in perfect lighting and pulsating rhythms.</p>
<p>I found myself in such a heightened state of sensory indulgence, I actually purred. Out loud.</p>
<p>After walking out of the theater I realized that if the world could step inside my head in that moment, they would get the idea of <a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/sex-on-a-plate"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sex on a Plate</span></a> at its core. It&#8217;s not the food, you see, though that is a magnificent component of the satiety; it is what I&#8217;ve awakened inside that enables me to feel that kind of passionate arousal in such a moment, and see the world exploding with color and texture all around me. Imagine feeling like that on a regular basis. Oh yes.</p>
<p>The good news is that I&#8217;m not an anomaly &#8212; I&#8217;ve worked to get my senses to this place, but there are lots of you out there, even if you don&#8217;t know it yet. I&#8217;ve discovered that some of you took my <a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/5-tips-to-heighten-the-senses"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">tips</span></a> to heart in getting started, and  are beginning to see food in a whole different way. That excites me. Some of you have taken the tips into the bedroom. That excites me more.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t yet started on the road toward Eden, I&#8217;m putting out a personal challenge to you, because it&#8217;s no fun here with just a few of us: Do something today to satiate your senses. Take a few extra seconds when you nibble that bite of chocolate, and feel its silkiness as it melts on your tongue. Run a finger down your lover&#8217;s spine. Drink in a moment of beauty, whether it&#8217;s a perfect flower or an exquisite woman.</p>
<p>Do this and you will soon be rewarded in the Garden, because things are in motion to bring Sex on a Plate to life, off the digitized page and right in front of you. Do you want your senses to be tickled? Titillated?</p>
<p>If the answer is yes &#8212; and I hope it is &#8212; I&#8217;ll need you to prepare.</p>

I&#8217;m also continuing my <a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/category/sex-on-a-plate"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sex on a Plate</strong></span></a> adventures, so please do join me for a little stimulating conversation.</p>
<p>Among other things, I was invited to see <a href="http://www.zumanity.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Zumanity</strong></span></a> in Las Vegas &#8212; the sensual side of Cirque du Soleil. Suffice it to say, the show&#8217;s sumptuous, erotic display gave me much inspiration for what is ahead. Today&#8217;s show also features interviews with Sally Jarrett from Prince Charles&#8217; <a href="http://www.highgroveshop.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Highgrove shop</strong></span></a> and Chef Shane Kisby from <a href="http://www.theprioryinn.co.uk/home/homepage.asp" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Priory Inn</strong></span></a>, both in Tetbury, England.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/sitegraphics/fp-itunes.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" />I&#8217;m also sharing a little love for my dear friends <a href="http://www.cc-chapman.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>C.C.

<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/ph-view.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />When I decided to go to <a href="http://www.blogworldexpo.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BlogWorld &amp; New Media Expo</strong></span></a> this year, I had one of those double-edged sword moments. I couldn&#8217;t wait to see old friends and make new ones &#8212; but ugh, Las Vegas. It&#8217;s the one town I try to avoid, because it just isn&#8217;t for me. My kind of gambling involves business risk, so I am maddened by the &#8220;ding-ding-ding&#8221; when I walk through casino mazes designed to keep you trapped inside when you just want daylight.</p>
<p>This trip, thankfully, was a bit different. <a href="http://www.planethollywoodresort.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Planet Hollywood Resort</strong></span></a> invited me to stay as their guest during my trip, and as  I&#8217;d never been to their hotel, I accepted with  an open mind (and braced myself for the &#8220;ding&#8221;-ing).</p>
<p>Guess what? Unlike many of the other hotel casinos in Las Vegas, this one is far better suited to my taste, with a sleek, modern design &#8212; thank you, designer gods. It actually looks more like a hotel that happens to have a casino, so I didn&#8217;t feel overwhelmed every time I walked through the door. This was a very good thing.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/koi-bakedlobster.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />I know a lot of people who travel to  Vegas for business, and they often find the bells-and-whistles setting to be too much. I found that at Planet Hollywood, I could at least tune it when I wanted to.  There&#8217;s still room for lots of fun, certainly (some of which I witnessed from the upstairs balcony), and the attached mall is massive, but you can also be zen-like and flake out at the spa. I really wish I&#8217;d had time to fit that in; however my room overlooked the dancing Bellagio fountains, so I at least got a bit of eye-candy between BlogWorld events and sessions.</p>
<p>The only thing I really missed was a bathrobe in my room. I realize that all hotels in Las Vegas are designed to keep you out of that room and in the casino, but I really craved a robe for those rare moments of downtime. Now that Las Vegas has become as much a business destination as a party one, I&#8217;ll be interested to see how the formula changes over time.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I left Las Vegas a happy camper this time, and enjoyed my stay even more than I expected to. Of course, part of the journey involved food (like it ever wouldn&#8217;t).  I was a guest for a tasting dinner at <a href="http://www.planethollywoodresort.com/din_koi.php" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Koi restaurant</strong></span></a> inside Planet Hollywood, which also happened to be the locale of my pal Jen Kushell&#8217;s first foodgasm. This was intriguing.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/koi-lycheemartini.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />The setting for our meal was a sumptuous table set with velvet couches overlooking those dancing Bellagio fountains. After more than a few lychee martinis (well, they go down easy), course after course appeared with sushi, spicy tuna on papadums, baked lobster on crispy rice (seen above &#8211; the Kushell foodgasm dish), sexy mashed potatoes and other sultry creations. Color me satisfied. You can see all of the dishes in my Facebook album of our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=153067&amp;id=625869702&amp;l=aaa53d0293" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Koi tasting</strong></span></a>.</p>
<p>I also had great company, which always makes a difference at dinner: <a href="http://www.ysn.com" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Jennifer Kushell</strong></span></a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/ysnjen" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>@ysnjen</strong></span></a>), <a href="http://rohitbhargava.typepad.com/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rohit Bhargava</strong></span></a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/rohitbhargava" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>@rohitbhargava</strong></span></a>), Tiffany Monhollon Wilson (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/tmonhollon" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>@tmonhollon</strong></span></a>) and <a href="http://www.remarkablepalate.com/blog" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chef Mark</strong></span></a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/ChefMark" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>@ChefMark</strong></span></a>).</p>
<p>Many thanks to Brandie Feuer at Planet Hollywood (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/phvegas" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>@phvegas</strong></span></a>) and BlogWorld party-man extraordinaire Joe Morin (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/josephmorin" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>@josephmorin</strong></span></a>) for making my stay a memorable one!</p>

<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/sweet-potatoes.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="337" />Sometimes one really needs a carb fix, but plain old French fries just aren&#8217;t enough. I&#8217;ve grown bored with potatoes, but there are times when I love &#8212; nay, need &#8212;  a good crunchy starch with my dinner. I&#8217;ve been experimenting with a variety of different ones to keep my palate enthused, and two of my regular favorites are sweet potato fries and yucca fries (thank you, Peru!).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sweet Potato Fries</strong></span><br />
These couldn&#8217;t be easier to make. Preheat the oven to 400 F. Peel a sweet potato, cut into fry-size strips, then toss with some olive oil, salt and freshly chopped rosemary. Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes or until they brown to your liking.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Yucca Fries</strong></span><br />
These take a bit more  preparation, but gawd are they worth it. Yucca has substance &#8212; potato-esque, but with the slightest hint of butteriness. I also love how it looks like Camembert when you slice it open, but that&#8217;s just me. I found a great recipe for baked ones (complete with pictures) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://innocentprimate.wordpress.com/2008/12/30/baked-yucca-fries/" target="_blank">here</a></strong></span>.</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1073" title="spawater" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/spawater.jpg" alt="spawater" />After a trip through Peru that was pretty taxing on my body, I needed something to bring my body back into balance and ready myself for the daily grind. Since spa treatments are definitely not in my budget right now, I wanted the next best thing, so I decided to create a home spa treatment day for myself. I used ingredients and items I had on-hand to bring it to life, and ended the day feeling relaxed and refreshed.</p>
<p>You can obviously vary this to suit your own tastes, but here&#8217;s a general list of what I do to set things up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw the blinds and light candles around the house</li>
<li>Put on soothing music (my favorite for this is a Reiki music CD)</li>
<li>Draw a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/everyday-indulgences-lavender-oil-epsom-salt-bath">lavender bath</a></strong></span> that will fill the house with a soothing scent</li>
<li>Lay out all the tools for a mani-pedi</li>
<li>Dig out my soft, fluffy bath robe</li>
</ul>
<p>From there, the schedule is mine to craft. I&#8217;ll usually start with a soak in the tub, then slather my body in a soothing lotion &#8212; my favorite is Burt&#8217;s Bees Milk &amp; Honey. (Note: You can find Burt&#8217;s Bees at significant savings at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.vitacost.com/productResults.aspx?ss=1&amp;Ntk=products&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;Ntt=Burt%27s%20Bees" target="_blank">Vitacost.com</a></strong></span>. They didn&#8217;t pay me to say that.) I use an <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/everyday-indulgences-olive-oil-facial-scrub"><strong>olive oil and sugar scrub</strong></a></span> on my face to exfoliate and deeply moisturize, and mani-pedi time follows, along with a nice hot cup of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/honeyed-chai-tea/" target="_blank"><strong>Honeyed Chai Tea</strong></a><strong></strong></span>.</p>
<p>If you are fortunate enough to find yourself home alone for more than a few hours, finish it all with a peaceful nap, and perhaps a yoga session. I&#8217;ve found some great free videos on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.myyogaonline.com" target="_blank">MyYogaOnline</a></strong></span>, which I also download to my iPod and take with me when I travel.</p>
<p>A big part of life&#8217;s enjoyment is to be found in treating yourself well, so indulge yourself.</p>

<p>This summer I was invited by <a href="http://www.winesfromspain.com" target="_blank"><strong>Wines from Spain</strong></a> and the <strong><a href="http://www.riasbaixaswines.com" target="_blank">Rias Baixas wine region</a></strong> to explore their viniferous offerings. I came away from the trip with a lot of new thoughts on white wines, as they hadn&#8217;t held much excitement for me &#8212; until I discovered why. A big part of enjoying wine comes from finding out what you like, the reasons you like it, and building from the flavor notes that attract your senses, so much was revealed to me in the span of this tour. With 3 winery visits a day for the better part of a week, I really got to know the nuances of Albarino grapes and Rias Baixas winemaking, so I now feel more empowered and knowledgeable in my search for the flavors that awaken my palate. I hope my findings will help you to discover the sparks that awaken your own.</p>
<p>During my trip I toured the 4 sub-regions of Rias Baixas exploring both large and small winemakers, including <a href="http://www.pazodesenorans.com/eng/" target="_blank"><strong><span>Pazo de SeÃ±orÃ¡ns</span></strong></a>, the winery of the D.O.&#8217;s founder, Marisol Bueno. The region is known for the fortitude of its female winemakers, which I have to admit, made me smile.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be releasing a series of videos and stories about the region, but for now here&#8217;s a little taste of my arrival in Santiago de Compostela, a site of pilgrimage for many Catholics. You might hear a sound that is quite unexpected coming from Spain. (Please pardon the video quality &#8212; been working out bugs with the conversions.)</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1062" title="suspiro" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/suspiro1.jpg" alt="suspiro" width="240" height="320" />After several days here in Peru, one thing has become apparent: This is a culture deeply in love with its food. Nowhere else have I seen such a strong emotional connection to the kitchen and table. In kicking off  La Mistura, Peru&#8217;s annual culinary festival, Chef Gaston Acurio talked about the state of the economy, and how food is the one sector that is growing in this country &#8212; because the emotional connection Peruvians have with their food is the last thing they&#8217;re willing to let go. Instead, they are spending their scarce funds on high-quality food products and ensuring that one integral piece of their lives remains intact.</p>
<p>There is something to be learned from this. To eat in Peru is to take the pleasure of dining and hospitality to a level we rarely see in the U.S. Even the fast food here is of better quality &#8212; and I&#8217;m happy to say that Bembo&#8217;s, the national burger chain, is outselling the golden arches, simply because the food is better.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/peru-steak.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="207" />Service is also prized here, and Peruvians demand the very best. The quality is evident at every level, from  street foods like anticuchos (hearts, liver and intestines), papa rellena (a mixture of beef, onions and olives deep fried in a mashed potato crust) and picarones (fried dough) to the more exotic fare found in the city&#8217;s best restaurants.</p>
<p>With such a rich choice of ingredients, my palate has been surprised a number of times with new textures and flavors, including some from the Amazon that I&#8217;ll detail in a later post. We&#8217;ve practically gorged ourselves on ceviche and pisco sours, both national treasures. We&#8217;ve even sampled cuy (guinea pig), which is surprisingly good, especially when the skin is crisped to a crunchy finish.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/picarones-bees.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="210" />It will take me a while to really absorb and share what I&#8217;m experiencing here, because it&#8217;s life-changing. I&#8217;ve never had so many new flavors in a matter of days, so my palate is still reeling from the experience.</p>
<p>We are now in the Sacred Valley in preparation for our trip to Machu Picchu, and it seems that everywhere I look the landscape is bursting with colors and textures &#8212; my senses will remember this trip for many years to come. We&#8217;ll have videos, photos and podcasts in the months to come, and can&#8217;t wait to share it all, but for now we&#8217;ll post as much as we can. It&#8217;s difficult when we&#8217;re always on the go (I&#8217;m supposed to be sleeping right now, as I have a 6:45 AM train to Machu Picchu), but at the very least you can take a peek at my Facebook albums:</p>

<p>During our trip to Scotland, I sat down with Chef Jason Henderson from <strong><a href="http://www.knockcastle.com" target="_blank">Knock Castle</a></strong> to talk about his approach to fine dining. I posted <strong><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/knock-castle-princess-for-a-night">my initial impressions about Knock Castle</a></strong>, but this takes a little behind-the-scenes look at how Jason thinks about food, and what he wants people to experience in his dining room. His able staff left me with one of my best hospitality experiences to date, so if you are going to be in the vicinity of Crieff, Scotland, I highly recommend staying here. He didn&#8217;t pay me to say that, though he is awfully cute.</p>

<p><img class="size-full wp-image-655 alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="digitaldads" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/digitaldads1.jpg" alt="digitaldads" width="300" height="182" />I love that so many people are getting behind my <strong><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/category/sex-on-a-plate">Sex on a Plate</a></strong> mission! I recently sat down with my good friend C.C. Chapman, who is not only a prolific new media entrepreneur, but is also an avid cook, to talk about  the link between food and sensuality. His site <strong><a href="http://www.digitaldads.com" target="_blank">Digital Dads</a></strong> (for dads, by dads) addresses all sorts of parenting aspects, and he had some questions about how dads might keep things spicy with the wife.</p>
<p>He proposed an interesting theory that has turned into &#8220;C.C.&#8217;s law of the 2 Cs,&#8221; and I wholeheartedly agree. I think the ladies might, too:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I believe that if every guy could master the art of cunnilingus and cooking then they could win any womanâ€™s heart. Because of this, I wanted to get [Jennifer's] take on the intimate qualities of food that sheâ€™s been talking about as part of her <a href="../sex-on-a-plate">Sex on a Plate</a> concept. What follows is a little Q&amp;A and I did with her.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So if you&#8217;re a dad, or know a dad, please do spread the gospel &#8212; see the full <strong><a href="http://www.digitaldads.com/2009/09/sex-on-a-plate/" target="_blank">Digital Dads Q&amp;A</a></strong>. Remember the mission: Better food and better sex for everyone! Huzzah!</p>

<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/veg.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />My pal Art Insana has created a wonderful new site called <a href="http://www.the-future.com" target="_blank"><strong>the-future.com</strong></a>, which takes a compelling look at  the trends that will shape our world in the days and decades ahead, with contributions  on topics ranging from fashion to science. I&#8217;m intrigued to see the discussions that will surely arise.</p>
<p>When Art asked me to write a piece on food for the site&#8217;s debut, I could not help but think about the local (or locavore) movement, and what that might mean for us, globally, as a species. There are more questions than answers that arise when examining such a topic, so I decided to begin with those in hand.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I&#8217;d been spending the past few weeks deep in thought about local vs. mass-production food, as I received a screener&#8217;s copy of <em>Food, Inc.</em> and finally had a chance to watch it. After a bit of searching, I also found <a href="http://www.hulu.com/the-future-of-food" target="_blank"><em><strong>The Future of Food</strong></em></a> on Hulu. I used to be of the opinion that genetically-modified foods were fine, given that just about all plant matter we eat has been hybridized at some point in history. However, the idea of flounder DNA in tomatoes crosses a line for me &#8212; as does the law of unintended consequences. As does the idea of us not having knowledge readily available concerning what is being put into our bodies.</p>
<p>Given that I&#8217;m also a rabid capitalist, this all presented a bit of a quandary. Years ago,  I came out swinging in favor of Monsanto &#8212; the monolith of seed manufacturing. Now that I&#8217;ve learned more abut their business practices, however, I&#8217;m very disturbed by what I see as an unethical value system and extremely dirty legal tactics.</p>
<p>Rather than standing on a soapbox and preaching some kind of foodie gospel, however, I am much more eager to encourage people to read, then read between the lines, look at both sides, and draw their own conclusions. Ask questions. Find out where your food comes from. The only way for us to truly affect change is to be well-informed with the truth &#8212; not a Michael Moore-esque scare version, but a well-balanced view.</p>
<p>I encourage you to read my article, <a href="http://the-future.com/2009/09/food-for-thought/" target="_blank"><em><strong>The Great Food Debate: Romance vs. Reality</strong></em></a>, and share your own thoughts. This topic is one that touches every single human being on the planet, so it&#8217;s worth a bit of brain time.</p>
<p>How much do you really think about what&#8217;s going into your mouth?</p>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1056" title="lavender" src="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/lavender.jpg" alt="lavender" />As summer winds down, I find myself looking for respite from the heat anywhere I can find it. Some days the air is so thick on the East Coast I feel like I need oars.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m in those dog-day doldrums, I find that certain scents offer quick refreshment and make my tongue tingle a little bit &#8212; and that always makes me happy.</p>
<p>Simple syrups are one of my favorite ways to perk up a cocktail, a glass of iced tea, or even a fruit salad. They are easy to craft (note the name &#8220;simple&#8221;), so this is a quickie even for the novice cook. This recipe can be adapted for any kind of herb (suggestions below), so think about what your senses are craving and indulge thyself in some refreshment!</p>
<p><strong>Herbed Simple Syrup</strong></p>
<p><em>Makes about 1 1/2 cups</em></p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>1 cup sugar<br />
1 cup water<br />
1 cup loosely packed herbs (basil, mint, rosemary, lavender, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<p>Place ingredients in saucepan and stir, then place over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and boil until sugar is dissolved (1-2 minutes).</p>
<p>Remove from heat, and let stand for 30 minutes. Pour liquid through a  strainer into an airtight container and discard herbs. Cover and chill for 2-3 hours.Â  Can be stored in refrigerator up to 1 month.</p>

<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/figsmi.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />Since last week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/sex-on-a-plate"><strong>Sex on a Plate</strong></a> post (and the announcement of my mission to help people have great food and great sex) I&#8217;ve had a lot of compelling conversations around the subjects of sensuality, sexuality and food. One of them was with a national woman&#8217;s magazine, so let&#8217;s hope I make the editor&#8217;s cut for that.</p>
<p>In having such conversations, of course, questions have arisen, such as &#8220;Where do I start?&#8221; and &#8220;What do I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d put together a couple of tips (OK, five of them) to share my approach to the senses, and how these actions help me to savor life on a very profound level. I recommend you give them a try and see what happens.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Quiet your mind.</strong> Nothing can interfere more with a moment of enjoyment than a mind that is full of worry, to-dos, schedules, etc. Take a moment to breathe. This has been my greatest challenge, as my brain is constantly buzzing with things I need to take care of, ideas for my businesses, people I need to reach out to, on and on; it&#8217;s enough to make a person frazzled. To quiet myself, I&#8217;ve committed a minimum of 15 minutes each day to sit quietly, preferably surrounded by trees and flowers, to just be. To take it all in.</li>
<li><strong>Pay attention.</strong> In that moment of serenity (you can get there &#8212; deep breaths, people) take note of the colors, sounds, scents and textures around you. Notice how vivid the colors are in that Iris over there, or how peaceful the sound of the breeze is. Feel the sun on your face.</li>
<li><strong>Reach down into that inner place of joy.</strong> The ultimate feeling is to revel in one&#8217;s very existence &#8212; to feel a sense of giddy happiness just to be alive, experiencing this moment. If we can take pleasure in something that simple, imagine the indulgent pleasures that can follow.</li>
<li><strong>Engage your mental mouth.</strong> This is your inner taster. We all have one. In remembering your favorite food memories, your mental mouth pulls up smells, flavors, feelings from the past, at times when you had a perfect bite, or your grandmother&#8217;s apple pie evoked the ultimate feeling of comfort. By exercising this little guy, and by thinking about flavors, you are putting your brain to work on expanding the receptors for these all-important pleasures. I did not develop my palate passively &#8212; I taste a lot of things, see how they make me feel, store the ones I like and refer to them for inspiration.</li>
<li><strong>Approach your food actively.</strong> Remember when you sat outside and paid attention to your surroundings? Apply that to your next meal. What colors, textures and smells are before you? Take a moment to absorb those, and note how they make you feel. Are you inspired to lasciviously dive into that dish of glistening red tomatoes? Does the soft texture of that loaf of bread make you want to play with it in your hands? These are exercises that put the mind to work &#8212; to train it to anticipate pleasure, and get you excited for the things you&#8217;re about to taste.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me know how you do. Or, as I am wont to say, keep playing with your food.</p>

<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/brandywine-vineyard.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="240" />Last week I was invited on a little adventure to explore the <a href="http://www.bvwinetrail.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Brandywine Valley Wine Trail</strong></a> in Chester County, PA, about 45 minutes outside of Philadelphia. At first I was surprised &#8212; I was not aware there <em>was</em> a wine trail in Pennsylvania. Infinitely curious and not sure what to expect, I set off  with an open mind.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I did, as this picturesque region has a lot to offer the food &amp; wine explorer. With its 8 vineyards, the 50-mile trail is easy enough to visit over the course of a weekend, though there are other distractions that may compel you to  pull over from time to time,  from farms to antique shops and <a href="http://www.longwoodgardens.org" target="_blank"><strong>Longwood Gardens</strong></a>, built by Pierre DuPont in the early 20th Century. Given the valley&#8217;s proximity to several major cities, those in the know travel there on weekends from Washington, DC, Baltimore and New York &#8212; and have been doing so for years.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/wine-poetry.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="240" />The Brandywine Valley is a mix of town and country, as you can travel out to the estate vineyards themselves or visit the local tasting rooms, often part of the town&#8217;s shopping centers. This mix is a bit handy for those  who might not swoon at the sight of grape vines, and who are eager to spend more time tasting. Paradocx, Kreutz Creek and Chaddsford wineries all have such locations, while Chaddsford also features an outdoor area for live events. Penns Woods, like some of the others, has  a tasting room on-site at the winery, where you can view the rolling hills of vines. Information about all the wineries, including a special events calendar, can be found on  the <a href="http://www.bvwinetrail.com/index.cfm" target="_blank"><strong>Brandywine Valley Wine Trail</strong></a> site. The in-town tasting rooms were particularly convenient for me, as I also had a cooking class to attend at the <a href="http://www.hamanassett.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Brandywine Country Cooking School</strong></a> (more on that in my next post).</p>
<p>Though I only had a couple of days to spend, I managed to sit with a number of the local winemakers, winery owners and tasting room managers to talk about what&#8217;s happening in Pennsylvania wine, and those chats will be featured in an upcoming episode of Food Philosophy. It is a region in progress: Some of the wines are starting to win regional and national awards, and from my conversations it seems that many winemakers are still trying to find the sweet spot, finding which wines work best with the Brandywine&#8217;s particular terroir. As with any wine region, it sometimes takes decades to find which grapes are best suited to a given region, and in fact, this is what makes it exciting: It offers you a chance to explore right along with the winemakers, learning how they think and discovering what excites them. Though grapes have been grown here since the days of our founding fathers, there are now varietals available for experimentation that would not have been possible for William Penn and friends.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/chaddsford-flowers.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="240" />Overall, I think the Brandywine Valley offers a conveniently-located, relaxing getaway for east coasters looking to travel close to home. Happily, chefs and restaurants have joined the party, featuring local ingredients and wines wherever possible. I had a particularly good burger  at <a href="http://www.bistroonthebrandywine.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Bistro on the Brandywine</strong></a>, which was accompanied by a roasted golden beet salad with frisse and arugula, candied walnuts, Humboldt Fog blue cheese and white balsamic vinaigrette. It tasted as good as it sounds.</p>

This is what happens when I drink first thing in the morning. We stopped in at the Penderyn Distillery, the only working distillery in Wales, which is working to revive the Welsh Whisky tradition. Keith Tench gives me a lesson in cuddling and properly sniffing whisky, and I get a  taste of a VERY special brew. The dance number at the end features Tom Jones. Don&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you.</p>

<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/prosciuttomelon.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="305" />If you happen to follow my  <strong><a href="http://www.twitter.com/foodphilosophy" target="_blank">Twitter</a></strong> activities, you may have noticed that I&#8217;ve begun a regular thing called <strong><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=sexonaplate" target="_blank">#sexonaplate</a></strong>. (That little number sign is called a hash tag, and creates a Twitter stream of people&#8217;s tweets  on a given subject when they add the tag.)</p>
<p>The original &#8220;sex on a plate&#8221; quote comes from my first manifesto, <strong><a href="http://www.foodphilosophy.com/on-food-and-sensuality" target="_blank">On Food and Sensuality</a></strong>, written in 2004 when I discovered that the pre-consumption sight and/or smell of certain foods evokes a visceral reaction in me that is so sensually satisfying, the eating is almost an afterthought. Almost.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;m asking what evokes that reaction in you. What makes you swoon? Sigh? Tremble? Drool?</p>
<p>I do have an ulterior motive here, which has become my life&#8217;s work: <strong>I want you to eat better food and have better sex</strong>. They go together, you see.</p>
<p>My second manifesto is in the anthology <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFood-Philosophy-Eat-Think-Merry%2Fdp%2F1405157755%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1205737237%26sr%3D1-1&amp;tag=gastronomicme-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank"><em>Food &amp; Philosophy: Eat, Think and Be Merry</em></a></strong>. My essay <em>Food and Sensuality: A Perfect Pairing</em> takes the premise quite a few steps further, delving into comparisons of cheap porn and bad television cooking shows &#8212; and explaining why neither is truly satisfying.</p>
<p>The conclusion of both manifestos, however, remains the same: <em>Life is more satisfying when it is accompanied by sensual indulgence that is felt all the way down into the soul</em>. It makes colors more vivid, tastes more satisfying, and lovemaking more fulfilling. It takes what might have become a daily routine and spices it up in a way that makes one feel more alive simply for being here and witnessing what is present for the senses to enjoy. If you&#8217;ve ever bathed in the scent of lavender, I think you know exactly what I mean.</p>
<p>But I cannot embark upon this mission alone. Indulgence is better when shared &#8212; and I would love for us to experience it together. How do we do that? Well, for starters, we need to talk about it. The conversation on Twitter is coming along nicely, and that is one spot &#8212; but there are others. Talk to me on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/jenniferiannolo" target="_blank"><strong>Facebook</strong></a>. Leave comments here. Sniff basil leaves. Dip a piece of bread in truffle oil and inhale deeply.</p>
<p>Then share the experience &#8212; let somebody in on the secret.</p>

<p>My Twitter pal Chip Griffin from <a href="http://www.mediabullseye.com" target="_blank">Media Bullseye</a> wrote an article today likening social media to levels of cooking appliances, with the EasyBake being the starter model. I found the idea quite humorous, and ended up getting a little quote love. :) His analogy is a good one, and worth a read if you are thinking about dipping your toe into the social media arena.</p>
<blockquote><p>In cooking, you might think of entry-level as an <a id="k9_5" title="Easybake Oven" href="http://www.amazon.com/Easy-Bake-Oven-Center-Hasbro/dp/B001DI4VN0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=toys-and-games&amp;qid=1250263982&amp;sr=8-1">Easybake Oven</a>. These much-maligned children&#8217;s toys can be used for cooking, though I have not done so myself. My lack of experience seems irrelevant, however, since someone actually created a cookbook on the subject. <a id="yjas" title="I kid you not." href="http://www.amazon.com/Easy-Bake-Oven-Gourmet-David-Hoffman/dp/B000BBXAP0/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1250263982&amp;sr=8-4">I kid you not.</a> And Jennifer Iannolo told me on <a id="ium4" title="Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/foodphilosophy/status/3306834318">Twitter</a> this morning that she &#8220;can work an EasyBake like nobody&#8217;s bidness.</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><div class="tweetmeme_button" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
			<a href="http://api.tweetmeme.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoodphilosophy.com%2Feveryday-indulgences-lavender-oil-epsom-salt-bath%2F"><br />
				<img src="http://api.tweetmeme.com/imagebutton.gif?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoodphilosophy.com%2Feveryday-indulgences-lavender-oil-epsom-salt-bath%2F&amp;source=foodphilosophy&amp;style=normal&amp;service=bit.ly&amp;b=2" height="61" width="50" /><br />

		</div>
<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/lav.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="303" />For me,  nothing relieves stress better than a hot bath, and I was so happy to move into my new apartment because the old one didn&#8217;t have a tub!  I had a gorgeous multi-jet shower (we nicknamed it the &#8220;Porn Shower&#8221;), but oh, how I longed to soak my weary self on many an occasion.</p>
<p>Back in the day when I could afford massages regularly, my darling of a masseur recommended that I take a hot bath afterward with lavender oil, Epsom salts and buttermilk to offset the lactic acid buildup.  The elixir always left me feeling rejuvenated, and I rarely suffered from the soreness typical of deep-tissue massages.  And though  I now have to skip the massage part of that joyful experience (boo!), I am still a huge fan of the bath combo. It also makes the house smell incredible.</p>
<p>Note: Epsom salts are not the same as regular salts &#8212; they are actually a combination of magnesium and sulfate. Magnesium is supposed to assist the pain receptors in the body to settle down a bit, which is my layman&#8217;s explanation, but please be patient with me, as I&#8217;m learning this stuff right along with you. I do welcome your comments below if you have better explanations than mine.</p>
<p>This trifecta of goodness offers natural healing properties to soothe the nervous system, ease aches and pains, and evoke the aromatherapeutic effects of calm. I also get extra-excited when I can use real foods and ingredients as part of my wellness regimen, and all of the items can below are completely edible (as long as you use culinary lavender, but feel free to use either). Consider it comfort food:redux.</p>
<p>The next time you&#8217;re filling the tub with hot water, simply add in:<br />
1/2 cup of buttermilk<br />
1 cup of Epsom salts<br />
drizzle of lavender essential oil</p>
<p>Climb in, close your eyes and let the stress disappear.</p>
<p><strong>Variation</strong></p>
<p>If you want to get some skin-soothing action in there, and prefer a dry mixture to make in bulk and store (just multiply the measurements below in proportion), prepare a dry mixture of the following:</p>
<p>1 cup Epsom salts<br />
1/2 cup powdered milk<br />
1 cup rolled oats<br />
2 Tbsp lavender buds</p>
<p>Put all the ingredients in the food processor and grind to a fine powder. I make this in bulk and store it in a pretty jar in my bathroom. (It also makes a wonderful gift for your favorite stressed-out people.)</p>
<p>P.S. I&#8217;ve now also seen lavender Epsom salts available in drug stores, so if you can&#8217;t find or afford the real essential oil, this does work as a decent substitute, but will not afford you the true benefits of the oil, which you can find in natural health food stores or online at <a href="http://www.sunseyestore.com/products/pure.html" target="_blank">Sun&#8217;s Eye</a>, where I get mine.</p>
<p>Let me know how it goes for you. It sure was good for me.</p>

<p>I spoke a little bit about it the other day, but letâ€™s discuss the dynamic of afternoon tea in greater detail, for it is one of lifeâ€™s greatest pleasures.</p>
<p>The Brits and Scots have mastered the introduction of sweets and a bit of caffeinated refreshment to the afternoon, and for that I thank them. To make a perfect cuppa, however, certain rules must be followed. Iâ€™ve been scolded by my mother for not letting my tea infuse, so please donâ€™t be foolish like me, or she might feel it in the air and come find you.</p>
<p>Three minutes. Do not steep for less or your tea will be watery. She gets really mental about this. Milk comes after, unless you are serving a pot of tea, in which case you can add sugar and milk to the cup first, then pour the properly-steeped tea over the combo, which helps to stir it all together. Hey, theyâ€™re nothing if not uptightly efficient in the UK.</p>
<p>If you are not a baker, or have no access to lovely baked goods that are decorated with swirls of whipped cream and what not, at least treat yourself to a little biscuit of some kind. In the UK that means a cookie, and surely you can find a good cookie.</p>
<p>So create a sweet afternoon for yourself. Invite a friend over and take a moment to share a cuppa and a biscuit. Life will taste just a little nicer that day, and it wonâ€™t cost you but a quid or two.</p>
<p>If you are inclined to bake something yourself, I suggest some of the following biscuits:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/lavender-biscotti-with-almonds/" target="_blank">Lavender Biscotti with Almonds</a></strong><br />
<strong><a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/chestnut-caramel-pound-cake/" target="_blank">Chestnut Caramel Pound Cake</a></strong><br />
<strong><a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/hazelnut-fig-linzer-cookies/" target="_blank">Hazelnut &amp; Fig Linzer Cookies</a></strong></p>
<p>P.S. If your tea preferences lean more toward spicy goodness, see my <strong><a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/honeyed-chai-tea/" target="_blank">Honeyed Chai Tea recipe</a></strong>. In that case, it needs to steep for at least 15 minutes, or Iâ€™ll slap you.</p>

<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/KnockCastle.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="256" />Every woman should feel like a princess once in a while. It makes the world a better place. After our long, winding journey south from the Scottish Highlands, we found ourselves on the lush grounds of a castle, and I felt right at home. (Shocking, I know.)</p>
<p>When I think of romantic, bucolic settings, <a href="http://www.knockcastle.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Knock Castle</strong></a> in Crieff is what I picture in my mindâ€™s eye. Aside from being an actual castle, which comprises a certain ancient mystique, there is a sense about the place of intimacy, respite and unpretentious welcome.</p>
<p>As I strolled through different parts of the grounds, I found myself conjuring up little stories â€” the romantic in me cannot resist when presented with such a canvas for creativity. In the lush gardens, I imagined lovers frolicking among the vivid blue of hydrangea, stealing into shady nooks for hidden kisses. The grass was so soft it felt like carpet beneath my feet, and I could picture many an afternoon spent picnicking on its inviting softness.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/KnockCastle2.jpg" alt="" width="312" height="230" />In the summer house, where we took afternoon tea, I pictured ladies awaiting their gentsâ€™ return from croquet, or perhaps a fox hunt. It was as if I stepped back in time and into the fairy tales in my head.</p>
<p>Note that I havenâ€™t even gotten to the food yet. Youâ€™re already in love, arenâ€™t you?</p>
<p>I also havenâ€™t mentioned the rooms, private cinema, spa, incredible staff or chef/proprietor Jason Henderson.</p>
<p>Each room in the castle has a different theme, with most leaning more toward the masculine or feminine sides. Mum and I stayed in the Lady MacBrayne suite, which is the largest on the property, and the former suite of the Lady herself. (I am *so* high on the favorite child list right now.)</p>
<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/KnockCastle-SittingRoom.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="210" />Our plush suite had a sitting room, two bathrooms (one with a spa tub), and a large bedroom. The sitting room has leather couches and a stained glass-framed bay window complete with seat to overlook the grounds.</p>
<p>Alas, I did not get a chance to experience the spa, which I think made me die a little bit inside, but this gives me a wonderful reason to go back. Now I just need to find a prince to come with me (feel free to leave your name and address in the comments section).</p>
<p>I did, however, get to spend some time in <strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=3569108&amp;id=745921417" target="_blank">The Egg</a></strong>. Nanoo nanoo.</p>
<p>And while weâ€™re on the subject of princes, letâ€™s talk about the king of the castle himself. Chef Jason Henderson is the owner of Knock Castle along with his father and siblings, and the personal investment theyâ€™ve made is evident in every piece of the property, from the decor in each suite to the helicopters that assist guests in getting back and forth from major cities with ease.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/KnockCastle-Scallops.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="210" />Jasonâ€™s approach to cuisine is the kind that speaks to my soul, and after dinner we sat down for a long chat about food, cooking, its meaning for him, and his adventures in running a country hotel. As it turns out, we both worked for Relais &amp; Chateaux, so we spent some time talking about the specifics of country hotels, and how different the dynamic is from managing larger hotels and restaurants. Look for that discussion on an upcoming Food Philosophy, because I couldnâ€™t resist recording that exchange to share with you. Jason is the kind of chef I only come across once in a while, and such discoveries light up my inner gastronome like a neon lantern â€” perhaps heâ€™ll spark something in you, too.</p>
<p>His commitment to the comfort of his guests is also very evident. Iâ€™ve stayed in a lot of country hotels where the service is polite, but either a little too intrusive or standoffish. Many times it can feel like youâ€™re living in a fish bowl, which takes what could be a relaxing country stay and introduces a dynamic of odd discomfort. It seems that Knock Castle, however, has found an optimal balance of helpfulness and warmth, as we truly felt like guests in someoneâ€™s home, but with none of the bad parts. It was also clear this was a genuine way about the place, and not simply because we were there with our cameras â€” these people are authentically as sweet as toffee pudding.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0px 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/KC-MarkJenMom.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="210" />Our respite at the castle was all too brief, but Iâ€™m most eager to go back. Iâ€™m actually working on some ideas to take you with me next time, so if I can bring that to fruition you might just become part of my fairy tale stories!</p>
<p>Thanks to Jason and his marvelous staff for a day very well spent. We canâ€™t wait to see you again.</p>

<div class="heading4">
<p class="text2"><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/chefs/charlie-trotter.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="240" /><em>Cooking is not really that difficult.  In fact, itâ€™s more about love and touch and caring than about special techniques or magical recipes. &#8211;  Charlie Trotter</em></p>
<p>It is intriguing to discover what tidbits our minds file away, only to thrust them to the surface when we least expect it.  I started this adventure with the idea of presenting â€œCharlie Trotter on Tomatoes;â€ he swoons for them, too, so I was eager to capture his thoughts on such a glorious ingredient.</p>
<p>Then I revisited his cookbooks.  Though I have read them many times, my mind has been so preoccupied with his use of colors, exotic ingredients, and innovative flavor combinations that I only subconsciously registered his commentary.  Suddenly, as I re-read the pages, it seemed as if everywhere I looked, passages jumped out about sensuality, desire, touch â€” the things we espouse on every page of this site.  Just by reading his words, I was reminded of the intensity with which he approaches his craft, the reverence he holds for even the humblest of ingredients â€” and the true sensualist behind the creations. Tomatoes quickly became a secondary matter.</p>
<p>With one look at the composition and presentation of his dishes, the aesthetic nuances of Charlieâ€™s food philosophy spring to life; each dish is meant to tease the senses in a cacophony of color and aroma, followed by the flavor explosions that have earned him a global reputation as a culinary giant.</p>
<p>He often says that â€œcuisine is only about making foods taste the way they are supposed to taste.â€  On the surface, it is a simple statement, but it belies the foundation of understanding one must achieve to speak with such philosophical brevity.</p>
<p>That underlying commitment to purity of flavor best captures the â€œwhyâ€ behind his creations: Each ingredient is coaxed to shine in a state of elegant purity, where the intellectual and aesthetic achieve a state of sublime harmony.  The desires of his palate at a given moment dictate the â€œwhatâ€ â€” what does he like to eat, and what is he in the mood for?  The rest unfolds as a physical extension of this desire; his hands simply respond in a continuation of the cerebral process.</p>
<p>This is a man who has spent a great deal of time thinking about ingredients at their height of perfection, who constantly challenges his mind to find the cooking methods and flavor complements that will bring them to a new peak, surpassing what has been created before.</p>
<p>But he is also keenly aware of the impact of the physical process, and how it echoes the connection between food and sensuality:</p></div>
<blockquote>
<p class="text2"><em>â€¦the art of cooking, that is the act of gathering foodstuffs, preparing them, and serving them, is among the most intimate things that we can do for another.  Indeed, since every sense â€” touching, smelling, seeing, tasting, and hearing â€” is engaged, at times even profoundly, the entire process more often than not verges on the sensual.  And when food and wine stimulate and excite the palate, which in turn stimulates the mind, the act of eating becomes so much more than that of attaining sustenance.  It is more about achieving a higher good intellectually, spiritually, and sensually (The Kitchen Sessions, p. 15).<br />
</em></p></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p align="center">
<p class="text2">Eating taken to a higher plane?  At his table, most certainly.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/chefs/trotter-kitchen.jpg" border="1" alt="" hspace="10" width="300" height="220" align="left" />Charlie Trotter is one of the best modern examples of a food philosopher that I have had the pleasure to encounter.  Given his intellectual bent (and a college minor in philosophy), this comes as no great surprise.  He actually reminds me of a professor of gastronomy, one from whom Iâ€™ve learned that generosity and a deep passion for oneâ€™s craft elevate the experience of cooking â€” and eating â€” to the level of sensual profundity he mentions.</p>
<p>His cookbooks are peppered with quotes from literary greats, and one simply knows that there is never a book far from his hands.  In conversation, he has read Dostoevsky to me one moment, then quoted Fernand Point a moment later; then sent me a copy of <em>Ma gastronomie</em> so I could discover it for myself.  His heart and spirit share equal stature with his mind, and his contributions to cuisine â€” and to those eager to learn â€” are such that this particular student has had her own mind enriched incomparably. His cooks often say the same.</p>
<p>There is something about a cerebral chef that strikes a deep chord within my inner food geek/philosopher; that resonance is a source of comfort when I look at the piles of gastronomic books and tomes filling my shelves.  I know that in seeking a deeper meaning for myself in the realm of gastronomy, and a better understanding of the human condition, I can look to those with a similar approach and discover something new, something that makes me eager to delve into thick books and lose myself for hours; or to feel the black earth beneath my feet as I traverse rows of crops, talking with the farmer whose hands planted the verdant creations before me.  Always, there is meaning.</p>
<p>Thank you, Charlie.</p></div>

<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/highland-sheep.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="320" />When I visited Scotland for the first time with my mother in 2004, I didn&#8217;t have so much as an inkling what my life would be like 5 years later. At that time I barely knew a certain chef named Mark Tafoya, and though I had a food blog, it was the &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; kind, without tags or permalinks or anything of the sort.</p>
<p>How wonderful it feels to know that now, in addition to sharing some snippets with you from the road, we&#8217;ve also captured some of my family&#8217;s history on video, and that story can now be shared with cousins from both sides of the pond, and even those in Australia &#8212; simultaneously. We are all taking part, whether virtually or in person, in Homecoming Scotland 2009 &#8212; and you are right here with me. Do you know how amazing that feels? For the first time you&#8217;ll get to see my mom go crazy for her sweeties, and share stories about putting on her Wellies and picking fresh mushrooms after a rainstorm. She is a very special lady, and those around her know it for certain, but now I get to share her with you, too. This trip was as much about her as it was about Scotland, and though we hauled her around through a pretty tight schedule, I hope she&#8217;ll be as pleased with the results as we hope to be.</p>
<p>We started our journey in Inverness, where she was born, and these pictures barely capture the bucolic majesty of the Scottish Highlands. It is a land of mist and green, with the first buds of heather just starting to peek out. Soon the hillsides will be resplendent with waves of purple, but for now there is a gentle tease of the colors to come. If you ever get a chance to see it first-hand, I implore you to do so, because the sight of those hills dotted with sheep and heather will take your breath away.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/features/JenMomHugh.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="254" />The most important stop of our &#8220;Heeland&#8221; journey was in Culloden, the site of the most famous battle in Scotland&#8217;s history. The first time I visited Culloden in &#8217;04, I noticed that the cairn (monument) there was built by Duncan Forbes, my ancestor. I was so overcome with the magnitude of that battlefield&#8217;s history that I actually wept as I took it all in. I felt proud that our family commemorated the bravery of so many men, but was a little bit disappointed that the family name did not appear on any of the clan gravestones. This was a bit of a bummer.</p>
<p>What I didn&#8217;t know &#8212; and what truly blew me away &#8212; was that during the battle itself, an earlier Duncan Forbes was actually the Lord President of Scotland. This was getting good. I also discovered that members of the Forbes clan fought on both sides of the battle, but many fought under the name of the Mackintosh clan, so they were hidden in plain sight from mine eyes.</p>
<p>All of this wonderful news was delivered to mom and me by Hugh Allison, who joined us in full regalia (yes, that includes a kilt) to explain what happened during the battle. He even gave me a little lesson in weaponry, and I found that the swords are my kind of weapon. Of course, they do resemble knives, so that makes sense.</p>
<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/Culloden-House.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" />When we had afternoon tea at Culloden House afterward, I discovered that it, too, was owned by Duncan Forbes, and in fact housed the bed where Bonnie Prince Charlie slept the night before the infamous battle. This was all delightfully overwhelming, as I did not realize the weight the Forbes name carries in that part of Scotland. When I heard the sound of bagpipes as dinner was escorted in to the Culloden House&#8217;s guests, I did in fact get a bit misty. The sound of those pipes always stirs something deep in my soul.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Hugh Allison has become one of my new best friends, and he will join me for an upcoming Food Philosophy podcast to discuss the history of Culloden in further detail. We shot some video with him to give you an overview, so look for that to come out in the next couple of months. If you want to learn more yourself, you can read Hugh&#8217;s book Culloden Tales, which gives a moving account of the battle and clarifies that it was not, as many think, a battle between the English and the Scottish. As it turns out, there was a little bit of both on either side.</p>
<p>It is such an incredible feeling to find out where you come from. As a first-generation American I feel a little bit lost sometimes, like I am straddling the fence of three cultures (American, Scottish and Italian), but this helps to put it all in perspective, because all three comprise important parts of me. There is much more to tell, and it will all be done in due course, but I wanted to give you a little snippet of my experience so far. I also want to know if you&#8217;ve explored your roots in any way like this. Is it important for you to know where you come from? What blood runs through your veins? I hope you&#8217;ll post a comment if you&#8217;ve had a similar experience.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/MomJen-teaCulloden.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="245" />Now, I would be most remiss if I did not mention the joy that is afternoon tea. There is nothing quite like curing the afternoon blahs with a pot of tea served with sandwiches, cakes, biscuits and scones with a dollop of clotted cream. It&#8217;s downright decadent, and Mom dove in like a starved woman. (If it comes with whipped cream, she&#8217;s in.) The photos here are from our afternoon tea at Culloden House, which was incredibly inviting after a day of driving and touring.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I&#8217;ve noticed something interesting about myself in the UK, and it&#8217;s happened on the three separate occasions I&#8217;ve been here. If you know anything about me, it&#8217;s that I am a coffee freak. I live for coffee, could bathe in the smell of the beans, and simply can&#8217;t get enough. Unless I&#8217;m in the UK. Then all I want is tea, and I want many cups, all day long. I think it has to do with the chilly dampness in the air &#8212; nothing cures it like a cuppa.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try to send as many updates as I can from the road, so make yourself a cuppa and check back for more. We&#8217;re off to Wales tomorrow! You can also see more photos of our trip on my Facebook albums for the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=129265&amp;id=625869702&amp;l=7a6eae72a2" target="_blank"><strong>Highlands</strong></a> and <strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=129273&amp;id=625869702&amp;l=85d04a77ab" target="_blank">Culloden</a></strong>.</p>

<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/Kiltarlity.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="239" />The first time I traveled to  Scotland with my mother was in 2004, when the Culinary Media Network was a mere blog-type thing called &#8220;Gastronomic Meditations,&#8221; and my newsletter had about 4 subscribers. It was my first time there, and we were able to visit the house in which she was born &#8212; many, many moons ago. Don&#8217;t tell her I said that.</p>
<p>I wrote a few things about my discoveries then, so I thought I&#8217;d recap my first impressions (listed at the end of this post).</p>
<p>Next week Chef Mark and I are taking Mom back for a little retracing of the roots &#8212; this time on video. Incidentally, since she has thoroughly become an American despite the lingering Scottish lilt in her voice, I don&#8217;t call her Mum. She&#8217;d probably box my ears. Given the scare we had with her very serious heart attack last year, this trip is nothing short of a miracle, so I&#8217;m beyond grateful that we have the opportunity to do it at all.</p>
<p>2009 is a very special year for those of Scottish heritage, who have been invited to take part in <strong><a href="http://www.homecomingscotland.com/default.html" target="_blank">Homecoming Scotland</a></strong>. For the entire year, the country has thrown open its doors to everyone of Scottish descent, so if there&#8217;s a trace of Bonnie Scotland in your blood, get your kilt over there lest you miss all the fun. Alas, we will arrive just after the largest clan gathering in history in Edinburgh; I would have been enraptured by big hulking men in kilts throwing telephone poles around, so it may be just as well.</p>
<p>Our journey will begin in Inverness, where my mother was born, and where our clan made its greatest impression (my ancestor, Duncan Forbes, built the monument at the Culloden battlefield). Then we will wind our way along the Whisky Coast, where we&#8217;ll visit some distilleries and sample a nip or two of Scotch. After that it&#8217;s down toward Glasgow for a visit with our pal Chef Tom Lewis of Monachyle Mhor &#8212; this part excites me terribly, because we&#8217;re going to make a clootie dumpling. That damnable recipe has eluded me for nearly a decade, and I *will* get it right. Though I am waiting for Mom to get after him while we&#8217;re in the kitchen if he doesn&#8217;t do something the way she remembers. This is going to be a hoot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be spending some time with my cousins in dear old Glaesgae, where they will speak to me in sing-songy tones I&#8217;ll barely understand, but we&#8217;ll laugh and drink and play music until the wee hours.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping we have good internet access while we&#8217;re away so I can bring you along, but one never knows. &#8220;Access&#8221; is a relative term, I find. After our stint in Scotland we&#8217;ll be traveling on to Wales and the Costwolds, so this should be quite a fascinating trip. Lots more to come!</p>

You see, my pal Andy Husbands, chef/owner of <strong><a href="http://www.tremont647.com" target="_blank">Tremont 647</a></strong> in Boston&#8217;s South End, is making his debut this week on Hell&#8217;s Kitchen.</p>
<p>Andy and I became friends in Boston many moons ago, when I was cutting my teeth in the food world, and I liked him instantly because he&#8217;s full of sass, piss and vinegar. He also makes a killer Tibetan momo.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/" target="_blank"><strong>Hell&#8217;s Kitchen</strong></a> premiers Tuesday night, July 21, at 8PM. I guess maybe I&#8217;ll go plug in the television.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t get a chance to see Andy, and whether he wins or not, I highly recommend that you sample his goods at Tremont 647. The Taco Tuesday menus always make my mouth water. Note: These are normally Taco Wednesdays, but they are holding them on Tuesdays until Andy&#8217;s time on Hell&#8217;s Kitchen runs out. Get thee to Tremont Street!</p>
<p>Good luck, Andy! Break a&#8230;knife? (Or perhaps the jaw of an obnoxious chef?)</p>

- </em><em>Julia Child</em></p>
<p><em></em>â€œFull steam ahead.â€  It is a phrase that would serve as a mantra for the ebullient woman that was Julia Child.  This giant of character, spirit, and stature changed the meaning of cuisine for a culture with its feet firmly implanted in a quagmire of frozen dinners and canned, limp ingredients.</p>
<p>(Here is where I am supposed to say: â€œWe have come so far!â€  But have we?  More on that in a moment.)</p>
<p>As a child, I was enthralled with Julia.  Since PBS was the station of choice for my allotted television time, I often watched in piqued curiosity as she bombastically wielded her instruments around the kitchen.  And that voice.  Knowing no better, and given the name of her series (â€œ<em>The French Chefâ€</em>), I assumed she was indeed French, and that she and her countrymen all spoke in that funny pitch.  I distinctly remember being alarmed to discover she was American.</p>
<p>Because of Julia, I would often tie an apron around my waist and stand on a chair at my motherâ€™s kitchen counter, ingredients and cookbook at the ready, prepared to speak to my audience.  The window, a perfectly-centered camera, recorded every one of my gastronomic sermons.  Given that my only talent at the time was for baking Snickerdoodles, I canâ€™t imagine that my proselytizing was of much use to my viewers.</p>
<p>After reading NoÑ‘l Riley Fitchâ€™s biography of Julia, <em>Appetite for Life</em>, it is easy for me to say that I admire this spirited cook even more now than I did before.  Aside from being a true bon vivant and culinary legend, she was so fantastically independent in her thinking and actions that to me, she has become a personal hero.</p>
<p>At a time when it was taboo to do so, she remained single into her thirties, determined to marry a man about whom she was passionate, and with whom marriage would be fun.  Her husband Paul fit the bill admirably, and became her beloved partner in every way possible.  She railed against conventions she found insupportable, and staunchly believed that individuals should be responsible for themselves, turning her back on a president (FDR) whose policies she felt had gone too far in enabling the complacent.</p>
<p>What I loved most in exploring her life, however, was discovering that she had little patience for â€œtrendyâ€ food.  She wanted good, solid cooking, and held disdain for the entertainment spectacle the industry became in the later years of her life (though one can certainly say she kicked it off).  That she stayed true to her principles, and refused to sell out lest her objectivity lose its credibility, is a testament to her character.</p>
<p>Her lack of pretense made cooking an inviting topic for those who might initially feel daunted by taking on such a field of exploration.  She handled mistakes with humor, and insisted they were the only way to learn.  What a dame.</p>
<p>So, fifty years later, what have we learned?</p>
<p>Well, as I look around me, I see that despite her efforts, and the proliferation of cooking schools, shows, and chefs who spread the gospel, there are still woefully few who cook in this country.  When I say â€œcook,â€ I mean not from a package.</p>
<p>Yes, the packages have gotten prettier, and the ingredients better (in some cases), but how does that translate into culinary knowledge?  If people were paranoid about cholesterol in Juliaâ€™s time, look at their reactions to carbs now.  I would love to hear Julia respond to being chastised for making a cake laden with white flour and sugar!</p>
<p>Her mission was to ignite the passions of would-be cooks, to show them that solid skills opened a world of sensory possibilities.  She â€œbrought a new aesthetic to food, one based on the centrality of pleasure and tasteâ€ (<em>Appetite for Life</em>, p. 299); â€œshe celebrated her appetite, the joy of the kitchen, and the pleasure of food, a pleasure conveyed in the way she patted the bread dough and caressed the chickenâ€ (p. 301).</p>
<p>One can see the impact of her influence: We have passionate amateurs who take knife skills classes, install magnificent kitchens in their homes, and fully embrace the sensual experience that is preparing a meal.  A young woman named Julie Powell, seeking a meaningful experience, took <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em> and set out to prepare each one of its recipes within a year&#8217;s time.  She now has a book and a movie, and has garnered a legion of fans who cheered her on every step of the way. Some of her dishes were successful, and others a disaster, but the process evoked something powerfully fulfilling within her. For what task, in today&#8217;s world, could be more challenging (and frustrating) than teaching oneself traditional French technique â€” from a book?</p>
<p>But there are not enough of her â€” of us.  There are too many who dine out for the sake of being fashionable, rather than for the gustatory experience.  Cooking has become a circus, with a superstar in every ring.  Those devouring the spectacle do not participate â€” they are armchair travelers and cooks who live vicariously through a television chef, wearing their virtual toques.  Julia called them â€œfluffiesâ€ (p. 476).</p>
<p>To offer an eerie comparison from her time period: <em>Poppy Cannon, the can-opener queen, occasionally appeared nationally on CBSâ€™s Home show, demonstrating, for example, how to make vichyssoise with frozen mashed potatoes, one sautÃ©ed leek, and a can of Campbellâ€™s cream of chicken soupâ€ (p.296).</em></p>
<p><em></em>That same show, circa 2005, now appears five nights a week on the Television Food Network, touting â€œSemi-Homemade.â€  Everything old is new â€” and mind-numbingly unappetizing â€” again.</p>
<p>Those of us who do cook, however, savor the exploration of a world of ingredients, seeking knowledge of technique, history, taste, or the myriad of wonderful sensations to be found in the realm of gastronomy.  Our need to satiate our senses is a tribute to the spirit of Julia Child, who understood why it is preferable to take a small taste of something wonderful, rather than a bowl of something lackluster (or god forbid, fat-free). As Fitch so eloquently concluded, â€œ[Julia's] message was her philosophy of life: life is to be joyous, and joy comes from sensory pleasures shared with othersâ€ (p. 459). Amen.</p>
<p>Since this week marks what would have been La Grande Dame&#8217;s 93rd birthday, I will be sure to find myself a magnificent bottle of bubbly and offer a toast to her memory. For what you have brought to our lives, our country, and our cuisine, dear Julia, <em>bon app</em>Ã©<em>tit.</em></p>

<p>Though I would love to be indulgently pampering myself with a spa day right now, the very thought of such a luxury seems sadly far off. Having said that, my soul and skin need a little rejuvenation every now and then to keep the stress at bay.</p>
<p>For me, there&#8217;s nothing more sensually satisfying than baby-soft skin, and there are lots of ways to achieve this right at home. Here&#8217;s a little secret: Chefs swear by olive oil and kosher salt for exfoliating hands.</p>
<p>In the same vein, but a bit more delicate, is a scrub I use for my face: olive oil and table sugar. You only need a little of each to make a paste, and after delicately scrubbing your face with the mixture you&#8217;ll be left with silky smooth cheeks. And as a moisturizer it can&#8217;t be beaten.</p>
<p>Since I only use good olive oil in the kitchen, my face is treated to some extra-virgin goodness. What could be bad about that? :)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been experimenting with various home treatments, so I&#8217;d love to hear about your successes with them. Do you have any favorites?</p>

				<img src="http://api.tweetmeme.com/imagebutton.gif?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoodphilosophy.com%2Ftip-freezing-strawberries%2F&amp;source=foodphilosophy&amp;style=normal&amp;service=bit.ly&amp;b=2" height="61" width="50" /><br />

<p><img class="alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/images/strb-short.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" />As you might know, it&#8217;s national berry month, and as I try to eat in season as much as possible (or at least grab the goods while they&#8217;re in season), this can mean berry doldrums for the rest of the year. However, more and more tips are becoming available for preserving fresh fruits and vegetables, and I received a tip on freezing strawberries this morning from Janie Hibler, author of <strong><a style="&quot;border:none" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060085487?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gastronomicme-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060085487&quot;&gt;The Berry Bible: With 175 Recipes Using Cultivated and Wild, Fresh and Frozen Berries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Berry Bible</span></a></strong>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m liking this idea, as I can envision myself savoring strawberries with vanilla sugar over a nice shortcake come October or November. Can&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Here are Janie&#8217;s tips:</p>
<p>- Rinse strawberries and pour them onto a baking sheet lined with a paper towel.Â  Pat dry with another paper towel.<br />
- Put baking sheet in freezer until strawberries are completely frozen (about 2 hours depending on freezer temperature)<br />
- Transfer strawberries to self-sealing plastic freezer bags and place back into freezer.</p>
<p>It really doesn&#8217;t get much easier. Hibler insists on freezing the strawberries in exact portions, such as pints and quarts,  because strawberries become condensed when thawed (rendering them impossible to measure with accuracy).Â  She also recommends consuming frozen berries within a year for maximum freshness. â€œAfter that, ice crystals will start breaking down the berriesâ€™ flesh, and eventually they will lose their flavor,â€ adds Hibler.</p>
<p>You can see more ideas like this in <strong><a style="&quot;border:none" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060085487?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=gastronomicme-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060085487&quot;&gt;The Berry Bible: With 175 Recipes Using Cultivated and Wild, Fresh and Frozen Berries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Berry Bible</span></a></strong>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s that glorious time of year when farm stands are beginning to overflow with the season&#8217;s finest. Given my tactile nature, I always find myself drawn to the piles of gently fuzzed peaches, seemingly awaiting my greedy touch. My favorites are the elbow-drippers &#8212; once you&#8217;ve tasted such decadence, it&#8217;s practically impossible to eat any other kind of peach.</p>
<p>And though peaches are wonderful on their own, there is something to be said for the allure of caramelization. I&#8217;ve grown quite fond of grilled fruits in the past couple of years, and this recipe has become a favorite: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/grilled-peaches-with-coconut-milk-and-cinnamon-sugar/">Grilled Peaches with Cinnamon Sugar</a></strong></span></p>
<p>Simple and lustful, this recipe is ideal for using up that last bit of heat from the grill. You can substitute regular milk (or cream) for the coconut milk if you like. The peaches are a perfect foil for quality vanilla ice cream (look for the specks of vanilla!), and capture what is, for me, the essence of summer.</p>

<p>With all that&#8217;s happening around us, I find that my decadent and frugal sides are like rival angels on my shoulders. The stress of keeping so many balls in the air to keep things moving forward &#8212; seemingly without a minute to breathe &#8212; leaves me utterly worn out, and  there are times when I simply want to indulge myself. Of course, I also want to do this without making my wallet cry.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve read or heard me wax poetic on basil leaves, you know that I can find indulgence in seemingly ordinary places and things, so I&#8217;ve decided to share my favorite everyday ones with you. Let&#8217;s face it: We could all use  a little pick-me-up. Some indulgences will be food, some non-food, but all will relate to engaging the senses without  adding the stress of a big expense.</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll share yours, too, because I might run out of ideas and will need to pilfer. Oh, stop, I&#8217;ll give you credit for it.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, for me, self-indulgence begins with scents, and I like nothing more than smelling deliciously edible. I&#8217;ve given up on synthetic-smelling perfumes and instead turned to essential oils to soothe my soul. It&#8217;s no secret that aromatherapy can have a profound effect on one&#8217;s state of being, and I can think of no better atomizer than the neck. Hair also smells gorgeous with a little drop combed through the ends. Yum.</p>
<p>I discovered the joy of citrus oils after a massage in Los Angeles (back when massages were actually part of my decadent life), so I knew the scent of oranges would send me to my happy place. I found a combination that took it to a whole new level, however.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re wondering what I smell like, here&#8217;s your chance to be a voyeur (sniffeur?). For the past few months I&#8217;ve slathered myself with <a href="http://www.sunseyestore.com/products/herbal-ess.html" target="_blank">Vanilla Orange Oil from Sun&#8217;s Eye</a>. I love that there are  tiny slivers of orange peel soaking right in the oil, so you get the full power of both scents. The only drawback is that it needs to be reapplied several times a day, but at $6.75 a bottle, how could I possibly complain about that?</p>
<p>I have other scents that I use for other moods and occasions, but I&#8217;ll share those as we go. ;) Did I mention that vanilla is reputed to have an aphrodisiacal effect on the senses? Try it and let me know what happens.</p>

<p>As we hope you&#8217;ve noticed, we take a great deal of care in creating our work (understatement). We didn&#8217;t want to publish the book with any errors (the horror!), so we sent back the proof for another round of corrections.  Once we approve the final version, our first big order will be placed, so we expect to have books in inventory and ready to ship in early July. We are currently doing an elaborate ritual dance to keep the printing gremlins away.</p>
<p>If you have already ordered a book, you received a love letter from us today, and we thank you so much for being first in line. We&#8217;re sorry we can&#8217;t kiss you in person, because we love that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Now, for you <em>squillions</em> and <em>trillions</em> of people who will be ordering books between now and July 31st, we&#8217;d like to extend some of that love. <strong>If you <a href="https://shop.gildedfork.com/cp-app.cgi?usr=51J7103418&amp;rnd=4244572&amp;rrc=N&amp;affl=&amp;cip=&amp;act=&amp;aff=&amp;pg=prod&amp;ref=gfentathome&amp;cat=BOOKS&amp;catstr=" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">purchase our cookbook</span></a> before July 31st, we&#8217;ll send a free download link to the full-color digital version of the book as soon as it&#8217;s available.</strong> That way you can print out those pages and get <em>them</em> all messy instead of your pretty book. You can also see the recipe photos in their full glory.</p>
<p>In addition, we&#8217;ve created a Friends &amp; Family discount for you &#8220;early adopters,&#8221; so after purchase you&#8217;ll receive a special code to forward to your favorite fellow food fanatics. Say that five times fast. To learn more about the book, see our <a href="http://www.culinarymedianetwork.com/category/cookbooks/" target="_blank">full list of annoucements</a>, including a video of the unveiling of our galley copy. Or, you can just:</p>
