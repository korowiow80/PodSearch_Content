		<description><![CDATA[It's coming up on Christmas and lots of people will be buying iPods, Kindles and other gadgets for their loved ones.  I thought I might suggest a few ideas for the Geek Dad, which is probably what I qualify for.<br /><br />

In this version, I thought I would focus on some books I really enjoyed this year.  Links are affiliate links that will show you where to get audiobook downloads, CDs, ebooks or good old books made from dead trees.<br /><br />

Here's my list from my favorites this year.  I'm cheating a bit because some of these are series, not just individual books.<br /><br />

1.) <img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/daemon-unabridged1.jpg" alt="" title="daemon-unabridged[1]" width="95" height="95" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1631" /> My favorite of the year has to be <a href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/daemon-unabridged">Daemon</a> by Daniel Suarez.  This is actually a two part book with the second book called Freedom (TM).  This two book series is all about a mad scientist who dies and leaves behind a computer Daemon to take over and reform the world.  Lots of good geek stuff, action and an fun plot.  The book goes fast and the narrator in the audiobook version do a great job.<p><a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/2011/12/12/five-books-for-the-geek-dad/">Five Books for the Geek Dad</a> is a post from: <a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews">Digital Podcast</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s coming up on Christmas and lots of people will be buying iPods, Kindles and other gadgets for their loved ones.  I thought I might suggest a few ideas for the Geek Dad, which is probably what I qualify for.</p>
<p>In this version, I thought I would focus on some books I really enjoyed this year.  Links are affiliate links that will show you where to get audiobook downloads, CDs, ebooks or good old books made from dead trees.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my list from my favorites this year.  I&#8217;m cheating a bit because some of these are series, not just individual books.</p>
<p>1.) <img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/daemon-unabridged1.jpg" alt="" title="daemon-unabridged[1]" width="95" height="95" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1631" /> My favorite of the year has to be <a href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/daemon-unabridged">Daemon</a> by Daniel Suarez.  This is actually a two part book with the second book called Freedom (TM).  This two book series is all about a mad scientist who dies and leaves behind a computer Daemon to take over and reform the world.  Lots of good geek stuff, action and an fun plot.  The book goes fast and the narrator in the audiobook version do a great job.</p>
<p>2.)<img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/gunslinger-dark-tower-unabridged1.jpg" alt="" title="gunslinger-dark-tower-unabridged[1]" width="95" height="95" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1632" /> Next in line is the Dark Tower series from Stephen King.  The Dark Tower starts off with <a href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/gunslinger-dark-tower-unabridged">The Gunslinger</a> and then continues with six more books.  The first book introduces the gunslinger Roland Deschain of Gilead. Roland is kind of a knight of this other world.  He pursues a man he sees as evil called the Man in Black and eventually learns that he must find his way to the Dark Tower to resolve his demons.  This series is a masterpiece from Stephen King&#8217;s amazing mind.  It will keep your Dad going for a long time.</p>
<p>3.)<img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/moneyball-the-art-of-winning-an-unfair-game1.jpg" alt="" title="moneyball-the-art-of-winning-an-unfair-game[1]" width="95" height="95" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1633" />  <a href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/moneyball-the-art-of-winning-an-unfair-game">Moneyball</a> is a winner from Michael Lewis.  You probably saw the movie version, but the book is much better.  It reveals inside the world of baseball and the main guy of the book Billy Beane.  I really liked this book and recommend the audiobook to all who like a good story.  I also like The Big Short and Boomerang by Michael Lewis as well. These two focus on the big financial mess of the past few years and explain what really happened.  Excellent stuff if you ask me.</p>
<p>4.) <img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/unbroken-world-war-ii-story-survival-resilience-redemption1.jpg" alt="" title="unbroken-world-war-ii-story-survival-resilience-redemption[1]" width="95" height="95" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1634" />Next up on my list is <a href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/unbroken-world-war-ii-story-survival-resilience-redemption">Unbroken</a> by Laura Hillenbrand.  Wow! What a story this one is.  The main character is Louis Zamperini who in times of peace was a great athlete.  But war comes along as Japan bombs Pearl Harbor and Louis like many others is pulled into the war.  This book is his story.  Zamperini endures things you won&#8217;t believe.  It is a tail of a desperate struggle for survival in an environment of perpetual torture.  Just when you think things can&#8217;t get any worse, they do.  And it happens more than once.  Zamperini survives and becomes something of an inspiration.  This is the story that many of our grandfathers really endured.  It&#8217;s definitely worth the time to listen or read the book.</p>
<p>5.)<img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/hunger-games-unabridged1.jpg" alt="" title="hunger-games-unabridged[1]" width="95" height="95" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1635" /> Last on my list, here&#8217;s something I enjoyed that will connect the fathers and daughters out there.  The book is called <a href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/hunger-games-unabridged">The Hunger Games</a> by Suzanne Collins.  This is another sci-fi story of survival in the face of certain death.  In this story, the hero is a teenage girl who must find a way to fight and survive.  The book has two follow-on books in the saga.  While it&#8217;s clearly targeted to teenage girls and can be a bit gushy at times, The Hunger Games is an action packed, well told story that I think just about everyone will like.</p>
<p>I hope you find your Dad some thing great for Christmas.</p>

It seems that the fake bloggers have moved on to become Fake News sites.<br /><br />

The fake blog scam used a fake blog to show how the fake blogger had lost weight using 2 magic products they saw on Oprah.  They gave rave reviews to the products and had lots of fake comments too.  They link you to a site to get supposedly free samples.  If you signed up you got put on a monthly subscription for $70 per month or something like that, without really knowing you signed up for anything.<br /><br />

Ads for these kinds of sites were all over the internet, including the big search engines like Google.  Google took steps to stop in on their site by banning everyone whoever ran an ad to such a site.  They did it without appeal or warning.  Just banned people for life.  They banned me too because I had tested ads to see if they were hard to get approved.  They weren't hard to get approved.  Google had no problems with them until much later when the FTC got involved.  Despite Google's harsh treatment of its customers, at least you won't find those ads there any more.<br /><br />

Not so for Bing, Huffington Post, Fox News and other big name sites.  They still run ads for these scammers. <br /><br /><p><a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/2011/12/01/bing-huffington-post-fox-news-all-running-ads-for-scams/">Bing, Huffington Post, Fox News All Running Ads for Scams</a> is a post from: <a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews">Digital Podcast</a></p>

Google had no problems with them until much later when the FTC got involved.  Despite Google&#8217;s harsh treatment of its customers, at least you won&#8217;t find those ads there any more.</p>
<p>Not so for Bing, Huffington Post, Fox News and other big name sites.  They still run ads for these scammers.  The ads look like these and point to Fake News sites promoting wrinkle cream or weight loss or whatever.  </p>
<p>This first example is an ad from Bing, followed by ads from Huffington Post and Fox News.<br />
<img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/bingad.jpg" alt="" title="bingad" width="309" height="484" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1611" /></p>
<p>The one below is from the Huffington Post.<br />
<img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/huffingtonpostad.jpg" alt="" title="huffingtonpostad" width="321" height="254" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1610" /></p>
<p>This one is from Fox News:<br />
<img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/adsforfakenews1.jpg" alt="" title="adsforfakenews" width="405" height="254" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1626" /></p>
<p>These ads point to sites that look like these:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/fakenews.jpg" alt="" title="fakenews" width="480" height="434" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1619" /></p>
<p><img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/fakewrinklesite.jpg" alt="" title="fakewrinklesite" width="480" height="439" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1620" /></p>
<p>These sites claim to be advertisements at the top of the page.  But it&#8217;s not clear what part is an ad.  In fact the entire site is an ad with fake news stories, fake endorsements and fake comments.  They even disclaim that they are all fake at the bottom of the page in some really fine print in faded colars at the bottom of the page saying something like:</p>

You will be charged on same card provided today. If you wish to cancel, please call: xxxxxxxxxx If You have any questions about Our Risk Free Trial, please contact Our Customer Service Department toll-free at xxxxxxxx</p></blockquote>
<p>These sites are scams in my opinion.  They are no better than the fake blogs.  The FTC should take them down and sites like Bing, Huffington Post and Fox News should be fined for letting these kinds of ads run.</p>
<p>BTW if you look at the ads above that run on Huffington Post and Fox News, there is one titled Veterans Administration.  It is not any part of the real Department of Veterans Affairs, but it sure does a good job of sounding official.  My guess is that that&#8217;s some sort of scam too.</p>

With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King&#8217;s Landing. Robb Stark&#8217;s demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exi&#8230;<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is being widely reported that Amazon and the state legislature have declared truce in the ongoing effort to get Amazon to collect sales taxes.  In the deal that passed the legislature last Friday, Amazon and other online retailers get to delay collecting sales taxes until September 2012 so that they may try to lobby for a federal solution to the tax issue.  In exchange, Amazon is going to drop its proposed initiative to block the law.</p>
<p>Amazon had earlier offered to create 7,000 jobs in California by building multiple distribution centers in California.  Amazon still wants to do that and asked for safe harbor if they go ahead, but the legislature didn&#8217;t accept that.  They say that the opportunity to create jobs will have to wait until January.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s too bad that the only real sense of urgency in Sacramento is to collect more taxes and not to create more jobs.  They are giving Amazon the tax break anyway, so creating 7,000 jobs would be costless to the state.  But the people in Sacramento just don&#8217;t seem to care enough to deal with that now and prefer to wait four or five more months.  I guess they think four or five months of 7,000 people being unemployed isn&#8217;t worth their time.</p>
<p>As I write this, it is unclear what Gov. Brown will do &#8211; will he sign it, veto it or just let it go into law without his signature.</p>
<p>Whether Amazon will reinstate its affiliate program in California is also still up in the air, but it would be nice to see the 25,000 affiliates back in business creating jobs and paying taxes.  We can only wait and see.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sacramento Bee published an <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2011/09/01/3876555/amazon-offers-jobs-to-avert-ballot.html">article</a> describing Amazon&#8217;s new offer to California&#8217;s Governor Brown and the Legislature.  Amazon is apparently offering to spend tens of millions of dollars on new distribution centers in California and hire 7,000 people in exchange for the state delaying until 2014 a law requiring out of state retailers to collect sales tax for the state.</p>
<p>The law could mean that Amazon has to collect $200 million in sales taxes for the state.  But the status of the law is uncertain.  Amazon refuses to collect the sales tax.</p>
<p>As a result of the new law, Amazon terminated business relationships with 25,000 small businesses based in California to protect itself from having to to collect the sales tax.  This has cost the state lots of jobs and lost income taxes as well.</p>
<p>In addition, Amazon claims the law is unconstitutional and has started collecting signatures for a June referendum that would overturn the law. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/breaking-news/ci_18807177">Mercury News</a>, when Amazon submits signatures for its referendum by Sept. 27, the law requiring Amazon to pay taxes will be stayed until the June election. That would mean no revenues could be collected.</p>
<p>So on one side, Amazon spends lots of money in California to build distribution centers and creates 7,000 jobs and on the other side California will probably get nothing or at best only some part of $200 million.</p>
<p>The Democrats running the state are not that interested in Amazon&#8217;s offer and only seem interested in trying to collect more taxes.    Their most recent maneuver is to try to bypass a vote by citizens on Amazon&#8217;s referendum by passing the law again but this time with a two thirds majority.  Republicans don&#8217;t seem interested.</p>
<p>Unless the Democrats can make their end-run around the democratic process work, Amazon will have won the PR battle.  When the citizens get to vote on the law, they will know for certain that this law and our representatives in Sacramento have killed at least 7,000 certain jobs.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[My time with Steve Jobs happened a very long time ago.  It was early 1980, or perhaps late 1979, and I was a freshman at Stanford.  I heard that Steve Jobs was coming to talk to some students in a small group session.  I don't actually recall why it caught my attention. I had probably heard of Apple computers back then, but I had never seen one.  The only computers I had ever seen where in huge boxes behind thick glass windows.<br /><br />

Somehow, I decided to go to the event.  It was over in Branner Hall across the street from my dorm complex, Wilbur.  We met in a big room. It was kind of dark and had a fireplace.  I did a quick search on Branner and found a picture of the room.<img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/branner_common1.jpg" alt="" title="branner_common[1]" width="225" height="176" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1585" /><br /><br />

We all settled in with Jobs sitting down at the head of our circle.  He was a young guy.  Full of energy.  I listened with great interest to what he had to say.  The thing I remember was his vision of what computers would look like in our future and his excitement about the day his vision would come true.<p><a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/2011/08/26/my-time-with-steve-jobs/">My Time With Steve Jobs</a> is a post from: <a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews">Digital Podcast</a></p>

The thing I remember was his vision of what computers would look like in our future and his excitement about the day his vision would come true.</p>
<p>His vision was not the Mac.  What he talked about was a computer so small it fit in our hands.  It would go with us every where.  It would be our personal navigator.  His enthusiasm was so clear and intense.  Even though it sounded like science fiction given the computers we had at the time.</p>
<p>We had about an hour of Jobs&#8217; time that evening, but his vision of a personal navigator always stuck with me.</p>
<p>I remember later breaking into the computer science building to get access to a computer with a modem, as I must have run out of hours at the computer lab.  I wandered around a bit until I came upon a room with <img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/xerox_star.jpg" alt="" title="xerox_star" width="220" height="309" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1591" />some computer monitors and modems.  Sitting next to the terminal was another monitor.  This one was way cooler.  It was something called a Star computer.  I had never seen anything like it.  It had a completely different screen and you could move the arrow around on the screen with this thing attached by a cord.  I didn&#8217;t know it was a mouse.  I played with it for half an hour trying to see what I could do with it.  It didn&#8217;t seem to be able to do much of interest.  I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to connect it to the Dec System 20 which is what I needed.</p>
<p>Even though it was not much use, it seemed very cool and I remember wondering in passing if Jobs had seen this thing.  It turns out that the Star was one of the inspirations for the Lisa and later Mac.</p>
<p>In the mid to late 80s, I would own a few Macs and use them all the time at work.  They were great until they were not.  In came the Thinkpad and I have been locked into Wintel ever since.</p>
<p>In the mid 90&#8217;s, Apple released the Newton.  I thought then that Jobs&#8217; vision might be coming a reality with a Jobs less Apple.  Like other enthusiasts I bought a Newton.  I used it for a while, but it wasn&#8217;t easy.  It was kind of hard to use, it was too big and way too heavy.  The Newton failed and the Pilot took its place.<img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/430px-Apple_Newton_MP1001-215x300.jpg" alt="" title="430px-Apple_Newton_MP100[1]" width="215" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1586" /></p>
<p>But obviously, Jobs was not done.  He gave us the iPod, the iPod touch and iPhone and now the iPad.  He did it.  He delivered on his vision from 1980.  These cool devices have become our personal navigators in so many ways.</p>
<p>I never met Steve Jobs again since that evening in Branner Hall.  It was a short, but memorable time.</p>
<p>Whatever Steve Jobs does next, I wish him well.  It would be interesting to hear Steve give that Branner talk one more time.  What would his vision be now?</p>
<p>BTW, if you haven&#8217;t seen Jobs giving the commencement speach at Stanford you should.  It&#8217;s quite inspirational.  You can see the <a href="http://thebitt.com/2010/10/12/how-to-live-before-you-die-by-steve-jobs/">video here &#8211; How to Live Before you Die</a>.</p>

<p>On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. <br />Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane&#8217;s bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War. <br />The lieutenant&#8217;s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyho&#8230;<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/spotify-150x1501.jpg" alt="spotify logo" title="spotify logo" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1570" />I was recently invited to sign up for <a href="http://www.spotify.com/us/hello-america/">Spotify</a>, an online music service that has been big in Europe for a number of years and is just now coming to America.</p>
<p>So, I signed up.  Pretty easy to do.  Then, I was somewhat surprised that Spotify is a downloadable application that runs on your computer.  I downloaded it, ran the install and fired it up.</p>
<p>Within seconds it was up and running, importing all my music from my iTunes folder.  It got everything, except the files Apple DRMed into prison.</p>
<p>The application seems much lighter and faster than iTunes, which is a welcome change.  It looks sexy, with a grey/black background and white font.  (Makes it harder to read though.)    You can see the screenshot below:<br />
<img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/spotify-screen-shot.jpg" alt="Spotify What&#039;s New" title="spotify-screen-shot" width="450" height="359" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1571" /><br />
Next up, it asked if I wanted to sync my iPhone/iPod or Android device.  I wasn&#8217;t about to test this on my iPod, so I tried the Android approach.  I had to download the Android app to phone and install that. All I had to do was enter my name and password for it to start syncing.  Worked great, until it didn&#8217;t.  </p>
<p>It stopped and complained about memory problems.  I looked and there was still plenty of memory available. Turn the app off and on, then an error message about my memory card.  Turned in off and on again.  Uninstalled and re-installed.  Still got the error message.  Finally turned the phone off and on and that got it working again.</p>
<p>Spotify tried to push 2500 songs to my Android, which choked as it ran our of memory.</p>
<p>I tried to un-select some play lists thinking that would take them off my Android, but that does not seem to work.  Syncing seems to be limited to pushing songs from my PC to the Android phone, not taking them off the Android. Now my memory card is full and I&#8217;m not sure what to do.</p>
<p>I do wish the sync would work right.  It should add and delete songs from my Android as I select them in the Spotify app.  Maybe I&#8217;m doing something wrong, but I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>I decided to forget the phone for now and check out the Spotify desktop app.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to play with.  You can listen to just about everything out there music wise, except the Beatles and few others.  They insert some ads every now and then but that&#8217;s ok.  You can get rid of the ads for $5 per month and for $10 you can have the same streaming experience on your mobile device.</p>
<p>Another nice feature is that the system integrates with Facebook so you can share play lists with Facebook friends. </p>
<p>Overall, I liked Spotify a lot, but it&#8217;s not quite an iTunes killer until the mobile syncing stuff works much better and without glitches.</p>
<p>iTunes is certainly vulnerable.  On my machine, iTunes is bloated, slow and glitchy.  It constantly asks to be updated with a cumbersome process. Spotify is slim, fast and aside from the syncing issues seems to work well.  However, iTunes still seems to lead on the syncing front, which means I continue to be stuck using iTunes until Spotify works better with my mobile.</p>

The <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/initiatives/pdfs/i952_11-0019_referendum.pdf">petition</a> was <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/initiatives/pdfs/i952_title_and_summary_11-0019_final.pdf">approved by the Attorney General</a> and Amazon can now go on to collect signatures to try and get it on the ballet.</p>
<p>I tried reading the <a href="http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/initiatives/pdfs/i952_11-0019_referendum.pdf">petition</a>, but it&#8217;s a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo to me.  The Attorney Generals title and summary are as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>REFERENDUM TO OVERTURN LAW REQUIRING INTERNET RETAILERS TO COLLECT SAME SALES OR USE TAXES AS OTHER RETAILERS.  If signed by the required number of registered voters and filed with the Secretary of State, this petition will place on the statewide ballot a challenge to an existing state law.  The law must be approved by voters at the next statewide election to remain in effect.  the law expands the definition of retailers considered &#8220;engaged in business&#8221; in California to include certain Internet retailers selling to California consumers, so that out-of-state Internet retailers also collect existing sales or use taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s easier to read than the petition, but I still don&#8217;t know what their talking about.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to watch Amazon fight it out with the Wal-Mart shill Main Street Alliance and labor unions.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the summer of 1991 I was a normal kid. I did normal things. I had friends and a mother who loved me. I was just like you. Until the day my life was stolen. For eighteen years I was a prisoner. I was an object for someone to use and abuse. For eighteen years I was not allowed to speak my own name. I became a mother and was forced to be a sister. For eighteen years I survived an impossible situation. On August 26, 2009, I took my name back. My name is Jaycee Lee Dugard. I dont think of myself as a victim. I survived. A Stolen Life is my story in my own words, in my own way, exactly as I remember it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">-Jacyee Dugard</p>
<p>Tina Jordan, of Entertainment Weekly wrote a <a href="http://shelf-life.ew.com/2011/07/14/reading-jaycee-dugards-a-stolen-life/?iid=rcfooter-books-jaycee+dugard%3A+%27life%27+reclaimed">great review of the book</a>.  She concludes &#8220;I didn’t finish the book thinking she was damaged.  I finished it feeling blown away by her courage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ms. Dugard tells a most compelling story that is worth listening to.  Maybe her telling the story will make people pay a bit more attention to what&#8217;s going on around them.</p>

The new legislation is part of the budget package recently approved by the California Assembly and Senate.  The legislation is an attempt to get Amazon to collect sales taxes by claiming that independent affiliates who choose to promote Amazon on a pay for performance basis create nexus for Amazon.  </p>
<p>The Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional for States to force out-of-state retails to collect sales tax.  California is trying to bypass this rule by claiming independent companies create a nexus for Amazon.  It will likely end up in the courts, but not before lots of people lose their jobs.</p>
<p>The only thing that could turn this around is if Gov. Brown comes to his senses and vetoes the bill.</p>
<p>My condolences to all who have lost a job or a livelihood today.</p>
<p>Below is a copy of the letter being sent to Amazon&#8217;s California Affiliates:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello,</p>
<p>For well over a decade, the Amazon Associates Program has worked with thousands of California residents. Unfortunately, a potential new law that may be signed by Governor Brown compels us to terminate this program for California-based participants. It specifically imposes the collection of taxes from consumers on sales by online retailers &#8211; including but not limited to those referred by California-based marketing affiliates like you &#8211; even if those retailers have no physical presence in the state.</p>
<p>We oppose this bill because it is unconstitutional and counterproductive. It is supported by big-box retailers, most of which are based outside California, that seek to harm the affiliate advertising programs of their competitors. Similar legislation in other states has led to job and income losses, and little, if any, new tax revenue. We deeply regret that we must take this action.</p>
<p>As a result, we will terminate contracts with all California residents that are participants in the Amazon Associates Program as of the date (if any) that the California law becomes effective. We will send a follow-up notice to you confirming the termination date if the California law is enacted. In the event that the California law does not become effective before September 30, 2011, we withdraw this notice. As of the termination date, California residents will no longer receive advertising fees for sales referred to Amazon.com, Endless.com, MYHABIT.COM or SmallParts.com. Please be assured that all qualifying advertising fees earned on or before the termination date will be processed and paid in full in accordance with the regular payment schedule.</p>
<p>You are receiving this email because our records indicate that you are a resident of California. If you are not currently a resident of California, or if you are relocating to another state in the near future, you can manage the details of your Associates account here. And if you relocate to another state in the near future please contact us for reinstatement into the Amazon Associates Program.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, we would like to clarify that this development will only impact our ability to offer the Associates Program to California residents and will not affect their ability to purchase from Amazon.com, Endless.com, MYHABIT.COM or SmallParts.com.</p>
<p>We have enjoyed working with you and other California-based participants in the Amazon Associates Program and, if this situation is rectified, would very much welcome the opportunity to re-open our Associates Program to California residents. We are also working on alternative ways to help California residents monetize their websites and we will be sure to contact you when these become available.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>The Amazon Associates Team</p></blockquote>

Need a great gift?  Think audiobooks.<br /><br />
I'm a Dad and I love audiobooks, so I thought I would share my top 10 recommendations based on my listening the past year.  Just so you know, I like tech stuff, interesting business, action, thrillers and good reads.  The list is short of classics, but everyone of these books will keep your Dad interested and listening through to the end.<br /><br />

<a title="The Big Short" href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/big-short-doomsday-machine-unabridged">The Big Short by Michael Lewis</a><br /><br />

This is for the business oriented Dad's out there.  Michael Lewis tells the fasinating story of how the banks, regulators, rating agencies and hedge funds caused the big Recession.  I think everyone should listen to this book and you will have a much better understanding of who screwed up the world economy. Warning, you might be mad after listening to this book, but at least you'll be mad at the right people.<br /><br />

<a title="The Gunslinger" href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/big-short-doomsday-machine-unabridged">The Gunslinger by Stephen King</a><br /><br />

This audiobook is for the Stephen King fan.  It is the first book in King's master series called  The Dark Tower.  The story is dark, troubling and well told.  I really enjoy King's work and the The Dark Tower is worth the the time and listening effort.  This book is just the beginning, but it will get your Dad hooked on Stephen King.<p><a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/2011/06/13/10-audio-books-for-fathers-day/">10 Audio Books for Father&#8217;s Day</a> is a post from: <a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews">Digital Podcast</a></p>

<p>If you didn&#8217;t know, Father&#8217;s Day in the US is coming up next Sunday, June 19, 2011.  Need a great gift?  Think audiobooks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a Dad and I love audiobooks, so I thought I would share my top 10 recommendations based on my listening the past year.  Just so you know, I like tech stuff, interesting business, action, thrillers and good reads.  The list is short of classics, but everyone of these books will keep your Dad interested and listening.</p>
<p><a title="The Big Short" href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/big-short-doomsday-machine-unabridged">The Big Short by Michael Lewis</a></p>
<p>This is for the business oriented Dad&#8217;s out there.  Michael Lewis tells the fasinating story of how the banks, regulators, rating agencies and hedge funds caused the big Recession.

I really enjoy King&#8217;s work and the The Dark Tower is worth the the time and listening effort.  This book is just the beginning, but it will get your Dad hooked on Stephen King.</p>
<p><a title="Unbroken" href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/unbroken-world-war-ii-story-survival-resilience-redemption">Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand</a></p>
<p>This book was really compelling.  In this true story, the WWII hero of the book goes through the unimaginable and survives, only to have to do it over and over again.  You find yourself wondering how things can get worse and they do.  But Louis Zamperini, remains resilient and unbroken, and ulitimately finds the peace of redemption.  Well written, well read.  At times it will break your heart, but it&#8217;s a story worth knowing.</p>
<p><a title="Do the Work" href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/do-the-work-unabridged">Do The Work by Stephen Pressfield</a></p>
<p>This is for the creative Dad; the author, programmer or artist who must overcome the forces of resistence to find way to Do the Work.  The book shows resistence for what it is, and provides inspiration to do battle with the Resistence Monster.  It&#8217;s short, but really enjoyable.</p>
<p><a title="True Grit" href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/true-grit-unabridged">True Grit by Charles Portis</a></p>
<p>What can I say?  Did you see the movie?  Now listen to the story, and your Dad will enjoy it all over again.</p>
<p><a title="The Passage" href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/true-grit-unabridged">The Passage By Justin Cronin</a></p>
<p>This is a big book and a big sci-fi, thriller story.  The scientists have created something monsterous, man is almost wiped out and must fight to make a come back.  The story line may seem familiar, but this is a really good telling of the story.  I read this first as a book and enjoyed it so much I got the audiobook version to listen to the performance all over again.</p>
<p><a title="The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/girl-dragon-tattoo-unabridged">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson</a></p>
<p>The first in a well written trio of books.  Action, mystery and some wierd but interesting charactors.  It&#8217;s a good audiobook for Dad&#8217;s that just need a fun escape from the real world.</p>
<p><a title="Daemon" href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/daemon-unabridged">Daemon by Daniel Suarez</a></p>
<p>This was the book that got me started on audiobooks.  Dad&#8217;s who like facebook and action thrillers will enjoy this twist on a dangers and benefits of a networked world.  It&#8217;s fun and there&#8217;s a sequel your Dad will want too.</p>
<p><a title="Outliers" href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/outliers-story-success-unabridged">Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell</a></p>
<p>Gladwell always finds a twist, something right there in plain site, but often unseen.  In this book, Gladwell explores outliers in performance.  Is there something that can explain why some people are just exceptional at some things?  Gladwell does a nice job exploring the issue.  I especially enjoyed the connections between when your kids are born and there chances of doing well in a particular sport depending on the cut off dates for different age groups.</p>
<p><a title="In The Plex" href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/in-the-plex-how-google-thinks-works-and">In The Plex by Stephen Levy</a></p>
<p>Another one for the tech Dad. In The Plex goes undercover at Google.  It explores what may be the most important company in the world and how it works.  It reveals the unapologetic culture that has come to rule so much of the internet.  You get to see Google turned inside out.</p>
<p>So there you have it, my list of audiobook recommendations for Father&#8217;s Day.  Hope you find something great for your Dad.</p>

<strong>The Happiness Project By Gretchen Rubin</strong></a>  <br />

<a href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/happiness-project-unabridged"><img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/happiness-project-unabridged1.jpg" alt="" title="happiness-project-unabridged[1]" width="175" height="175" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1522" /></a>Why I Spent a Year Trying to Sing in the Morning, Clean My Closets, Fight Right, Read Aristotle, and Generally Have More Fun Gretchen Rubin had an epiphany one rainy afternoon in the unlikeliest of places: a city bus. "The days are long, but the years are short," she realized. "Time is passing, and I'm not focusing enough on the things that really matter." In that moment, she decided to dedicate a year to her happiness project. In this lively and compelling account of that year, Rubin carves out her place alongside the authors of best-selling memoirs such as Julie and Julia , The Year of Living Biblically , and Eat, Pray, Love . With humor and insight, she chronicles her adventures during the 12 months she spent test-driving the wisdom of the ages, current scientific research, and lessons from popular culture about how to be happier. Rubin didn't have the option to uproot herself, nor did she really want to; instead she focused on improving her life as it was. Each month she tackled a new set of resolutions: give proofs of love, ask for help, find more fun, keep a gratitude notebook, forget about results. She immersed herself in principles set forth by all manner of experts, from Epicurus to Thoreau to Oprah to Martin Seligman to the Dalai Lama to see what worked for her - and what didn't. Her conclusions are sometimes surprising - she finds that money can buy happiness, when spent wisely; that novelty and challenge are powerful sources of happiness; that "treating" yourself can make you feel worse; that venting bad feelings doesn't relieve them; that the very smallest of changes can make the biggest difference - and they range from the practical to the profound. <p><a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/2011/04/19/5-audio-books-for-mothers-day/">5 Audio Books for Mother&#8217;s Day</a> is a post from: <a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews">Digital Podcast</a></p>

The daughter of a Danish immigrant and a black G.I., Rachel survives a family tragedy only to face new challenges. Sent to live with her strict African-American grandmother in a racially divided Northwest city, she must suppress her grief and reinvent herself in a mostly black community. A beauty with light brown skin and blue eyes, she attracts much attention in her new home. The world wants to see her as either black or white, but that&#8217;s not how she sees herself. Meanwhile, a mystery unfolds, revealing the terrible truth about Rachel&#8217;s last morning on a Chicago rooftop. Interwoven with her voice are those of Jamie, a neighborhood boy who witnessed the events, and Laronne, a friend of Rachel&#8217;s mother. Inspired by a true story of a mother&#8217;s twisted love, The Girl Who Fell from the Sky reveals an unfathomable past and explores issues of identity at a time when many people are asking, &#8220;Must race confine us and define us?&#8221; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/major-pettigrew-stand-novel-unabridged"><strong>Major Pettigrew&#8217;s Last Stand By Helen Simonson</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/major-pettigrew-stand-novel-unabridged"><img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/major-pettigrew-stand-novel-unabridged1.jpg" alt="" title="major-pettigrew-stand-novel-unabridged[1]" width="175" height="175" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1524" /></a>You are about to travel to Edgecombe St. Mary, a small village in the English countryside filled with rolling hills, thatched cottages, and a cast of characters both hilariously original and as familiar as the members of your own family. Among them is Major Ernest Pettigrew (retired), the unlikely hero of Helen Simonson&#8217;s wondrous debut. Wry, courtly, opinionated, and completely endearing, Major Pettigrew is one of the most indelible characters in contemporary fiction, and from the very first page of this remarkable novel he will steal your heart. The Major leads a quiet life valuing the proper things that Englishmen have lived by for generations: honor, duty, decorum, and a properly brewed cup of tea. But then his brother&#8217;s death sparks an unexpected friendship with Mrs. Jasmina Ali, the Pakistani shopkeeper from the village. Drawn together by their shared love of literature and the loss of their respective spouses, the Major and Mrs. Ali soon find their friendship blossoming into something more. But village society insists on embracing him as the quintessential local and her as the permanent foreigner. Can their relationship survive the risks one takes when pursuing happiness in the face of culture and tradition? </p>

<a href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/breakfast-with-socrates-the-philosophy-of-everyday-life"><img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/breakfast-with-socrates-the-philosophy-of-everyday-life1.jpg" alt="" title="breakfast-with-socrates-the-philosophy-of-everyday-life[1]" width="175" height="175" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1525" /></a>Breakfast with Socrates explains what history&#8217;s greatest thinkers would say about everything we do each day, from heading to work, through going to the gym, making dinner and falling back to sleep. We rarely think about how these everyday activities relate to wider ideas about the world, but Robert Rowland Smith illuminates the connections with wit, warmth and authority. In this hour-by-hour commentary on a single day in our lives, you&#8217;ll find Lucretius explaining why it&#8217;s good to be unprepared and Emerson advising you on booking a holiday. You&#8217;ll get insight from Jung about your dreams, thoughts from Mill on bunking off, and the lowdown on sex from Aristophanes. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/parisians-adventure-history-paris-unabridged"><strong>Parisians: An Adventure History of Paris By Graham Robb</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.castlibrary.com/audio_books/parisians-adventure-history-paris-unabridged"><img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/parisians-adventure-history-paris-unabridged1.jpg" alt="" title="parisians-adventure-history-paris-unabridged[1]" width="175" height="175" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1526" /></a>This is the Paris you never knew. From the Revolution to the present, Graham Robb has distilled a series of astonishing true narratives, all stranger than fiction. A young artillery lieutenant, strolling through the Palais-Royal, observes disapprovingly the courtesans plying their trade. A particular woman catches his eye; nature takes its course. Later that night, Napoleon Bonaparte writes a meticulous account of his first sexual encounter. An aristocratic woman, fleeing the Louvre, takes a wrong turn and loses her way in the nameless streets of the Left Bank. For want of a map &#8211; there were no reliable ones at the time &#8211; Marie-Antoinette will go to the guillotine. Baudelaire, Baron Haussmann, the real-life Mimi of La Boheme, Proust, Charles de Gaulle (who is suspected of having faked an assassination attempt on himself in Notre Dame) &#8211; these and many more make up Robb&#8217;s cast of characters. The result is a resonant, intimate history with the power of a great novel. </p>

<p>Now what seems really interesting is that Cloud Drive is connected to the Cloud Player, an Android app.  There is no Cloud Player on iOS. There is no Windows Phone version. It&#8217;s all about Android.  Last week they launched an app store for Android.  Look out for video and other content next.<a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/223654-amazon-cloud-player-android_original1.jpg"><img src="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/223654-amazon-cloud-player-android_original1.jpg" alt="" title="223654-amazon-cloud-player-android_original[1]" width="180" height="320" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1514" /></a></p>

So what is SoundCloud:<br /><br />

<blockquote>SoundCloud is an audio platform that enables anyone to upload, record, promote and share their originally-created sounds across the internet, in a simple, accessible and feature-rich way. From sample to symphony and soundbite to soliloquy, SoundCloud allows sound creators anywhere to instantly record audio on the site or via mobile applications and share them publicly or privately; to embed sound across websites, social networks and blogs and receive feedback from the community.
<br /><br />
SoundCloud's open platform also supports a wide range of applications built on the SoundCloud API, enabling everything from mobile voice recording, online mastering, digital distribution to Facebook artist profiles and iPad music making. SoundCloud offers free accounts to amateur creators, with more advanced users able to upgrade to premium accounts for advanced features like statistics, controlled distribution and custom branding.</blockquote><br /><br />

And now they are going to <a href="http://blog.soundcloud.com/2011/01/13/calling-all-podcasters/">support podcast RSS feeds</a>:<p><a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/2011/01/19/soundcloud-social-hosting-for-your-podcast/">SoundCloud &#8211; Social Hosting For Your Podcast</a> is a post from: <a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews">Digital Podcast</a></p>
