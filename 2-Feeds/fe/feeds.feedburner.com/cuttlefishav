			<title>Raspberry Pi - First Impressions</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>My Raspberry Pi has arrived! The diminutive computer came through the door in an unassuming packet direct from Element 14 (Farnell) 10 weeks or so after I placed my order. This was pretty much when they said it would arrive, so I have no complaints.</p><p>To get it working you first need to download an operating system from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads">Raspberry Pi website</a>. I downloaded Debian 6 because it's nice and familiar - although other operating systems are available. You have to install the operating system on to an SD card using a software utility. I followed some instructions I found <a rel="external" href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup">here</a>. Next you simply plug the SD card into the Pi, add a USB mouse and keyboard and connect it to your TV via an HDMI cable. Finally, you will need a micro USB power supply. I used the one from my Kindle.</p><p>As soon as you plus the power supply in to the device it starts to boot up. You get the classic Linux loading screen with lots of messages as the system boots and reports on progress. A word of warning. I initially used a 16Gb Sandisk Ultra SD card but the boot process hung half way through saying "Waiting for hardware interrupt". I then tried a 4Gb card and everything worked fine, giving me the login prompt at the end.</p><p>The username is "pi" and the password is "raspberry". Once logged in you get the system prompt. Typing "pwd" will show where you are in the file system. Linux/Unix users will know what to do from here. I used "apt-get" to download a graphic interface. But I actually don't think I needed to do this. Just type "startx" and a desktop should appear. Next, I opened the "Minori" web browser to see how my website looked (pretty good!). Finally, I followed the instructions <a rel="external" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=5577">here</a> and installed the Chrome browser and had a proper test.</p><p>My first impressions are that the Pi is exactly what the creators say it is. It's a fully fledged computer running Linux suitable for programming and experimentation. As you would expect for the money it's a bit sluggish, but not overly so. It comes with plenty of programming tools to help you get the most out of the resources available.</p><p>It runs Chrome fairly well so I should be able to use one to run my web-based artworks - such as ArtScanner and the Dropsketch viewer. When browsing the web I found that video playback was slow, but I know that it can run videos off of the SD card without a problem. I may also not be running an optimal system configuration yet.</p><p>That's it for now, I'll post again when I've had a more complete look around. I uploaded a few pictures <a rel="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/seancuttlefish/sets/72157629878265406/">here</a> on Flickr.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Squid Soup Infestation at Phoenix Square</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>There is a great - albeit creepy - installation on at <a rel="external" href="http://www.phoenix.org.uk/">Phoenix Square</a> at the moment. Infestation by Squid Soup is in the Cube and features a host of projected spiders and bugs that you can interact with! As you walk around you invariably end up squashing a few, but luckily plenty of new ones appear to replace them! It's great fun to play with and it on until the 10th June. See a few pictures <a rel="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/seancuttlefish/sets/72157629741972890/">here</a>, but to experience it properly get down to Phoenix Square.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Letters and Bridges Performance @ Interact</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The "Letters and Bridges" telematic performance took place at the Interact Gallery yesterday. Vocalists in Leicester and Mexico City performed a number of pieces together over a distance of 5,400 miles via a high-quality internet audio link.</p><p>There was one hick-up when the connection dropped, but on the whole the link worked very well and the audience was treated to an interesting, experimental, and very personal performance.</p><p>It was the result of a number of workshops and rehearsals led by Ximena Alarc&oacute;n as part of her Networked Migrations project. Pictures and video from the project can be found on the Interact Gallery website at <a rel="external" href="http://interactgallery.co.uk/networkedmigrations.html">http://interactgallery.co.uk/networkedmigrations.html</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<title>The News @ Two Queens</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I popped in to see the latest exhibition at Two Queens in Leicester today. The show is based on their recent live online event 'The News'.</p><p>When you arrive you are greeted by a large pink 'shamanic' figure. I saw this being made when I tuned in to the live broadcast and he looks even more impressive in the flesh/plaster. There are then assorted props and detritus (or rather 'archival materials') from the event, plus video and projections.</p><p>Make of it what you will. I rather enjoyed it. I particularly like the fact that emerging local artists have taken the initiative to create a space like this. 'The News' is on for a week. Go to the <a rel="external" href="http://2queens.com/">2queens.com</a> for more information and directions. Here are some <a rel="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/seancuttlefish/sets/72157629696385628/">pictures</a> from the show.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Computer Arts Society Talks and Website</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I gave a talk at the Computer Arts Society in London earlier in the week. It was a good opportunity to present some of the work I have created during my PhD research and the small, but appreciative, audience seemed to like it.</p><p>For those who don't know, the Computer Arts Society was established in 1968 and can list many illustrious past and present artists and theorists amongst it's members.</p><p>Talks are normally held in London, but I have been keen on running events under the CAS banner in Leicester. To this end we have two talks at Phoenix Square coming up - one next week by Genetic Moo about their work and another towards the end of May by Dr Nick Lambert, current chair of the society.</p><p>Information about the society and the forthcoming talks can be found on the new Computer Arts Society website at <a rel="external" href="http://www.computer-arts-society.com/">http://www.computer-arts-society.com/</a>. Membership of the society is free and basically involves joining the CAS email list.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Simon Faithfull Talk / Muted Fnord Performance</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Last night was a good one. At 6pm Simon Faithfull gave a talk at <a rel="external" href="http://www.phoenix.org.uk/">Phoenix Square</a> about his "An Expanding Atlas of Subjectivity" exhibition. He talked about the motivations behind his work and discussed the Limbo app he now uses that was developed by Cuttlefish.</p><p>At 9pm things moved to <a rel="external" href="http://www.interactgallery.co.uk/">The Interact Gallery</a> where an exhibition of Simon's recent drawings will be running for the next six weeks. Then at 9:30pm <a rel="external" href="http://www.mutedfnord.net/">Muted Fnord</a> played downstairs at Fabrika with visuals by myself.</p><p>I hope to upload a video of Simon's talk towards the end of the week. Pictures from the Muted Fnord performance be found <a rel="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/seancuttlefish/sets/72157629525271068/">here</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Forthcoming Events</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I've put together a series of events for April/May 2012 with the support of Phoenix Square, The Interact Gallery and the Computer Arts Society. If they go well I'll look to do something similar in October/November 2012.</p><p><em>23rd April 2012</em><br /><strong>An Expanding Atlas of Subjectivity<br /></strong>Simon Faithfull<br />Phoenix Square, 6pm FREE<br /><a href="http://www.simonfaithfull.org/">www.simonfaithfull.org<br /></a><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/119318501533942/">http://www.facebook.com/events/119318501533942/</a></p><p>Simon Faithfull currently has an exhibition at Phoenix Square and The Interact Gallery. Learn more about his work and his exhibition at Phoenix Square in this fascinating talk from the internationally renowned artist. During the talk, Faithfull will discuss the development of his iPhone app and web based artwork Limbo and take part in a Q &amp; A with members of the audience.</p><p><strong>Muted Fnord</strong><br />The Interact Gallery, Fabrika. 9pm FREE<br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/308985445836589/">http://www.facebook.com/events/308985445836589/</a></p><p>The talk will be followed by a visit to The Interact Gallery (2 minutes walk away) to view Simon's most recent drawings plus a performance by local musicians Muted Fnord.</p><p><em>9th May 2012</em><br /><strong>Genetic Moo<br /></strong>Nicola Schauerman and Tim Pickup<br />Phoenix Square, 7pm FREE<br /><a rel="external" href="http://www.geneticmoo.com/" title="External Link: http://www.geneticmoo.com/">www.geneticmoo.com<br /></a><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/407917592554209/">http://www.facebook.com/events/407917592554209/</a></p><p>Genetic Moo's Nicola Schauerman and Tim Pickup will discuss their interactive video installations where mutated human-sea-life forms both disgust and delight audiences. They will explain their inspirations, the technologies used, and possible future directions. To contextualise their practice, the talk will start with an introduction to computer-driven interactive art work, identifying a number of key works and concepts.</p><p>Genetic Moo have been creating interactive art since 2006. Virtual creatures are constructed from choreographed video clips, combining elements of the human and the animal. They respond in a variety of life-like ways to audience motion, sound and touch and vary in size from the tiny Animacules to the all encompassing Mother. The works are driven using Open Source and Flash Software utilizing a variety of interactive interfaces. The programming behind the work is just complex enough to make the creature appear more believable. The audience should be unaware and unencumbered by the technology. The audience asks "What am I looking at?", not "How is this working?". They ask "Is it Real?"</p><p><em>29nd May 2012</em><br /><strong>The Computer Arts Society From 1969 to the Present<br /></strong>Dr Nick Lambert<br />Phoenix Square, 7pm FREE<br /><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/357604224280650/">http://www.facebook.com/events/357604224280650/</a></p><p>Although digital art is considered to be a recent phenomenon, it has its roots in the 1960s with Art and Technology and Cybernetics. The Computer Arts Society, founded in early 1969, acted as a catalyst for British and international artists experimenting with computers and set up several exhibitions of its own. It also fostered collaborations, discussed new developments and hosted heated arguments in its magazine PAGE. The CAS is still active today and its current Chair, Nick Lambert, will review its history and explain its current mission to develop a new appreciation for the digital arts in Britain.</p><p>Dr Nick Lambert is Lecturer in Digital Art and Culture at the VASARI Research Centre, School of Arts, Birkbeck, University of London.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Visuals for Muted Fnord</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I did some new visuals for the band <a rel="external" href="http://www.mutedfnord.net/">Muted Fnord</a> on Thursday night. It's not something I do so much of these days, but they asked and I like their sound so thought I'd say yes. It also gave me an opportunity to experiment with some new visual ideas that I plan to incorporate in to some future interactive artworks.</p><p>i went back to a visual style that I used to use when I did live visuals for Zion Train ten or so years ago - that is, mixing line drawings and schematics with live and processed video. It always appealed to me aesthetically, and it still seems relevant to my current work, which is often about the different ways we can see the world - be it in a reductionist way (where everything is broken down in to parts and labled) or in a system-like way (where the world is seen a unified whole of interacting parts).</p><p>The raw materials I used included a sequence of video clips I recorded at Leicester market, slowed down and abstracted until only the colours and rhythms of the movement remain, plus botanical drawings of plants, anatomical drawings of the human skeleton and schematics of machines. I then added an image of the Emperor Julian II that I scanned from a 1,500 year-old roman coin and a quote about the world being "one living thing" that came from a translation his writings. The whole lot was then mixed live using one of my sound responsive Max/MSP/Jitter patches.</p><p>Of course, I didn't expect anyone at the show to pick up on all of these elements, but I think it make for an interesting visual mix and the feedback seemed positive.</p><p>I think that the next versions of my Memory Mirror artworks will include some of these elements, indeed I've already been surreptitious placing the image of Julian around Leicester so that when I come to use it in a installation piece it will have a subtle familiarity! Get a free badge from <a rel="external" href="http://onelivingthing.com/">here</a> if you like.</p><p>A collection of stills can be found <a rel="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/seancuttlefish/sets/72157629413689940/">here on Flickr</a> and there is a 15 minute video clip of Muted Fnord playing accompanied by the visuals <a rel="external" href="http://youtu.be/BHA93DH7qXY">here on YouTube</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Alan Turing Inspired Art Exhibition</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This year marks 100 years since Alan Turing's birth. Turing is seen by many as the father of artificial intelligence and modern computing and his work on decrypting German Enigma codes in world war two undoubtedly saved thousands of lives. He was also gay in time when this was regarded as "illegal". He was persecuted for his homosexuality to the extent that he took his own life at the age of just 42.</p><p>Amongst the tributes to Alan Turing in this centenary year is a touring exhibition of artwork inspired by his life and works. The most recent destination of the exhibition was the Workstation in Sheffield as part of the LoveBytes festival. I managed to make it up and spent a couple of hours looking at the work on display.</p><p>It was an interesting collection that included interactive and responsive work, robotics, sound art and prints. A robotic "artist" that made drawings of visitors seemed to get particular interest from the general public. I personally enjoyed seeing three of Roman Verostko's prints at close quarters - the level of detail is amazing.</p><p>I took quite a few pictures and have uploaded them to <a rel="external" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/seancuttlefish/sets/72157629294388312/">my Flickr page</a>. I'm hoping to bring the exhibition to Leicester later in the year. I'll announce this on my website as soon as everything is confirmed. For more information about the exhibition visit the website at <a rel="external" href="http://turingcentenaryarts.eu/">http://turingcentenaryarts.eu/</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Two Queens in Leicester</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I visited the new Two Queens Gallery and Studios in Leicester today to have a look at their first exhibition. The space (located appropriately at 2 Queens St, Leicester, in the Cultural Quarter) looked great, consisting of a large exhibition space downstairs with artists' studios upstairs.</p><p>The exhibition itself contains various mixed-media pieces that make use of light, water, projections and screens. There are some interesting ideas on show and it's a good statement of intent I think. It certainly places the gallery in a clear contemporary art context.</p><p>I'm really looking forward to seeing what the artist-led groups behind the space (CUSP and Vanilla Galleries) do with it. I'm sure it will become a valuable addition to the Leicester arts scene. You can find out more about the gallery at their website <a rel="external" href="http://2queens.com/">http://2queens.com/</a> and follow them on Facebook at <a rel="external" href="http://www.facebook.com/twoqueensleicester">http://www.facebook.com/twoqueensleicester</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Summer Sundae 2012</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I've been involved personally in Leicester's annual <a rel="external" href="http://summersundae.com/">Summer Sundae festival</a> since 2004 - initially working with Bathysphere on their stage and then being involved in the Summer Sundae Fringe festival (now known as the Leicester Fringe Festival) for five years.</p><p>In 2010 Cuttlefish got involved and produced an iPhone app for the festival. Last year we took over the festival website and produced an Android as well as iPhone app. I also ran an Interact Gallery off-site exhibition of Memory Mirror at the 2011 event.</p><p>This year we will have a similar level of involvement, with the website already being updated regularly with new announcements and a new version of the iPhone app appearing in the Apple App store a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>We've also added a few extra things to the festival's web infrastructure for 2012: there's now a Podcast series showcasing music from last and this year's line-up; we've also added a custom page/App to the Facebook site to promote ticket sales; and we plan to make a mobile web version of the line-up available to people who don't have iPhones or Android phones at the festival.</p><p>It's always interesting coming up with new ideas for how we can use the internet to help promote the festival. Technology is constantly developing and you sometimes have to make a real effort to keep pace with it. The big bonus with Summer Sundae, though, is that after the work's done you get to relax and have fun at the festival itself!</p>]]></description>

			<title>Jacktrip Workshop @ The Interact Gallery</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>The Interact Gallery held its first event as part of the <a rel="external" href="http://interactgallery.co.uk/networkedmigrations.html" title="External Link: http://interactgallery.co.uk/networkedmigrations.html">Network Migrations</a> project today in the form of a <a rel="external" href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/soundwire/software/jacktrip/" title="External Link: https://ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/soundwire/software/jacktrip/">Jacktrip</a> training session with the group in Mexico. As part of a three-way Skype connection between ourselves in Leicester, partners in Mexico and the Jacktrip tutor in Chile we learnt how the Jacktrip software works.</p><p>During the workshop we successfully used the software to make an audio connection with Columbia and are feeling quite confident that it will deliver what we need in the future. The plan is to use Jacktrip to create a high quality audio session between Leicester and Mexico for the Networked Migrations performance later in the month.</p>]]></description>

			<title>It's Raspberry Pi Time</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's not often something comes along that causes more fuss on the internet than Apple's latest offering but despite the imminent arrival of the iPad 3 the new <a rel="external" href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> computer is definitely grabbing the limelight at the moment. So why all the interest in this little computer?</p><p>Well, the first thing you notice is that it's cheap - very cheap. For just &pound;25 it aims to provide you with a fully-fedged computer that will run a real operating system.</p><p>Part of this cost saving is down to the fact that you can plug it in to your TV instead of buying a monitor. You'll also need to provide your own USB keyboard and mouse since these are not included. What's more it doesn't come with a hard drive - instead you'll need to use a cheap SD card to give the computer some storage. RAM is limited to 256Mb and the processor is more like the one you find in your smartphone rather than a desktop PC. In fact, the whole device has more in common with mobile phone hardware than the typical home computer.</p><p>You may be thinking that the device sounds is rather limited. Well yes it is (remember, it only costs &pound;25!), but Smartphone level computers are actually pretty powerful devices these days. If you run a efficient operating system on them (such as Raspberry Pi's Debian Linux) and include a decent graphics chip (like the Raspberry Pi has) you will indeed have a computer that will do most of the things we use current desktop computers for - web browsing, email, document editing and - within reason - gaming.</p><p>However, despite being capable enough, the Raspberry Pi is not really intended to be a cheap way of doing these sorts of things. Instead, the goal of the project is to ignite interest in computer programming and computer hardware development.</p><p>People my age who became interested in computers did so using the equivalent of stripped-down simple computers like the Raspberry Pi. The Acorn and Sinclair computers of my youth had only a fraction of the power of 'professional' computers of the time, but there were relatively cheap and most important of all they were straightforward to program. They were also very hackable. I remember soldering wires directly on the the board of my beloved ZX80 and building my own hardware voice synthesiser!</p><p>With the industry focus on ever increasing processing power to support ever larger operating systems and games, and young people being taught how to use applications rather than programming, the makers of the Raspberry Pi believe computing has lost something since those days.</p><p>Raspberry Pi hope that their device will get people doing real computing again. It's priced at the level of a textbook and hopefully every school pupil will one day have access to one.</p><p>A community is already starting to develop around the device and there seems to be a huge demand for the hardware. I've been lucky enough to get my order in and when it arrives I look forward to getting coding on it. I'll no doubt report back here once I have.</p>]]></description>

			<title>An Ecology of Mind London Premiere</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I went to the London premiere of Nora Bateson's <a rel="external" href="http://www.anecologyofmind.com/">An Ecology of Mind</a> film last night. I wrote about this film a couple of blog posts ago and thought that the London screening would be a good opportunity to see it on the big screen. Plus, Nora was there herself and there was a discussion panel after.</p><p>The film made even more sense second time around around, but the highlight was hearing Nora Bateson talking about her father's ideas and the making of the film. Her enthusiasm was infectious. The panel was less interesting for me - basically a series of monologues rather than a discussion.</p><p>More screenings are planned (check the website for details) and there was even talk of a sequel to the film. I hope this was a serious suggestion!</p>]]></description>

			<title>Pictures on the Radio</title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>I bought a little Chinese shortwave radio last week and by tuning in to a fax broadcast on 2618KHz last night and holding my iPhone near it while running an app called HF Fax I was able to receive this weather map. I was quite impressed. Radio has always fascinated me. Despite knowing broadly how it works (I have a radio license which I took an exam for ages ago), I still consider it to be basically magic.</p><p>All radio frequencies exist in the same place simultaneously, their waves travel around our world almost instantly and we can't see or touch them. Yet we not only managed to not only discover them in the first place, but are able to control them in such a way that within decades of discovery their use became essential to the modern world.</p><p>For a while I've been thinking about a project that would look to visualise the radio spectrum around you in a creative way - letting you see, hear and 'feel' the waves around you. Making the invisible, visible. I'll report back when I've made some progress.</p>]]></description>
