							<description>Practical situations are not common at all because the Lord is in them.  The Christ of scripture was content to move unknown and unseen.  Jesus was so noble and regal in His movements through the earth.  He didn't come to the healthy but to the sick.

And now indwelling us, He shows unbelievable respect for  those who are in need.  The Lord comes in all His dignity to our daily practical lives and we live watching Him and learning Who He is!!

							<description>Julie discovers that Christ arranged for her to meet and comfort a man in Home Depot. She said nothing but walked with him for a few minutes.

From that experience, she realized that she has been impacted by Body Life, especially by John's kindness and respect in the normal pathways of life.  Carole sees the Blood of Christ flowing and circulating through the one Body of the Church.

We are seeing the presence of Christ in our Body, through each one as He so naturally expresses His own Being.  'The self life at the core and at the end of it all is so wretched and pointless.'  Carole found the expression of Church in Ephesians 2:20-22.  Christ's indwelling is complete and energized!

This 'spiritual lesson' happened, of all places, in the chicken barn.  With humor and honesty, John tells the chicken story.  Jennifer saw it from another angle, that to attempt a task without God given authority is to experience a debacle!  And she tells her story of the bear-mauled dog.

							<title>Episode #275 - Knowing a Father</title>
							<description>Julie sees with joy that the Father has always been working in His plan for all of us so that we would know Who He is as a Father!  The Lord gave Julie a song in response to a podcast comment (from D in Michigan) a year ago. That insight deeply impacted Julie. Hear this lovely song: "Face to the Son."

							<title>Episode #274 - Knowing the Lord is ALL</title>
							<description>Shulamite Retreat considers 2011.  There is no way to measure a year's accomplishment since only God knows what HE accomplished.  Martha calls it "a strange empty year of fullness. This is a year He has both weakened us, struck where we are trying and shown us where we ARE weak -  in one form or another."

"The One Thing is to behold Him."   All we have to 'do' is see Him Who is the Vast Mystery of God.  All God wants is that we would see and know His Son. Don shares that He is all the provision we need.  God's plan is so perfect and we are to rely solely on Him.

							<title>Episode #271 - Abiding in His Love</title>
							<description>The Shulamite New Year retreat continues. . . Julie says everyone who is forgiven much, loves much. The irony of love is that when we are most transparent and needy, we are accepted and loved. But when we hide and lie, we are isolated from God's love and human love as well.  
"It's terrifying to open yourself up to love." 

 Jenn shares her year's experience of knowing Christ as King.  From seeing the Lord, she could then see Him in each person in our fellowship.

							<title>Episode #270 - Life and Death, Light and Darkness</title>
							<description>True fellowship in the Body of Christ is based on each member coming to the light as "He Himself is in the light," and "the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin."   (1 John 1:8,9)  That alone is fellowship!

The danger of the Last Days is clearly given us in scripture.  There will be many deceivers, even among ourselves, and we need life's experience of reality to develop discernment.  It's crucial that we live by a Hidden Life with God where we receive His marvelous grace and extend it to others.

							<title>Episode #264 - I AM The God Who Is Holy</title>
							<description>"I AM THE GOD WHO IS HOLY"  We don't really know that HE IS GOD nor that HE IS HOLY.   Very few follow Jesus through denial of self to the cross.  Jennifer sees that so very few experience the miracle of living in a Body where reality and accountability are gifts of Christ's presence.  On the other side of the Cross there is such glorious reward . . .  the love of Christ.

							<title>Episode #263 - The Holy Will of God</title>
							<description>In the face of an offense, faith is active, not passive, always needing to hear the Lord's view.  When John the Baptist needed comfort from prison,  Jesus' answer was "Blessed is he who is not offended in Me." John sees that the word 'in' implies an intimacy of relationship with Jesus.  He said, "When the will of God is your highest value, then the will of God is your comfort."

							<title>Episode #261 - Called to Holiness</title>
							<description>Carole quotes from the article  'Four Faces of Christ' on our website.  "To know the Lord as Lion is to live in the safety of the fear of God."  We need to know Him to be as terrifying and holy as He is.  Julie sees that holiness is Sonship. Ephesians says we were created to BE holy.  To meet Him in His holiness results in the joy of knowing we are His children. John says, "God's calling to holiness is a statement of Who He is, but He is not asking us to perform it, He is asking us to receive it. His holiness is the dance that He is leading."

							<description>The Holy Spirit has given us a fresh revelation of what has been a long term experience: God's Holiness.  Lev. 21:8  NLT   "I, the Lord, am holy and I make you holy."  

Authority brings the cross and the cross is the path to holiness.  Jenn says that our walk is a progression of the call to His Holiness by the chastening that makes us able to receive His gift of the new creation.

							<title>Episode #259 - Light is Love</title>
							<description>Love is all about the life, words are cheap. If there is real life present it is undeniable.   

When as a Body we journey, every place is influenced by what He has formed in and among us in real life.  The journey is right through the Cross and only the Cross will bring you to the love of Christ at its highest and best.  No greater Love exists, than Christ in His dying on the cross for the world.

What IS the mission?  The mission is Love.  God is widening our view as a "panorama" (beyond our understanding)  and "amplifying" our purpose, which is bringing Christ's love into every place we go.  Every believer is on a mission journey.

							<title>Episode #255 - The Last Days</title>
							<description>For us in these days, the Light of God's call and revelation are on this issue of  personal responsibility.  God's way is 'through' not around and not escaping our basic work of life.  And we will never know God without living in the very life He has given us.   The paradox of our work is that when we take it up, then He is there to bear it all.

							<title>Episode #252 - The Work of Believing</title>
							<description>"The walk in the Spirit is more instinctive than deliberate."   We learn to trust the Lord as He moves in mystery through our lives.  Faith for such a life comes just from seeking Him.  We ask Him not so much for what to do, but what to believe.  And when the Word comes from Him, we receive the faith as a gift.

							<title>Episode #251 - The Work is Union</title>
							<description>Christ's life could not have been more down in the normalcy of life: born in a stable, working as a carpenter in a small village.  The basic work is seeking the Lord.  The first work (before any work) is to ask the questions of God and the second work is to bow the will to the answer.  Carole sees the work as Union! Christ in me, the hope of glory.

							<description>Let's put no limit on what God can do with and for each of us - spiritually, physically, mentally.  Greatness is not necessarily fame or notoriety, but living to the fullness of your own destiny.  "For that which is His plan, there is complete presence and provision."  All God asks for is faith to say yes to His vision.  And the entire motivation of anything we do is Love: for Him, from Him, to Him.

							<title>Episode #246 - The Humanity of Christ</title>
							<description>The first heresy that came into Christianity in the first century was known as "Gnosticism."   It was a satanic attack that denied the humanity of Christ and made Him to be a 'phantom.'  This is a most subtle lie that is prevalent today as much as then.  When we seek to remove the indwelling of Christ from our practical, physical life and depend on knowledge for our path to God, it can become the heresy of gnosticism.
