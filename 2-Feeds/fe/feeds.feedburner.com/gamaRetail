&lt;p&gt;Presenter: Gregory Silberman&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The successes and failures of companies to properly protect their intellectual property is often a measure of the successes and failures of the companies themselves. While copyright and trademark law are well known tools for protecting the intellectual property of a game, patents are often misunderstood or overlooked entirely to the potential detriment of the developer or publisher. This session will discuss what you need to know NOW to use patents to protect your intellectual property, avoidliability for patent infringement, and will discuss proactive steps you can take. Regardless of the size of your company, you can always improve the IP protection of your assets, from game artwork, to game play methods, to components, and even software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presenters: Dr. Steven Cavazzi and John Ward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="LEFT"&gt;&lt;font face="Verdana, sans-serif"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;This session will cover information about two important data gathering strategies being formulated by GAMA for use within the industry. The first data gathering strategy is designed to answer the question: Are youth who play board games different from those youth who do not? The second data gathering strategy is designed to answer the question: What is the value of an after-school program that focuses on board game play? Discussion will center on the use of these efforts in order to generate evidence that supports the board game industry’s efforts to market their products as assets to school districts and other educational institutions.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Speaker: Dean Kao&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first hour of our 2-part series on Human Resources concerns, we'll discuss the things you'll need to think about before bringing on staff, and how to make sure the staff you already have makes sense for your level of sales and available budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll cover the basics of how to advertise you're looking for staff, what to look for, and the pros and cons of various solutions including hiring family, part- and full-time staff, and (not) hiring friends. We'll have sample interview questions and hopefully even a few of our members' employee handbooks and other HR paperwork for you to look over. Feel free to bring your own HR paperwork, employee handbooks, and anecdotes about your best and worst hires, as well as any specific questions about areas you'd like help with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Many of us have stores specifically designed to appeal to families with children, and hold events meant to attract young gamers. Some of those younger gamers may play regularly at our stores, spending significant periods of time without their parent or guardian there to supervise them.&lt;br /&gt;In this seminar, we'll talk about the potential problems that supervising younger customers can bring, and how to assure you're doing your best to comply with laws regarding their supervision during both events and regular store hours. We'll discuss the best ways to help parents understand your rules for use of your game space and events, and what you might need to do should any incidents occur. Please come prepared to discuss your local laws and ordinances and how you've dealt with them, as well as your rules and regs for handling kids at events as well as during regular store hours. We'll also be taking questions about specific circumstances and how to legally and safely take care of the kids in your store.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Moderator: Mike Stackpole&lt;br /&gt;In this discussion, we'll take on the contentious topic of pre-release tournaments and events. What effect do they have on the local game economy? How do Tournament Organizers affect local retail sales and game interest? What effect does it have on casual play? As this is a passionate topic for many, this discussion will be strictly moderated to keep it productive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Speakers: Dave Wallace, Fantasy Shop Comics &amp;amp; Games; Gordon Lugauer, The Board Game Barrister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good stocking is a lot more than just 'order 1 of each, 2 if it's D&amp;amp;D'. Industry veteran Dave Wallace will discuss specific strategies for building your expertise, tracking sales and order data to allow more efficient buying, and more. Learn how a dedicated buyer can free up time for managers to manage and owners to concentrate on long-term strategy, and the systems you'll need to put in place to let one buyer handle multiple product lines and/or stores and get the feedback needed to make smart purchasing decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
