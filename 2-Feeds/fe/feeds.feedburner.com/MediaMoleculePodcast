It's the Jubilee Weekend here in the UK - our Queen has been sitting on her throne for 65 years, and so the entire country is celebrating with 50s themed street parties, and 500 million miles of bunting. If none of that means a thing to you, don't worry, because more importantly (to some anyways) it's also E3! The time of trailers and screenshots galore is on us once again, and whilst we at Mm are remaining at home this year, Alice, Spaff and Kenny are here to recount E3 tales of yore, and  besides, LittleBigPlanet will be there.

We're off to a rambling start in this week's podcast, with questions about what exactly it is that Jagermeister's made of, and how it is that Scrooge McDuck ever managed to successfully swim in his pool of gold coins. But thankfully, for your sanity's sake (and ours), Kenny, Tom, Spaff, and Alice pull it together and dive into matters of utmost importance: various Scottish confectionery! The topic of the week takes us by surprise, as Tom reveals his childhood brush with fame, having appeared in a newspaper article about potential electrocution. Have you also ever made headlines? Send us your story to podcast AT mediamolecule.com! 

Also, please welcome LittleBigPlanet's new Community Co-ordinator, Steven Isbell, for his first-time Mm podcast appearance! We wheel Steven in to go over the LBP news this week, which includes <a href="http://www.littlebigplanet.com/en/news/article/new_features_in_update_1.12/" title="LittleBigPlanet Update 1.12">Update 1.12</a>!

And we're back with your second Media Molecule podcast for the week! Isn't that exciting? It is Easter weekend after all, and as we've missed you listeners so much, Kenny, Spaff, and Alice hop back into the sound cave mere days after the last recording. What is it like to see Obama punch a journalist in Mass Effect 3? How awesome is it that Alice has her white robe in Journey? And how dazzled are your ears by Kenny's use of 'ting'? You can find out by simply listen-ting! 

Last, but not least, this week's episode sees the second GDC special segment, an audio focussed discussion between Kenny and shiny special guests, Austin Wintory (Journey composer) and Brian Min (Double Fine Production's Audio Director). We hope you enjoy it!

The birds are chirping, the sun's been shining a bit, the flowers are starting to bloom, and our clocks have gone forward--all signs that spring has sprung! And with it, a shiny new podcast! 
It's been a while, and we're down a Tom this week, but Kenny, Spaff, and Alice went into the sound cave to quickly catch up on where it is we've been this whole time, including tons of fun stuff that's been happening in the Little Big Planet world! 

But that's not all! This podcast sees the first of two special segments we recorded in our adventures a few weeks ago during the annual Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. We hope you enjoy our two very special guests, Greg Rice from Double Fine Productions and Chris Remo from the Idle Thumbs Podcast. They speak with us about their amazing success on Kickstarter--very exciting and impressive!--and then we dive into some wonderful indie games chatter.  

As fate would have it, and as you may have noticed as it is now the 2nd of April and no longer a Friday, we did not manage to get the podcast up last week. So, it looks as though we're the April Fools after all!

Do you smell that? Take a whiff -- it's the tantalising aroma of a new gaming device. The PlayStation Vita launched this week in the US and EU, and Kenny, Tom, and Alice are feeling the electronic device envy as folks around Mm towers start to unpack their very own shiny new handhelds. Spaff recounts tales of a recent gam jam that took place at Tarsier Studios in Sweden. And, exciting news -- the Sackies have reached the final phase! All you fine folks can now go and vote for your favourite finalists on LBP.me!   

A lot of traveling is on the horizon for us podcasters though, with Game Developers Conference around the corner, followed by SXSW, so we quickly wrap things up with some fine (quality not confirmed) jokes!  

Have you bought or plan to buy a PlayStation Vita? Let us know what games you're looking forward to, or send us some jokes (maybe good ones!) to podcast AT mediamolecule.com

<p>Do you smell that? Take a whiff&#8212;it&#8217;s the tantalising aroma of a new gaming device. The PlayStation Vita launched this week in the US and EU, and Kenny, Tom, and Alice are feeling the electronic device envy as folks around Mm towers start to unpack their very own shiny new handhelds. Spaff recounts tales of a recent LBP Vita game jam that took place at Tarsier Studios in Sweden. And, exciting news&#8212;the Sackies have reached the final phase! All you fine folks can now go and vote for your favourite finalists on LBP.me!&nbsp;  </p>

Oh dear... Have you ever played a game so vigorously -- so enthusiastically, so <strong>POWERFULLY</strong> -- that you've accidentally given yourself an injury? Spaff, Tom, Kenny, and Alice think back on all the times they've given themselves a game-related ouchie in this podcast's Topic of the Week (spoiler: Spaff is made of glass and is currently sporting a fractured radius). Cradle that sore gaming thumb of yours as we read out some stories from you, the listeners! 

On an entirely less "owie" note, the Sackies have reached the end of the nominations phase! Keep your butts glued to your seats, as the finalists will soon be revealed and you'll be able to enter <em>the voting phase</em>. Very exciting :)

We may be saying goodbye to tides of yule and, alas, bidding farewell to the entirety of last year, but please take time to welcome, welcome, welcome 2012's first Mm podcast goodness! In keeping with new beginnings, keen listeners may notice we've freshened up the format a bit – and the addition of snazzy sounds is surely not to be missed!
 
This week’s TOPIC OF THE WEEK (WEEk WEek Week week….echo echo) is: “What is your new year’s resolution?” Feel free to chime in with yours in the comments below! Additionally, Kenny, Spaff, Tom, and Alice discuss who did what and where over the new year, dive into the latest and greatest LBP happenings, dance dangerously close to Kenny’s Star Wars mega-fan triggers, and dust off the good ol’ mail bag. We hope you enjoy it!
 
 
“Where can I find out about that thing you were talking about?”

Media Molecule Podcast 14 - It's the Sound of Christmas!

"Ho Ho Ho!" says Kenny's somewhat dodgy Santa impersonation, for what
seems like the second time. Oh, that's because it IS the second time.
Behold! The gang gets a dose of holiday 'deja vu' thanks to a failed
first attempt at recording the podcast this week in a pub. Alas, the
Pubcast was not to be, but don't be sad -- 'tis the season to be
jolly! (And your ears will thank us for re-recording in Kenny's sweet
sound cave.)

It's a jam-packed episode this week, for you dear listeners, on this
Christmas Eve's eve, with Kenny, Alice, Spaff, Tom, and John all
squeezed into a the aforementioned (cosy) cave to recount their
special family Christmas traditions, reveal a few holiday confessions,
and revel in Little Big Planet's bountiful collection of Christmas
competitions!

We hope you enjoy your own holiday festivities, whatever those may be!

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

With 75% of the gang infected with lurgy, the podcast room is filled with germs this week, and the mood seems somewhat glum - don't worry though, we're still here to ramble on about the latest LBP happenings and somehow steer those conversations into madness. With Christmas just around the corner, we'll be filled with cheer in no time... don't get too close though,  you might catch something!

If you want to hear about Alex's plans to make a 20 player split screen game, Kenny's song-a-day challenge, and what happens when you entrust a big bag of clay to a load of game developers, then this podcast is for you!

<p>Look over here everyone! - it&#8217;s the Media Moelcule Podcast number eight!&nbsp; Recorded a little earlier this month, Kenny, Spaff, Martin and John gather to talk about the LittleBigPlanet 2 Move pack, a DLC pack heading your way this September! We also talk about  the recent LBP meetup in Missouri, and John&#8217;s crazy mission to kayak around the UK. </p>

<p>To find out more about the Move Pack head on over to LittleBigPlanet.com - we just updated it with all the Move Pack contents you could possibly dream of. <br />
Well, actually I take that back: you guys are pretty imaginative, you could probably dream up some pretty rockin&#8217; content. But if you want to know more about the pack, it&#8217;s still the best place to be lookin&#8217;!

In this spotlight edition of the Media Molecule Podcast, Kenny, Daniel and Spaff sit down with Mm Art Director Kareem Ettouney to discuss his influences and passions, and how they affected the look at feel of the weird mish-mash that is LittleBigPlanet. We discuss generalities of art in games, games as art, how Mm works as a studio, how you can only be as mad as how serious you are, and Kareem sneaks in his obligatory Beatles Analogy.

After the podcast Kareem attended his art class, where he painted this picture... we include it here as a great example of Kareem's personal interests, influences and non Mm work. There's plenty more Sphinx magic for those who are interested, just visit Kareem's website - http://www.kareemettouney.com

Oh my! We’ve only gone and fulfilled our new years resolution by recording another podcast this year! Mm Podcast 5 is slightly different to what I’m going to describe as the normal way we do things, despite not really recording enough of them to establish any kind of norm. This time we invited Jim Unwin and Nathan Ruck to join the usual gang of Spaff, Tom and Kenny, and focused our discussion on how these guys designed the User Interface for LittleBigPlanet 2.

<p>Oh my! We’ve only gone and fulfilled our new years resolution by recording another podcast this year (although it should have been released last week oops)!</p>

<p>Mm Podcast 5 is slightly different to what I’m going to describe as the normal way we do things, despite not really recording enough of them to establish any kind of norm. This time we invited Jim Unwin and Nathan Ruck to join the usual gang of Spaff, Tom and Kenny, and focused our discussion on how these guys designed the User Interface for LittleBigPlanet 2.</p>

<p>As referenced in the podcast, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/preshaa/sets/72157625596989904/" title="">Jim has recently uploaded a presentation of his concepts for the UI to Flickr</a>. They should provide you with a more in depth glimpse into the creation of the new UI in LBP2.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP6137" title="">Jim will be talking at SXSW in March</a>, so if you are going, you should go and listen to what he has to say!</p>

<p>If you have any questions you’d like to ask us, or any comments for us, you can mail us at podcast@mediamolecule.com - thanks for listening, we’ll be back soon!

<p>Our last podcast was back in November 2009 - and we decided that rather than try to do a regular podcast whilst making LittleBigPlanet 2, we&#8217;d face up to the fact that it simply wasn&#8217;t going to happen and skip the entire year altogether.</p>

<p>Well - new year, new resolutions and NEW PODCAST. In a new effort to bring you a regular podcast, we kick off 2011 with a <em>brand new podcast</em> to celebrate our <em>brand new game</em>, LittleBigPlanet 2 - launching this week!</p>

<p>Join Kenny, Michelle, Spaff and Tom as we sit down in Kenny&#8217;s audio booth to discuss what&#8217;s going on in this very exciting launch week.
