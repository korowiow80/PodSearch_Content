      <title>Bluegrass and Old Time Music Radio Show #26</title>
      <description>Here's a Christmas story you should never forget! My wife and I spent Christmas day 2006 on a pilgrimage to the banks of the Delaware River to celebrate George Washington's crossing and the historic battle with British forces in Trenton, New Jersey. That turning point battle came at a time when most felt the American Revolution was over. Washington's Continental Army had been badly beaten during the summer and fall of 1776 and the army reduced from 26,000 to just 4,000 men. Those left were tired, demoralized and their enlistments were about to expire at the end of December. All seemed lost. Listen to the story set to music of the time.</description>

      <description>The Blue Mountain Boys, a Swedish hard-driving, high and lonesome bluegrass band in the tradition of Bill Monroe, is featured in this episode. I play songs from their new album "Tall och Gran" (In the Pines) and discuss the influence Sweden has, and continues to have, on America.  You&amp;#146;re going to like the Blue Mountain Boys not only for their talent, but also for the fact they have their music for sale on CDbaby.com. Check out their website  at www.bluemountainboys.com.</description>

      <description>Original Formula, a stimulating duet with wonderful vocals and expert guitar pickin', is featured in this episode. Alton Elliot (guitar and vocals) and Robert Perkins (lead guitar and vocals) will thrill you with music that harkens back to duets like the Blue Sky Boys, the Louvin Brothers, the Stanely Brothers and the Everly Brothers. Through my interview with Alton and Robert, you will also learn about Nick Lucas and his amazing role in the origins of guitar playing in every musical style we know today.  You&amp;#146;re going to like Original Formula not only for their talent, but also for the fact they have their music for sale on iTunes and CDbaby.com.

      <description>Songwriters, who needs them? Well just everyone who loves music and that means you and me. This episode contains a number of bluegrass and old time songs written by living songwriters. They're not real popular and you may not have heard of them, but then how many people think of who wrote the song they just heard and liked? Listen to the songs these people wrote and remember their names. Who knows, maybe ten years from now they will be famous.</description>

      <description>The new Blue Ridge Music Center is the subject of this 1.5 hour episode. I recently held an interview with Joe Wilson and Debbie Robinson of this fantastic mountain music show case when my band, the Oriskany Strings, and another nearby band, the Craig County Boys, played there. The Blue Ridge Music Center is a part of The Ridge Parkway National Park and is located at Mile Post 213 near Galax, Virginia and Mt. Airy, North Carolina.  Joe Wilson is a magical person and I know you will enjoy listening to this educational interview about the center and mountain music. The interview is interleaved with the music of the three bands that played at the center the evening of August 19, 2006.</description>

      <description>The Athy (Ireland) Bluegrass Festival 2006 is the subject of this episode. I recently learned that bluegrass music is alive and well in Europe, so I contacted Tony O Brien (songwriter, vocalist and musician) who manages this festival. Tony sent me two CDs loaded with music from the festival and I was blown away with the quality of the bluegrass and old time music played at the festival. The Bluegrass Patriots from Fort Collins, Colorado was the first headline band and the No. 1 European Bluegrass Band, 4 Wheel Drive, was the second headline band. There are plenty of great Irish bluegrass and old time bands to listen to and some play original music they wrote.</description>

      <title>Bluegrass and Old Time Music Radio Show #19</title>
      <description>This episode is about live performances and what a band must do to insure the audience hears the band as the band wants to be heard. It's no easy task and knowing something about sound engineering will help you better enjoy a live performance. Nearly all musicians love to perform before a live audience and nearly all musicians wonder if the audience spotted all the mistakes they made. When a band's in the studio, they get to correct their mistakes before their album is released. In a live performance, all the band's mistakes are out there for the audience to hear and see. I use a live performance of the Oriskany Strings to present and discuss my points.</description>

      <description>The Itinerant Band is featured in this episode. This band plays music from the 18th century and uses instruments seldom heard or seen. I bought their Jefferson and Liberty album while attending a reenactment of the 1757 battle between French and British forces at Fort Ticonderoga in upper state New York. This is another of my history of old time and bluegrass music episodes and I think you will like it. You can learn more about the band at www.itinerantband.com.
