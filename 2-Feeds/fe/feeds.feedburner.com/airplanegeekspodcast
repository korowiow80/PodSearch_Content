Kip explains why the full TSA &#8220;body search&#8221; shouldn&#8217;t be necessary and he gives us some interesting details about the plot that led to the ban on liquids over 3 ounces. We consider calls to privatize the TSA, and discuss managing security and managing risk, the public perception of &#8220;the threat&#8221; and just how large it really is, security theater, the cost of technology, behavioral profiling, the effects of TSA security on the travelling public and thus on the commercial aviation industry, the history of Blogger Bob from <a href="http://blog.tsa.gov/">The TSA Blog</a>, and even a little peek inside the Bush oval office.</p>
<p>Kip observes that the risk in counter-terrorism is nonlinear, whereas in aviation safety it is linear. We have to be looking for nonlinear risk but a lot of the risk models used came out of the FAA safety regime and don&#8217;t apply well to security.</p>

Guest Kip Hawley was Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) from July 2005 to January 2009. He’s also just written the book, “Permanent Emergency: Inside the TSA and the Fight for the Future of American Security” available through his website (KipHawley.com), Amazon.com, and many bookstores.
We talk with Kip about how he came to be the TSA Administrator, the risk that business aviation presents, and the Large Aircraft Security Program. Kip explains why the full TSA “body search” shouldn’t be necessary and he gives us some interesting details about the plot that led to the ban on liquids over 3 ounces. We consider calls to privatize the TSA, and discuss managing security and managing risk, the public perception of “the threat” and just how large it really is, security theater, the cost of technology, behavioral profiling, the effects of TSA security on the travelling public and thus on the commercial aviation industry, the history of Blogger Bob from The TSA Blog, and even a little peek inside the Bush oval office.
Kip observes that the risk in counter-terrorism is nonlinear, whereas in aviation safety it is linear. We have to be looking for nonlinear risk but a lot of the risk models used came out of the FAA safety regime and don’t apply well to security.

<p>Guest Linda L. (Heid) Maloney had a 20 year military career as a naval flight officer flying the A-7, EA-6A, and the EA-6B Prowler. She was one of the first women to join a combat military flying squadron.

<p>We talk with Linda about being a female military aviator, and the time she had to eject from her plane. In her book, a collection of women military pilots tell their stories, the decisions they have had to make, the legacy they want pass down to their children, and the encouragement they give to other women.

<p>Mike Kincaid is a CFI/Designated Examiner at <a href="http://www.flymls.com">Mountain Lakes Seaplanes</a>, based at Pappy Boyington Airport (COE) in Hayden, Idaho. He learned to fly in Alaska, where seaplanes are a must, and he had a career with the Alaska Department of Public Safety. In Alaska, Mike hiked, fished, hunted, skied, snowshoed, mushed dogs, flew bush planes, chased bad guys, protected the wildlife of Alaska, and built log cabins deep in the woods. He now shares his passion for seaplane flying with students from around the globe in his restored Piper J3 and writes when the weather grounds him.</p>
<p>We talk about how Mike ended up in Alaska and learned to fly, and what it&#8217;s like to fly with floats. He offers a few stories about his adventures in Alaska, some good and some very much the opposite. Mike&#8217;s <a href="http://www.Adventurousbooks.com">books</a> include Seaplane Rating Basics and several others based on his Alaska adventures. Mike was also involved in the movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frozen_Ground"><i>The Frozen Ground</i></a> based on a real case about a serial killer in Alaska. The movie is scheduled for release December 2012 and stars Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, and Vanessa Hudgens. Mike did the flying (some if it spectacular glacier flying) which director Scott Walker referred to as &#8220;organic flying.&#8221; He was the stunt double and pilot for John Cusak.</p>

<p>Guest Leigh White is President of <a href="http://www.alertsol.com">Alertness Solutions</a>. We talk about the science of fatigue and how it can be applied to aviation, be it for pilots, cabin crew, air traffic controllers, and others. Leigh talks about new fatigue management requirements, how to integrate those with existing processes, and how fatigue management is really an enhancement of operator safety management systems.</p>
<p>When managing a flight department and incorporating fatigue into the operation, there are four main factors to be aware of:<br />
1. a continuum of performance impairment, not just falling asleep<br />
2. focus on circadian rhythm<br />
3. the hours of wakefulness (at 16 hours there is a significant performance drop) &#8211; impact on long duty days<br />
4. sleep debt &#8211; the cumulative effect of insufficient sleep</p>

<p>Guest Steve Fulton is a Technical Fellow with GE Aviation. He was the pilot at Alaska Airlines who helped develop the world&#8217;s first RNP procedure (that&#8217;s Required Navigation Performance), and he was a co-founder of Naverus, now part of GE. RNP enables aircraft to be placed on efficient predefined paths from top of descent to the runway.</p>
<p>We discuss RNP, the FAA reauthorization, and what the U.S. Congress has mandated. We talk about bringing what was developed in simpler situations to more complex ones here in the U.S., and mention &#8220;The Highways in the Sky&#8221; study where GE identifies significant benefits at airports that are not at the top of the FAA priority list. Steve points out that besides techincal challanges, this technology requires attention to the human element because it represents such a large change for pilots and air traffic controllers. Controllers, for example, have great vectoring skills that work well for loading the runways, but not very efficiently. RNP brings efficiency, but the task is more about managing automation. Steve also talks about translating the benefits of RNP to general aviation and unmanned aviation as well.</p>

Guest Ryan P. Starkey, Ph.D. has been working with University of Colorado students to develop a Mach 1.4 UAV. Propulsion for this very efficient aircraft comes from a 20 pound turbojet that features an afterburner and  thrust vectoring nozzle. We talk about the design of the vehicle, possible commercial and military applications, and the timeline for first flight.
Ryan is Assistant Professor and a McAnally Faculty Fellow, as well as Director of the Busemann Advanced Concepts Lab at the University of Colorado Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences. You can also learn more about this project at Starkey Aerospace Corporation.

<p><a href="http://www.richardaboulafia.com/">Richard Aboulafia</a>, Vice President, Analysis from <a href="http://www.tealgroup.com/">Teal Group</a> joins the Geeks to talk aviation. <a href="http://www.aviationqueen.com/">Benet Wilson</a>, Director of Media Relations for the <a href="http://www.aopa.org">Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association</a>, is back as guest co-host.</p>
<p>We talk about the A380 and B787, program breakeven vs. recurrent breakeven, lessons the airframers can apply to the 737MAX and A320neo, and why the A380 doesn&#8217;t have swimming pools, bowling alleys, and fast food restraunts. Richard opines on the poor state of the business jet market and the impact on Wichita. We talk about the Chinese aviation market and why Richard isn&#8217;t worried about the Comac 919. Shades of the IPTN N-250! Richard also talks about what Bombardier needs to do to gouge out CSeries market share. We touch on the EU Carbon Trading Scheme, the American Airlines bankruptcy, the Boeing 747-8, the Heli Expo in Dallas and the Singapore Airshow.</p>

Delta Said to Weigh US Airways Bid in Review of M&amp;A Options
Delays Worse After JFK Runway Work Done
