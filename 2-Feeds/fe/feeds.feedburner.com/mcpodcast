			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you look at addresses on the street, your address points to the dirt that your house sits on. On the Internet, your address can be redirected to anything (your website, your facebook, etc).

Also you don&#8217;t want your manager, lawyer, record label, etc to own the domain name. YOU should own your domain name (side point when creating a band you need to specify who owns the domain name, and if someone quits they should sign away rights to the domain name).</p>
<p>If found Sara Haze through watching the television show Ruby on Netflix. I loved the song Lovely so much I Googled the lyrics. I then found Sarah on Youtube, and then went to <a title="Sara Haze Home Page" href="http://www.sarahaze.com" target="_blank">her website</a> (which doesn&#8217;t exist).It&#8217;s owned by some website design company. It&#8217;s very weird, and a very strange situation. I&#8217;ve always said &#8220;make it EASY to buy and connect with people.&#8221; I had to search, and finally find her on <a title="Sara Haze on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/sarahaze" target="_blank">twitter</a>, and hope she reads her tweets. I would love to have her as a guest on the show.</p>
<h3>So what do we learn from this?</h3>
<p>1. Have your website ready before submitting your music to be used in movies, tv, etc.</p>
<p>2. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Always</span></strong> own your domain name.</p>
<p>3. Music MOVES people and when your music touches them they will ask Uncle Google to help find you.</p>
<p>4. Put your lyrics on your website as people may be Googling for them (make it easy to be found).</p>
<p>5. Sara is missing the ability to collect email addresses and build her community.</p>
<p>Sara I think you are awesome, and wish you the best. Please let me know if I can help.</p>

<p>Lyrics<br />
I don&#8217;t wanna be her<br />
I just want to be little old me<br />
Shouldn&#8217;t have to think<br />
Who am I suppose to be today<br />
And what give you the right<br />
To tell me who I should be<br />
Who gave you that right</p>
<p>Cause I, I feel lovely<br />
Just the way that I am<br />
Yes I feel lovely<br />
The way that I am</p>
<p>I know you want the best<br />
Yeah only good things for me<br />
But you have to realize<br />
I can&#8217;t be all these things you project on me<br />
Cause I&#8217;m beautiful to me<br />
Doesn&#8217;t that mean a thing<br />
I feel lovely<br />
Just the way that I am<br />
Yes I feel lovely<br />
The way that I am</p>
<p>I need that to be enough for you<br />
Need that to be enough for you<br />
Cause it&#8217;s enough for me<br />
It&#8217;s enough for me</p>
<p>Am I suppose to give up everything I am<br />
Just to make you happy<br />
I thought I was the one you<br />
Always wanted me to be<br />
It turns out I&#8217;m just little old me<br />
I&#8217;m just little old me<br />
And that&#8217;s fine by me</p>
<p>Cause I, I am lovely<br />
Just the way that I am<br />
Oh yes I am,<br />
Yes I am lovely<br />
The way that I am<br />
I am lovely lovely<br />
I am lovely</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is from Areil Hyatt, and sometimes its good to go back to the basics.</p>
<p>As many of you know Cyber PR® is a hybrid of Internet Marketing, Social Media and PR. I am an avid Internet Marketing student and I gather the nuggets I learn from my studies for musicians.</p>
<p>For many years, I’ve attended internet marketing retreats and seminars; a favorite of mine was a two-day intensive course run by the incredible marketer, Ali Brown.</p>
<p>The course was a whirlwind, and the core principles I learned were both basic and critically important.</p>
<h2>There are three ways to increase your income:</h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Increase your number of clients (fans).</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Increase the frequency of purchase, how often your fans buy from you. (and you’d better have more than just music to sell).</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Increase the amount of money that you charge.</p>
<p>Okay, none of these three things is brain surgery, but from a musician’s perspective, it brings up some interesting points.   In my last article about Internet marketing, I point out that music sold online cannot be treated like a diet product. So, marketing music from a straight-up traditional Internet marketing approach is, in my opinion, not entirely possible. The reason why I think this is: Products that sell very well online tend to solve people’s problems.  (Like Losing weight or making more money). I am captivated by how musicians can use some of these basic principles, to increase their own bottom line in the digital space. I’m going to break each one of the three principles down from a musician’s perspective, and my next three posts here will focus on each one.</p>
<p>This blog post will focus on #1.</p>
<h2>So How Do You Increase your number of clients (fans)?</h2>
<p>I am always shocked when musicians I work for at Cyber PR®, are desperate to reach <em>more and more</em> potential fans without really focusing on the fans that they <em>already have. </em>These fans don’t need to be found, because they are already your fans.</p>
<p>Studies have proven that it is much harder to make a new client and get them to purchase something than it is to get a client that already knows you and trusts you to purchase from you over and over.</p>
<p>I always suggest that, in measuring fans, the best place to look is at your social networks and at your mailing list.</p>
<p><strong>Your newsletter list is the only place where you can directly engage with your fans on your <em>own terms.</em></strong></p>
<p>Not Facebook’s terms, and not Twitter’s terms.</p>
<h2>10 Fail-Safe Ways to Increase/ Engage With Your Fan base</h2>
<p>Here are <strong>10 fail-safe ways to increase / engage with your fanbase</strong> by pulling from fans that you already know and have who trust and like you!</p>
<p>1. Get serious about your newsletter.</p>
<p>Use Fanbridge.com or ReverbNation.com and send your newsletter one time per month.  Track your effectiveness by monitoring your open rates.</p>
<p>2. Mine your inbox and outbox for names and addresses to add.</p>
<p>Ask all of your friends if it’s OK to add them to your list, otherwise you might be considered a spammer.</p>
<p>3. Bring a clipboard to each and every live appearance.</p>
<p>Invite people onto your mailing list with a raffle or giveaway from stage, and collect e-mail addresses.  During your performance, hold the CD up on stage and than give it away, you’ve just inserted a full commercial into your set without feeling “salesy” and you’ve excited one of your fans by giving them a gift.</p>
<p>4. Include a special offer on your home page with a free exclusive MP3 or video.</p>
<p>Use the Reverbnation Fan Collector or Free Download widgets to deliver it.</p>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> Make sure this download is not available anywhere.  Not streaming on your Facebook page.  <em>Only</em> on your website.</p>
<p>And of course it can also be available for purchase on your CD, but make sure that no one can get it anywhere else online. This will motivate people to sign up to your mailing list!</p>
<p>5. Follow 25 new people a week on Twitter.</p>
<p>6. Send out e-mails to your most engaged fans on Facebook and ask if you can have their e-mail addresses for your newsletter.  This is a bit arduous but the results will pay off.</p>
<p>7. Do the same with Twitter.</p>
<p>8. Start a blog and start sharing photos and stories and thoughts.</p>
<p>Note: you can also use Instagram to take pictures from your iPhone or Android phone, which can then be shared through Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>9. Start a podcast or a vodcast and interview other artists with big followings.  Ask them to share your podcast with their fans and followers.  It doesn’t have to be a big production.  It can be a small, informal video at YouTube.  Click here to see mine.   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/arielpublicity" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/arielpublicity</a></p>
<p>10. Ask your fans to review your music at CD Baby, iTunes, and Amazon.</p>
<h2>Boost Your Spotify Profits Using Fanbridge Page</h2>
<p>The FanBridge Fan Page Creator just got more social, thanks to our new Spotify Play Button integration. If you have music available on Spotify, you can add an album to your FanBridge Facebook tab and allow fans to stream music with Spotify. Using the Spotify module on a FanBridge Facebook tab allows artists to get the best of both services by embedding audio directly onto their Facebook page and collecting streaming royalties through Spotify. Make your music more shareable and get paid for it, too!</p>
<p>How does it work? Simple. Just add the Spotify Play Button module to your FanBridge Facebook Fan Page, search for your artist name, and select the album you’d like to include on the player. When fans go to play your tracks, Spotify will automatically launch. If your fans don’t have Spotify, they’ll be notified that they’ll need it to access the tracks and will be prompted to either open or download the app.</p>

As many of you know Cyber PR® is a hybrid of Internet Marketing, Social Media and PR. I am an avid Internet Marketing student and I gather the nuggets I learn from my studies for musicians.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I&#8217;m playing clip of someone in the entertainment business who just made $15 million in two days. His name is <a title="Kevin HArt on WTF Podcast" href="http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_272_-_kevin_hart" target="_blank">Kevin Hart</a>, and the clips are from Marc Maron&#8217;s <a title="Marc Maron's WTF Podcast" href="http://www.wtfpod.com" target="_blank">WTF Podcast</a> (a favorite of mine). In it we learn how Kevin had a lot of momentum going where his standup lead to Television and acting. He at one point had his own show on ABC (until the president of ABC got fired). He has had some bad luck, but he never let it get him down. When he started out while some comedians would only play certain clubs, Kevin played them all. He knew it was about building a following, and he knew that happens one fan at a time.</p>
<p>He recently had an opportunity to play an arena, but opted to play many smaller shows (for what sounds like the same money). This is a more intimate setting, and one where he can connect with his fans directly. I bring this to you today in case you&#8217;re not happy with all the venues you play. Forget the surroundings, and focus on connecting with your audience. Hopefully you are connecting with your music, now take it to a more personal level.</p>
<p>When my band was flying high, we not only learned fan&#8217;s names, but we learned what they did, their hobbies. We truly wanted our fans to be &#8220;friends&#8221; and in the end they were. This way if I ran across someone knew and I found out they were into cars, I knew to get them introduced to Fred. If they were into pool, I needed to make sure they challenged Connie to a game. By doing this, and helping our audience make a connection with each other we then had people with something in common (their hobbies and OUR MUSIC) and so when the weekend rolled around they could plan to do something together. It was (as Seth Godin calls it ) a Tribe. This also took some of the pressure off the band as people were coming out to see each other in addition to the band.</p>
<p>As more people were coming out, then the club owner was happy. Then as you connect more with your Tribe, they will follow you outside of their &#8220;normal&#8221; hangouts and venues. Then club owners really like you as you are bring ing in an audience.</p>
<p>I love how Kevin talks about playing clubs where you are underpaid, and under appreciated. He stated he was there to steal the clubs audience. To connect them with them, and then have them follow him. He makes his connections through things like twitter, Facebook etc. You can see his website at <a title="Kevin Hart Online" href="http://www.khartonline.com/" target="_blank">http://www.khartonline.com/</a> You can hear the full interview at <a title="Kevn Hart on Marc Maron's WTF Podcast" href="http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_272_-_kevin_hart" target="_blank">http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_272_-_kevin_hart</a></p>

<h2>Where is the Facebook Page?</h2>
<p>Ali from sarcood.com asked, &#8220;Does the Marketing Musician website have a Facebook Page?&#8221; In the past I have dabbled with one. The problem is, I hate doing things poorly. I don&#8217;t use Facebook a ton for business stuff. It&#8217;s all family and friends, but on the other hand you guys are my friends, so I&#8217;ve setup a Facebook Page for the podcast. I say this up front that I&#8217;ll try to catch it a few times a week, but I apologize if you need a response within 24 hours. It should be a great place to share ideas for the show.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An artcile at Gigmasters.com reveals where their traffic is coming from. They state that:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2361" title="gigmasters" src="http://marketingmusician.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gigmasters-300x195.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="195" /></p>
<p><strong>1. Google (organic) 56.1%</strong><br />
It’s not surprising that Google’s number one, however, it’s pretty amazing that it accounts for more than half of our traffic. Plus, this is organic traffic, which means that it’s from searches and not from paid advertising (see “Google PPC” below).</p>
<p><strong>2. Direct traffic 14.4%</strong><br />
We found it interesting that our second most popular source of traffic doesn’t come from ANYONE! This is from word-of-mouth and people actually typing “gigmasters.com” into the URL box, or by using a bookmark. For example, GigMasters members who use the site frequently.</p>
<p><strong>3. Other websites 11.2%</strong><br />
There are hundreds of sites that make up this percentage, such as Ask.com, PR Web, One Wed, New York Times, Twitter, YouTube, and CD Baby.</p>
<p><strong>4. Bing 5.4%</strong><br />
Who uses Bing? Apparently, a lot of people. Bill Gates must be proud of this one.</p>
<p><strong>5. Yahoo 5.3%</strong><br />
Good ol’ Yahoo is still in the game representing a sizable chunk of our traffic.</p>
<p><strong>6. Google (PPC) 5.2%</strong><br />
PPC stands for “pay-per-click.” In other words, we pay Google for this one.</p>
<p><strong>7. Facebook 1.1%</strong><br />
We thought this would be higher, but it’s still impressive since Facebook isn’t a “search engine,” technically. Also, we found that Facebook’s conversion rate to actual gig requests ranked very high. That’s a whole other topic that we could get into in a future blog post.</p>
<p><strong>8. AOL 0.7%</strong><br />
Yup, America is still online.</p>
<p><strong>9. Search 0.6%</strong><br />
This includes Search.com itself and other miscellaneous search engines that aren’t Google and Yahoo.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, <a href="http://www.gigmasters.com/contact.aspx" target="_blank">contact</a> GigMasters anytime. They also recommend these <a title="Video Tutorials" href="http://performer-blog.gigmasters.com/topics/video-tutorials/">video tutorials</a> to help you get more gigs!</p>
<h2>How to Check your Website stats</h2>

		<itunes:summary>An artcile at Gigmasters.com reveals where their traffic is coming from. They state that:



1. Google (organic) 56.1%
It’s not surprising that Google’s number one, however, it’s pretty amazing that it accounts for more than half of our traffic. Plus, this is organic traffic, which means that it’s from searches and not from paid advertising (see “Google PPC” below).

2. Direct traffic 14.4%
We found it interesting that our second most popular source of traffic doesn’t come from ANYONE! This is from word-of-mouth and people actually typing “gigmasters.com” into the URL box, or by using a bookmark. For example, GigMasters members who use the site frequently.

3. Other websites 11.2%
There are hundreds of sites that make up this percentage, such as Ask.com, PR Web, One Wed, New York Times, Twitter, YouTube, and CD Baby.

4. Bing 5.4%
Who uses Bing? Apparently, a lot of people. Bill Gates must be proud of this one.

5. Yahoo 5.3%
Good ol’ Yahoo is still in the game representing a sizable chunk of our traffic.

6. Google (PPC) 5.2%
PPC stands for “pay-per-click.” In other words, we pay Google for this one.

7. Facebook 1.1%
We thought this would be higher, but it’s still impressive since Facebook isn’t a “search engine,” technically. Also, we found that Facebook’s conversion rate to actual gig requests ranked very high. That’s a whole other topic that we could get into in a future blog post.

8. AOL 0.7%
Yup, America is still online.

9. Search 0.6%
This includes Search.com itself and other miscellaneous search engines that aren’t Google and Yahoo.

If you have any questions, contact GigMasters anytime. They also recommend these video tutorials to help you get more gigs!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re hungry, you will have a much better chance of getting food if you move to where the food is. Likewise if you want to grow your audience online (let&#8217;s say twitter, or facebook) you need to do the following:</p>
<p>1. Understand your audience. You can get to know them by starting a podcast, creating a poll with free websites like <a title="Poll Daddy" href="http://www.polldaddy.com" target="_blank">Polldaddy </a>and <a title="Survey Monkey" href="http://www.surveymonkey.com" target="_blank">Survey Monkey</a></p>
<p>2. Go to where yoru audience is.</p>
<p>3. Make friends with them.</p>
<p>4. <em>After</em> you have developed a relationship with them, tell them about your music.</p>
<p>Kevin Mulryne started <a title="Yes Music Podcast" href="http://www.mulryne.com/yesmusicpodcast/" target="_blank">a podcast about Yes Music</a>. He went to the official website of Yes. He followed people that followed the band YES. He commented on their Facebook page. Slowly the Word of mouth got out about his podcast, and he is continuing to build an audience.  You can do the same thing with your band.</p>
<p>Think about your band and if there are bands that you sound like. You could go to the band&#8217;s twitter and Facebook account (because if their fans like their music &#8211; and you sound kind of like them &#8211; then they<em> may</em> like you.</p>
<p>Happy Easte everyone.</p>

You can use the voicemail button on the right, or leave a comment below. Check out the Artist Growth <a title="Artist Growth" href="http://youtu.be/KwXPgcra0E4" target="_blank">Youtube Channel</a>. Rich read about it on <a title="American Songwriter" href="http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/02/artist-growth-wants-to-make-your-next-tour-smarter/" target="_blank">American Songwriter</a>. Here is what Rich said about it:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was reading <a title="American Songwriter Magazine" href="http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/02/artist-growth-wants-to-make-your-next-tour-smarter/" target="_blank"><em>American Songwriter</em></a> magazine when I came across an advertisement for the &#8220;Aritst Growth&#8221; app and account.</p>
<div>It looks like a nice full featured service that artists might want to explore. It integrates many of the tasks that they should already be doing into one place &#8212; including social media announcements from their calendar, tracking of merch sales/inventory, taxes/accounting/income, and connecting to industry pros.</div>
<div>There&#8217;s a section called &#8220;AGtv&#8221; that provides videos straight to the phone (or web) of insight and advice from many music industry pros.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Looks like a cool service; perhaps something to share on Marketing Musician. According to the FAQ:</div>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<div>Sign up before March 18, 2012 and receive a year for free. After that, you can sign up for a 30 day free trial before it becomes $5 per month, which you can totally avoid paying if you sign a friend up via our referral rewards program.</div>

<div dir="ltr">So, based on the final sentence from that FAQ, here&#8217;s a referral link. I signed up to explore it, but haven&#8217;t started integrating much. <a href="http://www.artistgrowth.com/rb7426" target="_blank">http://www.artistgrowth.com/<wbr>rb7426</wbr></a></div>

I was pleased to see there is a plugin that makes it super easy to apply the code to my website, and within SECONDS I was getting real time stats in my Clicky dashboard. I could see what brought people to the site, where they came from, what pages they visited. It&#8217;s insane, and it&#8217;s FREE for 100,000 daily impressons over three websites. It&#8217;s definitely worth looking at. There is even a &#8220;SPY&#8221; section where you can see exactly wehre anyone on your site is doing. Cool. If you&#8217;re not using WordPress you can still use them. They have plugins for just about every platfrorm (or just manually add their tracking code). This is very cool. If you need more impresisons (or websites) the price is 9.95 a month.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are some new interviews on Youtube that show David Lee Roth interviewing Alex and Eddy Van Halen. It starts off with them talking about how they started off. They weren&#8217;t shooting for stadiums. They were shooting to play that first small club. Then the next bigger club. Then the next small theater.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UOTidtqG-Ko" frameborder="0" width="400" height="233"></iframe></p>
<p>I read a book last year that was called &#8220;Just 10 lbs.&#8221; The idea is when we think about a giant task in front of us, we can get overwhelmed and either quit, or get frustrated. A better approach is to think about the next 10 lbs (instead of the 100 you need to lose). For me I think about my next meal. If I string together a bunch of good meals, and throw in some exercise I lose weight. We can do the same for playing gigs.</p>
<p>Think about your next gig. Forget about how small or big it is. Ask yourself, &#8220;What can I do to make this a gig that ensures the owner of the vendue asks me back?&#8221; One of the wasy to find out what to do is ask.</p>
<p>Ask the owner when they would like you to drop off any promotional material.<br />
Make sure you have a way to collect e-mail addresses at the gig.<br />
Have promotional material for your website and explain why people should visit.<br />
Ask if there is any promotional items the owner would like you to mention during the performance.<br />
Do your best to have the staff names.<br />
Make sure you know when you are expected to setup, and what is the best door to come in.</p>
<p>Think about your next gig. Think location of the neighborhood. Think about your promotional material, and your merch. See what you can do to make sure this is the best gig ever.</p>
<h3>Still Want A Record Deal?</h3>
<p>Later in the video Eddit and David Lee talk about their first record deal where they got 11 points. Before you go thinking that is 11 cents for every dollar. Think again. There is a stipulation (based on old 78 records) that 10 percent of records broke during delivery. So you got 11 points for every 90 cents. The producer (Ted Templemen) took three of the 11 points that the band got. According to Van Halen, Ted Templemen makes more on their records than the band members do (as they split the 8 points by four people that means you get 2 points per person).</p>
<p>From that you have to pay agents and attourneys. As David Lee put it, &#8220;The whole thing is a loan.&#8221; The band split $1.15 between four people and paid for everything.</p>
<p>They toured the world. Their album went platinum. When the tour was over Warner Brothers let them know that the band owed them 2 million dollars and another record.</p>

		<itunes:summary>There are some new interviews on Youtube that show David Lee Roth interviewing Alex and Eddy Van Halen. It starts off with them talking about how they started off. They weren't shooting for stadiums. They were shooting to play that first small club. Then the next bigger club. Then the next small theater.



I read a book last year that was called "Just 10 lbs." The idea is when we think about a giant task in front of us, we can get overwhelmed and either quit, or get frustrated. A better approach is to think about the next 10 lbs (instead of the 100 you need to lose). For me I think about my next meal. If I string together a bunch of good meals, and throw in some exercise I lose weight. We can do the same for playing gigs.

Think about your next gig. Forget about how small or big it is. Ask yourself, "What can I do to make this a gig that ensures the owner of the vendue asks me back?" One of the wasy to find out what to do is ask.

Ask the owner when they would like you to drop off any promotional material.
Make sure you have a way to collect e-mail addresses at the gig.
Have promotional material for your website and explain why people should visit.
Ask if there is any promotional items the owner would like you to mention during the performance.
Do your best to have the staff names.
Make sure you know when you are expected to setup, and what is the best door to come in.

Think about your next gig. Think location of the neighborhood. Think about your promotional material, and your merch. See what you can do to make sure this is the best gig ever.
Still Want A Record Deal?
Later in the video Eddit and David Lee talk about their first record deal where they got 11 points. Before you go thinking that is 11 cents for every dollar. Think again. There is a stipulation (based on old 78 records) that 10 percent of records broke during delivery. So you got 11 points for every 90 cents. The producer (Ted Templemen) took three of the 11 points that the band got. According to Van Halen, Ted Templemen makes more on their records than the band members do (as they split the 8 points by four people that means you get 2 points per person).

From that you have to pay agents and attourneys. As David Lee put it, "The whole thing is a loan." The band split $1.15 between four people and paid for everything.

They toured the world. Their album went platinum. When the tour was over Warner Brothers let them know that the band owed them 2 million dollars and another record.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A call to action CTA shold be in your thoughts when you fire up an email. Even if its just to let people know where you are on twitter, facebook, etc, there is a goal. When you write a call to action you don&#8217;t want to put &#8220;Click here.&#8221; I&#8217;m guilty of that. A better way is to let people know <em>what</em> they are clicking on <em>where</em> it is taking them, and <em>why</em> they should click it.  Instead of saying, &#8220;click here&#8221; I could say,  &#8220;<a title="Build Your Band’s Website Details" href="http://marketingmusician.com/build-your-bands-website/">Find out about the Creating your band&#8217;s website class on our website, and see if its what you could benefit from the class</a>..  The example <a title="CTA skills from Fanbrdige" href="http://www.fanbridge.com/blog/creating-effective-calls-to-action-in-email-campaigns" target="_blank">in the article I was referencing</a> used the CTA of &#8220;See our site for more fan-only presale information.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other thing to think about is the location of your call to action. While many email programs insert these at the bottom, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to put these &#8220;above the fold&#8221; and use a warm friendly inviting tone.</p>
<p>Lastly, you don&#8217;t have to be a great web designer to make your call to action stand out. This be as simple as putting it in bold.</p>

<h3>Peter Tork Not Ready For Death of Davy Jones</h3>
<p>I was/am a Monkees fan and was bummed ot hear about the death of Davy Jones last week. I immediately thought, &#8220;What are the other guys up to.&#8221; When I went to petertork.com I was really blown away how his website basically pushed people to facebook, and his new band was on a sonicbids electronic press kit (only). When I listened to the music, I thought, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this available for sale somewhere?&#8221; It is its in iTunes, but the links on Peter&#8217;s website go to his solo stuff. In other words, the band that could use the publicity and is looking for gigs, got no love on his website. When people who might be interested in buying his new music show up to his website, he made it hard to find anything new.</p>
<p>When I went to <a title="Shoe Sued Blues _ Peter Tork" href="http://www.shoesuedeblues.com/" target="_blank">http://www.shoesuedeblues.com/</a> again I couldn&#8217;t purchase his music. Most of the pages on his website are &#8220;under contruction&#8221; since 2009. This is sad. While you hate to capitalize on your tragedy, you can&#8217;t pick when interest in your music will come. When it does, you shold be ready. He wasn&#8217;t. I notice now that he has a newsletter sign up page on his front page &#8211; which is a start.  Meanwhile, if I have an extra 2400.00 I could go to Mickey Dolenz ebay page and purchase lunch with Mickey. I guess you have to eat.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we talk about breaking down the price of airplay, and how to track your Return on investment (ROI). I got a notice from CDBaby about a service called <a title="Jango Internet Radio Station" href="http://www.jango.com" target="_blank">Jango</a>. According to their website they have 7 million listeners. It&#8217;s an internet radio station that allows you to create your own stations. They compare themselves to pandora. The biggest difference between Jango and Pandora for me is I&#8217;ve heard of Pandora, and I&#8217;ve never heard of Jango. Have You? (Use the poll below).</p>
<p>I went over and took a peek, and the I also went and tried to find an &#8220;Average&#8221; Indie artist. Well the guy I found (that came on after Ted Nugent) turned out to be a guy who has played with Kip Winger, and worked with Olivia Newton-John, Paul Abdul, etc. He had five whole fans of his music. I did find it very useful that you can email people who become fans of your music (cause they say the money is in the list for a reason). So I put some of their pricing into an Excel Spreadsheet (you can learn Excel at <a title="Lynda.com Software Tutorials" href="http://www.lynda.com/promo/trial/Default.aspx?lpk35=930&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=ldc_affiliate&amp;utm_content=679&amp;utm_campaign=CD475&amp;bid=679&amp;aid=CD475&amp;opt=" target="_blank">lynda.com</a> along with zillion other titles for only $25) and here is what I came up with.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2277" title="Jango Break Down" src="http://marketingmusician.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/jango_breakdown.jpg" alt="" width="303" height="151" /></p>
<p>They state that you get 30-50 fans per 1000 plays. I took the average (40) and used that for my calculations. If you get 40 fans per 1000 plays, you would get 10 fans for 250 plays and 160 if you got 4000 plays. This means you will pay anywhere from $1 a fan (250 plays) to .63 a fan (4000 plays).</p>
<p>The site does allow you to link to your website. You might want to use a link tracking tool like PrettyLinks (for wordpress &#8211; learn how to build your website with this free software) to see how many people click-through on your Jango web page back to your band&#8217;s website (you do have a website right?). The plugin is free, and there is a premium version but that&#8217;s not required to just track clicks.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a free way to get your music in front of people, try uploading your music to Music Alley, and then locating music podcasters that play your style of music. Send a personal email to the host (not form letters) and mention something that proves you listen to the show. If you&#8217;re music fits their genre, I would almost guarantee you that they will play your music. I would send them a link to your music (not the file &#8211; that ties up their email inbox), and mention that you are on Music Alley.

		<itunes:summary>Today we talk about breaking down the price of airplay, and how to track your Return on investment (ROI). I got a notice from CDBaby about a service called Jango. According to their website they have 7 million listeners. It's an internet radio station that allows you to create your own stations. They compare themselves to pandora. The biggest difference between Jango and Pandora for me is I've heard of Pandora, and I've never heard of Jango. Have You? (Use the poll below).

I went over and took a peek, and the I also went and tried to find an "Average" Indie artist. Well the guy I found (that came on after Ted Nugent) turned out to be a guy who has played with Kip Winger, and worked with Olivia Newton-John, Paul Abdul, etc. He had five whole fans of his music. I did find it very useful that you can email people who become fans of your music (cause they say the money is in the list for a reason). So I put some of their pricing into an Excel Spreadsheet (you can learn Excel at lynda.com along with zillion other titles for only $25) and here is what I came up with.



They state that you get 30-50 fans per 1000 plays. I took the average (40) and used that for my calculations. If you get 40 fans per 1000 plays, you would get 10 fans for 250 plays and 160 if you got 4000 plays. This means you will pay anywhere from $1 a fan (250 plays) to .63 a fan (4000 plays).

The site does allow you to link to your website. You might want to use a link tracking tool like PrettyLinks (for wordpress - learn how to build your website with this free software) to see how many people click-through on your Jango web page back to your band's website (you do have a website right?). The plugin is free, and there is a premium version but that's not required to just track clicks.

If you are looking for a free way to get your music in front of people, try uploading your music to Music Alley, and then locating music podcasters that play your style of music. Send a personal email to the host (not form letters) and mention something that proves you listen to the show.

I would send them a link to your music (not the file - that ties up their email inbox), and mention that you are on Music Alley. You can read this free chapter of my book here.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we talk about tools for bands to share ideas with each other securely. You can create a drop box account for free and have 2 GIGS of free space. Upload your musical idea, and then share it with the rest of the band. They can sign up (again free) and have access to every file in that folder you shared. You could also do this with fans (join our mailing list and get exclusive content). This works on Windows, MAc, Linux, and even mobile. This means when you can download software and install it and whatever is in that folder(s) will automatically download (great if you use a desktop and a laptop). If you update an idea, jsut save it in the dropbox and everyone in the band gets the latest version automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Tool for Cover Bands &#8211; Finding The Song</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;re going to play an event, and someone want to hear some rare song. How do you find it? One of the best tools is youtube.com (even though there may not be an official video for the song). This is great, except how do you take that song with you if you don&#8217;t have a smartphone? Check out www.youtubedownloader.com a free tool that allows you to download the video, and then convert it to audio so you can throw it on your portable media player and listen in the car, etc.</p>
<h3>Brief Pause in Broadcasting</h3>
<p>The media host of this podcast is changing. While this means nothign to you, it does mean a lot of updates have to happen behind the scenes of this podcast and many other podcasts I do. All this means to you is there may be a brief hiatus fro this podcast I I hurdily swap out media files on my other websites. Please continue to send in ideas, tales from the road, gear reviews, etc. I&#8217;ll be back soon.</p>
<h3>Music Heard in Today&#8217;s Podcast</h3>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am in a band that likes to fire people. We&#8217;ve gone through a drummer and a guitar player. Here are some tips I&#8217;ve picked up for doing auditions.</p>
<p>1. Give them three songs to learn of different styles.</p>
<p>2. Make sure the band knows those songs.</p>
<p>3. When they arrive explain how you will run these three songs.</p>
<p>4. If the songs go ok, you can &#8220;wing it&#8221; and &#8220;jam&#8221; or whatever. If things are not going good, you can thank them for their time, and let them go.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t do these and we had a drummer who couldn&#8217;t sing, show up and he hadn&#8217;t learned any of our songs, and wanted us to play music from the band foreigner. It went on WAAAY too long, and we know he wasn&#8217;t a good fit after the third song.</p>

		<itunes:summary>I am in a band that likes to fire people. We've gone through a drummer and a guitar player. Here are some tips I've picked up for doing auditions.

1. Give them three songs to learn of different styles.

2. Make sure the band knows those songs.

3. When they arrive explain how you will run these three songs.

4. If the songs go ok, you can "wing it" and "jam" or whatever. If things are not going good, you can thank them for their time, and let them go.

We didn't do these and we had a drummer who couldn't sing, show up and he hadn't learned any of our songs, and wanted us to play music from the band foreigner. It went on WAAAY too long, and we know he wasn't a good fit after the third song.</itunes:summary>

		<description>I was listening to an interview of Music Business Radio with Cas Haley where he was talking about coming in 2nd on America&amp;#8217;s Got Talent. This contest/reality show (of which I&amp;#8217;ve never seen, I&amp;#8217;ve given up on television).

This contest/reality show (of which I&#8217;ve never seen, I&#8217;ve given up on television). He mentions in the interview how the contract that he was offered would&#8217;ve paid him .75 a CD. Now I realize that with the big Sony machine behind him he could sell thousands of records. However, think about this: Can you name who won two years ago on any reality TV show (the voice, American Idol, etc). If you were to tell your CD for $10 at <a title="CDBaby Digital and Physical Distribution for Indie Musicians" href="http://www.cdbaby.com/from/jammindave" target="_blank">CDBaby</a>, you may 8 TIMES AS MUCH per CD. For every Cd you sell at a gig, you would have to sell 8 more if you were on a label to receive the same amount. As he mentioned he could sell hundreds of thousands of CDs and STILL OWE MONEY.</p>
<p>But Wait There is More. Then I stumbled across Zack Andrew who was tired of hearing everyone say, &#8220;You should go on America&#8217;s got talent.&#8221; Zack combines the unlikely skills of classical guitar and beat boxing. He looked into <a title="America's Got Talent Contract" href="http://beatsnstrings.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/contract.jpg" target="_blank">the contract</a> and not only do they mention that the show may MAKE UP information about you to <em>make you look interesting </em>(I assume), but you sign away your rights to pretty much everything. You&#8217;ll be the next hot thing until next year&#8217;s winner. Wow.</p>

<p>The interesting point I feel is people will pay with money or time to get your music. teenagers who have more time than money tend to steal music illegally. Older people have more money than time and may fork out the $12 for the new tunes. In this example, Louis shows that if you make the price low enough, the people who are steeling your music <em>may </em>find that its less painful to part with the cash than the time it would take to copy it through illegal channels. It doesn&#8217;t take much. There are some great plugins you can use on your website to sell digital products.</p>

<h3>Stumble Upon To Promote Your Music</h3>
<p>I was reading an  <a title="Using StumbleUpon to get Your band Exposure" href="http://diymusician.cdbaby.com/2011/11/use-stumbleupon-to-get-exposure-for-your-music-stumbleupon-for-musicians/" target="_blank">Article</a> at the CDBaby DIY Podcast site, and it turns out &#8220;The Bolt&#8221; is a StumbleUpon addict. I&#8217;ve heard that StumbleUpon brings you traffic, but it doesn&#8217;t give you <em>quality</em> traffic. As most people are coming to judge your website (not sit and listen). It is addicting. You may find interesting things such as<a title="How to Hijack a Street Sign" href="http://thumbpress.com/how-to-hack-an-electronic-road-sign/" target="_blank"> How to hijack a street sign</a>.  With this mind, I throw this out to you. have you had any quality visitors from StumbleUpon? If I was submitting my website to StumbleUpon, I would make a page where people can listen to my music and hope that the music makes them stick around.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>How to Communicate With Fans So You Connect With Them (Instead of Bore Them to Tears)</h3>
<p>In the same way that there is an art and craft to songwriting, there is also a craft to writing and using language in general and these word-related skills can play a big part in how effectively you communicate with fans &#8211; especially online.</p>
<p>In this article I’m going to quickly address something called “point of view” and why it’s so important — namely, when to use the First Person, Second Person, or Third Person perspective when talking about and describing your music.</p>
<p>You probably learned these things in school. But just in case you forgot the details, here’s a refresher on what they are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Person</strong> is when you write about yourself: “I just wrote a new song” or “We have a big show coming up this weekend.”</li>
<li><strong>Second Person</strong> is when you speak directly to the reader: “You will really enjoy this new song” or “You should come to our show this Saturday night.” (The second example actually combines first and second points of view in both “you” and “our” terms.)</li>
<li><strong>Third Person</strong> speaks from a more distant, observer viewpoint: “Suzy just wrote a new song” or “The XYZ band has a big show coming up this weekend.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Great. You’re back on track with what these three things are. Now, how can you use them to more powerfully communicate with fans?</p>
<p>First, let’s consider the way a band might describe the music on it’s new album. <strong>Here’s one version written in the Third Person</strong>:</p>
<p><em>“On this new album, the listener will be swept away by the pulsating rhythms as his or her body is compelled to get up, shimmy and shake the night away. A perfect gift for the special dancer in one’s life.”</em></p>
<p>That’s cool, but it could be made much stronger with a simple shift in perspective. <strong>Here’s an alternate version of the same words written in the Second Person</strong>:</p>
<p><em>“On this new album, you’ll be swept away by the pulsating rhythms as your body is compelled to get up, shimmy and shake the night away. A perfect gift for yourself or that special dancer in your life.”</em></p>
<p>See the subtle difference? “YOU” is a powerful word. In most cases, speaking directly to your fans in this way (and actually helping them visualize how they’ll enjoy the music) is the best way to write about your sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Now let’s consider how you might approach an artist bio</strong>, especially when it comes to putting a positive spin on what you do. In fact, I’ll use myself as an example here, because I just got some nice press coverage that I plan to add to my bio.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s one way I could weave it in using the Third Person point of view</strong>:</p>
<p><em>According to the Salt Lake Tribune, Bob Baker is “one of the most widely recognized authorities on music marketing. A prolific writer, indie musician and former music magazine editor, Baker is regarded as one of the industry’s leaders in helping musicians leverage online web and marketing strategies to boost their careers.”</em></p>
<p>Pretty cool, huh? Quoting a media source works pretty well here.</p>
<p><strong>Now consider how that same information would feel if it had been written in First Person</strong>:</p>
<p><em>I am one of the most widely recognized authorities on music marketing. A prolific writer, indie musician and former music magazine editor, I am regarded as one of the industry’s leaders in helping musicians leverage online web and marketing strategies to boost their careers.</em></p>
<p>Hmm … awkward! Yep, that version would make me look like an egotistical baffoon. So when it comes to heaping praise on yourself, be cautious and consider quoting a fan, industry expert or media person instead of saying it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>So, is there ever a good time to write in the First Person?</strong></p>
<p>Of course, there is. First Person is great when telling personal stories and giving people a glimpse into your world, such as:</p>
<p><em>“You’ll never believe what happened to us when we stopped at a 7-11 in Biloxi , Mississippi. It was close to midnight and I had a sudden urge for a Slurpee ..”</em></p>
<p>“I’d love to tell you the surprising reason I wrote this song and why it means so much to me …”</p>
<p><strong>So there you have it …</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use First Person when sharing personal stories and your inner most thoughts.</li>
<li>Use Second Person when describing your music, promoting shows, and encouraging fans to buy.</li>
<li>Use Third Person to quote other people saying awesome things about you.</li>
<li>Combine First and Second Person for even greater impact, as in “I want you to know how much I appreciate you and your support.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Bob Baker is the author of “<a title="Guerilla Music Marketing Online" href="http://www.1shoppingcart.com/app/?Clk=4527980" target="_blank">Guerrilla Music Marketing Online</a>,” Berkleemusic’s “<a href="http://www.bob-baker.com/buzz/berklee.html">Music Marketing 101</a>” course, and many other books and promotion resources for DIY artists, managers and music biz pros.

		<itunes:summary>How to Communicate With Fans So You Connect With Them (Instead of Bore Them to Tears)
In the same way that there is an art and craft to songwriting, there is also a craft to writing and using language in general and these word-related skills can play a big part in how effectively you communicate with fans - especially online.

In this article I’m going to quickly address something called “point of view” and why it’s so important — namely, when to use the First Person, Second Person, or Third Person perspective when talking about and describing your music.

You probably learned these things in school. But just in case you forgot the details, here’s a refresher on what they are:

	First Person is when you write about yourself: “I just wrote a new song” or “We have a big show coming up this weekend.”
	Second Person is when you speak directly to the reader: “You will really enjoy this new song” or “You should come to our show this Saturday night.” (The second example actually combines first and second points of view in both “you” and “our” terms.)
	Third Person speaks from a more distant, observer viewpoint: “Suzy just wrote a new song” or “The XYZ band has a big show coming up this weekend.”

Great. You’re back on track with what these three things are. Now, how can you use them to more powerfully communicate with fans?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many ways to add income to your music business. You can do the obivous and see t-shirts and merch at yoru gigs, you can teach students (guitar for example), sell your music etc. But what about those days when there are no gigs, students, etc. I&#8217;ve been playing arounnd with odesk.com This is a site where people posts jobs of all sorts (I&#8217;ve been finding a few jobs as a podcast consutlant), and when I typed in &#8220;Music Producer&#8221; into the search box I not only found some jobs, but some ofthese were ongoing jobs (people want 30 second version of cover songs for some reason).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also seen jobs for music for video games, presentations, indie movies, etc. Be careful as I&#8217;ve started looking at jobs where I was &#8220;kind of&#8221; qualified and it turned out to be a waste of time.</p>
<p>oDesk is free. They stay in business by adding a percentage to the fee that you charge. For example, if I charge $18 an hour the final price to the client is $20 (with oDesk taking an additional $2).</p>
<p>Check it out at oDesk.com</p>
<p>Another alternative is<a title="elance" href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-1386878-10766274" target="_blank"> elance.com</a>, however there is a monthly fee to use this service (in addition to the percentage they take), and there seemed to be less music related jobs.</p>

		<itunes:summary>There are many ways to add income to your music business. You can do the obivous and see t-shirts and merch at yoru gigs, you can teach students (guitar for example), sell your music etc. But what about those days when there are no gigs, students, etc. I've been playing arounnd with odesk.com This is a site where people posts jobs of all sorts (I've been finding a few jobs as a podcast consutlant), and when I typed in "Music Producer" into the search box I not only found some jobs, but some ofthese were ongoing jobs (people want 30 second version of cover songs for some reason).
I've also seen jobs for music for video games, presentations, indie movies, etc. Be careful as I've started looking at jobs where I was "kind of" qualified and it turned out to be a waste of time.
oDesk is free. They stay in business by adding a percentage to the fee that you charge. For example, if I charge $18 an hour the final price to the client is $20 (with oDesk taking an additional $2).
Check it out at oDesk.com
Another alternative is elance.com, however there is a monthly fee to use this service (in addition to the percentage they take), and there seemed to be less music related jobs.
Do you know of any other sites where musicans can be hired to free lance work?</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chickenfoot features Sammy Hagar, Joe Satriani, Michael Anthony, and Chad Smith and they released their third album Chickenfoot III today. To help build up some buzz, they have released a series of videos that give you a double dose of &#8220;Behind the music meets Storytellers.&#8221; You get to understand what the lyrics are about, as well as gets youy thinking things like, &#8220;Am I going to get the hear the weird solo?&#8221; You get intimate details of the song and how its about the death of their co-manager.</p>
<p>The bottom line is you can&#8217;t help but want to hear the song when you get done with the video. They play about 60 seconds of it, and then fade it out &#8211; making you want more. This is <em>exactly  </em>what this video is supposed to do and you can do something like this. The videos are well thought out (as each one introduces the next one).</p>
<p>These videos sucked me in? How about you? Do you want to hear more from the new album now?</p>
<p><object width="500" height="284" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/eSdhcpRd78I?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed width="500" height="284" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/eSdhcpRd78I?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" allowFullScreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" /></object></p>
<p><strong>Video Tips</strong></p>
<p>To make your own video, the AUDIO is the most important thing. Make sure you close enough to be picked up by the microphone, or if you have the technology to pull it off (Like <a title="Camtasia Studio" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003F4XPW8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=cooler-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B003F4XPW8" target="_blank">Camtasia Studio</a>) you can record the audio on a portable device and sync the video later.</p>
<h3>Easy Video Player</h3>
<p><a href="http://jammindave.webactix.hop.clickbank.net/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" src="http://www.easyvideoplayer.com/affiliates-images/250-250.gif" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></a>There are tons of tools for video that are free (YouTube for example). This tool is NOT free, but it is focused on getting your more sales. How?</p>
<p>You can embed an email sign up list, RIGHT IN THE VIDEO. You can have the video redirect the viewer to a web page (like your store).</p>
<p>YOU can have &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; button right in your video.</p>
<p>You get video analytics.</p>
<p>Do split testing with videos.</p>
<p>Secure content from theft (stops people from playing it on their website).</p>
<p>Add overlays that are linkable on your videos.</p>
<p>You can have buy now buttons appear at a certain time.</p>
<p>The thing that sounds annoying about it is it comes with a membership to some marketing website. Granted you can cancel anytime you want, but (for me) if I&#8217;m purchasing software I&#8217;m not interested in a marketing membership.  The software goes for $127 and if you want the non-branded version it&#8217;s basically $200.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Chickenfoot features Sammy Hagar, Joe Satriani, Michael Anthony, and Chad Smith and they released their third album Chickenfoot III today. To help build up some buzz, they have released a series of videos that give you a double dose of "Behind the music meets Storytellers." You get to understand what the lyrics are about, as well as gets youy thinking things like, "Am I going to get the hear the weird solo?" You get intimate details of the song and how its about the death of their co-manager.

The bottom line is you can't help but want to hear the song when you get done with the video. They play about 60 seconds of it, and then fade it out - making you want more. This is exactly  what this video is supposed to do and you can do something like this. The videos are well thought out (as each one introduces the next one).

These videos sucked me in? How about you? Do you want to hear more from the new album now?



Video Tips

To make your own video, the AUDIO is the most important thing. Make sure you close enough to be picked up by the microphone, or if you have the technology to pull it off (Like Camtasia Studio) you can record the audio on a portable device and sync the video later.
Easy Video Player
There are tons of tools for video that are free (YouTube for example). This tool is NOT free, but it is focused on getting your more sales. How?

You can embed an email sign up list, RIGHT IN THE VIDEO. You can have the video redirect the viewer to a web page (like your store).

YOU can have "Buy Now" button right in your video.

You get video analytics.

Do split testing with videos.

Secure content from theft (stops people from playing it on their website).

Add overlays that are linkable on your videos.

You can have buy now buttons appear at a certain time.

The thing that sounds annoying about it is it comes with a membership to some marketing website. Granted you can cancel anytime you want, but (for me) if I'm purchasing software I'm not interested in a marketing membership.  The software goes for $127 and if you want the non-branded version it's basically $200.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>George Hrab gave away his entire CD for free as one giant file.  He spent lots of money recording it, and putting together a great package for the CD. He had a lot to lose, but he decided to use podcasting and give it away for free.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1721" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="George hrab Tops the CDBaby Charts" src="http://marketingmusician.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/georgehrab.png" alt="" width="280" height="232" />The results? The CD brought up the sales of all his other CDs, and the CD itself outsold all his previous five CDs combined. His CD ended up on the charts at <a title="George Hrab" href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/hrab6/from/jammindave" target="_blank">CDbaby</a>, and is on the &#8220;Top Sellers&#8221; list at <a title="George Hrab" href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/hrab6/from/jammindave" target="_blank">CDBaby</a> in the Rock/Funk Category.</p>
<p>George produces the Geologic Podcast which is a podcast critical thinkers/skeptics/ atheists (of which George is one). His podcast has boosted him as a leader in this niches, and he is asked to speak at conventions for skeptics. This is a dream come true as George gets to hang out with people he has admired, and then play his music right in front of his target market (critical thinkers).</p>
<p>To this I say if you believe in anything, put it out there. It may scale back your over all appeal, but in return you get loyalty. Look at the Rage Against the Machine. They are overly political and criticise all politicians (both liberal and conservative). Do some people not like that type of topic? Sure, but those that do REALLY do.</p>
<p>This is just part one of the discussion between George and myself. I will be splicing in parts of our conversation in future episodes.</p>
