			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From my TOI blog :<a href="http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/freeze-frame/entry/dirty-dirty-pictures" target="_blank"> Freeze Frame</a></p>
<p>It was a sultry Sunday evening in Calcutta, sometime in the late-eighties. I had settled down on my favourite cushion, by the tall window, in our hall. The hall housed our new colour television set, which had recently replaced the old, sturdy black &amp; white Bharat TV that once held pride of place.</p>
<p>That particular Sunday was abound with possibilities and I could hardly wait for evening to descend. The television listings that I spent time on every morning had a pleasant surprise in store &#8211; Doordarshan was going to telecast Julie that evening. Yes, Julie. Remember the radio playing “Dil kya karein jab kisiko kisi se pyaar ho jaye” on Vividh Bharti that every teenager hummed when he set his sights on a pretty lass? I was old enough to know that Julie had caused quite a stir in its days for its bold scenes, and also like many things “adult” was out of bounds for me. Yet I was ready to try my luck. After all, wasn’t everything that was out of bounds a legitimate reason to try push one’s luck? There was a subtle excitement in the hope that someday I would surely be successful. And may be today was going to be that day.</p>
<p>My favourite cousin, a few years older in age and considerably older in experience was on her summer break, and it didn’t take long for us to realize that we perhaps stood a better chance if we teamed up together to come up with a plan that allowed us to hoodwink the elders and watch Julie on the sly. The last resort was bribing our movie-loving grandmother to be our partner in crime. Today, I blame those treacherous teen years entirely for such foolhardiness.</p>
<p>Our reverie was, however, rather short lived. My father, who on other Sundays, kept himself busy with his books in the Baithak-khana, had got wind of our plotting. So even before the screen could come alive with the title track, he walked into the room and switched off the television. As we stared at him doe-eyed in our ‘innocence’, he followed it up with a sermon on how such “Awposanskriti” was eroding our values, principles and morals. The other elders who had gathered in that sombre hall by then agreed with Baba &#8211; some wholeheartedly, while some significant others, including my grandmother, perhaps, because they had no other option but to agree.</p>
<p>This was not the first time that I had faced his ire, nor would it be the last, but it was definitely the last time for aspiring to watch “adult” movies on the sly, till I had become a responsible adult myself. And when my grudge had made way for a deeper understanding, I realized that all he had wanted to achieve that evening was to instill within me a sense of propriety and appropriateness, till a point in time that I was able to distinguish between black and white, fantasy and reality, family entertainment and entertainment for certain members of the family.</p>
<p>Decades later, as a responsible parent of an impressionable eleven year old, I often feel like an aberration among my generation for having very strict TV viewing rules, curtain bans on movies, channels and social media and for harbouring the belief that the cub needs her mother’s protection from the big, bad world. Preserving her innocence over overt-exposure is high priority. And every day I find that I am fighting a losing battle.</p>
<p>Why? Because if the late eighties had one Julie trying to invade our homes, the 21st century has a battalion of Munnis, Jalebi Bais, Chikni Chamelis, Sexy Sheilas, Rakhis and their accompanying serials kissers popping out of the window. Even the once innocent cartoon channels leave little to the imagination with their poor Hindi translations and colloquialisms.</p>
<p>Who do we have to blame for this? The Censor Board? The film producers? The directors? The actors? The screenplay writer? Advertising agencies? Or the viewing public that thirsts for such trollop? Is it not true that over the past few decades we have appear to have loosened our moral purse strings considerably and today allow almost everything in, in the name of entertainment, a realistic slice of life or plain reportage? Haven&#8217;t we lowered our walls and raised our threshold to accept only trash in the name of entertainment? And that too across the print, electronic and outdoor media.</p>
<p><img src="http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/freeze-frame/resource/collage2.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Few parents today bat an eyelid over inappropriate content. In fact, I frequently come across ‘responsible parents’ who have taken their 5-8-year old children to watch movies like LSD, Dirty Picture, Delhi Belly, Vicky Donor and Hate Story, in the name of entertainment. All of us sit through parties, musical evenings and so called cultural evenings when little girls and boys ape the suggestive gyrations of “Sheila ki jawani”, “Munni badnam hui” and “Jalebi Bai” while the world clap and cheer them for their finesse. And this is the dirty, rotten reality of our times, the real dirty picture.</p>
<p><img src="http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/freeze-frame/resource/collag1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>No, I am not a prude, and I don’t consider myself a conscience keeper for society at large. I just carry a wishlist in my pocket. I call it the &#8220;list of impossible wishes&#8221;. Here is how it goes : I would definitely like better and cleaner movies for my daughter, I would like less nudity, sexual innuendoes and vulgarity thrust upon us in the name of entertainment, I would like better censorship, better ratings for movies that don&#8217;t have enough to be called an &#8220;adult&#8221; movie but is nonetheless inappropraite for children, I would like better sense to prevail over parents and the &#8220;the list of impossible longings&#8221; gets loger. And since my wishlist is fraught with impossibilities, I have shelved it a long time ago. Like many of you, I squirm, rant, complain and impose stricter rule upon the child. I know that there is no instant solution to the mess. Yet I will continue to believe that everything has an appropriate time, and that over exposure to adult movies, images and innundeos are perhaps a little premature for children, even though I know, I am fighting a lonely losing battle.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><strong><a href="http://csaawarenessmonth.com/">In support of Child Sexual Abuse Awareness Month April</a> 2012</strong></h4>
<p><a href="http://csaawarenessmonth.com/"><img title="CSAlogo2012" src="http://somaghosh.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/csalogo2012.png?w=270&#038;h=270" alt="" width="270" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>Every little girl has a story to share. Often a dark, grim secret. A subplot to the joys and sorrows of girlhood. The people, faces, voices, hands, eyes  vary but the story remains the same. Of innocence lost. Of shame inflicted by perverted adults. Of children who learn &#8216;not to talk&#8217;. Of children who, as adults, learn to hide the scars and move on with life.</p>
<p>This is little X&#8217;s story :</p>
<p>&#8220;She was 8. She stood by the window, looking down at the square, full of kids, who screamed, laughed, fought, yanked at each others&#8217; hair, played and mostly laughed. Her small feet, were on the tip of her toes, peering down to catch every action of her friends. Her eyes were forlorn, as if they yearned to be a part of that laughing, playing pack yet something dark and sad held her back. She had, of late, started to stay away from her playmates, had quietened more than normal. Nobody may have noticed, but she knew that she was not the same any more. She was confused, scared and embarrassed of herself. She wanted to run, play, scream, jump and be happy, but &#8230;.</p>
<p>It all started a few days ago, when she was taken to the new doctor-uncle in the neighbourhood, for a nasty cold. Something was wrong when he kept poking and probing her behind that curtain he had drawn between her and her mum. His touch. His hands touching her in places that felt uncomfortable. She felt a wretched feeling running deep in her veins. By then he had pulled back the curtain and was busy writing out a prescription. She had come home, scared. But she never told anybody anything because she didn&#8217;t know what to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this is just one of those millions of stories. A little girl, even before she has grown aware of her girlhood is subjected to hands, often unseen by an adult eye, pinching her baby bottom, touching her, spreading a cold shiver, a hot flush, a wretched feeling through her being and then disappearing. Dirty eyes running up and down her body, making her cringe, wanting to hate herself and hide in shame. What is worse is that more often than not it is a known face, a relative, a family friend, the friendly neighbourhood uncle. Outside the known walls, the darwan, the shopkeeper or even a man who walked past her.</p>
<p>And in the middle of this trauma and shame, most of these little girls do not find the words to articulate the pain. And in some cases, even if she does manage to talk, the adults are not ready to accept the truth.</p>
<p>The sexual assault, in whatever form on manner, inflicted upon children leaves a scar that is very hard to remove and difficult for the child to deal with. I happened to speak to a few of my friends while preparing to write this difficult piece and what I found surprising and painful is that a number of women they know have been living with such scars from various stages of their childhood that haven&#8217;t healed. They have taught themselves to move on, ways to hide behind big bags, heavy dupattas, loose clothes, dodge dirty hands in the crowd and keep out of sight of the ever smiling genial uncle who had little control over his rogue hands.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take off those rose tinted glasses and stop living in a world that believes that such things are figments of a child&#8217;s imagination or that these are rare cases. These incidents happen everywhere and it can happen to anybody. Even little boys. I will not quote statistics to prove my point. Enough has been proven by numbers, but mere numbers haven&#8217;t been able to change anything. However much we dwell this grim reality, we are at best scratching the surface. The ambit is much larger. The solitary incident that I have addressed here is only the tip of the iceberg. The reality is that a large group of perverted, twisted predators, in the guise of genial human beings are preying on our children.</p>
<p>Talk to your child. Tell her or him the difference between &#8216;good&#8217; touch and &#8216;bad&#8217; touch. Ask them to tell you the moment they feel uncomfortable in someone&#8217;s company. Win their trust. Do not push them away by doubting them, that would be the worst thing possible for a traumatised child. Shed your own inhibitions and talk to them freely. Tell them that there is no reason for them to feel embarrassed about their body or hide. It is the pervert who is wrong to touch them inappropriately. SHE or HE IS NOT GUILTY.</p>
<p>The child often does not understand sexual abuse. Just like little X, he or she is confused, scared and embarrassed. Let us help them tell us their story instead of living with the scars for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p><img src="http://author.toiblogs.com/freeze-frame/resource/apu.jpg" alt="" width="217" height="182" />  <img src="http://author.toiblogs.com/freeze-frame/resource/teenka12.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="188" />  <img src="http://author.toiblogs.com/freeze-frame/resource/nrsng.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="188" />  <img src="http://author.toiblogs.com/freeze-frame/resource/sc6.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="182" />  <img src="http://author.toiblogs.com/freeze-frame/resource/roy.jpg" alt="" width="188" height="188" />  <img src="http://author.toiblogs.com/freeze-frame/resource/satpk.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="165" /></p>
<p>These are only a few of the masks that his face has donned through his career that has spanned five decades, in more than 300 movies, some classics, some memorable and a few forgettable. The tall, lean physique, sharp, laughing, talking, sad, deep eyes, an aquiline nose, thin lips that part to flash a charming smile and curl up in anger when the character demands it and a chiselled, almost stubborn jaw. I know his strapping stature, his broad shoulders, his intelligent, piercing gaze and his boyish smile. I know the fingers that hold his favourite Charminar, one arm folded as the other supports it, the furrows on his forehead and the twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>And the face changes to an older, rugged, grease smeared Rajput&#8217;s face, poised between whether he wants to stay on the right path or should he embrace the easy. The same man is a different man again: a bespectacled married man caught between his principles and his marriage vows. A new mask, that of Mayurvahan, the cunning, conspiring minister of Jhind, masterminding the overthrow of the crown prince, in the heart of Madhya Pardesh. Yet another mask, that of an anti-hero, who is not the hero nor the villain but embodies both, an antithesis to the idea of the hero that has been imprinted in our minds; he lies, he is a coward, he is a thief, he is also Montu &#8211; an aimless young man of the late 60&#8242;s; Sandip, the selfseeking, self proclaimed revolutionary with anything but revolution on his mind; Chiranjib, the golden hearted hooch smuggler, living on the wrong side of the law and flirting with danger; Khitish Sinha, an aging swimming coach looking fo his next champion; Pradyot, an aging, reclusive thespian who is drawn out of his exile, to enact yet another role. Remember Shyam, from Basanta Bilap, who locked horns with the residents of a women&#8217;s hostel in his neighbourhood? Or pandit Gangacharan Chakravarti, in a pair of black-rim spectacles, a black umbrella firmly tucked under his arm, who scrambles to survive the great Famine of 1943 and exploits fellow villagers for his own surival? And of course, Prodosh Mitter aka Feluda, the private investigator who weilds his &#8216;mawgajastro&#8217; to fight foes like Maganlal Meghraj, Amiyanath Burman and Mandar Bose?</p>
<p>Every time the lights in the vast theatre would dim and darkness would surround the audience, a man emoted, laughed, cried, fretted, fumed, despaired, repented, loved or looked back in silent anger, time after time, in various frames as different characters. The same man but every time a new face that changed colours like the chameleon, in the shades that coloured that character. A legendary thespian - essentially Soumitra. In one of his interviews, Soumitra modestly attributes this vast array of characters portrayed on screen to his fear of becoming stereotyped. I attribute it to his sheer genius and a rare honesty that he breathed into each of the characters he transformed into, on screen. That is what made him an essential &#8216;star&#8217; element in the strange alchemy of movie making. And to us, his viewers, the essential alchemist.</p>

<p>Soumitra&#8217;s journey had almost ended before it began in 1956, when he was rejected at the screen test of <em>Neelachale Mahaprabhu</em>. It finally dawned in 1959, a period when Bengali cinema was already heading towards its golden era. Satyajit Ray, whose contibution to Bengali cinema is often considered to be the greatest, had opened the doors of the silver screen to him. With Satyajit Ray&#8217;s Apur Sansar, the twenty-four year old Soumitra suddenly became a household name and the new promising star of Bengali cinema. The auteur&#8217;s new apprentice has had no reason to look back. By the late masetro, Ray&#8217;s, own submission, Soumitra had gone on to inspire many roles that Ray etched and executed in celluloid. The unmistakable charisma of Soumitra in 14 of Satyajit Ray&#8217;s 31 feature films, somehow seems inevitable as the apprentice over time carved out a niche for himself as a master of his craft. This creative niche and his natural intellectual aura allowed him to work with other great directors of the sixties and the seventies in the likes of Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha, Ajoy Kar as much as with a new generation of directors in the new millenium. The playright-poet-actor, to my mind, is still an essential part of both mainstream and parallel Bengali cinema.</p>
<p>Being from Calcutta, a tryst with theatre is inevitable and I remember sitting in the darkeness of Bijon Theatre, watching a middle aged Soumitra as Rajkumar on stage for the first time. His baritone voice cut through the cold, dark silence. The desire to watch him live on stage, again and again, was the only reason that I kept returning to watch theatre, even if it meant playing truant to hop across to Rabindra Sadan and Academy of Fine Arts. The legendary Shishir Kumar Bhaduri had been his mentor in thetre, an association that, dated back to his days in college, and had only strengthened his resolve to become a professional actor. As I watched him in awe, I often found myself wondering whether it was theatre that had made him the actor he is.</p>
<p>And yet I could not reconcile myself to the fact that beyond the mid-eighties, with the downward spiral of the Bengali film industry, his body of work, mainly in mainstream cinema, seemed to decline sharply in quality. But, in time,  he stepped out from under the arclights and retired to the role of a character actor, where he continued to do what he did best &#8211; take every opportunity he could to turn in a performance of his lifetime.</p>
<p>A genius is often recognized last at home. This has indeed been the story of his life as well. It was only after being honoured by the French Government&#8217;s Officier des Arts et Metiers and a Lifetime Achievement Award from Italy, that he was offered the Padma Shri award from the Indian government in the 1970s, which he chose to decline. Instead in 2004, he accepted the prestigious Padma Bhushan. However, in 2001 he turned down the Special Jury Award for Best Actor as a mark of protest against the bias of the National Film Awards Committee in awarding popular and mainstream cinema over art films. And, on 9 June 2008, he was awarded the 2007 National Film Award for Best Actor.</p>
<p>Is his attitude toward national awards a reflection of his indifference toward the industry of which he has long been a part or his inflated sense of self? He put all doubt to rest, in an interview in 2007, shortly after he was awarded the National Award for the Best Actor &#8211; &#8220;<em>I have long since lost all interest in these awards because they have so often been given to someone who does not deserve it or to someone who isn&#8217;t really worth naming. It&#8217;s not attitude or ego problem, it is simple, reasonable thinking. I feel I have worked in 14 of Mr (Satyajit) Ray&#8217;s films and I was not considered to be the best actor in any one of them</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well perhaps the industry finally got things right when on 21 March 2012, he was declared the recipient of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for lifetime contribution to Indian Cinema. But is this too little too late? It does make you wonder.The septagenarian actor, who lives and breathes movies and theatre for the sheer joy and love of the profession, is also battling Cancer. But he does not want to hang up his shoes yet. Perhaps, the adrenalin rush of grease paint, clap sticks and the arclights is something he cannot close his mind to completely, not as yet.</p>

<div>From my TOI blog :<a href="http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/freeze-frame/entry/sinhala-dossier-iv"> Freeze Frame</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>Remember the overflowing Amaya Lake that could have swept us away the night before? Well, the next morning, the lake looked placid, as if it was all a bad dream. It was still overflowing lazily, over its embankment, on to the connecting road. The angry, rushing waves had mellowed with the heavy shower being replaced by a steady drizzle. We were once again on the road, this time leaving behind the hills for the flatter, drier, red-soiled plains of the cultural triangle of Srilanka – Sigiriya, Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura – all UNESCO World Heritage sites, and the treasures that had lain buried close to their heart for centuries.</div>
</div>
<p>A rainy, cool afternoon revealed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigiriya">Sigiriya</a> &#8217;rock&#8217; fortress, an architectural wonder with its water garden, rock garden, mirror wall and of course, the famous Lion Gate &#8211; known for the two huge paws of a lion carved out of rock that evidently ‘guarded the entrance to the fortress’ many hundreds of years ago. But, nowhere did they mention that the fortress was built &#8216;on&#8217; and around the Sigiriya Rock, which &#8220;is a hardened magma plug, from an extinct and long eroded volcano&#8221; (source, Wikipedia) and that the Lion Gate, the Mirror Wall and the Sigiriya Maidens were all situated at various levels in the rock several hundred steps above the ground. The summit &#8211; a climb of 1200 steps &#8211; promised a view of the remnants of the Royal Palace and a bird&#8217;e eye view of the plain that spread out upto the horizon. Such a climb, for a person who hates heights, better still is scared of heights ( and that would be me), can be very trying, trust me. But, I did manage to reach the Lion Gate, two giant lion paws sculpted out of rock, on a plateau beyond the first 800 steps of sheer torture, happy, light headed and numb with the fear that I had just fought all the way up there. My two brave soldiers continued to climb the next four hundred steps, to roam the ruins of the Royal Palace, long after I had retired and sat back to feel the light drizzle on my face.</p>
<p>A few hours away was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonnaruwa" target="_blank">Polonnaruwa</a>, one of the earliest seats of Buddhism in Srilanka as well as one of the earliest capital cities. Polonnaruwa gives the curious traveller the feeling of a huge open air museum, with remains of a rich past scattered amongst the excavated rocks and remains.</p>
<p>The mellow afternoon sun revealed the awe inspiring “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal_Vihare" target="_blank">Gal Vihara</a>” – near perfect sculptures of the Buddha that have stood the test of time since the 12th century. A little ahead of us was the first excavation site of the ancient city of Polonnaruwa, a structured and well-planned city from an earlier civilisation that now stood pregnant in its silence. We decided to take a walk amongst the ruins of stupas and the Royal Palace and stood in stunned silence before the broken walls of the Lanka Tilaka temple, with its headless deity still standing tall. In the dying light of the December twilight we walked on towards the silohouettes of the Sacred Quadrangle, with the crumbling pillars reaching skywards and the stupas fast becoming a blur.</p>
<p>The next day, our final stop in the cultural triangle was Anuradhapura, a marvellous location that houses the earliest Dagoba in the country ,wherein evidently lies buried the collar bone of the Buddha, and of course, the Mahabodhi Tree, a fifteen hundred year old Pipul tree, a tree that grew from a branch of the Pipul tree under which Buddha is said to have attained his Bodhisattva. Anuradhapura felt very rooted in its Buddhist past, with the calm, silent air only broken by solemn chants of the Buddhist monks drifting in from distant monasteries.</p>
<p>While the trip had been peppered with niggling worries, neither the Bee nor me  had felt the urge to switch on our respective mobile phones, reply unanswered email, update Facebook or for that matter “live tweet” the trip. All we had done was eat, sleep, take hundreds of pictures and look all around us to see what more could be, and more importantly, should be captured in our mind’s eye.</p>
<p>Two days later, it was time to go.</p>
<p>We all climbed into Nandana’s van, with my Red Palm saplings sitting cosily in a laundry basket, happy to be heading homewards. There was just one stop between us and the airport – Negombo, a sea beach of ourstanding beauty that we would cross on the long drive down the coastal road on our way back to Colombo. As we lunched at the sea side restaurant, on a sumptuous spread of international and Srilankan delicacies, we watched the boats with large, picture-perfect sails lazily go by in the late afternoon sun, a number of wind-surfers skilfully negotiate the breeze and a bevy of tourists, shades delicately perched on their noses, waiting for the perfect tan while local ladies, in long, flowing skirts sold colourful batik sarongs and scarves.</p>
<p>The last night at Colombo would have been uneventful had it not been for a ‘chance encounter’ with the 400 pilgrims of the ‘six days – seven nights’ Ramayana Tour, who seemed to have virtually overtaken our hotel. We left them behind in the crowded, chaotic lobby, preparing to go into their banquet hall before they were told of the following day’s agenda. They would no doubt have a wonderful time in Srilanka as well, much like we did, amid the warm beaming smiles, the piquant cuisine, the red palms, the colourful masks, the golden beaches and the loquacious history of the Emerald Isle.</p>
<p>Holidays were meant to refresh and rejuvenate. Srilanka definitely did the same for us!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From my TOI blog :<a href="http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/freeze-frame/entry/sinhala-dossier-iii"> Freeze Frame</a></p>
<p>From Galle to Kandy took the most part of day six and by the time we had started climbing the hilly terrain, the late December afternoon had mellowed into a cooler twilight – the Red Palm that had welcomed us into the country now peeped out of almost everyone’s gardens alongside exotic orchids, erum lilies &amp; lush foliage. Once on Main Street, Kandy, we eagerly kept an eye out for the hotel we were supposed to stay in for the next two days. The ever smiling Nandana, our new driver, and his cousin, Lakshana aka Lucky, corrected our perceptions and informed us that we were still in Kandy and another hour and half away from the hotel. Our travel agency had ‘forgotten’ to inform us that the hotel was in Gampola, a town 25km from Kandy, atop an isolated hill. Trust me, the first ride to the hotel, on a pitch dark road that kept winding up precariously around sharp bends raised several critical questions in both the adults’ minds, which we didn’t dare ask in front of the 10-yr old who sat snuggled up between us. But the last few bends were so treacherous that I couldn’t keep my fear of heights under control any more and blurted out, ‘God, this is scary. Even if we manage to reach the hotel, how on earth are we going to scale this for the next two days?’ My brave little R wrapped her small fingers tightly around my clenched fist and said in a tiny yet trying to sound reassuring voice, ‘Don’t worry, Mama, even I’m scared’. If Kandy is the Shimla of Srilanka, evidently Nuwara Eliya is supposed to be the Switzerland of Srilanka, but we wouldn’t know that, not at least on this trip. ‘No hotels are available,’ was what our travel agent had informed us before we had left Mumbai and now sitting in Kandy, barely a couple of hours away from the fragrant tea gardens, all we could do was to utter the choiest expletives under our breath for trusting the premium international travel agency in Bandra that had made us believe they had our best interests at heart. But we had no option but to swallow our anguish. Looking out of the French windows of our &#8216;deluxe suite&#8217; the following morning, which yet again left much to be desired, we found nature had conspired to put many of the misgivings to rest: the early morning fog was swirling up from the valley beneath as a small train chugged its way up a hill through the the trees and the first few birds had started to venture out in ones and twos in the light rain that had begun falling the night before. So what were we to see in Kandy? ‘The Temple of the Tooth Relic, Botanical Garden, Kandy Royal Palace, mask and batik shopping and Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage’, rambled Lucky almost as if he was talking in his sleep. ‘Today Pinnawala and Botanical Garden; tomorrow, at 10, sharp, Temple of Tooth Relic’. And like good children, later in the day, we allowed ourselves to be led through the meandering pathways of the botanical gardens before we got an opportunity to &#8216;shake a trunk&#8217; with the pachyderms of Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage, many of whom had been orphaned during the Tsunami. R came away proud of having &#8216;bottle-fed&#8217; a baby elephant! The following morning, the Bee, R and I, climbed into Nandana&#8217;s big van along with our family of two &#8216;pregnant&#8217; strolleys, a laundry bag full of red palm saplings, some Srilankan wood carvings, a few masks and countless nick-nacks, the purchasing of which, got us late and took away from us the opportunity of entering the sanctum sanctorum of the hallowed Temple of the Tooth relic, which is thought to house a tooth of the Holy Buddha (and you would have thought the guides would have known the timings of the temple!). Quite disappointed with the morning, we set out for Dambula, our first stop in the Srilankan cultural heritage triangle that boasted of a spectacular Buddhist monastery carved in the rock 160m above its surrounding plains. Dating back to the second century BC, Dambula is still very much functional as a monastry. To our astonishment, we found that this magnificient world heritage site hosts 153 statues of Lord Buddha, 3 statues of Srilankan kings and several statues of Hindu Gods and Goddesses in 5 key caves. For once, our expectations weren&#8217;t belied. The photographs in the Srilankan tourism brochures did justice to what was there before us. So, that evening, tired though we were, there were no misgivings in our mind about ploughing on to our next hotel &#8211; a beautiful Lake Resort, which we were told offered the finest in Srilankan hospitality. But that, we soon realised, is after you reached the hotel. Lest you think I am needlessly complaining, here is what happened: the rains had started falling from the night before; not a torrential downpour or heavy rain; a steady drizzle, that had gathered momentum through the day, but which gave no indication that the droplets had gathered momentum to form a huge force of water that had overflowed the embankments of the Lake Kandalama or Lake Amaya and had swept away part of the road. The near absolute darkness of the Srilankan bush had hidden this little secret from us until we very nearly drove into it. We realised the &#8216;depth&#8217; of situation only after the van had screeched to a halt at a slope on the unpaved road, a few meters from a stream of gushing water, that had come into sight because of the highbeam of our van. Not another soul had stirred on that road on that night till we turned around and hit another highway again. Strange, if you consider that we had been on the phone with the front desk twenty times to a dozen in the past hour to seek directions to the hotel and the &#8216;near incident&#8217; took place barely a couple of kilometres from the hotel. What surprised us even more was that our driver and navigator who appeared to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown a couple of minutes ago, seemed wonderfully composed and dismissive when confronted with what had very nearly happened at the hotel. &#8216;Happened? Sir, but nothing really happened. You are all here aren&#8217;t you?&#8217; We jolly well were. But that, we went on to learn, was part of the joie-de-vivre of the Srilankan psyche. A beautiful country, once torn apart by war, the Srilankans had grown to appreciate the good things in life and ignore much that could or would worry them. For us denizens of Maximum City, however, it left us as Commander Bond might aver, &#8216;shaken and not &#8216;stirred&#8217;.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From my TOI blog : <a href="http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/freeze-frame/entry/dear-writer" target="_blank">Freeze Frame</a></p>
<p>Dear Writer,</p>
<p>This morning, the postman returned the last few letters that I had written to you in autumn last year. As always, I had posted the letters to your address in the Ivory Tower. But they came back with &#8220;the addressee has moved&#8221; stamped on them. So, have you changed your arrogant, skyscraping address? Do you no longer sit by your lofty window on the Ivory Tower and watch the clouds float by? Have you finally come down to dwell amongst us commoners, in the city of Babel? Or have you lost your way among the crowded alleys and the bazaars of Babel? And I can&#8217;t help but wonder why? What would have made you leave your lofty abode and come down to earth?</p>
<p>Do you remember the first time we had met? I was a little girl, recuperating from what sounded like a bout of a strange disease to my young ears. I remember, I was propped up by my pillows on the bed, staring out of the window, scraggly and tired of being ill for so long. My father removed the brown paper cover from the package he held in his hand and a book appeared &#8211; a book about a vet from the deep African jungles by the River Limpopo. I was still to learn my alphabets well, so it became another reason to bond with my father &#8211; his baritone reciting from the book at any hour of the day I whimmed upon.</p>
<p>And from then on, we embarked upon a journey &#8211; my father, you, dear writer and I. He would read fascinating tales that you had penned, about the little boy who spoke to animals, about Shakuntala, Raja Vikramaditya, Thakumar jhuli, Tuntunir Golpo &#8211;  magical creatures, prince and princesses, dragons and demons &#8211; the list grew longer. You and I had become best friends. You know, I was in a great hurry to learn my alphabets, so that I could return to you on my own. You see, later, when my father stayed away from home on long official tours  it became very difficult to fill up those empty hours without listening to your stories. And all through the years of my growing up &#8211; my girlhood, my torrid teenage years, and confusing early adult years, I found shelter in your words, your thoughts, your expressions, your imagination, your prose. You sealed all the lonely gaps, filled up my life, the solitary corner in a chaotic party, long lounging hours on my father&#8217;s easy chair, the junior school library, the forbidden shelves of the senior school library, boring lectures, stressful exams and in between heart breaks with old moth eaten books from the old book-alleys of Kolkata, just because I always loved whatever you wrote. Just because I loved you speaking to me through those pages, painting my world with a sea of stories, dear story teller. Because, I&#8217;ve always loved listening to you.</p>
<p>I know, in all my letters I keep talking about moving from one city to another, from one country to another. And I keep telling you how difficult each move would have been had you not been there looking out for me. Every word of it is true. Meeting new faces, getting to know the city, walking the alleys, roaming the bazaars and spending hours in bookshops admiring your latest books. Do you remember me telling you that during my first summer in the desert city, I had actually had a dozen books couriered to me from Kolkata, because the foreign city did not have a decent bookshop? And do you remember my hilarious encounter with a new neighbour who claimed that the sight of fat books made her go faint, because reading was not her cup of tea? I have lived in such cities and survived such neighbours, only because you smiled and showed me your world of pain, anger, joy, terror, lust and envy and I cried and laughed with you. Because, with you I found friends who loved books and the written word.</p>
<p>In one of your letters, from a long time ago, you had told me that &#8220;<em>Writing is utter solitude, the descent into the cold abyss of oneself</em>&#8221; and <em>&#8220;Writing a book is a long, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.<em>” </em></em>And everytime I asked you why you wrote, you had said, &#8220; <em>We write to taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospect.</em>&#8220;&#8216; I hung on to each of your words, from your letters, your essays, your poems and your prose. Every time you took out time to write back to me, I was encouraged a little more to ask more questions. On asking what is that one essential thing that is of utmost importance for your wiriting &#8211; an inspiration, a muse, paper, pen, thought, idea; you had mentioned &#8220;<em><em>I need solitude for my writing; not &#8216;like a hermit&#8217; &#8211; that wouldn&#8217;t be enough &#8211; but like a dead man.”</em></em> And I had thought all was well between you and your solitude, by your lofty window in Ivory Tower.</p>
<p>And then, suddenly, one day you stopped speaking to me. Your stories told tales of distant lands, strange creatures, magical maidens and voyages, but none of them spoke to me any more, none of them told me stories. My hours were no longer filled up with you or your quirky characters. Your stories now left me empty. You seemed distant and withdrawn.</p>
<p>And of late, I see that a lot of things have changed as have your priorities. You seem to have started to keep busy with a lot but writing. Settling down in your new address in the chaotic city of Babel among us lesser mortals, attending lit fests, speaking at august gatherings about evolved issues, opining about worldly matters, launching your books, marketing yourself, managing your image, lining up for long lists and short lists of awards and writing. Writing book after book, but writing in tune with what the publishers think will sell like hot cakes, books that will fly off the shelves overnight, genres that the new generation will identify with. Books that reviewers will love to review and critics will critique gently. And books that someday will be immortalised on the silver screen by some award winning movie director. And none of that is wrong. Because after all, you are human, aren&#8217;t you? A mortal, just like us, but immortalised by the words that flow through your pen.</p>
<p>But what about me, dear writer? And more like me, who had thought that it would be a life-long journey with you, sailing through your sea of stories, exploring new vistas with your idioms and metaphors? Have you forsaken me and my friends? Forever?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Your devoted reader</p>

<p><em>&#8220;God knows; I won&#8217;t be an Oxford don anyhow. I&#8217;ll be a poet, a writer, a dramatist. Somehow or other I&#8217;ll be famous, and if not famous, I&#8217;ll be notorious. Or perhaps I&#8217;ll lead the life of pleasure for a time and then—who knows?—rest and do nothing. What does Plato say is the highest end that man can attain here below? To sit down and contemplate the good. Perhaps that will be the end of me too.&#8221; &#8211; Oscar Wilde</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does this mean that the heart is finally healing?</p>
<p>I was out looking for me. I needed to find myself, some parts of me, that I thought were out there, somewhere. I also needed to find and know that part of me who I thought I hadn&#8217;t met before.</p>
<p>But my heart asked me to stop looking. I was taken by my hand and lead to me. I was looking at myself, in the mirror. And my heart said, &#8216;I had me. I had me all along.&#8217;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pain numbs me. Ghosts of follies past extend their ugly, rotting hands to reach me, embrace me and hold me back. They want me to stay, never leave, roam the darkness with them and fight the light.</p>
<p>But I must leave. I must leave this chaos behind and seek out my thoughts. Run after my words. Gather the ideas that lie scattered around the house, in corners, in the laundry basket, among the drying flowers in the vase, by the Giggle&#8217;s study table, up on her soft board, among the books that have been holding on to my book marks for months. In my Facebook updates, down my timeline. Among my tweets. In the darkest hours of the nights that I spend without sleep, waiting for a phone call from across the seas. Among the branches of the jaswanti, juhi and mogra. On the wings of a truant breeze that flies in from across the lake, touches me, murmurs your name and rushes past.</p>
<p>I had promised to give myself a break. A break after I had finished making sense of words, phrases, sentences, expressions in a language that I love because it&#8217;s my own and then translate all into another language that I fell in love with, much later. A break from ideating, chasing thoughts, putting them into words, freezing them in frames or painting them into pictures for you to admire. The recess became longer and then permanent. And painful.</p>
<p>My words have left me. I feel empty. They fail me every time. Every time I want to say something or express my pain, joy, anger or frustration. I try to cry, but no tears flow. There is a hole in the stomach and a  dull ache, somewhere very close to the heart. I know exactly why. But don&#8217;t know how to cure the pain or what will heal the wound.  Or how to exorcise the ghosts or fight the demons. No, I don&#8217;t know how to fill up this black hole either. All I know is that I want my words back. And my tears. The pain numbs me again.</p>
<p>I feel like the wasted, dried, shrivelled up plant that I had banished to a corner of the balcony, towards the end of winter. The branches resembled dead twigs, the leaves had dried, curled up and fallen off. I knew it was dead.</p>
<p>And as if to defy all logic, defy death and make me believe again, this morning little green leaf buds had raised their heads  on every dried node. The parched, dry, brown bark had burst open in places and life was spreading its arms towards light.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It had been lying in my armoir for a few months now.  An empty tin of Honey-Oatmeal cookies sat nestled among things that are necessary, useful, unused, keepsakes, iPods, scarves, handbags, clutches et al.</p>
<p><a href="http://somaghosh.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_3992.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2357" title="IMG_3992" src="http://somaghosh.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/img_3992.jpg?w=226&#038;h=300" alt="" width="226" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>On one of those several flights that we took last year, to Calcutta and back, the Giggle insisted that she was hungry and the ever-so-diligent mother had quickly bought her a tin of cookies from the trolley. It was an early evening flight, so the trolley was laden with potato wafers, tins of potato stickman, salted nuts and cookies. None of it was &#8216;food&#8217;. The cookies though had won my favour over rest of the junk.</p>
<p>The famished eleven year old had finished four of the six &#8216;cookies in the tin, leaving the last couple for the father, who she was leaving behind in Bombay, for the coming fortnight.</p>
<p>And after the rest was put to good use, I had kept the tin. For myself.</p>
<p>As a little girl, I always wondered about the old tin that used to emerge out of my grandfather&#8217;s mahogany armoire. The tin and what came out of it. It was a rather uninteresting looking old cigarette tin. There once used to be some pictures on it, some patches remained, as did a few letters of the brand. Strange that it had not rusted. Perhaps it was a keepsake, as a memory of days when my grandfather was a smoker. But I had always watched him pull out crisp, new bank notes from it. The notes, of various colours and sizes, fitted as snug as bugs in the tin. The lid closed and stopped a couple of millimeters short of bending the edges or crumpling them.</p>
<p>Mine is a pink cookie tin, bought off a trolley, on a flight to Calcutta. And I had to follow in my grandfather&#8217;s footsteps. For ever since I was a little girl, I had wanted to have a tin full of crispy, colourful notes of my own. So, since today morning, my tin has found a new purpose.</p>

<p>Now, will you tell me your cookie tin story?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From my TOI blog : <a href="http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/freeze-frame/entry/mumbai-s-missing-winter-memories-of-a-few-winters-past">Freeze Frame</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Melancholy were the sounds on a winter&#8217;s night.” &#8211; Virginia Woolf</p>
<p>What would be the earliest memory you have, of winter? A dark, gloomy, foggy day? A sharp, bitter cold morning? A nippy, sunny afternoon? Mellow sun? The silence that descended upon night when all sought a warm spot under the blanket, even the neighbourhood strays? White Christmas? Rainy and freezing cold? The frozen tip of your nose? Numb fingers and chattering teeth? Feet that refused to get warm under layers of blankets? <em>Nolen gurer sandesh</em>? Aromas of freshly fried <em>koraishutir kochuri</em><em> </em>wafting in from mum&#8217;s kitchen? Men and children in trade mark &#8216;monkey caps&#8217; (which for a long time was thought to be a Bengali idiosyncrasy, I beg to differ)? <em>Maidan</em> and <em>boi mela,</em><em> </em>bags full of new books? Losing your way home on foggy Delhi nights? Chai-pakoda? Piping hot instant cup noodles thawing your frozen organs, from the inside, on a freezing cold November afternoon at Jungfraojoch? Fond memories? Dark, depressing thoughts, best forgotten with that long winter night of the past?</p>
<p>Are you wondering why I&#8217;m asking so many questions? Why am I romanticising about winters past? Don&#8217;t you see that I am wistful? Why? Because, I live in Bombay. Because the time on my watch is almost half past three, the sharp light has just started to mellow outside my window and the fan rotates lazily overhead. Because we are in the last week of November. Because the temperature in Bombay everyday adamantly ranges between 34° and 25°.</p>
<p>Anyway. My earliest memory of winter would be of a particularly bitter winter in the &#8217;80s. That winter evening in Calcutta, when in all my five year old innocence, I went to complain to my mother about her sudden, unannounced absence from my life, she introduced me to this funny little bundle, swathed in a new blanket, called My Sister. That winter I had been strategically usurped by this little creature, who didn&#8217;t even know how to burp by herself, had no control over her fine haired, tiny, nodding head, could not even sit up and gurgled when she was happy.</p>
<p>Everyday, around noon, she would be given a massage with oil &#8211; perfected to a polish, packed off to the terrace and then put out in the sun, &#8216;to strengthen her bones&#8217; &#8211; as my grandmother would put it. This evidently was a routine for a new born, I was told. And evidently once upon a time, even I had been subjected to this &#8216;ritualistic-bone-hardening&#8217; pickling. A bevy of aunts, of all shapes and sizes, joined my mum on the terrace, draped in shawls of varied hues, soaking up the golden, mellow sun as their nimble fingers worked deftly at knitting needles. Balls of colourful wool fast transformed into wales of purl, ribs of cable and further into scarves, frocks, booties, caps &#8211; tiny and cheerful. I would loll, snuggle up to my mother, to warm my cold fingertips, toes, try to win back her love and then run away to join the giggling pride of cousins in their games. Soon, to my surprise, either the gurgling, tiny bundle&#8217;s warmth, or perhaps the long hours spent in the sun, not sure which of the two, thawed my resentment, and I transformed into a proud Didi.</p>
<p>A few winters later, the doe-eyed little riot was running around the same terrace, in woollen dresses that were once mine &#8211; her wild, curly mane following her as she chased me around, with a chubby fist full of orange peel &#8211; to squirt into my eyes. The devil! And a few winters further down in life, she and I lay on quilts put out to sun, on the same terrace, soaking up the same languid sun, reading, laughing, pulling at each other&#8217;s pigtails, with older cousins learning their ropes at the knitting needles while their curious, teenage eyes strayed from the wool, on to the neighbourhood terraces, boys etc. Winter spelt the end of school year, so only books of &#8216;consequence&#8217; found favour &#8211; only lazy afternoons, on the terrace, spent with cousins of all shapes and sizes, had the permission to be a part of my winter day. No television, no mobiles, no video games, BBs, PSPs, iPods, iPads  - nothing to distract the lazing mind rolling under the slanted rays that cast longer shadows.</p>

<p>Winters kept descending upon Calcutta. And oh, the joys it brought forth! Book fairs, <em>nolen gurer sandesh</em>,<em> </em><em>nolen gur</em>, bowls of diced tomatoes sprinkled with salt, freshly rolled, still-warm-to-the-touch <em>narkel naru</em>sprinkled with khus-khus and smelling faintly of camphor, the aroma of <em>Koraishutir kochuri</em> frying in the kitchen, afternoons on the terrace and long wintry nights. One particular year, the terrace changed address. I was older. The new terrace had a new skyline, more palm trees peeping from behind neighbourly terraces, pots full of zinnias, dahlias, marigolds nodding their heads from balconies, new faces lazing in the winter sun on their old jute carpets, some interesting, some curious, a few who spoke loudly, from across terraces &#8211; our new neighbours, in another part of my city. Some knitted, some read the day&#8217;s paper, some were lost in a siesta under blankets put out in the sun and some, young buccaneers, who hid in the shadow to steal glances at pretty, long haired girls who, in other seasons, barely graced their terraces.</p>
<p>And I had thought winters were all the same, perhaps everywhere, other than the places where it snowed, as suggested by pictures in the Readers&#8217; Digest. I had also imagined, in my teenage folly, that my winters would forever be the same. Like a winter&#8217;s day, short but full of promises. Camping by the banks of the Brahmaputra in December, winter nights spent at the foothills of the Mathaburu hills, watching the winter sun rise on the Ghats of Banaras, the crispy Christmas dawn in Shillong, the icy slopes of Rohtang Pass did correct my presumptions of teenage but every time I returned to Calcutta and these brief experiences became part of memory.</p>
<p>But Delhi decided to teach me a different lesson about winters, in particular. The mild, sunny Calcutta winter had been replaced by a long spell of bitterly cold winter. I would no longer return home to Calcutta. The gloomy, foggy, cold Delhi was home. The long, lonely park across from my balcony started to look barren with tall trees and their bare branches stretching skywards and one cold December day the children that came to play did not return any more. The long French windows on the western face of our C R Park house were visited by the setting sun&#8217;s tepid, slanted rays before evening descended with thick, dark fog that turned everything of the night into dark, eerie shadows. The cold and lonely terrace did not seem inviting either, not a soul to share it with, no one to chase me around, no cheerful chatter, and no clicking knitting needles weaving fancy patterns. Later, in the winters that followed, I had made enough friends to chatter away the winter blues, with steaming cups of <em>adraki</em> or <em>elaichi chai</em>, crispy, piping <em>mirchi pakoda</em>s, had learnt to soak up the early winter tepid sun as long as it lasted and also the secret of drying stubbornly wet clothes with the help of a room heater. Foggy nights did not scare me any more &#8211; not even after we lost our way home a few times and once up the hills, on our way to the camps on the slopes of Mukteshwar, overlooking Ranikhet. I was warming up to the winter in Delhi, though every year, the tip of my nose refused to &#8216;unfreeze&#8217; till winter left us.</p>
<p>I had never imagined that of all cities, I would reminisce about Delhi, about missing Delhi, that too, missing the winters in Delhi. I guess, it may not have been so, had my current &#8216;permanent address&#8217; not been in a city that has only two seasons and winter does not figure on that list. Three years back, when we had wanted to run away to the distant Swiss Alps, in November, to renew the feel of winter &#8211; we went hunting for winter wear and Maximum City sprang a surprise on us. No malls, no stores in town or in the suburbs had any stock of woollen wear! We were finally directed to &#8216;that-market-even-sells-tiger&#8217;s-milk-if you-can-afford-it&#8217; Crawford Market &#8211; to a particular departmental store, perhaps one of five in the city, where we found woollens for our trip. And that memory, of thawing internal organs over piping cup noodles &#8211; yes, that was from the Swiss Alps, under scarves, multiple layers of sweaters and jacket lined with down, one that I keep going back to as much as to the ones from Delhi &#8211; as I brave the 33°, in the last week of November, in Bombay.</p>
<p>But curiously enough, this year departmental stores in Bombay have, take a breath, sweaters, yes, woollen sweaters, shrugs, pullovers et al, being displayed on shelves. The afternoon sun is sharp and golden outside my window, the fan is still running at a high speed and I am wondering, &#8216;what do those stores know, that I haven&#8217;t guessed as yet? Do they have news of the &#8216;missing&#8217; winter finally descending upon us?&#8217;</p>
