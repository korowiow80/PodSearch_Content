			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a guest post by Ashlee McCullen</em></p>
<p>If your father or husband loves to exercise and can’t stop fiddling with his smartphone, a fitness gadget may be just up his alley. I’m going offer to Father&#8217;s Day gift suggestions that make tracking workouts and recording progress incredibly easy.</p>
<p>The hardware products I recommend make excellent companions to workout tracking apps, while the service subscriptions I recommend offer in-depth information that you just can’t get for free.</p>
<p><strong>FitBit Ultra</strong><a href="http://cloudfront.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/fitbit-ultra.png?9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-3115 alignright" title="fitbit-ultra" src="http://cloudfront.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/fitbit-ultra.png?9d7bd4" alt="Fitbit Ultra" width="241" height="261" /></a></p>
<p>For some FitBit enthusiasts, being without it is like being naked. This “lifestyle” fitness tracker is intended to go everywhere with its user, even in bed. By constantly tracking movements and monitoring sleep habits, the FitBit is great for helping individuals set and meet fitness goals. Its companion app includes a calorie counter, for a more holistic measurement. Perhaps best of all, it requires no action other than turning it on and attaching it. ($100)</p>
<p><strong>Garmin FR70 Fitness Watch</strong><a href="http://cloudfront.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/garmin-fr70.png?9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-3116 alignright" title="garmin-fr70" src="http://cloudfront.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/garmin-fr70.png?9d7bd4" alt="Garmin FR70 Fitness Watch" width="208" height="281" /></a></p>
<p>Made by the GPS mapping powerhouse Garmin, this fitness watch offers a readily accessible way to view your heart rate and progress as you exercise, enabling you to optimize a workout. Set the watch to track your jogs and other distance workout to keep track of where you’ve been, how long you exercised and how many calories you’ve burned. ($129)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wahoo Blue HR Heart Rate Strap for iPhone 4S</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://cloudfront.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/wahoo.png?9d7bd4"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3119 alignright" title="wahoo" src="http://cloudfront.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/wahoo-300x136.png?9d7bd4" alt="Wahoo Fitness Heart Rate Monitor" width="300" height="136" /></a>Sometimes, a single purpose product works better than an all-in-one, and that may just be the case for the Wahoo Heart Rate Monitor. Strap this onto your chest for accurate, continuous heart rate monitoring. Better yet, it interacts with several popular apps including Runkeeper. And despite its name, it works with non-iPhone smartphones; I had no problems syncing it with my <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/phones/cell-phone-detail.aspx?cell-phone=samsung-galaxy-s-4g">Samsung Galaxy from T-Mobile</a>. ($80)</p>
<p><strong>Runkeeper Subscription</strong><a href="http://cloudfront.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Runkeeper-App.jpg?9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-3117 alignright" title="Runkeeper-App" src="http://cloudfront.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Runkeeper-App.jpg?9d7bd4" alt="Runkeeper" width="124" height="124" /></a></p>
<p>If the dad in your life is serious about running (or wants to be that way), he’ll love an annual subscription to Runkeeper Elite. Runkeeper is a free running tracker app for iPhone and Android, and the Elite membership offers more statistics and resources. ($20)</p>
<p><strong>FitnessBuilder/PumpOne Subscription</strong><a href="http://cloudfront.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/FitnessBuilder-App.jpg?9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-3118 alignright" title="FitnessBuilder-App" src="http://cloudfront.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/FitnessBuilder-App.jpg?9d7bd4" alt="Fitness Builder" width="124" height="124" /></a></p>
<p>Of the fitness apps for iOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android, FitnessBuilder is perhaps the most well designed. The app is free, but to access the vast <a href="http://www.pumpone.com/">PumpOne library of exercises and workouts</a>, you’ll need a yearly subscription. While it’s price may seem a bit extravagant for a personal purchase, it’s just right for a gift. ($60)</p>

<p><a href="http://cloudfront.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/dorm-room.jpg?9d7bd4"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3111" title="dorm-room" src="http://cloudfront.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/dorm-room-300x225.jpg?9d7bd4" alt="Dorm Room Gym" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>Lets face it, when you go away to college, you are usually required to live in the dorms for at least a year, giving up the idea of &#8220;personal space&#8221; almost entirely. You are, all of a sudden, sharing a room with a stranger away from the comforts of a nice big house and refrigerator. So, when you are accustomed to a heavy workout routine and having the proper tools at your disposal for quick and easy diet maintenance. How can you maintain a healthy bodybuilding regime in the confinement of your dorm room and your even smaller student budget?</p>
<p><span id="more-3110"></span></p>
<h2>Diet Diet Diet</h2>
<p>Eating the right food is essential to any bodybuilder’s success, but it truly is the key to maintain positive gain in college. Stay away from beer and pizza at 2 am. The freshman twenty is not a myth and it takes dedication to avoid the temptation of late night unhealthy snacking while studying. The key to this is making sure that you have, on hand, a supply of healthy options for when you need a quick bite. Most dorm rooms allow for a small refrigerator and a microwave for cooking, some even have communal kitchens, making it possible for you to actually prepare meals.</p>
<p>Shop based on your circumstances, if a microwave is all you’ve got, you can make it work. Oatmeal, protein powder and fruit are easily stored on a shelf and can be quickly prepared and eaten on the way to class. Tuna is a great source of protein and can be stored easily. Add a piece or two of whole wheat bread and you’ve got lunch on the way to class.</p>
<p>The cafeteria should have chicken or some meat and potato options that work well if you cannot cook for yourself. Take advantage of the salad bar and any fruit that is available to grab and eat later. Keep nuts and protein bars on hand for those little meals or snacky times. When you are eating well, you can build muscle and will stay in shape.</p>
<h2>The Right Exercises</h2>
<p>Having an understanding of exercises that will benefit muscle gain which do not require equipment is essential to your success if you do not have time or money to go to the gym. Develop a workout plan that is filled with cardio, running in place or jumping rope, pushups, crunches and squats. All of these are exercises that can be done in a confined amount of space and at anytime, using your own bodyweight to make them effective. Take advantage of those study breaks and use them to give your body a break from sitting stiffly for so long.</p>
<p>Stretching is a necessary component to muscle training and is easy to do in small intervals, with no equipment and little room.</p>
<p>Most Dorm rooms have at least one TV in them and there are endless supplies of workout videos that can help guide and direct you, making sure you are doing a workout that is going to produce results. These videos are designed for people that need to work out &#8220;at home&#8221; and do not have access to a lot of equipment or space.</p>
<h2>Compact Equipment</h2>
<p>Health and fitness are very important these days; therefore the market for workout equipment is huge. You can easily find a pair of weights, a jump rope or a step that you can purchase at a good price to fit your college budget. These items can then be stored in the bottom of your closet or under your bed to pull out and use when you can and then toss them into hiding again once you are done. Resistance bands are another great option that take up little space and can be stored nearly anywhere. The best thing about these bands is that they provide a total body workout and you can use them anywhere.</p>
<h2>Will Power</h2>
<p>If you want to be successful at anything, will power and dedication are the key ingredients. The best diet and the hardest workouts aren’t going to do you any good unless you stick to them and make them your routine that you are committed to maintaining, no matter what. This means that late night study snacks are fruit and nuts, not pizza, and when you see your roommate heading out the door to the club or a keg party, you use the alone time to get in a nice hard workout. Sleep is also important in the repairing and building of muscle; so it is important to not be tempted to stay up late and hang out, even though it would be so easy.</p>
<p>There are many challenges facing the dorm bound bodybuilder, but none great enough to stand in the way of success.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Muscle Building Tips</strong> the Top 6 by guest author and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nobullbodybuilding.com/go/physiqueartist">Metabolic Masterpiece</a> author, Scott Tousignant</em>.</p>
<p>Are you struggling to gain muscle? Feel like you are busting your butt with nothing to show for it? I sympathize with your frustrations. As a former hardgainer who thought he had tried everything, I can relate to disappointment that burdens you when the promise of massive muscle gain yields little to no results. I won’t guarantee that you will gain 10, 20, or even 30 pounds of muscle by applying the advice below&#8230; but I can guarantee that applying these 6 <em>Muscle Building Tips</em> with consistency will finally break your free from the hardgainer label once and for all, just as it did for me.</p>
<p><span id="more-3106"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://cloudfront.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/scott.jpg?9d7bd4"><img class="size-full wp-image-3107 aligncenter rci_wppp_autopin" title="scott" src="http://cloudfront.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/scott.jpg?9d7bd4" alt="muscle building tips"width="371" height="335" /></a></p>
<h4>Muscle Building Tip #1: Incorporate a Variety of Rep Ranges Into Each Workout</h4>
<p>A common mistake among bodybuilders is to spend 4-8 weeks focusing on strength training in the 3-5 rep range, then move onto 4-12 weeks of hypertrophy training in the 8-12 rep range. There is no doubt that this can be effective, but if you want to maximize your muscle building potential you need to utilize every rep range within each workout.</p>
<p>When you incorporate both strength training and hypertrophy training within each workout they feed off each other. Strength training hit’s your muscles on a neurological level, which increases your ability to recruit more muscle fibers. It gives your muscles a more dense and “harder” look. Hypertrophy training hits your muscles on more of a metabolic and cellular level, increasing the size of the muscle, which is temporarily visible during and immediately after the workout as a result of the ‘Pump’. The more permanent and long term gain in muscle size is a result of your body adapting to hypertrophy training, increasing the size and numbers of your muscle filaments.</p>
<p>Research has shown that your body adapts to rep ranges faster than it will adapt to exercises, which means that it’s important to vary your rep range more frequently than it is to vary the exercises that you use. Don’t be afraid to mix in some high reps in the 15-25 range either. I know many bodybuilders who experienced rapid growth when they began to mix in some high rep leg presses into their training.</p>
<h4>Muscle Building Tip #2: Train With Adequate Volume</h4>
<p>The media and blogosphere have filled the heads of young trainees with a fear of over-training. I’m going to go against the grain and tell you to test those limits. For far too long I heeded that advice with nothing to show for it. As soon as the clock struck 60 minutes I would run like hell out of the gym for fear that my testosterone would rapidly drop and my body would immediately go into a catabolic state and start eating away at my precious muscle.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I took a stand and tested my limits that I realized that my body required a higher volume of training. More sets and more exercises were necessary to ignite muscle growth and transform my physique. 60-75 minutes should be sufficient time to crush an amazing workout. What I have discovered with myself and with my clients is that the extra 15 minutes is where I bring out the fine details of my physique.</p>
<h4>Muscle Building Tip #3: Incorporate a Variety of Training Protocol</h4>
<p>The best method for incorporating a variety of rep ranges and adequate volume to your workout is to include a variety of training protocol into each training session. Straightsets are great for the strength exercises, supersets are great for both strength and hypertrophy, and dropsets are great for tapping into the deep muscle fibers that are often neglected and untouched. Mixing in 8 sets of 8, Pyramids, Trisets, Giantsets, and other training protocol will stimulate your muscles in unique ways, forcing them to adapt and grow.</p>
<h4>Muscle Building Tip #4: Train with Focused Intensity</h4>
<p>Intensity isn&#8217;t necessarily about training so hard that you feel like puking. It&#8217;s about giving each and every rep 100% of your focus and attention. Making each rep count as if it&#8217;s the one that will lead to your ultimate goal.</p>
<p>This kind of focused intensity is the difference between mindlessly going through the motions and hoping for success&#8230; Or completely embracing the moment, soaking it all in, enjoying the process, and expecting success!</p>
<p>Every rep has a purpose. Pour your heart and soul into every inch of the movement.</p>
<h4>Muscle Building Tip #5: Get Adequate Sleep</h4>
<p>Consistently experiencing 8-9 hours of quality sleep everyday can play a key role in your muscle building journey. It provides your body with the opportunity to recover and rebuild, it reduces your stress, and it contributes to greater energy and mental clarity during your workout.</p>
<h4>Muscle Building Tip #6: Supplementation</h4>
<p>Supplementation is exactly what it’s defined as&#8230; a means of supplementing an already stellar nutrition plan. You should never place all of your hopes and dreams of building a lean and muscular physique on supplements alone. But some key supplements do have to potential to enhance your results.</p>
<p>Creatine is one of those supplements that has proven time and time again to improve strength and recovery. It can also make your muscles appear fuller. Consuming 5 grams of creatine once or twice per day is both safe and effective.</p>
<p>Fish oil is another outstanding supplement that carries both health and muscle building benefits. It can aid in recover and improve your strength.</p>
<p>Protein powders are more of a convenience thing&#8230; and for some, it’s a way of ensuring that their muscles receive an adequate amount of protein as quickly as possible post workout, so they can begin to recover and rebuild immediately.</p>
<p>So there you have it! The 6 <span style="text-decoration: underline">Muscle Building Tips</span> that have taken me from hardgainer status to experiencing Maximum Muscle Stimulation and building an impressive physique.</p>
<p>You could easily take this information and run with it, by designing a workout program on your own. Or you could take a much easier route, eliminating all the guesswork, and follow a strategically designed program that uses the above protocol and has been proven to work over and over again.</p>
<p>That strategically designed program is called <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nobullbodybuilding.com/go/physiqueartist">Metabolic Masterpiece</a>. Your body seriously won’t have a clue what hit it when you follow this training protocol. This is one of the few and rare programs that will increase your fat burning potential, while increasing your strength, and gaining lean, sexy muscle to shape and sculpt your body. This program has been my body transformation secret for years, until now.</p>
<p>One of the greatest benefits of releasing this program to the public has been seeing people get even better results than I have, when following the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nobullbodybuilding.com/go/physiqueartist">Metabolic Masterpiece Body Sculpting Program.</a></p>

<p>What a peculiar question I thought.   Who would gain weight by simply drinking a cup of coffee?  Then I realized that maybe it&#8217;s not common knowledge about what types of coffee people are referring to or in particular, how that coffee is prepared.</p>
<p><strong>Can You Gain Weight from Coffee IF:</strong></p>
<p>&#8230; you drink straight black coffee (caffeinated or decaffeinated) without anything added?  The answer is NO.  Like drinking water, straight black coffee without any additives of any sort, contains no calories and therefore you cannot gain weight.  You might over consume caffeine or too much water but any weight will be purely water and expelled thru natural processes.</p>
<p><span id="more-3092"></span></p>
<p><strong>Can You Gain Weight from Coffee IF:</strong></p>
<p>&#8230; you add in milk, sugar, dairy creamers, whipped cream, chocolate or any other type of additive that contains calories.  Adding in a single cube of white granulated sugar can add 9 calories.  A single cube isn&#8217;t much.  Add in some milk or creamer and you&#8217;ve added more calories.  Doing some simple math:</p>
<p>Brewed coffee with 2 tablespoons of half &amp; half can equal 41 calories.  Not a big deal depending on who you are but it&#8217;s quite easy to consume enough to add in 100 calories per day.  100 calories a day, 7 days a week and you&#8217;ve got an extra 700 calories a week.</p>
<p>At first it might not seem like much but over the course of a month, you can easily add a pound or two of unwanted fat.</p>
<p>If you are at all into the fancy brewed coffees with milk, sugar and other additives, you can have a single drink that is over 320 calories!  That&#8217;s easily enough to gain weight.</p>
<h3>Can you gain weight from coffee?</h3>
<p>You sure can IF you start adding in the various delicious substances available today.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m shocked that a single coffee with cream and sugar from Dunkin&#8217; Donuts adds up to a whopping 120 calories!  Just 1 small a day and the weight gain would be minor but significant over time.  The quickest way to lose the weight if you have this type of habit is simply to find some great tasting straight black coffee (try 100% Kona; nice and expensive too) and you&#8217;ll lose weight by doing absolutely nothing.  Even consuming 1 less per day if you have a bigger habit that 1 small could make a significant difference over a month.</p>
<p>Sometimes but not always, the easiest way to burn fat without losing any muscle or exercising more is portion control.  You save a few bucks, you lose some weight and you literally do nothing different except to curb one habit, by one portion.  It may not be the miracle solution but it can make a difference depending on your current habit and consumption.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Can you gain weight from coffee</span> just seemed like a strange question at the time but after some consideration from the various scenarios and given that many people are not aware of their portions, the calories in the beverages they consume or even the various additives, it became clear that something as simple as drinking coffee could put extra pounds on you over time.</p>
<p>The quick solution is to be aware of your coffee consumption and if you are using any additives (especially with calories of any sorts) to monitor your intake and adjust as necessary.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re stuck trying to get past a plateau and looking for alternative and unique methods to dig yourself out of a workout rut, you might want to keep reading.</p>
<p>With the explosion of the modern internet and growing number of experts giving you rehashed but slightly twisted fitness information, we&#8217;re all way past fitness overload.</p>
<p>Getting past a plateau can be a huge hurdle if you are trying to continually make some type of progress in your workouts.</p>
<p>This means that you should use every option at your disposal and be as efficient as possible in the gym in the time allotted.  Even more important, sticking to the basics with slight overload variations can get your past your sticking points without resorting to insane high intensity workouts or crazy exercises that are better suited for a circus performance.</p>
<p>One small note before we get started …</p>
<p><span id="more-3086"></span></p>
<h3>Watch Scott Tousignant Squat 365 Pounds!</h3>
<div id="video1"></div>
<p>with a little help showing off squats with <strong>resistance bands</strong> as help from above.</p>
<p>Remember what 4 time Mr. Universe Bill Pearl said &#8230; <em>&#8220;Does the muscle really care what mode is used to stress it past capacity? The important thing is to successfully stress the muscle past capacity – the mode is of secondary importance.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Since squats seem to be always touted as one of the few exercises you should do, you might as well learn some variations on them to get past sticking points or at the very least, to make them more interesting.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s just a few exercises I&#8217;ve used heavy duty resistance bands on:</p>
<ul>
<li>lying leg curl</li>
<li>tricep pushdown</li>
<li>lat pulldown</li>
<li>single leg smith lunges</li>
<li>seated leg press</li>
</ul>
<p>A few experts have been touting the importance of using resistance bands for some time.  Here&#8217;s just a few reasons why you might want to consider investing in a set of high quality bands for some of your free weight exercises:</p>
<h3>1. Squats with Resistance Bands</h3>
<p>Take an old school, mass building, quad hobbling movement like the traditional barbell squat and using resistance bands, you can change it into a concept called Variable Resistance.</p>
<p>Resistance training can take one of two possible paths.  Constant and Variable.</p>
<p><strong>Constant:</strong></p>
<p>In a constant situation you take a free weight and at times the weight being resisted against will change.  For example, the number of fibers used at the top of a squat is significant different from the bottom.  That&#8217;s why most people have a sticking point at the bottom because you are pushing 100% of the weight.  As you rise, you push less and less as your skeleton takes the brunt of the weight.</p>
<p><strong>Variable:</strong></p>
<p>In the same example if you were to do <strong>squats with resistance bands</strong> as Scott demonstrates in the video above, at the top, the bands are pulling down with force.  As he gets to the bottom, the bands are adding nearly nothing and it&#8217;s all free weight.  As he rises, where it normally would be easier as you rise up, the bands now add resistance.</p>
<p>Depending on the bands, the length at which they are stretched, the force applied can change.</p>
<p>I like to make my workouts as brief as possible.  And I don&#8217;t just mean in terms of time.  Getting more work done with each set, making it harder and progressive is the key to growth.</p>
<p><em>“It’s not how short you make it; it’s how you make it short.”</em></p>
<p>Sometimes creativity pays off in the gym.</p>
<h3>2. Without progression, you have nothing</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s a simple fact of life that in order to progress, one must change.  In terms of building muscle, this means progression.</p>
<p>You could add more and more weight to the bar.  But once you hit sticking points, this is where creativity comes into play and using resistance bands might help you get past a stuck point by making the exercise progressive in some shape or form.  Even if it&#8217;s just a bit harder at the top to stand straight as more weight pulls down, that can be progressive overload, enough to force adaptation.</p>
<h3>There is no substitute for hard work</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m all in favor of taking breaks, or taking a break from training.  But in order to progress and take it to the next level, you must work harder over time on a semi-consistent basis.</p>
<p>There are no real long-term lasting shortcuts to building muscle except hardwork, dedication and time.</p>
<h3>One technique can make all the difference</h3>
<p>The next time you are in the gym, you might want to learn more about using resistance band specifically applied to free weight exercises.  I&#8217;m not talking about rubber tubes here folks.  I mean the REAL heavy duty bands!  Here&#8217;s the two brands I&#8217;ve used with great success in the past.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorinex</li>
<li>EliteFTS</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits of Resistance Band Training</h3>
<p>One major benefit to using resistance bands is an adjusted mechanical load.  When you lift a free weight object thru a range of motion, the load does not change during the movement.  It&#8217;s a constant mass and provides different stimulation at various points within the movement.</p>
<p>To use &#8220;muscle heads&#8221; who want to build the most muscle, it means that half of the movement of any given exercise isn&#8217;t providing optimal stimulation and maximum overload.  I take this to mean 50% or so is not optimized.</p>
<p>Think of the squat.  You are stronger in a quarter squat than a half.  And stronger in a half than a full.  The sticking point of most squats is at the bottom.  As you get higher, the load transfers off the muscle and onto joints.  But what if there was a way to make the load variable?</p>
<p>By using a combination of resistance bands and free weights at the same time, you can overload the whole range of motion!  The free weight will provide the greatest overload the initial point while the bands provide resistance at the finishing portion.</p>
<h3>Eccentric Maximum Overload</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s been chatter about the eccentric (stretching portion; fighting against gravity) as being the real growth simulator in a given movement.  Without giving into that conclusion, the bands offer more resistance in the eccentric portion than free weights alone.</p>
<p>In the example of the squat, as you come down, the bands add to the acceleration.  They are pulling down with great force.  Gravity + the bands.  As you fight against that to stay in control, you are overloading the eccentric portion of the lift vs. free weights alone.  This puts tremendous stress in the eccentric portion of the lift that gravity alone does not provide.</p>
<h3>Let’s get focused</h3>
<p>We can all use help getting more results from our workouts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a fan of resistance bands used for specific portions of the workout.  I know that they work because it simply adds variable resistance to a exercise to make it harder.  Making it harder is the formula for improvements.</p>
<p>Do you have more suggestions for getting results? Drop them in the comments.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a guest post by Krisca Te, Australia&#8217;s leading provider of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.opencolleges.edu.au/"> TAFE courses</a></em></p>
<p>A friend told me the other day:</p>
<p><em>“What’s the point of dieting? I go on a diet, I avoid certain food that I like, I eat less and watch the pounds fall off. I am very happy with myself; with my dedication, with my success over my appetite. Then it takes a few months or a few years and I’m right back where I’ve started. So why go through all this? My body apparently is happy to be at this weight. ”</em></p>
<p><strong>But are you?</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-3076"></span></p>
<p>It is not only about the way you look, it’s about health. Research shows over and over again that a restrictive calorie diet in mice results in healthier and longer living animals. The regularly fed mice became fat, grew older sooner and their coat was matted, turning grey and shedding. The others, those who got less food were leaner, looked healthier and their coat was shiny and retained its color.</p>
<p>So, it is probably healthy for human beings to be a little less heavy than our bodies feel comfortable in.</p>
<p>Because our bodies are such intricate machines, they are ready for different kinds of disasters. If a virus or bacteria attack the body, the white blood cells are sent to fight the intruder. When we inhale large particles, our body reacts with a sneeze. The body’s ultimate ‘survival kit’ is the fat it is storing, mainly around the waist, for leaner times.</p>
<p>This fat accumulates in fat cells that split and divide to be able to store more. The old ones do not disappear. The fat coats inner organs as well. To be ready, just in case the calories you intake would amount to less than what it needs to operate.</p>
<p>And the circle continues – more fat, heavier mass, less air, less physical activity. Less physical activity, less calories spent, easier for the fat to accumulate.</p>
<p>Back to my friend.  I’ve seen her shed some and gain some. I’ve seen her happy in lean times and miserable when she gained the weight back. This yoyo of gaining weight and shedding is so unhealthy for our hearts, doctors tell us.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not about the kind of diet you are doing; it’s about your life style.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is not about the amount of food you are eating, it’s about the kind of foods.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It’s not about being in the optimal weight as far as some chart indicates, but being in the optimal shape as far as your body is concerned.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Dieting and exercise are not something that has to be done periodically, but all the time. Shedding weight and keeping it down means a change of lifestyle.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are hundreds of diets on the market; low calorie diets, low carb diet, Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, The South Beach diet, Pritikin, Ornish, Attkins. The list goes on and on. There are diets that tell you to eat by your body type, by your blood type, or by your body shape. It does matter, for your health, what method you’ll be using to shed the pound, but to keep the pounds off, you have to be physically active.</p>
<p>The way to get your body in the right shape is to exercise. It has to become a priority on the list of things you have to do today. Any physical activity that raises your heart rate and leaves you a little bit breathless will do. Being healthy sometimes means pushing yourself to the uncomfortable zone for a few minutes. But the endorphins the body releases in this case will more than make up to it.</p>
<p>That is what my friend did. She likes walking and she does it for at least one hour every day. She also discovered she can combine walking with another love of hers, books. Something she had no time to do lately. Now she downloads the books on to her iPod and listens to them while walking.</p>
<p><em>Krisca Te works with Open Colleges, Australia&#8217;s leading provider of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.opencolleges.edu.au/"> TAFE courses</a> equivalent and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.opencolleges.edu.au/health-fitness-courses/certificate-iv-in-fitness.aspx">fitness courses</a>.

<p>It&#8217;s late on a Friday night and I suddenly get &#8220;<em>volunteered</em>&#8221; to make dinner.  I&#8217;m an honest person and truth be told &#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m not a chef</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t like to cook</li>
<li>I eat because I need fuel</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve never ever attempted to <em>pan fry salmon</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I look around the kitchen and without an idea, I think to myself&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-3070"></span></p>
<p><em>&#8220;You know Marc, you printed out that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nobullbodybuilding.com/go/anabolic">Anabolic Cooking</a> cookbook and it&#8217;s in the bottom drawer.&#8221;</em>  I quickly grab the copy (it cost $47 to print in B&amp;W at Office Depot but let me finish the story)&#8230;</p>
<p>All I&#8217;ve got is a bag of frozen Atlantic Salmon for my protein.  I&#8217;ve got some sweet brown rice that I can make in my rice cooker, and a fresh salad that I picked up from Whole Foods.  I skimmed the cookbook for FISH and found a pan fried salmon recipe called Walnut Crusted Salmon.</p>
<p>Sounded interesting and I&#8217;m a cinnamon and walnut fan.  The directions looked simple enough and there wasn&#8217;t going to be a huge mess to clean up.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know the first thing about how to pan fry and I didn&#8217;t have the time to do some massive research on Google to figure it out.  I used my powers of a public education to guess that pan frying probably meant&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Pan Fry = Medium High heat on a non-stick pan.</strong></p>
<p>I thawed the salmon, made the topping below and pan fried the salmon.  5 minutes per side exactly at medium high heat and it was flaky as described and cooked thru.</p>
<p>The crackling of the walnuts, cinnamon and <span style="text-decoration: underline">pan fry salmon</span> made this amazing smell in the air.  When the rest of the family entered the house, they wanted to know what smelled so darn good!  I&#8217;d never attempted to pan fry salmon and here I was, doing exactly that for the first time and successfully I might add.</p>
<p>The Pan Fry Salmon recipe below, codename Walnut Crusted Salmon makes makes 4 servings.  I sprinkled the mixture on both sides the best I could.</p>
<h2>Ingredients for Pan Fry Salmon:</h2>
<p>• 4 Salmon Filets (6oz each)<br />
• 1 Tbsp Olive Oil<br />
• 1/4 cup Walnuts, crushed<br />
• 1 pinch of Cinnamon</p>
<h2>Easy Step Pan Fry Salmon Directions:</h2>
<p>1. In a bowl, mix walnuts and cinnamon</p>
<p>2. Coat salmon filets with walnut-cinnamon mixture</p>
<p>3. In a non-stick pan, coated will olive oil, pan fry salmon on both sides for 5 minutes or until the fish begins to flake</p>

<h3>Overall Impression of the Pan Fry Salmon named Walnut Crusted Salmon</h3>
<p>Delicious!  I&#8217;m a fish fan anyway but the cinnamon and walnuts that were cooked into this were amazing.  The leftovers were just as good, maybe a bit better.</p>
<p>You can lean how to make this <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nobullbodybuilding.com/go/anabolic">pan fry salmon</a> recipe and loads more (beef, chicken, fish) along with some vegetarian options by following some really simple directions.  I&#8217;ve found that most cookbooks don&#8217;t cater to bodybuilders or even those who are fitness minded looking for optimal muscle building meals.  Many cookbooks offer up healthy recipes or semi-nutritious options but are severely lacking in protein.  As a recreational bodybuilder, I want my meals to contain a fair amount of protein, some fats, maybe some carbohydrates but they need to taste great.</p>
<p>Most of the time when I eat salmon for lunch, I do the unthinkable.</p>
<p><strong>Thaw and Microwave!</strong></p>
<p>You shudder I know.  It&#8217;s drab and boring.  However, these meals make me look like a professional chef when clearly I am not.  I&#8217;m not making meals that are wowing people every time or myself but it&#8217;s nice to have a reference cookbook specific to my needs as a protein seeking bodybuilder.</p>
<p>In a bind and can&#8217;t figure out what to cook?  Need some ideas?  Can&#8217;t cook?!  Not a problem.  Just download the report below and get started with 10 delicious, healthy recipes right now.  This is from Dave Ruel&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nobullbodybuilding.com/go/anabolic">Anabolic Cooking cookbook</a> with over 200 muscle building, fat burning recipes.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to some happy cooking some pan fry salmon or whatever else you fancy.  You don&#8217;t need to be a chef to make some amazing recipes.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>It&#8217;s time for some NoBull Q&amp;A&#8230;. questions come from Mike.  If you have question and you can&#8217;t find the answer, check out the <a title="Getting Started Questions" href="http://www.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/getting-started-questions/">FAQ</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p><em>My girlfriend is doing Weight Watchers and she says my diet is to restrictive.  She likes Weight Watchers because it is based on points,  She feels this allows her more freedom of choice.  I am trying to create a livable way of eating forever.</em></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Hate to break the news Mike but &#8230; She&#8217;s right! <em> (sort of)</em></p>
<p><span id="more-3060"></span></p>
<p>One nice thing about Weight Watches vs. any type of traditional macro-nutrient bodybuilding type plan is freedom of choice and ease of use.  Based on a few factors, you are given an allotment of points per day.  You can use those points however you want but as you&#8217;d expect, high calorie items are going to cost you dearly.  They encourage lots of lower costs items like fruits and vegetables that have fiber to fill you up.  It goes along the same lines as a bodybuilding diet.</p>
<p>However, what I&#8217;ve witnesses from my friends who are Weight Watchers members is they don&#8217;t necessarily eat healthy, they reserve points for binge eating and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">body composition is rarely if ever discussed.</span>  I&#8217;m sure this varies by trainer so I&#8217;m not making snap judgments against Weight Watches but it&#8217;s a drawback in my opinion.  It&#8217;s all about losing the weight and from personal observations, most of time, it&#8217;s a fair amount of muscle that goes along with the overall weight loss.</p>
<p>Eating less than you consume is the basic law of thermodynamics to burn fat but with points, you can skip meals, eat less and save them for margaritas later that night and still come in under your daily calories.  That&#8217;s a huge difference in thinking in my opinion.</p>
<p>On the other side, a bodybuilding diet does not have to be restrictive.  In both cases, points or not points, the goal is to eat less than you burn, hence you hopefully &#8220;lose weight.&#8221;  There&#8217;s nothing that says you cannot use a traditional bodybuilding style nutrition plan and add in some high point items.</p>
<p>Truthfully, there&#8217;s not much of a difference except there&#8217;s no point system in most meal plans you&#8217;ll find for what&#8217;s classified as restrictive bodybuilding diets.  I believe most people who use Weight Watchers give less thought to the actual food consumed vs. the bodybuilding type that even if they could eat that chocolate chip cookie, they think beyond the calories and dive a bit deeper.</p>
<p>In the end, you could follow a Weight Watchers plan, follow a weight exercise plan and ensure your protein needs are being meet and be extremely successful.</p>
<p>If you look at bodybuilding cookbooks like the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.musclecooking.com">Anabolic Cookbook</a>, you&#8217;ll find that a restrictive bodybuilding diet is merely a limitation of your own cooking abilities.</p>
<p>As with anything there are exceptions.  If you were to train for a bodybuilding competition and attempt to achieve an ultra-low percentage of body fat, you would be somewhat restrictive in your eating.  And by this I mean, even if your coach were to put you on a very high carbohydrate diet for intense training while dieting down, you&#8217;ll want to reserve every precious gram of carbohydrates for fuel for recovery and training.  You&#8217;d opt to skip that beer or wine so you could consume more food such as a sweet potato where you may get the same amount of carbs but in a different capacity.  This is more of an extreme example but as you tweak nutrition beyond just being fit, you will be somewhat restrictive if you want to survive the ordeal.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p><em>What do you feel is the key to maintaining your fitness level year round. I have found the biggest obstacle is the weekends, especially during the summer when their are plenty of barbecues and family functions. </em></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The easy answer is making your nutrition and exercise into routines (habits) without being one of those overly obsessive annoying food cops that can&#8217;t stop thinking about food and talking about food and telling you what you&#8217;re eating is awful.</p>
<p>Some tips for maintaining a fitness level year round (could be a blog post itself):</p>
<ul>
<li>Making the little things like meal planning and prep into routines which become habits</li>
<li>Develop a love for exercise (so much so that you miss it when you don&#8217;t do it)</li>
<li>Develop portion control</li>
<li>Eat slower; drink more water; add vegetables with fiber to ever meal for satiety</li>
<li>Check your protein levels; bump them up if necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen laundry lists of tips for going to family functions and barbecues but the best I ever saw and one I&#8217;ve used on a cutting cycle even at holiday times was to &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Eat Before You Go!  </strong>Have a meal about an hour before you go so that you essentially snack or have much smaller portions as your hunger has already been satisfied.  Not to the point where you are stuffed and can&#8217;t touch any more food (no need to be rude) but enough that it becomes a snack vs. a full blown overindulging meal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll repeat that I&#8217;ve seen hundreds of articles and sites on this topic alone and all of them are trying to get to to modify behavior in order to make healthy eating and exercise a routine.  When your attitude about food changes, you won&#8217;t need to be convinced to not overindulge because it will be against your nature.</p>
<p>In my opinion, all these online behavior modifications are soon forgotten by all but the singularly focused individual.</p>
<p>If you eat a meal before any such event, you eliminate the hunger sensation and that eliminates your desire to eat too much.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p><em>I have come to believe that you can&#8217;t label foods good or bad, I do enjoy beer, wine, pizza, etc.  Finding the balance seems to be the hard part.</em></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Technically you can label some foods as bad.  Trans-fats for example is a bad food with no redeeming qualities for your health.  But I get your point!</p>
<p>If you know roughly how many calories a day you need, then you don&#8217;t have to much worry about elimination of certain foods.  You can have 6oz of wine or a single serving of beer and have six pack abs.  You can have your cake and eat it too.  The problems aren&#8217;t good foods vs. bad foods as much as how much of any food you consume.</p>
<p>Rather then eliminate foods, just start to be aware of portion controls and how much of anything you are eating.  You&#8217;ll soon start to have a bit less wine, one less beer or half the slice of cake.  If you make a habit of over eating, you won&#8217;t be able to escape the ugly reality of eat more than you burn and you gain weight.  That can happen even on the cleanest of diets.</p>
<p>Pizza can be very good if made from scratch and it would rival a &#8220;healthy&#8221; meal elsewhere loaded with things you don&#8217;t know may be on it.  Another reason to learn how to cook a little bit at home.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen it, check out the <a href="http://www.bodybuildingsecretslive.com/category/bodybuilding-recipes/">Bodybuilding Recipes</a> section of this blog.</p>
<p>Simile modifications to traditional recipes can yield excellent results.</p>
<p>Finding the balance is the tough part but when your desire to look and feel different becomes a priority and that is on your mind all the time, you will start to do everything in your power to make it happen.</p>
<p>Personally I love wine!  I don&#8217;t eliminate it from my diet.  But I don&#8217;t like drinking a bottle as I don&#8217;t like how I feel, or look or workout the next day.  That negative mindset when it comes to overindulging, saves me 99% of the time without me even thinking about it.  I&#8217;ll drink my glass or two and be done.  I simply don&#8217;t want more.  It becomes a bit of an issue when I am looking to get much leaner and be restrictive and eliminate all alcohol from the diet.  That&#8217;s when it really isn&#8217;t a balance and it&#8217;s more of a short term forced action.  Which for a short time period works but it&#8217;s not sustainable in my situation for the long term.  Finding that balance is key.</p>
