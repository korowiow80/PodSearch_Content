			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n3/abs/nbt.1610.html#/" target="_blank">publication of his team&#8217;s gene therapy work</a> with AAV-9 in <a href="http://www.fightsma.org/index.php?what_is_sma">spinal muscular atrophy</a> (SMA) mouse models (Foust et al., <em>Nature Biotechnology</em>), Dr. Brian Kaspar participated in Nationwide Children&#8217;s Hospital&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nationwidechildrens.org/muscular-dystrophy-podcast" target="_blank">monthly podcast about neuromuscular research</a>. In this podcast, Dr. Kaspar spoke about a number of topics including:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)</li>
<li>The genetics of SMA</li>
<li>The difficulty developing treatments for SMA</li>
<li>The results AAV-9 has shown in SMA mouse models</li>
<li>The need for additional studies before moving to human trials</li>
<li>The next steps toward the clinic</li>
</ul>
<p>The podcast is available by <a href="http://www.nationwidechildrens.org/muscular-dystrophy-podcast">clicking here</a> and scrolling to the May podcast. At the time of this post, there is a problem in how the podcast is available on the Nationwide Children&#8217;s Hospital website. The audio file has a comma added at the end of the file type which prevents players from recognizing file type. In order to play the podcast, simply download it to your computer, select the file name, and remove the comma. Your computer should then recognize the podcast as a MP3 file.</p>
<p>Recently, FightSMA launched the &#8220;<a href="http://www.fightsma.org/index.php?gene_therapy">Realizing the Dream</a>&#8221; fundraising campaign which partners with the <a href="http://www.gwendolynstrongfoundation.com/" target="_blank">Gwendolyn Strong Foundation</a> to advance a common goal: to bring SMA gene therapy to clinical trial. These efforts will support Dr. Kaspar and other collaborating scientists. To learn more about the gene therapy campaign and how you can get involved, <a href="http://www.fightsma.org/index.php?gene_therapy">click here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thissideupcampaign.org/"><img align="right" style="border: 0pt none " src="http://www.hayeshitzemanfoundation.org/images/TSU_Logo.gif" /></a>Kyra Oliver&#8217;s four-month-old son, Hayes, died in 2002.  The cause of death was given as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS.  Within days of his death, as Kyra was still fighting through the anguish, she  founded the <a href="http://www.hayeshitzemanfoundation.org/">Hayes Foundation</a> to raise awareness of SIDS.  In 2006, she launched a campaign to educate mothers and caregivers that the safest way for infants to sleep is on their backs.  The campaign began in Kyra&#8217;s home state of Virginia and is now spreading to other states.</p>
<p>Kyra continues her fight, and is now planning a fundraiser in her home city that combines her desire to educate about how to avoid SIDS and her love of competitive running.  The Capital 10-Miler is being held on Saturday, October 3.  For more information, visit <a href="http://www.rrrc.org">http://www.rrrc.org</a>.</p>

<p>This is part 2 of our 2009 State of the Disease Podcast for Spinal Muscular Atrophy, where we look back at the scientific advances in SMA research in 2008 and look forward to what might come in 2009.  This two-part series features the co-chairs of FightSMA’s scientific committee, Alex MacKenzie, M.D. (Director of the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute) and Chris Lorson, Ph. D. (Assistant Professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia).</p>
<p>In part one Alex and Chris discussed three of the research advances they picked as being the most significant in 2008.  In this episode, they  finish that discussion by highlighting the following 2008 findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exercise promotes motor unit development and survival in mild SMA mice</strong></li>
<li><strong>A variety of RNA-based therapeutics that are moving in vivo</strong></li>
<li><strong>SMA Standards of Care<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We also tackle the future &#8230; what might come in 2009 in spinal muscular atrophy research.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t listened to part one of this two-parter,<strong> </strong>it&#8217;s strongly suggested you visit<strong> <a href="http://www.fightsma.org/blog/sma-science-research/fighting-back-podcast-18-2009-state-of-the-disease-for-sma-part-1.html">this post</a></strong>, and listen there first!</p>

<p>2008 was an important year in <strong><a href="http://www.fightsma.org/">spinal muscular atrophy</a></strong> research, as scientists and doctors continued their work to find a treatment or cure for the neuromuscular disease.  This episode of Fighting Back Podcast is the first part of our yearly &#8220;look back and look forward&#8221;.  This time we look back at 2008 and look forward to 2009 with the co-chairs of Fight SMA&#8217;s scientific committee, Alex MacKenzie, M.D. (Director of the Children&#8217;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute) and Chris Lorson, Ph. D. (Assistant Professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia).</p>
<p>Before the podcast recording session, Dr. MacKenzie and Dr. Lorson forwarded their lists of what they believe to be the most important scientific findings in SMA research in 2008.  In this episode, we have a spirited discussion of the first three items on the list, including what they are and why they&#8217;re important.  The advances discussed in this episode are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A non-SMN modifier of disease: Plastin-3 (B. Wirth)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Muscle vs nerve SMN rescue in SMA mice (A. Burghes)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Nutritional supplement w/ TSA significantly increases SMA mouse survival (C. Sumner)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>(Note: We are efforting links for each of these. Please check back!) </em></p>
<p>In part 2 of our <em>State of the Disease Podcast for SMA</em>, which will be released next week, we discuss the remaining items on the list, including the role of exercise promoting motor unit survival and the groundbreaking SMA Standards of Care that were released in 2008.  Drs. MacKenzie and Lorson also discuss the important findings they they hope will happen in 2009.</p>

<img align="right" style="border: 0pt none; padding-left: 5px;" src="http://www.fightsma.org/images/fightingbackpodcast-logo125x125.jpg" />This is the last in a series of four Fighting Back Podcast episodes that feature audio from the Fighter Mom Friday event, held on May 9, 2008 in New York City.  The workshop was designed to educate, inform, and inspire attendees fighting against diseases or conditions affecting their children. The day-long event featured a number of speakers, and several of them have agreed to allow us to present in podcast form the information they offered during the event.</p>
<p>Episode 17 features a seminar from Steve Eichenauer, a partner at lobbying firm <a href="http://www.psw-inc.com/">Public Strategies Washington</a>.  He discusses how Fighter Moms can talk to their legislative representatives to raise awareness of their cause and attempt to increase funding.</p>
<p><em>Note: Mr. Eichenauer refers during his talk to a one page information sheet that he handed out during the seminar.  That information sheet is available for download in .pdf format <a href="http://www.fightermom.org/index.php?fm-multimedia">Fighter Mom Multimedia</a> page.</em></p>
<p>More information on Fighter Mom Friday can be found on the <a href="http://www.fightermom.org/">Fighter Mom</a> website.  More audio from the event is available on the <a href="http://www.fightermom.org/index.php?fm-multimedia">Fighter Mom Multimedia</a> page, or by <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/fightingbackpodcast">subscribing to this podcast</a>.</p>

The day-long event featured a number of speakers, and several of them have agreed to allow us to present in podcast form the information they offered during the event.</p>
<p>Episode 16 of Fighting Back features Dr. Alex MacKenzie, Director of the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute.  The audio for the episode was recorded during Dr. MacKenzie&#8217;s seminar.  He discusses the relationship between families and researchers, and how they can help each other.</p>
