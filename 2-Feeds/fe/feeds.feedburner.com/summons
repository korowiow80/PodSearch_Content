<itunes:summary>Summons is a daily Bible Study that seeks to SUMMON believers closer to the Lord and draw non-believers into the kingdom of God. Jesus told us that teaching the word is like sowing seed. Summons is our attempt to sow seed throughout the world in the form of radio broadcasts and podcasts. We are excited about all the possibilities that Summons affords: ministering to Christians who cannot regularly attend church, staying connected to the local community, and providing opportunities for non-believers to hear the gospel message.</itunes:summary>
