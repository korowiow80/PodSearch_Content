In this way, you will gather some information about their previous work as well as capabilities to succeed. However, through questions, you will know their motives and future views just in case you hire them. And these questions are the following:</p>
<p>1.       Actually, the IT consultants are concern only with two areas, the raising returns and cutting costs. So therefore, ask him about what he prefers for, the raising returns or cost cutting. And which of the two do you do better? Indeed, what you want is they can come up something different that can actually raise the revenues without add on charge to the clients.</p>
<p>2.       The second question is what was your previous experience before you turn out to be IT consultant? Asking this kind of questions will somehow gives you an idea on how efficient they are concerning their work. Indeed, you are actually looking for reliable and can come up a quick idea right away and able to pursue them at the end.</p>
<p>3.       The third question is about the proficiency and professionalism on their work.  With how many clients they have and can work with one time? If ever you will hire them, can they spend a lot of time to your company? And, how fast and many times can you reply to emails or chat? This can be very helpful to your company. You will somehow gain information about how attentive and responsive they might be.</p>
<p>4.       Lastly, you ask them what kind of documentation just in case you hire them for a project and then completed. Who actually own the credit? Asking this kind of questions will give you a hint about his perspective and views about the ownership of the work. Actually, this documentation will somehow protect you in the long run.</p>
