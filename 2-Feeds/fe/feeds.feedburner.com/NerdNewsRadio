So, back, again. Few life updates &#8211; new site design for both NNR and kabrenlevinson.com, my personal homepage. I had a wonderful first year in college, and cannot wait for more. I&#8217;m going to try and work out a schedule so I can actually record more episodes in college, but expect at least two more for the summer!</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I got back from Austin, Texas. I was speaking at <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive">SXSW Interactive 2009</a>. It was my first time at South-By, and I can say right now that I am going next year &#8211; no matter what. My presentation was great (thank you, Alex, for offering me this great opportunity!) &#8211; read on for more about my presentation. I met so many incredible people, including <a href="http://twitter.com/garyvee">Gary Vaynerchuk</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinrose">Kevin Rose</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/zephoria">danah boyd</a>. Being under 21 at SXSW was tough, since so many after-parties were at 21+ venues, but it worked out. SXSW was overwhelming, especially going for the first time. Basically, it doesn&#8217;t stop. Day, night, morning, evening &#8211; you name it. There is always something going on at SXSW. Just check my <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=kabren+%23sxsw">Twitter stream</a>. I reconnected with some &#8220;old&#8221; friends from the Boston Social Media scene, like <a href="http://twitter.com/stevegarfield">Steve Garfield</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/dykc">Clarence Smith</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/chrisbrogan">Chris Brogan</a>. The Bigg Digg Schindigg was amazing &#8211; I finally saw a live Diggnation! Check my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kabren/sets/72157615345541144/">Flickr</a> for pictures. I&#8217;ll be uploading many more in the coming days. The panels I saw were amazing. Gary Vaynerchuk was the most inspirational speaker I saw, up there with the &#8220;SHIFT Happens&#8221; people and the Web and Feminism panel. I made a PDF of all the tweets I tweeted during SXSW. <a href="http://kabrenlevinson.com/files/sxswtweets09.pdf">Download it</a>. Most recent at the top.</p>

<h4>My Presentation</h4>
<p>As you all _should_ know, I was on a panel about the future of technology in education, called <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/schedule?action=show&#038;id=IAP0900347">Blackboards or Backchannels: The Techno-Induced Classroom of Tomorrow</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/alexleavitt">Alex Leavitt</a> Moderated, and I spoke along with <a href="http://twitter.com/archana">Archana Ramachandran</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/kellysutton">Kelly Sutton</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/dianakimball">Diana Kimball</a>. <a href="http://www.austinchic.net/2009/03/sxswi-09-liveblog-blackboards-or.html">Someone liveblogged our panel, check it out</a>! I spoke of my EduTech project and my feelings about, at least in small class settings, the use of off-hours technology only. For example, in small seminar classes, I see laptops as walls and severe distractions. They might be employed to &#8220;enhance&#8221; communication, but instead, they replace human-human interaction with superficial and removed conversation. Technology cannot replace or fix bad teaching &#8211; I was surprised to see some teachers react negatively to that statement, for surely I thought that they would all be in favor of quality teaching, too. I was also surprised to find out that predominately older K-12 teachers and university professors saw my own (and the groups) views as conservative. I never thought about it that way. The educators in the room appeared to want validation from us students. They wanted us to approve the unbridled use of technology in their classrooms. Not to say that risk-taking and experimentation are bad, because they are very crucial to the learning process, but the successful use of technology in classrooms need to be thoughtfully planned out. Technology cannot be there just to be there. One needs a goal. A teacher should be able to answer the question, &#8220;Why are you using technology in your classroom?&#8221; A teacher does not, or should not, just assign an essay or exam. Just to let you know, my philosophy of technology and education only applies to small class settings. I have yet to seriously consider the implications of technology in large classrooms, simply because I haven&#8217;t been in those situations and, I don&#8217;t particularly agree with lecture based styles of education.</p>
<div class="center"><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3559/3370784619_a09f2ac6d7_o.jpg"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3559/3370784619_a09f2ac6d7_o.jpg" width=500/></a><br /><small><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kabren/3370784619/">My Name Plate!</a></small></div>
<p>The response to our panel was mixed. Following the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23sxswed">Twitter hash tag</a> (#sxswed) was interesting: one person thought she should have been on the panel and did not restrain her anger, and others were frustrated with our &#8220;non-techno induced&#8221; classroom. Questions were engaging, but somewhat strange. One woman suggested that Kelly and I had been brainwashed by the educational systems in this country. Why? Because we both go to smaller liberal arts colleges? Or because at least I (don&#8217;t know about Kelly&#8230;) had a very progressive education in high school without standards? Anyways, others were more positive. One man raised the issue of learning, in general &#8211; how do you learn of find things on the Internet? Another man, who seemed younger, perhaps a recent college graduate, seemed offended by my advocating against the use of technology in the classroom, and proceeded to give various reasons how Twitter had helped him. Just to clarify, I think Twitter is amazing, but, do you really have a need to use it in class? How about on the weekends, when the students and the professor are not in the same room together?</p>

<p>I will be speaking on a <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/talks/panels?action=show&#038;id=IAP0900347">panel at SXSW Interactive 2009</a>, in just a few weeks. I&#8217;m excited. A year ago, I barely dreamed of attending SXSW, but being able to speak is such an honor. For those of you who don&#8217;t know about the organization, SXSW is a company that is devloted to histing and promoting events related to media. They ahve three conferences: Music, Film, and Interactive. For more info, <a href="http://sxsw.com">check out their website</a>.</p>
<p>In August, Alex Leavitt, a senior at Boston University, invited me to speak on his panel &#8211; he had been loking into my Academic Technology work and was interested in my EduTech program I created at the Cambridge School of Weston. I was amazed &#8211; my only previous speaking engagemtns were at PodCamps in the Boston area and at an education conference in Hawaii. I didn&#8217;t realize the impact of my work as a high school student. Of course, I accepted his offer.</p>
<p>So, Here I am, creating my own Educational and Technological Philosophy. I&#8217;ve just begun rethinking and redefining my thoughts on Education and Technology. Once I have something, I&#8217;ll let you know.</p>
<p>Here are the details about my presentatinon and the panel I will be speaking on. If you&#8217;re planning on attending SXSW Interactive, it&#8217;d be great to meet. <a href="mailto:k@kabrenlevinson.com">Send me an email</a>.</p>

Room B<br />
Sunday, March 15th<br />
11:30 am &#8211; 12:30 pm</p>
<blockquote><p>The traditional classroom: obsolete? Chalkboards, lectures, and even teachers may be on their way out as social technology enters the classroom. How do kids want technology integrated into the curriculum? Or do they even want it? Five students speak out to debate the potential for Wikis, backchannels, and social tech, and dispute tomorrow&#8217;s r/evolution in teaching and learning.</p></blockquote>

I haven&#8217;t forgotten Nerd News Radio. I still get emails every now and then, saying something along the lines of &#8220;please do a podcast.&#8221; It means a lot. I hope you will keep listening &#8211; go back, listen to past episodes and give me feedback for how I could improve the podcast and the site. I love Nerd News Radio. I&#8217;ve been through &#8220;downfalls&#8221; before (think 2006), but I will never forget. </p>
<p>I can guarantee I will record an episode of Nerd News Radio over Thanksgiving break, and maybe even sooner, though I doubt it. I will record over winter break, too. Send me emails, it helps. I have a lot of work, but I have been able to keep up with <a href="http://kabrenlevinson.com/blog/">my blog. Check it out</a>.</p>

<p>I apologize. It&#8217;s been about a month since I last recorded an episode. I had the episode for today, Sunday the 9th, all planned out, but now, my G5 is experiencing a crash. After having my mother&#8217;s G5 crash earlier in the day, I don&#8217;t have the time or energy to record a podcast on top of the schoolwork I must complete and the tech support I need to administer. I&#8217;m going to try my best, and I mean that, to record the podcast tomorrow night, Monday, March 10th. It is a school night, so I can&#8217;t guarantee it, but I&#8217;m going to try. </p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had major technical problems today. So, instead of an episode, I&#8217;m giving you my hands-on review of the One Laptop Per Child Laptop, or the XO Laptop. My G5 crashed twice, so I recorded on my MacBook and it&#8217;s a little impromptu. So, I apologize. I&#8217;ll be back on Wednesday with a fully functional audio system, and with a real episode!</p>
<p>Anyways, Mark Peck from Telco Talk and a friend from school lent me his XO Laptop for the evening. Here&#8217;s my review of the Open Source Initiative.</p>

<p>Facebook recently launched their new pages feature, so, naturally, I went ahead and created a page for Nerd News Radio. It&#8217;s meant for people to promote their businesses, services, brands, etc. It&#8217;s integrated with their new ad campaign feature. People can become fans of these pages, so, you all should go ahead and do so!</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a replacement for groups, but rather an addition for more professional businesses and services. </p>
