I'm a bit of a podcast addict, and I was gently sifting through the iTunes directory the other day when what should I chance upon but &lt;b&gt;The North South Divide&lt;/b&gt; listed in the 'podcasts like this' category of a rather amusing show I enjoy. Well, wasn't I a little taken aback and pleased? Yes, indeed I was - it means the comedy bletherings Trev and I wrote and recorded still has something of a presence in this internet of ours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's a bit of a shame, therefore, is that Trev has had to give up his storage space (presumably to allow some more internet to be poured in for someone else) so all the delicious audio and many of the shiny pictures vanished from this long-neglected site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;b&gt;Until now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="1"&gt;(dramatically placed in the middle of the screen)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;I've had a bit of a rummage and an ask about, and managed to get hold of the remnants of the eight-and-a-half podcasts Trev and I did. They're all here for your delectation. If delectating is your thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've also done a bit of tidying, so that all the podcasts are displayed in chronically chronological order on the right.. and there's a nice new set of links for you to click if you fancy something else amusing to hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will there be any more comedy? I can only speak for myself - I've got some ideas for a series to put together, and I'm a regular contributor to quite a few other podcasts... but as soon as anything concrete turns up, I'll wonder who left it there and probably need a crane to move it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also keep up with the goings-on of the North South Dividers in shortform, through the miracle of Twitter:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/syzygy"&gt;twitter.com/syzygy&lt;/a&gt; - that's me!&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/trevypoos"&gt;twitter.com/trevypoos&lt;/a&gt; - that's Trev.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;All the best to you and yours, then!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;james&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;formerly out of The North South Divide.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/22656500-6567274059280605773?l=thenorthsouthdivide.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">1</thr:total></item><item><title>No more NSD.</title><link>http://thenorthsouthdivide.blogspot.com/2009/12/no-more-nsd.html</link><author>comedy@trevs-shed.net (trev and james)</author><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2010 09:40:15 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-22656500.post-8849294347095256650</guid><description>Hello loyal NSD listeners. It has been a massive surprise and pleasure to me that so many people have enjoyed what we have made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly we will not be making any more, due to an unfortunate situation which I cannot see being resolved. I am truly saddened by this, as I am very proud of what we created here. I know that what we made, was of very high quality and made a lot of people laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The files will be left where they are for the podcasts that we have already made, and they will still be downloadable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to take this moment to thank firstly all of the listeners, who have made making this podcast a pleasure, tens of thousands of downloads and only one complaint. A statistic that I think that we can be truly proud of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, I would like to thank James Hart, I know that this is about to become a "without whom" but it is true. He truly made the NSD what it was, neither of us could have made it without the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally thank you to Beth Hart, who was the long suffering Kimberley Penge, amongst many others. She was important in the making of the podcast in many ways, and also one of our vital supporters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, this may not be a definite final thing, but I am not expecting anymore NSD's I am afraid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that you enjoyed listening to them half as much as we enjoyed making them. I wish James &amp;amp; Beth good luck in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am off to work on some new projects, I will let you know more as I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final thank you, to you, for sticking with us, dear listener. We did it for you. These podcasts gave me the confidence to start writing again, and I shall never forget the support that I have received.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Trev.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/22656500-8849294347095256650?l=thenorthsouthdivide.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>Merry Christmas Mr Bauble!</title><link>http://thenorthsouthdivide.blogspot.com/2008/12/merry-christmas-bauble.html</link><author>comedy@trevs-shed.net (trev and james)</author><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2010 14:04:22 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-22656500.post-3568736510844553713</guid><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://musicweb.webspace.virginmedia.com/NSD-08a-image.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 140px; height: 130px;" src="http://musicweb.webspace.virginmedia.com/NSD-08a-image.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Welcome to the Christmas and New year edition of the North South Divide for 2008.

We can raise interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did make this in just over a week, from idea to now, so it goes to prove we can do it when we decide to. Thanks have to go to james who has toiled away while busy with proper work over the Christmas period, and both of us have also been ill.
