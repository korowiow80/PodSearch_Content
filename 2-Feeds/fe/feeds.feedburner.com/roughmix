      <title>RoughMix 156 - Jericho Drafts</title>
      <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/3434/600x600_4461394.jpg" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days ago I was asked to write a song for a church service about Joshua 6.

This episode has me recording the bits and pieces as I worked on them - in all 4 clips.

Next time I will put it all together - but now you get to hear the dirty roughs complete with missed notes and bad rhymes.

Enjoy!&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

The mandolin is new about a week old, and I do not know how to play yet. But this was a way to get a new entry point into a song and that is what I do as I created this very raw tune "He's Not Here"

      <title>RoughMix 153 - Camille's Song</title>
      <description>I am to be the proud godfather of the lovely Camille and her parents chose for her dedication the verse Psalm 91:11

The dedication is taking place in a German church so the song is is German (as is the mom as well.) The dad is French, but as I do not speak French I am not even going there - it is stretch enough for me to write in German!

In this episode I went to the Bible itself and decided to take the exact words and use them, and ony them in the song. But this still left me with the abiltity to arrange the words as need for the musical beat, and this is what I did.

This time around I did not record the first attempts at the song. I did not have anything with me to record it, but what you hear here is the third generation. (I even asked my daughter to listen to the 2nd gen so that at least two of us would have heard it in case I forgot something - it would not have helped at all, but fortunately I was able to remember the tune - it somehow sat in my head.

What is a first in this version is the very last bit where the name of my godchild is sung - I was hoping to find a way to make this more personal and this is is how it now stands.

I hope you like it, but more important to me is that the family finds it as I intended it - a song to accompany the child into her adulthood!

Just a note - I am finding the podcast host I am working with to be too expensive so I am slowly moving archives off to other sites. Do not be surprised if you no longer find all of the episodes on this site / feed. I have given several alternative ways.

Thanks so much for stopping by!&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>RoughMix 152 - Kommt Herzu</title>
      <description>I was asked to write a song for a church service.

I asked about the main theme of course and it turned out to be Psalm 95:1-7

OK I thought I can do this.

Then I had the single idea to make the first verse into a refrain and the following verses into one time thoughts. The idea is to support the sermon about the text before it even gets preached. It happens this upcoming Sunday so I am not sure how it will happen

I used the Luther Bible for the German text (no copyright problems). I speak German but writing songs in German is still not easy for me.

What is posted here is the rough video I sent to other musicians who will be working with me on this Sunday.

If you use this tune in any churches please let me know. I welcome it, but it would be great to know!

Enjoy!&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

The deal here is to use what has been previously written as a tool to help spawn a new piece of music.

I hope it works!

      <itunes:summary>This tune is a prequel to a Tune I have written called "Father Forgive". The deal here is to use what has been previously written as a tool to help spawn a new piece of music.

I hope it works!

I decided to add this. I have been recording music, but actually posting a podcast takes some time, and life takes time too!

This episode runs long, and is experimental. The audio records uninterrupted and has background noise as recorded from my Palm Tungsten.&lt;P&gt;

I am making up everything on the fly, but it is based on some experiments I did in earlier recording where I played with some elements.&lt;P&gt;

      <title>RoughMix 147 - Scratch Pop and Ham</title>
      <description>&lt;I&gt;The cast about how music is made....&lt;/I&gt;
&lt;P&gt;

I was playing around with a kind of scratching sound on the guitar and decided to experiment with some other effects. By effects I do not mean anything electronic. I mean doing gimmicky things on the guitar itself, likes this kind of scratch, some popping (where I place a thumb under a guitar string, pull it up and let it snap back to the fretboard) and a few other things.&lt;P&gt;

Effects, gimmicks and tricks do not make a song, but they can be tools to help the creative process. My technical abilities continue to grow, but creativity oftens only thrives when something fresh is done or a new approach is taken. This episode takes one listen at approachingly freshly using what I am Pop, Scratch and Ham.&lt;P&gt;

In the second clip the effects I use include slapping (which I do with my thumb) slap harmonics and then a combination of these things as well.&lt;P&gt;

There are two clips: the first is called "Pop and Scratch", and the second "Ham is OK" (see if you can figure out why.)&lt;P&gt;

Shouts to: Casablanca, Morocco; Ghana somewhere north of Wenchi; Cameroon somewhere east of Foumban and to many friends in China and the rest of the world. If you send a short voice mail we can maybe share what you are doing in songwriting with others in the RoughMix community. [http://RuffMix.com]&lt;P&gt;

This time around I am using a tool that churns things up a bit. I play predominantly the acoustic guitar. I tried this time to record playing things in a different way than I usually do. Differently stylistically, rhythmically and different guitar tricks, and you can hear that is this short clip recorded mono on my Palm Tungsten.&lt;P&gt;

      <title>RoughMix 143 - Don't Know Why</title>
      <description>The cast about how music is made....&lt;P&gt;

I began this bit with a soft guitar piece and let it flow from there. The lyrics were all on the fly made up as I went along. This was a kind of a tool to help with the lyrical creativity.&lt;P&gt;

This is a long format episode. I recorded what I was doing over about 15 minutes without pause. In this episode I give commentary during the music as there a bits to talk about.&lt;P&gt;

Amongst other things I talk about the concept of having a musical library, and as always the importance of recording / capturing what you do so that you can later access it and use it.&lt;P&gt;

Sorry that it has taken so long since the last post. It is not for lack of music, but for lack of time to create the cast from the raw data.&lt;P&gt;

This episode is one where I am intentionally raw, also vocally. I am actually trying to make my material rougher for the cast so that we continually get at the main point, that music starts out rough before it ever gets to its polished presentable format.&lt;P&gt;

      <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/3434/600x600_1617147.png" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;I&gt;The cast about how music is made....&lt;/I&gt;&lt;P&gt;
This cast episode happened as an aside. I was playing the guitar and scanning the computer for messages and came upon some twitter notes, and I started to sing and play making up lyrics as I went. It is an exercise I try to do sometimes to see if I can do it, but I almost never actually record it as by the time I notice it is happening it is already gone. This time I had the Palm Tungsten running and was able to capture it.

The focus of this episode is on the creation of lyrics. My main point here is to allow yourself to be truly silly and to simply let flow what flows. You can always edit later, but you can only edit what already exists. So enjoy this very silly TwitTune. And for those who may care to know, my twitter ID is nlnnet&lt;P&gt;

This cast incorporates 4 Palm recordings all related to the same song I need to write for a specific event. It gives what is likely the best inside of the head working to date (and is therefore longer than normal. I tried to share what I was thinking as I was playing, which is of course impossible in the extreme, but I hope this helps you.

Thanks so much for for listening! Please tell 3 friends about RoughMix!

Here is a look at what I do recording the thoughts as they flow - complete with the false starts and re-trys. I am trying to get what is in my head to find its way onto the fretboard and strings, and sometimes it needs some help and time.

* One take on the Palm Tungsten. All was made up on the fly. I can never state it enough, also to myself, how much can be captured by simply having what you do recording on the roughest of roughs, as was the case here.

      <title>RoughMix 132 - Sunday Morning Tune</title>
      <description>I am not a morning person, but sometimes the muse strikes at strange unpredictable times. This episode of RoughMix, 132, was a tune that came to me early on a Sunday morning, hence the name "Sunday Morning Tune" for the episode.

It is a very short episode, intending only to highlight the idea of capturing the muse when it strikes even if it is at a time not normal to you.

I am of course eager to hear from you. For such a large audience it is amazing that so little feedback comes. This will work to your advantage if you send in some info. Keep it clean and focused and I am willing to add audio comments up to 30 seconds in length if audio quality is good. Go ahead and pimp your songs!

Happy Thanksgiving to my US friends!

      <title>RoughMix 131 - We're Waiting (For Mommy to Come Home)</title>
      <description>&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kelleys/48105411/" title="Tia Door 2003-03-13 by nlnnet, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/28/48105411_7a55c2bd0b_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Tia Door 2003-03-13" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
My wife had been out for awhile and my daughter was starting to complain about it.

"When will mommy come home?" was the question. So to distract and ease the delay I came up with a little tune which is featured in today's episode of RoughMix 131 "We're Waiting (for Mommy to Come Home.)".

It did not occur to me at the time, but this is actually a tool I use in writing songs - taking something current, happening at a moment and trying to create a little melody line around it. That is what happened here. The melody, simple as it is, was sung, then sung a bit more, each time becoming a bit more polished just because that is the way this works. The first bit was recorded together with my daughter. The second bit was the first attempt to capture this on the acoustic guitar instrumentally.

I hope that this silly little song inspires you to play with simple melody, and then see where it might lead.

      <title>RoughMix 130 - Uganda Choir Coming</title>
      <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/3434/600x600_1334644.jpg" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter woke up today and the very first thing she said was, "Daddy, today we are going to see the Uganda choir!"

Sensing her excitement I broke into a silly song and a chorus quickly appeared. I decided to capture it on the guitar and played it a few times. I stopped playing it as I realized that I should actually be recording this for RoughMix or else it would no longer be rough, so here is the initial thinking on the tune.

In this episode I also deliver the promised live version of "Work for Him" with the caveat that the engineer did not get it, but I recorded it as a backup on my Palm Tungsten, and that is what you hear here.

A special shoutout to friends in Vimont, Quebec and in Brasilia, Brazil. Why not send a note on the site or a voicemail?

      <title>RoughMix 129 - Work for Him</title>
      <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/3434/600x600_1307243.jpg" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A close friend was asked to give a sermon, and it was to be about having personal time with God, and about the difference between working for God and simply being with God. He asked if I might write a song for the event. This was less than a week by when the song would need to be done, so I said no.

Then later the day after I had an idea for some lyrics and I started to jot them down on my computer without having a single idea as to what music might be connected to it whatsoever. I wrote down the words using Google's online documents because I knew I would need to share the data with my friend and with the band if we indeed decided to do this. It also has a cool tool that allows for you to see the way in which changes are made to a document, so I can actually track not only what I did, but the changes made - a tool to track development that is of particular interest to RoughMix in allowing for a look into the process. [If you would like to view these changes send me an email and I can add you to the group that can see this.]

The next day (I wrote the text at a time too late to play music without waking my family) I played around with some potential music and recorded the roughs on my Palm Tungsten, and that is what I share with you in this episode of RoughMix 129 - Work for Him. There are two takes, and then a third will follow in another episode as performed with the band (if I can get the technician to get a recording that is usable from its premiere on 26 November, 2008.

      <title>RoughMix 128 - Garden Thoughts</title>
      <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/3434/600x600_1272929.jpg" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I was limited in my ability to record. I took this time to take a few minutes of solitude to record these thoughts (I was interrupted 3 minutes after I ended this recording.)

In this episode I have placed 2 roughs:

    * Castle Ruins (which runs about 1:20)
    * 1234 321

I am reporting more of the reality of songwriting. It is seldom clean and broadcast friendly. There is almost always more behind the scene than anyone knows.

      <title>RoughMix 127 - You May Smell Funny (but I love you so)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/3434/600x600_1260461.jpg" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a constant danger of taking ourselves too seriously in all that we do. This is also true in songwriting. So it is sometimes a good idea to just go ahead and be silly, and that is what this episode, number 127, of RoughMix is all about.

I was giving my daughter a hug, and she had an unusual smell in her hair, so I told her that she smelled funny. I immediately realized that although I had not meant it so, it could have hurt her feelings, so I followed it up quickly with the words,"but I love you so."

I then went on to sing... "You may smell funny, but I love you so..." And so a song was born. A silly song, but a song nonetheless.

What you hear here is a short clip I tried to capture after we were singing it together. I added a bit of guitar just so it would get fleshed out a bit, so this is the first rough of the tune. It has the possibility of being one of those songs that allow for itself to be filled with all kinds of silly things allowing for a virtual lyric improv that will work well with kids.

In all honesty this tune is stuck in my ear (and my daughter's as well even when we want to hear something else.) So if you are not afraid of having the same thing happen to you, listen on...

Special greetings to my friends in Vimont (in Quebec); Tatsuno, Japan; Tianjin, China and Guarantá do Norte, Brasil.

      <title>RoughMix 126 - Bring Me Back Rehearsal - the cast about how music is made</title>
      <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/3434/600x600_1179508.jpg" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing music is the first step. For many that is enough. For me, I want to usually work it out with a band, to draw upon the creative juices of others and to hear it a bit closer to what I hear in my head but cannot produce myself, because I can only sing, play guitar and create percussion (and even this not all at once - and the live part of it all is not to be underestimated.)

This is a rehearsal with my German band [Steffi Weiss - keys/vocals; Petra Wolfsperger - recorder; Christian Mees - bass] (we even created some German lyrics for the song specifically this.)

As is usual this was recorded on the Palm Tungsten which records mono and does a very poor job of dealing with clipping and audio that gets too "hot". That is part of the roughness of what works.

The raw material provides insight into discussions, general direction and more that you will need to discover for yourself and to which you are warmly welcomed.

I should note that this was the first and only time we got together on this tune. It was performed 3 days later.

The original post on this song is RoughMix episode 108 - http://ruffmix.com/entry/2008-02-22T03_05_53-08_00 where I shared two versions of what I did in the original writing of the tune.

      <title>RoughMix 125 - Acoustic Airs</title>
      <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/3434/600x600_1170453.jpg" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the best thing you can do is to simply sit down and play without a plan, without any goals, and see what happens. As in most cases this got recorded on my Palm Tungsten, which is almost always with me - which makes it a good tool for capturing spontaneity.

I had a listen to this clip afterwards and heard that I had a few elements that could be of use:

    * some tapping
    * some harmonics
    * some rhythm change-ups


Most importantly, to keep it rough I was not afraid of making mistakes just because I was recording it. I believe it is precisely this that allows for discovery of something new, something fresh and unique

That's what I did here in RoughMix episode 125, which I am calling "Acoustic Airs".

For those of you really into the roughness I am also sharing the original Palm based wav file online:

      <description>This time around I am sharing a tune with two "drafts".  Here I played around with the theme long enough to have some unique things spring forth just by virtue of staying at it long enough.  Listen carefully and you will hear my daughter chime in with some background vocals.

Sounds are all around us. I have slowly come to the conclusion that all of them are potential tools for inspiration, as this episode of RoughMix shows.

Welcome to RoughMix 123 - Press 1.

As the title implies, this episode was inspired by a recording I made while trying to call a credit card company. It was the automated voice that annoys us all so very much. I decided to try and use it as an inspirational tool and this cast is the result.

The important thing is not what I did (the music is truthfully pretty lame) but this is the Rough Mix and therefore I am sharing with you the raw data of the songwriting process in the hopes that it will whet your songwriting appetite.

Your inspiration may create something quite different - who cares! Your music should be yours - let loose!

There is also a bonus for those who listen to the end - a tune Brian wrote for his daughter of http://Elephant-Town.com fame back when she was very little. This is the third verse.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

As the title implies, this episode was inspired by a recording I made while trying to call a credit card company. It was the automated voice that annoys us all so very much. I decided to try and use it as an inspirational tool and this cast is the result.

The important thing is not what I did (the music is truthfully pretty lame) but this is the Rough Mix and therefore I am sharing with you the raw data of the songwriting process in the hopes that it will whet your songwriting appetite.

Your inspiration may create something quite different - who cares! Your music should be yours - let loose!

Two rough "tunes"
                    * In your Hands
                    * 3rd fret start  - it sounds like I here had a lick which was central to what became experimentation after that - always returning to the basic theme and then branching off from it again. I also included licks from other songs in it 2:22 for example, and others 

Over time you create a style and a body of work. This is a resource than you can plow again using it as a fertilizer for new projects - often improving and refining what you have already done. When I create something new it is impossible for me to not know my past.

Sometimes it makes sense to try extra hard to do something unique, but why not try at least sometimes to embrace your songwriting past and incorporate it into something intentionally?&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

                Just to show you how rough you can get this episode has its place. I am sharing with you all of the rough, which includes an embarressing "Yoko Ono" like voice, which is followed by what that inspired. (Sorry Yoko!)
                                                                
                Oddly enough, the second could not have happened without the first.
                                                                
                And so the tip this time - do not be afraid of making a fool of yourself (it is after all for you.) If you let your thoughts freely flow you may end up being surprised by what follows.
                                                                
                The original file as recorded on the Palm can be downloaded here for those of you who really want the details:
                                                                
                Original WAV file: http://www.mediafire.com/?unmjdonii1j
                                                                
                As I write this episode my audicity software is going crazy and doing nothing that it should. I have had to revert to an earlier version of the software, which meant that all of what I recorded was useless. I needed to mix down all of what I had to an mp3 file and then use this as the new base - sorry for any loss of quality - rougher still!

      <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/3434/600x600_1050989.jpg" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a ride with me into the distant past when my hair was black and my back was strong enough to schlepp around electric pianos.
                
                118 has a look into what is possible when you do not even have "real" instruments.
                
                The most important part of songwriting is not the tools at hand, but the tools in your head.

      <itunes:summary>Take a ride with me into the distant past when my hair was black and my back was strong enough to schlepp around electric pianos.
                
                118 has a look into what is possible when you do not even have "real" instruments.
                
                The most important part of songwriting is not the tools at hand, but the tools in your head.
                
                You can also access me and my random thoughts at: http://twitter.com/nlnnet

      <title>RoughMix 117 - Slap Therapy</title>
      <description>&lt;img src="http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/3434/600x600_1048851.jpg" alt="itunes pic" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some times it feels good just to hit things - added bonus if that is a guitar that results in sounds you like.

That was in any case the attempt represented in this episode of RoughMix which I am calling slap therapy. Listen in on the clip, recorded on the Palm Tungsten and you hear why I chose this as a title.

My tip this time around is to let things run awhile. Do not always be in a hurry to "make" something and don't worry about polish or beauty. Raw emotion, and unvarnished energy and the simple joy of not have any rules is sometimes a real pleasure.

It also has the added benefit of often causing something more refined to spring from this little exercise.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

In this episode of RoughMix I share two clips as indicated in the title in the hopes that it inspires above all all who may listen to record whatever you do to capture ideas. Only when you have a system will you not fprget things you create.

This tune was written "on demand". Find out more about how this was done in this cast.

This cast has the bit recorded for the band to rehearse, as well as the stuff that flowed from my head with all that was created being done on the fly. Follow the progress and see how it may help your songwriting.

Contact us at roughmix@gmail.com, or even better by visiting http://RuffMix.com and leaving a message there on this episode.

The lyrics and chords are available to anyone by making a request  when you save a note (your bonus for giving feedback.)

      <description>RoughMix 111 - Badum

I record lots of stuff on my Palm Tungsten, as I mostly always have it with me. I record far more than I share with you all, simply because I do not have time to do it all.

In all honesty I do not even follow my own advice about recording everything, but I do get pretty close, and this helps, I believe to give me material that I can use to create material. My biggest challenge is in fact in keeping track of all the stuff that I create in a manner that is easily filed. (I am by the way eager for listener feedback about this and other issues. I know that I have hundreds of listeners, but no one really replies. Since this is true if YOU reply you are very likely to get your reply shared with the hundreds of other listeners.)

One other note before getting into this episode's material - I am thinking about creating episodes of truly rough material with no comments and nothing other than raw Palm Tungsten recordings. I have the material to do this, but I do not want to just dump material on you. I DO however want to share the process of the songwriting, and maybe this is a way to do it.

Let me know what you think by doing the following:

* send a voicemail by visiting RuffMix.com and using the tools there to do this
* send an email to ruffmix@gmail.com
* visit http://RuffMix.com and post a comment on the episode
* call me and leave a voicemail at the phone number +49 7631 183381

And now, welcome to the episode I am calling "Badum", because this is what I called the audio track when I recorded it.

I want to send special greetings to visitors from San Antonio and Houston, Texas, Montreal, Canada, and Miami Florida and southwest of Ljubliana - please keep coming back!&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Forcing a specific chord change is the impetus to create something new in episode 110 of RoughMix.

This episode is an instrumental piece which had a large focus on a melody line which was inspired by the chord changes - have a listen!

In the last episode I shared the roughmix of "Bring Me Back" as I created it on the fly. This time around I show you what is sometimes the next step - sharing the song with a band for the first time.

This is a good way to polish what you do and get feedback that can only help improve your song.

This was recorded mono on my Palm Tungsten, for another band that would also need to perform it. The chatter, although in German will not hurt the understanding of the process itself.

It is a tune written specifically for a church confirmation to take place over 4 church services. The speaker is incorporating the song into the sermon itself, so it is a truly cooperative venture.

It is also a first for me to have written a song that will so quickly be performed by others without my participation.

Enjoy!

It informed me about the general theme of the upcoming confirmation church service, and it asked me if I might have any ideas about a song that could be created for the event.

I am always excited about challenges like this and this episode is the result.

I am particularly proud of this as all of it happened within an hour of getting the email - which shows that creatively can be done under pressure and can come from outside impetus.

If you want more about me there are many ways to get it - here are a few:

* http://twitter.com/nlnnet
* http://pownce.com/nlnnet
from these places you can get many more links.

Also, the ambient noise comes from my daughter, who also took this photo. She is 6.

I could tell you more about lots of things, but I do not think that anyone cares so I am saving myself the trouble. If YOU do care, let me know and I can send you more info.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;
