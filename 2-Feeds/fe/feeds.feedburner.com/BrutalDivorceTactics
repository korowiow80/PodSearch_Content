			<title>Should A Killer Get Alimony?</title>
			<itunes:author>California Attorney John L Welch &amp; Reno Brackman</itunes:author>
			<description>This week a decision was issued in the case of Linda Calbi, who is serving a three-year prison term after pleading guilty to beating her son to death.  The presiding judge suspended her alimony payments during incarceration, making  it clear that Linda is eligible to receive them again upon her release.  Her ex-husband Chris Calbi had been paying Linda over $3,000 a month until her incarceration, and I can assure you is not looking forward to being saddled with that amount when Linda is paroled.  To help make some sense of it all California Attorney John L Welch offers his insight to host Reno Brackman.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BrutalDivorceTactics/~4/FofruFut_xw" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>
