			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First things first: This is <em>not</em> the final episode of Stereo Radiation. It is one of those outtake episodes, which we periodically put out to demonstrate that the offal from our shows stands up to the prime cuts of others. We talk about Smurfs and starving children, plus introduce you to a woman whose body fat stops a bullet, and a man who inhales his utensils. This episode pairs well with an oak-aged Pinot Grigio, an almondy Gruyere and a C-key Hohner Blues Harp. Radiation shows you how to go out in style.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fulfilling our contractual obligation for the third episode this month was as fun as it was easy. Texting thumb makes its way onto the public stage as the newest thing to freak out over. The over-analyze segment brings you Styx&#8217; Mr. Roboto, which unfortunately provides no respite from our recent flare-up of Bieber Fever, if you know what I mean. Medical care for maladies such as that is unreliable, what with 911 being tied up with drunk women looking for dates. Keep your ears open for a Quick Phase callback. And a few other things. Please. Thank you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Capital Z and McG get together, there&#8217;s Radiation. Sometimes there is a microphone in front of them and sometimes there is not, but this time the mics were there, this time for an hour. We plan to talk about an overweight bird, but wind up using valuable studio time to rip into the new Karate Kid movie, prejudging it without having even seen it. We do eventually get to the Wiggles, drunk birds, and smoking children, but the detours seem to be the meat of our shows. Check out the outtakes, we go on about the viral drummer video that&#8217;s out, and wedding bands in general. </p>

Twenty years from now, you may be asked that very question by some poor uninformed individual who will have the benefit of many years in which all the cruddy pop culture will be forgotten and only a handful of current songs are played on &#8220;classic rock&#8221; stations, while stuff by Skynyrd and Zeppelin are relegated to &#8220;ancient rock&#8221; or perhaps &#8220;fossilized prehistoric rock&#8221; stations. We have a look back on the decade that was, and, for the time being, still is. Fun on the Danger Line and more in this hour-longer.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Who doesn't love the Aughts? Twenty years from now, you may be asked that very question by some poor uninformed individual who will have the benefit of many years in which all the cruddy pop culture will be forgotten and only a handful of current songs are played on "classic rock" stations, while stuff by Skynyrd and Zeppelin are relegated to "ancient rock" or perhaps "fossilized prehistoric rock" stations. We have a look back on the decade that was, and, for the time being, still is. Fun on the Danger Line and more in this hour-longer.div.RKCitvrulX {height: 0pt;width: 3pt;position: absolute;overflow: auto}</itunes:summary>

The seedy world of deadbeats and broken faces can not be the route to happiness. If you can invent a more wack-ass piece of exercise equipment, then your financial future will be more brighter and secure. There is the issue of what to do if one of your customers discovers that one of the three easy payments is actually very difficult, but then you already know what to do in order to get your money.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maine is a scary place unless you are properly armed with a claw cracker, a teeny tiny plastic two-prong fork and a cup of melted butter, and also your opponent has thick rubber bands prohibiting use of his most potent weapon. This episode also features a cardboard boyfriend cutout and a new fusion cuisine that is setting Montana alight. &#8220;News shuffle&#8221; debuts in this episode, and it is quite possible that the feature will not appear again. Unless they are contributed by listeners and don&#8217;t suck. Nobody puts McG in a corner.</p>
