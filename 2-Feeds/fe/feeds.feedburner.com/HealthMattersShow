That&#8217;s probably because of several reasons, not the least of which is that Fibromyalgia and back pain go together like Jello and Cool Whip. Think Bill Cosby.</p>
<p>It can be difficult for even the most seasoned professional physician to tell when back pain stems from a dysfunction of the back or is simply another symptom of Fibro. That&#8217;s because pain all along the back is a classic part of the illness.</p>
<p>I wrote the following article about the two conditions for another publication and now I want to share it with you. So very many people suffer with Fibromyalgia and back pain everyday. Feel free to leave a comment and share your experiences with others. </p>

<span id="more-27482"></span><br />
A few years ago, while in the process of mending and healing from earlier, long-term illnesses (one of them Fibromyalgia), I found myself in considerable back pain. I incorrectly had assumed I would be totally free of all pain soon, but no&#8230;my back continued to hurt! Why? Did I have something else wrong?</p>
<p>Granted some activities produced more symptoms than others. Walking, running, standing and bending were the biggest culprits capable of inducing cramping, spasms, tight muscles and a pain level that could take me to my knees. On my worst ten-out-of-ten pain level days, I stayed in bed to avoid taking multiple, strong, prescription drugs.</p>
<p>When walking became necessary, the exertion of trudging through a super-sized store would be the most challenging activity of all. One particular store’s long aisles offered few places to rest, forcing me to walk with a cane, rest, walk some more, stop again, then more walking…finally leaning on my cane for all it was worth or grabbing onto a store fixture sturdy enough to support me. Surely, an inadequate and ineffective way to get where I wanted to go. </p>
<p>Finally, in exhaustion, a stratospheric level of pain stopped me cold and headed me towards the limits of tolerance and brain delirium. Was it possible to get my errand done or did I need to leave the store before someone called 911? Luckily, no experience ever went quite that far, but I came terrifyingly close to such humiliation several times. It truly was no fun to get in that much pain and have so few options. </p>
<p>One day I walked halfway through a store. My back seized up in aisle five, leaving me in excruciating pain. I stood hobbled over, sweaty and in tears. Suddenly, a store clerk stood before me with a puzzled look. She didn’t know what to do&#8211; offer me help, call her manager or what.</p>
<p>Another day, in another situation, the quizzical party eyeing me was a drugstore pharmacist. “May I help you, ma’am? Do you need a chair or some other help? I’m happy to call someone for you.”</p>
<p>“No, thank you, sir. I need pain relief. Do you have anything to help my aching back?”</p>
<p>His answer was one I had heard before: apply a heating pad or muscle rub ointment or take an over-the-counter pain reliever. Truthfully, even today there are not adequate answers other than taking strong pain medications prescribed by a doctor. That day, if I had had a script for a pain drug, the pharmacist could have filled it and technically helped me, but I’m not inclined to live my life with that single, limited choice. No, I wanted more of an answer than…take a pill.</p>
<p>The life-altering pain lingered. The problem threatened to compromise my happy return to good health that I had envisioned. The constant agony worked on me emotionally, from the inside out. In my down moments, I envisioned an ugly world. Housebound. An invalid. Stuck, and laying on my back in a squalid bed, away from people, away from the world which I wanted to frolic in again so badly. </p>
<p>Suddenly, my future sprang forth in truth like my young being born: unless I did something major, my back pain neither would go away nor get better.</p>
<p>That’s when I booked an appointment with my general practice doctor. An x-ray revealed two bulging spinal discs. Weak back and stomach muscles plus my history of living for many years as a semi-invalid made me that much more likely a candidate for back pain. My physician recommended physical therapy and the option that sounded the most doable and pleasant to me: warm-water <b>pool therapy</b>. </p>
<p>Very soon I scheduled physical therapy sessions with a business in town that had its own warm water pool facility and offered this specialized therapy. I suspected that the process of getting stronger and exercising might proceed slowly. The words arduous and torturous come to mind even now as I remember those first few weeks. The reality was that I did not have a robust level of energy; I had to push myself. </p>
<p>The therapist started me slowly, but soon she had me walking laps in the pool and pushing and pulling my legs against the resistance of the water. Next came stretches, squats and leg lift repetitions for muscle building. All of the exercises strengthened my major back muscles in addition to improving my overall conditioning. I moved better, gained muscle mass and felt more flexible. It wasn’t long before every aspect of the warm water therapy program was working together for my good!</p>
<p>To get some variety in my training program, I independently signed up for entry-level water aerobics classes at the local gym. The water was waist-high and I moved about with ease. I did not worry about keeping my balance and noticed improvements in what I could do there, too.</p>
<p>When I took Deep Water classes, my feet didn’t touch the bottom of the pool. That’s when I donned a ski belt to keep me afloat. If I had struggled to keep my head above water, I surely would have expended too much energy and not done well in the class as far as building my back and overall muscles.</p>
<p>No, staying buoyant with the security of the ski belt allowed me to feel free, joyous and a little like a kid rocking and rolling in the water. My time in the pool turned out to be some of the most fun I had enjoyed in a long time. I gained agility and ability, plus had fun doing it.</p>
<p>Occasionally I used other water exercise tools to work out, too, such as webbed gloves for pushing and pulling me forward, foam-like dumb bells for lifting <em>weights</em> under the water, stretch bands for doing resistance exercises and, finally, specially-designed shoes made to create more resistance as I walked. Those built up leg, calf and ankle muscles. In doing the whole routine, I found that anything I did to strengthen my torso also helped my back. </p>
<p>But the improvement benefits were implied, not guaranteed. It was my responsibility to do my exercises right and not hurt myself. If I acted frivolously and did some movement wrong, I risked personal injury. </p>
<p>As I look back today, I know that my effort and time spent in doing warm water pool therapy meant I could avoid most, strong pain medications and, maybe, an invasive back surgery or two. So far, so good. This approach worked on a grand scale for me. Will it work for everyone? Probably not.</p>
<p>However, if you’re someone who would rather take charge of your health and aren’t afraid to try something new, maybe it could help you. Personally, I’m glad I didn’t leave my medical fate to chance. Physical therapy truly helped me. That’s why I feel truly grateful to my doctor for recommending this particular health-promoting answer.</p>
<p>Do I have even more, new and exciting health horizons ahead of me? I&#8217;m betting I do. After all, I&#8217;m ahead so far in conquering Fibromyalgia and back pain!</p>

Many people want to know why is it so tough to get an accurate diagnosis. Today, let’s look at 3 reasons why this may be happening and then catch the 3 bonus points below. You want to get this right!</p>
<p>1) Not all medical professionals can easily diagnose Fibromyalgia.</p>
<p>The truth be told, this illness should not be that confusing, but it often is. The specific diagnosis criteria is out there and available to any medical professional. Either you have the symptoms or you don&#8217;t!<br />

<span id="more-27454"></span><br />
After taking a careful medical history and doing a thorough exam, a doctor should be able to make a diagnosis for or against Fibromyalgia.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the hustle and bustle of obtaining a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia, it is sometimes easy to assume erroneous suppositions and a definitive diagnosis becomes a pipe dream effectively lost in an array of blood tests, x-rays, etc. If this happens to you, keep bringing your physician back to center so that you have a better chance of getting the diagnosis of Fibromyalgia, <em>or whatever condition you have</em>. Again, anyone can exhibit multiple symptoms. They can seem like Fibromyalgia, but be something different. However, if you&#8217;re suffering with this chronic pain condition, you have it and you need help in recovering from it. There is no quasi or borderline state of <i>maybe</i> Fibromyalgia once you meet the criteria for diagnosis. </p>
<blockquote><p>The important point here is that it&#8217;s important to keep progressing and moving forward in your recovery process. Get your questions answered. Try to stay on track and obtain a diagnosis. Don&#8217;t get lost in confusion.</p></blockquote>
<p>3) Sadly, this third reason is the most distressing of all. In our world of abundant, easy-to-obtain information, research reports, scientific studies, etc., there remain some doctors who “do not believe in Fibromyalgia&#8221;. I guess they missed both the American Rheumatologist Association’s diagnosis criteria and the Social Security Administrations’ ruling of 99-2p, the latter of which spells out the specific criteria that a person must meet to qualify for disability due to incapacitating Fibromyalgia. There are hundreds and thousands of other documents that prove the illness exists.</p>
<blockquote><p>Find the search box on the Health Matters Show website and put in the term Fibromyalgia. You&#8217;ll get a large volume of data right here!</p></blockquote>
<p>BONUS INFORMATION: The keys to being successful are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to your doctor visits prepared,</li>
<li>Certainly investigate all possible, troublesome health conditions, but don’t allow the exercise to hinder you in getting a correct diagnosis of what is bothering you, and </li>
<li>Don’t be dissuaded by one or two nay-sayers. If you suspect that you have the condition and you want a doctor to address what&#8217;s wrong with you, then stay the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Look for a professional who will take you seriously and give you an accurate diagnosis of Fibromyalgia. They are out there.</p>

<h2>Holistic Approaches to Fibromyalgia</h2>
<p>Of people in the know, that is, people who have had success in lessening the symptoms of Fibromyalgia or, possibly, helping others <b>heal from Fibromyalgia</b>, holistic approaches seem to work best. That is, better than prescription drugs which act as a Bandaid approach only because they mask the symptoms, not remove them. With integrative, holistic approaches to Fibromyalgia, the results are better, longer lasting and sometimes they work indefinitely.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m covering some of the material offered in my new book that&#8217;s coming out soon, <b><i>From The Floor Looking Up</i></b>, a memoir/ health book on how I got so sick with Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and how I healed. Check this out below. Sign up to receive the newest information about the book, if you haven&#8217;t already done so. I welcome each person who suffers with this illness and who wants to get rid of it.</p>
<p>At the bottom of today&#8217;s Health Matters Show blog post, we&#8217;ll finish talking about &#8220;holistic approaches to Fibromyalgia&#8221;.<br />

<span id="more-27403"></span><br />
Today we&#8217;ll look briefly at five areas:</p>
<p><strong>I)	LIFE CHANGES: a) Get moving.</strong> If you are able to get out of bed for any length of time at all, one of the first things to do to start feeling better is to add a slow-paced exercise program to your routine. The best examples include walking around the block, a gentle, easy-does-it water aerobics class, yoga, meditation, or entry level Pilates™ class.</p>
<p><b>LIFE CHANGES: b) Decrease stress.</b> Another thing to put on your first to-do list, consider how to decrease your stress level. You can cut back on your hours spent at work, alter the number of days worked, change jobs or consider taking a break away from work entirely through the Family Medical Leave Act or provided for by a disability policy (personal or group). </p>
<p><b>LIFE CHANGES: c) Retool your kitchen and food supplies</b> aiming at making life in the kitchen easier, healthier and a place that offers you better choices such as grass-fed beef, organic vegetables and fruit and lots of pure, clean water to drink. </p>
<p><b>LIFE CHANGES: d) Concentrate on restoring your body’s normal sleep schedule.</b> The suggestion is simple, but many times hard to accomplish: Go to bed at a decent hour and get 8 to 9 hours of real sleep and complete rest. That allows your body the hours it needs to heal what&#8217;s wrong with you and, if necessary, to re-regulate its natural biorhythms. For more specific suggestions, order your &#8220;free&#8221; copy of <a href="http://getwellhealth.com/Critical-freesleepintro.html" target="_blank"><i><b>3 Critical Things You Must Know About Sleep to Begin Feeling Better</b></i></a> today. </p>
<p><strong>II)	GAINING KNOWLEDGE. Putting it to good use. a) Reading and research.</strong> I do a lot of reading and research into many authority-figures&#8217; works. Once of the best sources I&#8217;ve found to give insight to what is wrong with someone is Karol K. Truman&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Feelings-Buried-Alive-Never-Die/dp/0911207023/?_encoding=UTF8&#038;tag=heamatsho-20&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;qid=1337264281&#038;camp=1789&#038;sr=8-1&#038;creative=9325"><b>Feelings Buried Alive Never Die</b></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=heamatsho-20&#038;l=ur2&#038;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. If you crack open the door and begin to look within, you may find some astounding answers about what is perpetuating your illness.</p>
<p><strong>b) CONSULTING A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL counselor or healing consultant will help most patients develop effective coping skills.</strong> Once you&#8217;re extremely sick, it&#8217;s valuable to have someone on your side. I like to think of it as having a personal cheerleader and friend who&#8217;s always willing, able and ready to listen. I go one step further and offer my services as a healing consultant. The time spent with my clients helps them recover their health and is rewarding to me, too.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just getting your problems out in the open is the first step towards resolving them. Plus, Fibromyalgia brings with it so many symptoms, having someone to help you cope with them can be a miracle in itself. The possible issues are almost too voluminous to cover in this short post.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>III)	ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES: Complementary Fibromyalgia treatment options</strong></p>
<p><strong>a) Alternative health information.</strong> As you and I investigate the best source of information about Fibromyalgia alternative therapies, we consult the Internet and such a source as the National Institute of Health (NIH) Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Mind Body methods research division. The website includes papers, clinical trials, web-teaching videos and lots of information about the value of considering a mind body approach to your health problem. Some of the best work is being done in the realm of cancer, but much of this approach can be applied to Fibromyalgia. *My point in aiming you at this credible website is to get you to open up to the possibility that mind body medicine does have something to offer you. I see the proof of this everyday in the technique I use to help people heal from Fibromyalgia, <a href="http://sacredcellularhealing.com" target="_blank"><b><i>Sacred Cellular Healing</i></b></a>.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Begin a program of low-impact walking, water aerobics and/or movement therapies, such as Tai Chi and Chi Gong.</strong> They can help you stay active and may provide you a much-needed measure of body conditioning. Be warned that it&#8217;s even tougher to come back physically, if you allow your body to become de-conditioned due to lack of any exercise.</p>
<p><strong>(c) Check out people who do hands-on work or specialize in relaxation.</strong> You can find local massage therapists with experience in working with people suffering with your symptoms. Also acupuncturists, Reiki masters, Chakra balancing, specialized energy work. One online source of relaxation work can be found with Dan Howard and his fantastic <a href="http://www.1shoppingcart.com/app/?af=1419039" target="_blank"><b>Intentional Resting™ Method</b></a>. Check it out while you&#8217;re here.</p>
<blockquote><p>I find Intentional Resting™ to be a simple yet powerful way to decompress and begin the healing process for me or anyone. I wish I&#8217;d thought of it myself! (Also, none of Dan&#8217;s products or courses are extremely expensive.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, deep breathing, muscle relaxation techniques, visual imagery, and music therapy can be beneficial for some patients in overcoming emotional problems, reducing anxiety, promoting a sense of well-being and calming over-active, body processes.</p>
<p><b>(d) An additional therapy to also check out would be a Healing Touch™ program.</b> This type of complementary (a.k.a. holistic or integrative) energy therapy can be used in conjunction with traditional therapies or as a stand-alone treatment. </p>
<p><B>IV. SUPPORT GROUPS AND ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA SOURCES:</B> for encouragement, interaction and helping you stay connected to the world. Specify what you&#8217;re looking for on Google by using a combination of &#8220;&#8221; quotation marks, + plus signs, etc. Example: a Google search for the term, support group + fibromyalgia + denver, delivered ten results. There a hundreds of thousands of people in &#8220;Fibro&#8221; groups on Facebook and scads of people looking for someone to talk to on Twitter. I am one of them! Contact me on Facebook at <a href="http://cindaonfacebook.com" target="_blank">Cinda Crawford</a> or my page, <a href="http://facebook.com/getwellhealth" target="_blank">GET WELL HEALTH</a>. Find me on Twitter at cindacrawford.</p>
<p>There are a few special Healthcare Links in the box on the right.</p>
<p><b>V. BLOGS, PODCASTS, FORUMS, TELESEMINARS, WEBINARS, VIDEOS &#038; more!</b> To find good resources in each of these categories, do some further research. Or make it easy on yourself by signing up for my teleseminar presentations by filling in the blanks of the box on this page entitled &#8220;What&#8217;s Happening? Get info by email.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you get back on Google and put in your terms plus (+) what you&#8217;re looking for (example Fibromyalgia + forum), you&#8217;ll get lots of information. Note, on most forums, there&#8217;s lots of talk going on with some of it being negative. On blogs, not so much so. On ones like the Health Matters Show, I tend to offer more information because I believe there&#8217;s power in what you know.</p>
<p>No matter which way you go, there&#8217;s always a good number of information sources at your fingertips, but few health and healing holistic approaches to Fibromyalgia like what you&#8217;ll find here with Sacred Cellular Healing. It&#8217;s mind, body, spirit healing at its best with a strong emphasis on the energetic and spiritual aspects of healing. Without a doubt, this is an excellent way to heal from Fibromyalgia!</p>

<p><a href="http://healthmattershow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Awareness-Day-2012.jpg"><img src="http://healthmattershow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Awareness-Day-2012-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Awareness Day 2012" width="280" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-27388" /></a>Since <b>CFS</b> and <b>Fibromyalgia Awareness Day</b> is tomorrow, May 12th, I suggest we start to celebrate and recognize what we&#8217;re capable of doing! We all have something we can do, even if it&#8217;s not always a march on City Hall or a declaration to the governor. Many millions of us are homebound and unable to get out into the world to advocate for the very illnesses that stole our lives.</p>
<p>Instead of being angry at yourself or your friends, let me encourage you to advocate for yourself online today. I&#8217;m keeping today&#8217;s <strong>Health Matters Show</strong> purposely short because there&#8217;s so much information ahead to read, study, watch and more! Go to <a href="http://facebook.com/getwellhealth.events" target="_blank"><strong>Facebook</strong>, my page there, <strong>GET WELL HEALTH</strong> and the <strong>Events page</strong>.</a> It goes &#8220;live&#8221; at 10:30 am EST on Friday, May 12th.</p>
<p>You can find a) information about a healing tool you can use now, b) four separate videos, c) special rates and discounts on the programs I offer and d) the chance to win one of five copies of <strong><em>Chicken Soup for the Soul&#8217;s: Celebrating Mothers and Daughters</em></strong> in time to give for Mother&#8217;s Day on Sunday!</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t lose! Don&#8217;t forget. Visit my Facebook Events page and then on to a fantastic Awareness Day Celebration!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not. That&#8217;s because ME, as a chronic illness, is very akin to CFS, CFIDS or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Looking at all the facts, I believe anyone can be stricken with one form of this illness or the other. Researcher/doctors can barely classify a person specifically with either one. The truth is few physicians understand both illnesses well enough to know the distinctions between them. Some people think they&#8217;re all one in the same thing. Today&#8217;s information will help to change that type of thinking&#8230;somewhat.</p>
<blockquote><p>*For a bit of background information, see the <a href="http://healthmattershow.com/what-is-me-myalgic-encephalomyelitis/" target="_blank">first post I did last year about ME</a>, then come back here.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that today&#8217;s information and brochure will become one of your most important &#8220;get well tools&#8221; in your health arsenal. &#8220;Knowledge is power.&#8221; Plus, today, see how ME/CFS Australia is spreading important messages and now a brochure for you to download.

<span id="more-27317"></span><br />
According to the <a href="http://www.mecfs-vic.org.au/" target="_blank">ME/CFS Australia (Victoria) website</a>, ME is a serious neurological illness. There is no known cause or cure for ME. It routinely affects 250,000 people in the UK alone. Men, women and children can suffer with the illness, but it is more prone to strike in women. Some people do recover (how?), but many do not. Up to 25% can be severely affected to the point where they are housebound or bed-bound needing a full time caregiver or at least in desperate need of a family member or friend to meet intimate feeding, bathing and mobility needs, etc.</p>
<p>WARNING: Do not think ME is about fatigue only. There are a whole lot more ME symptoms. Also, do not think that all ME sufferers are automatically mentally ill. No. Think instead of how some ME people are really, <em>really ill</em> to the point where they cannot think, comprehend or perform mental tasks. Some are even dying slow, agonizing deaths and that makes me very sad.</p>
<h2>ME symptoms can include:</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Malaise</b></li</p>
<li><b>Flu-like symptoms</b></li>
<li><b>Digestive symptoms</b></li>
<li><b>Sleep disorders</b></li>
<li><b>Difficulties with memory and concentration</b></li>
<li><b>Tender lymph nodes</b></li>
<li><b>Sensitivity to light and sound</b></li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking that science and research have not caught up to the needs of the CFS or ME population, you&#8217;re correct. To my knowledge, ME often expresses itself in people who cannot care for themselves&#8230;sometimes, at all. Weakness is one of the main ME symptoms, along with sensitivity to light, sound or movement. (I shed some light on this phenomena in today&#8217;s audio podcast.)</p>
<p>Take a look at ME/CFS Australia&#8217;s new, <a href="http://www.mechat.co.uk/db/ME%20Awareness%20leaflet%20for%20general%20public%20in%20PDF.pdf" target="_blank">explanatory brochure</a>. It&#8217;s a pdf and you can print it out for your needs or to have in your health file. (You only need a free pdf reader.)</p>

<h1>Fibromyalgia: Mood and Anxiety Disorders</h1>
<p>&#8230;.is information provided to you based on a media source &#8220;ahead of print&#8221; from Co-cure. If you&#8217;re not signed up for CoCure.org, I highly suggest you take a look at it.</p>
<p>Today we&#8217;re looking at how Fibromyalgia, mood and anxiety disorders are linked together. You may have suspected that was the case. If for no other reason, because so many doctors regard Fibro patients as &#8220;less than centered&#8221; and emotionally unhealthy. I&#8217;m not saying that that is true, it&#8217;s simply a common perception.</p>
<p>So, what is the real truth? Are Fibromyalgia sufferers more inclined to emotional upheavals and mood and anxiety disorders to begin with or&#8230;what? That a look at this study and draw your own conclusions. I welcome your comment below.<br />

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>Several studies carried out mainly in North America revealed high rates of mood, anxiety and sleep disorders in patients with fibromyalgia (FM), while the information in other countries is scant. Therefore, we aimed at investigating the prevalence and the impact of such conditions on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the<br />
severity of pain in a sample of Italian FM patients.</p>
<p>METHODS:<br />
One-hundred and sixty-seven women suffering from primary FM were consecutively enrolled. Psychiatric diagnoses were made by means of DSM-IV criteria. The HRQoL and the severity of pain were measured through the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (MOS-SF-36) and the FM Impact Questionnaire (FIQ).</p>
<p>RESULTS:<br />
Fibromyalgia patients showed a high rate (80.8%) of lifetime and/or current comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders. Patients with psychiatric comorbidity resulted significantly more impaired on the Mental Component Summary score of the MOS-SF-36 and showed a higher FIQ total score than those suffering from FM only. The severity of<br />
pain was associated with current psychiatric comorbidity.</p>
<p>Patients with current mood disorders showed significantly lower Mental and Physical Component Summary scores of the MOS-SF-36 and higher FIQ total scores than those with current anxiety disorders or those without psychiatric comorbidity. Finally, patients with sleep disorders reported a lower HRQoL than those with a normal sleep, and specifically those with difficulty in falling in sleep had higher severity of pain.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:<br />
Psychiatric comorbidity, in particular with mood disorders, provokes a significant impairment of the HRQoL and, when current, a higher severity of pain in FM patients.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-32448/ME-drove-daughter-suicide.html" target="_blank"><strong>ME drove my daughter to suicide</strong></a><br />
by ANDREA PERRY, femail.co.uk</p>
<p>Fiona Smith had a bright future ahead of her as a landscape architect when she was struck down with the debilitating illness chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)- also known as ME. After a courageous nine-year battle to get help for the illness, which left her severely disabled and often bed-ridden, Fiona could take no more and took her own life in November last year. She was just 31.</p>
<p>Now her mother Trish has spoken bravely for the first time of the daughter who she described as &#8220;my best friend, adviser and confidante.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs Smith, of Bristol, broke her silence at a launch of a new report which revealed there is a major suicide risk amongst ME sufferers. The report reveals a catalogue of failure and discrimination through the NHS and social services towards the 150,000 patients diagnosed with the illness. The document highlights, in particular, the problems encountered by people who are most severely affected by CFS/ME. Many of those involved in the study have been confined to their homes or even bed-ridden for up to 10 years.</p>
<p>Conducted by Action for ME, the leading UK charity, it is the largest study published into ME and questioned 2,300 sufferers. It found that:</p>
<p>• 51 per cent had felt suicidal as a result of the extreme pain of the illness coupled with a lack of support from the medical profession.<br />
• 65 per cent had received no advice from their GP on managing the illness.<br />
• 33 per cent had to endure a wait of more than 18 months before being diagnosed with ME, despite evidence that early diagnosis can help<br />
recovery.</p>
<p>Despite displaying classic symptoms of the illness, it took 19 months before Fiona Smith was suspected of having CFS/ME and a further two months before a formal diagnosis was confirmed. She became ill in February 1992 after a flu virus and shortly afterwards was so ill that she had to withdraw from her post-graduate diploma course.</p>
<p>Fiona deteriorated, becoming bed-ridden in July 1994 and often had no voice, was weak and in so much pain that she could do little for herself. Over the next two and half years she improved very slightly but still was mainly bed-ridden and unable to wash or feed herself. Without professional advice she plateaued at this stage for two years.</p>
<p>After a battle with her local health authority, who initially refused funding, she was referred to an in-patient unit in Romford where she made a slow but steady improvement. But a series of relapses set her back nearly five years. She had become so weak that she was too frail to attend six-monthly hospital appointments with the local consultant and instead her mother went to update him on Fiona&#8217;s state.</p>
<p>He could offer no advice and in summer 2000 he stopped seeing CFS/ME patients and said that Fiona&#8217;s GP would have to oversee her care. The GP had not seen another case as severe and was unable to help.</p>
<p>Mrs Smith said: &#8216;By last November the future looked bleak. Now dependent on others for virtually everything &#8211; despite nearly nine years of day to day struggle to overcome the illness &#8211; it seemed that Fiona decided, quite suddenly, that she had had enough.</p>
<p><center><span style="color: red;">Somehow she found the courage and the strength to hang herself<br />
from the curtain pole in her room.</span></center></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Why is it that some patients, despite maintaining excellent personal motivation and accepted as not having psychological problems or depression, steadily deteriorate to indefinite total dependency on carers?</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do they fail to respond to hospitalisation or professional interventions, which help others? They still seem to be a mystery to the medical profession but inevitably become forgotten as new patients emerge. I feel this category is seriously neglected and badly needs highlighting.</p>
<p>&#8220;The undertaker in our small village had handled three other ME suicides in recent years. There are many more like Fiona who are still patiently struggling and we must help them. The absence of a cure can be accepted but there is no excuse for such patients to feel forgotten and invisible as so many do.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Chief Medical Officer working group on CFS/ME is due to report on the most effective methods of treatment later this year.</p>
<p>Tony Wright MP, Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on CFS/ME presented the report at today&#8217;s launch. He said: &#8220;ME is a complex, much misunderstood illness. My post bag is full every week with people around the country in despair because of this illness. There has to be more money put into research.&#8221; The illnesses cost the public purse £4 billion each year. Yet just £250,000 is spent on research. Three times as many women suffer CFS/ME than men. Many girls under the age of 18 contract the condition, but there is no research carried out into the illness in childhood.</p>

See her great tips below.</p>
<p>Plus, I just love this lady. She&#8217;s open, honest and forthright. If she&#8217;s knows it to be true, if she&#8217;s lived it or witnessed it, she&#8217;s not afraid to share the information with others. </p>
<p>~~~~~<br />
Take her Reawaken Your Brilliance TV/radio show. She interviews people who can provide helpful information to her audience of people who want to know about how to live a healthier and happier life, how to feel better and get rid of the illnesses that are holding them back&#8230;plus there&#8217;s a whole lot more!</p>

<span id="more-27225"></span><br />
Julie shares how important it is to face your past <b>childhood trauma and abuse</b>. She did and she&#8217;s living a healthier life because of taking that step some time ago. She believes in peeling back the layers of your onion&#8230;no matter how much muck and mire is beneath. Much of the time that takes great courage, especially when you&#8217;re feeling depressed. Today, hear Julie tell us how she fought and won that tough battle.</p>
<blockquote><p>(I often write about childhood trauma and abuse. I do it in a powerful, &#8220;get well&#8221; way in which both of my teaching/healing tools, Sacred Cellular Healing and the Learn How to Heal Membership course, serve as an example of a healing modality that works gently and effectively. The purpose/ your goal is to get over childhood abuse and trauma and move on with your life in a healthy way!)</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, here are Julie&#8217;s Tips for Being and Getting Organized, even when you&#8217;re dealing with a maddening brain condition like Fibro fog. </p>
<ol>
<li><b>Tip #1:</b> Simplify, simplify, simplify. Make living your life and staying organized as simple as possible.</li>
<li><b>Tip #2:</b> Have a home for everything. If you don&#8217;t have a place for an item, create it. Remember rule #1.</li>
<li><b>Tip #3:</b> Label everything. Some OCD people will like this <img src='http://healthmattershow.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' />  Just label it. I find this type of tip comes in handy with all my computer, recording, video and audio equipment. If I don&#8217;t label the cords and what goes with what, at some point, I will get into serious trouble!</li>
<li><b>Tip #4:</b> And last but not least, color code everything. Julie suggests such a strategy as colored folders for paperwork. I do that, too, especially when I&#8217;m being super-organized. I&#8217;ll have to polish off that habit because I&#8217;ve been back-sliding a bit. I can see where it really will help me.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, if Fibro fog gets to you, consider her tips. And if you get a chance, be sure to check out her websites. She has so many great shows and speakers there. Speaking of shows, she is honoring me by making me her guest on next Wednesday&#8217;s Reawaken Your Brilliance show at 8 pm EST, April 25th. Join us &#8220;live&#8221; if you can for a frank talk about healing, chronic illness and how you can get better. Get your ideas together about what questions you want to ask because Julie invites your participation.</p>
<p>Thanks so much to Julie Seibert, my interview guest today, and to you, my audience. Your comments are encouraged below. Please share this resource at will!</p>

<p><a href="http://healthmattershow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2801711792_d370634f2f.jpg"><img src="http://healthmattershow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/2801711792_d370634f2f-300x174.jpg" alt="" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/caitlinator/2801711792/sizes/m/in/photostream/" width="300" height="174" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-26348" /></a>The question, <b>Do you have Fibromyalgia or CFS?</b> assumes you have symptoms similar to both illnesses, but you&#8217;re not quite sure how to classify what you&#8217;re experiencing. Your doctor may even be a bit puzzled.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon to get a different chronic illness and then Fibromyalgia follows, especially if the beginning illness leaves you sedentary and involves a degree of pain. And on the flipside, it&#8217;s possible to get Fibromyalgia first and then (example) CFS, so your illness sequence doesn&#8217;t give you a concrete answer. That&#8217;s exactly how my illness manifested in earnest when I became so sick.</p>
<p>Some of the same add-on conditions or symptoms often accompany both illnesses, such as being prone to stress, TMJ (temporomandibular joint dysfunction or syndrome), a dysfunctional thyroid (usually low thyroid) and/or HPA axis condition (hypothalamus, pituitary, adrenal axis), allergies, swelling of joints (Arthritis), pain in the limbs, hips, back, shoulders, neck, etc., sleep dysfunction, energy impairment, and immune system irregularities.</p>

Let&#8217;s compare the two and really see what is different&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-27164"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><b><font color="2f8c8c">People who suffer with Fibromyalgia tend to hurt with more intense pain and in more places of the body than Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.</font color></b> *If you&#8217;re someone who has CFS and you hurt like the dickens, don&#8217;t brush off this statement as being false. Instead, consider getting tested for Lyme Disease and Lupus.</p>
<blockquote><p> Lupus Syndrome symptoms:<br />
If you simply consider Fibro and CFS by themselves and alone, Fibromyalgia is considered more of a chronic pain problem, whereas CFS if considered more of an immune system irregularity condition.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The exception to all this may be people prone to migraine headaches, however &#8220;having migraines&#8221; is not within the definition of either illness. It is common to hear of people with Fibro and CFS complain of having frequent migraines or &#8220;suffering with a new headache pattern&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><font color="2f8c8c"><b>Fibromyalgia also differs from CFS in that for Fibro, a person must have at least 11 of the 18 designated tender/ trigger points active at any one time.</b></font color> Note: that&#8217;s how some people do not quite qualify for Fibromyalgia because they don&#8217;t have at least 11 of these points -or- their doctor doesn&#8217;t know how to diagnose their condition properly. (*One other scenario, their doctor doesn&#8217;t &#8220;believe&#8221; in Fibromyalgia and therefore will not give such a diagnosis to any patient.)</li>
</ul>
<p><P><br />
The same &#8220;logic&#8221; applies to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome because there are still physicians in the world who (1) do not believe it is a true illness, so how can they possibly diagnose the health problem as being CFS? -OR- (2) do not know how to diagnose it, so instead the patients gets three or more additional diagnoses, each one indicating an area of the body that could be dysfunctional.</p>
<blockquote><p>An example of this can be seen with recurring sinus problems. If I had $10.00 for every sinus infection a doctor diagnosed me as having, I&#8217;d be a semi-wealthy woman today. Did I actually have sinus problems? Yes, I did. I took plenty of antibiotics to &#8220;prove&#8221; it. Today, at certain times of the year, I still struggle with my sinuses. When that happens, instead of running to the doctor for an antibiotic, I often work on sinuses and immune system using my <a href="http://sacredcellularhealing.com" target="_blank">Sacred Cellular Healing</a> (SCH) technique. It helps to keep my immune system performing at peak capacity and, more times than not, I do not sicker with a sinus infection. *That means I don&#8217;t have to take multiple antibiotic prescriptions and that&#8217;s good!</p>
<blockquote><p>In a nutshell, I use SCH to boost my immune system to stay healthy and avoid getting sick.</p></blockquote>
<p>But some twenty years ago, was I experiencing a breakdown of the immune system as it deteriorated in capability and functionality? Yes, you better believe it. I was sick week after week with sinus infections. That one symptom pointed towards the reality of me having CFS.</blockquote</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;re sick and a bit confused as to which illness you have or if you have both, consult my Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome pages on our sister website, Get Well Health. It is fairly inclusive and includes much of the information you want to know about this topic. Do you have Fibromyalgia or CFS? </p>

Monday we did <a href="http://healthmattershow.com/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-diet/" target="_blank">Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Diet</a>. If you&#8217;re eating potato chips right now, be brave and read it if you missed it. I promise I won&#8217;t fuss, but I do have some great suggestions for you to think about and try.</p>
<p>Tuesday we did <a href="http://healthmattershow.com/treating-cfs-using-drugs-and-supplements/" target="_blank">Treating CFS Using Drugs and Supplements</a>. That is a hot topic for sure. Most people who have had CFS for awhile cannot manage unless they resort to some type of drug, OTC compound or supplementation. There were lots of ideas in this post.</p>
<p>Wednesday we did <a href="http://healthmattershow.com/lifestyle-changes-for-cfs/" target="_blank">Lifestyle Changes for CFS</a>. Now, to me that&#8217;s interesting information. If I can change my lifestyle (e.g. how I think, how I act, the attitudes I have, etc.), then I can gain a measure of control that <i>I control</i>. *Please read the whole post before you jump and down and accuse me of blaming the patient. I absolutely do not. This is simply a different way of looking at the problem.</p>
<p>Thursday, we examined the issue of <a href="http://healthmattershow.com/cfs-cognitive-behavior-therapy/" target="_blank">CFS: Cognitive Behavior therapy</a>. That may or may not be a new term to you, but it&#8217;s worth investigating. See if you agree or disagree that at least some of the aspects of Cognitive Behavior Therapy may have merit.</p>
<p>Friday, today as I mentioned, we&#8217;re doing a bit of wrap-up, but also looking at Complementary and Alternative CFS Treatment options. The first place I&#8217;m investigating is the NIH (National Institute of Health), Complementary and Alternative Medicine, Mind Body methods research.</p>
<p><center><b><font size="4">Get your copy of my newly revised&#8230;<br />
<a href="http://getwellhealth.com/pdf/GETWELLHEALTHJOURNAL.pdf" target="_blank">GET WELL HEALTH JOURNAL</a>!</font size></b></center></p>
<p>The sub-topics there include Aromatherapy and Essential Oils (at http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/aromatherapy/healthprofessional). I use essential oils myself to keep me healthy. Also addressed are hypnosis, yoga at http://nccam.nih.gov/health/yoga/introduction.htm, and clinical trials for mind body methods, plus how spirituality is being used and regarded in cancer care. In an age when not so long ago, it was taboo within the medical profession to talk about such topics, at least at NIH, they are addressing and looking into spiritual and alternative medical areas that could benefit the patient. I applaud them highly for such a move. However, all of the clinical trials right now involve cancer, not CFS. We anxiously await the results.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m particularly interested in a paragraph out of the health professional page referenced at NCI, the National Cancer Institute, on spirituality. It was linked to the NIH and reads this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Interest in and recognition of the function of religious and spiritual coping in adjustment to serious illness, including cancer, has been growing. New ways to assess and address religious and spiritual concerns as part of overall quality of life are being developed and tested.</p></blockquote>
<p>I take that to mean that extremely ill people, like those with severe CFS and ME, may look toward their natural spiritual and religious leanings for answers that they can&#8217;t find anywhere else. This is a personal journey of exploration and a choice that I made years ago when I developed the mind/ body, energy healing product that I call <a href="http://sacredcellularhealing.com" target="_blank">Sacred Cellular Healing</a>. I know I could never have gotten to the place I am now without undergoing that process, but more on that story another day.</p>
<p>Today, if you&#8217;re tired of being sick, tired of wasting your time, tired of throwing your money away with this product and that which doesn&#8217;t work, ask yourself honestly, what does it hurt to look inside of you for a deeper meaning to why you&#8217;re  so sick? By deciding to be the spirit-based child of God that you were put on this earth to be, you have a good chance at figuring out how to be healthy again. Your inner spirit knows what to do; your body only needs a few tools to get there.</p>
<p>Yes, Sacred Cellular Healing is one of the many Complementary and Alternative CFS Treatment Options available today.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for joining me this week.<br />

In some circles, this type of work is highly regarded. In other circles, it is not. I think that&#8217;s because such a suggestion as simply &#8220;change the way you think&#8221; is too simplistic and borders on &#8220;your illness is all in your head&#8221;. What an afront!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the beginning points of this type of therapy program and see if it is likely to help you, such as the following list.</p>
<p>A typical <a href="http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/lifestyle_psychotherapeutic_treatments_chronic_fatigue_syndrome__000007_6.htm" target="_blank">cognitive behavior therapy program </a>may involve the following measures:<br />
<span id="more-27119"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep a diary</strong>The value of keeping a diary may not be self-evident at first, but it can really pay off. Whether you write down your thoughts on paper or keep them online, it helps to see what you&#8217;ve written. It gives you a degree of validation for your illness. It also can help with things like organizing your life, such as with the &#8220;manage impaired concentration&#8221; goal below. You can keep lists of symptoms, prescriptions and the changes in how you feel. You think you&#8217;ll remember this important stuff, but it will fade with time. If you do a particular activity or project well, you can go back and look over your notes to help you see what might have worked in hindsight. It&#8217;s always 20/20!But more than that, writing down what is important to you can help you through the difficulty of managing the illness. Two great examples of that are 1) preparing for your doctor visits and 2) preparing a disability or insurance-based case. I invite you to come back to the Health Matters Show on Friday for a revealing discussion of all this week&#8217;s topics. If you do I will make available to you a &#8220;FREE&#8221; copy of my fabulous <strong>GET WELL HEALTH JOURNAL</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adjust your schedule as needed.</strong> If you have a terribly fatiguing illness like CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), it is not only a good idea but common sense that you consider reducing your activity level. If you do slow down, rest more, work few hours, etc., this give your body a chance to recover and heal. This is something you can figure out how to do for yourself.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confront negative or discouraging thoughts.</strong> For me, this is a big item. Negative or discouraging thoughts can carry lots of power. Few people are able to reject all negative or discouraging thoughts at will. Whenever this type of thought pattern is with you, it can seem overwhelming and pervasive. Can you will this type of thinking away? Maybe, once in awhile, you can do that. But on your worst days, don&#8217;t count on being totally successful. I find that it takes special training and help, such as what I offer my clients, to accomplish this goal in a meaningful way. Each person has been through different degrees and different type of stress and trauma. A person with CFS often needs real help in working with such involved self-based information. It simply isn&#8217;t that easy to &#8220;confront&#8221; the negative or discouraging thoughts and they will leave you alone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be flexible.</strong> Now that is a great suggestion. However, many people who are very sick, such as those with severe CFS or ME symptoms, become fairly inflexible. Change the temperature of the room and they&#8217;re miserable. Raise you voice and they&#8217;re off to find a quieter place. Introduce stress into a job situation and they cannot produce. Part of this may be because of <a href="http://www.prohealth.com/library/showarticle.cfm?libid=15974" target="_blank">damage to the brain</a>. Scientists suspect that to be the case.<br />
<blockquote><p>These results are consistent with an insult to the midbrain at fatigue onset that affects multiple feedback control loops to suppress cerebral motor and cognitive activity and disrupt local central nervous system homeostasis, including resetting of some elements of the autonomic nervous system.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if there is damage present, you may not be capable of being really flexible. No matter how hard you try, your brain damage can influence your tolerance levels, your ability to cope and your ability to change on a dime. All you can do it try. Do what you can to be flexible; the next idea or suggestion could be the one that really helps you.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set limits.</strong> This is an excellent suggestion, especially when the topic is aimed at your daily expenditure of energy. Dr. Charles Lapp calls this your &#8220;energy envelope&#8221; and I wrote about this yesterday during the sub-topic of stress in the post, <a href="http://healthmattershow.com/lifestyle-changes-for-cfs/" target="_blank"><strong>Lifestyle Changes for CFS</strong></a>. You only have so much energy each day. Think of your daily energy as being energy dollars deposited in your energy envelope. Some days you have a fat envelope with all the dollars you need; other days, you have a skinny envelope and you better use them wisely. Once you spend your energy dollars, they&#8217;re all used up and you have no more energy! That&#8217;s why setting limits with people, events, projects and the like is always a good idea.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prioritize.</strong> Yes, it is good to prioritize our lives. However, with the symptom of brain fog being present, prioritizing may not be something you think about. Most people suffering with intense brain fog are fairly stressed and run from putting out one fire to the other. I&#8217;m not saying that this a good pattern, just a likely one. Prioritize when you can and simply do the best that you can other times.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manage impaired concentration.</strong> This sounds funny to me, maybe to the point of being ridiculous. Manage your ability to &#8220;not be able to&#8221; concentrate? There are few, logical answers of how you can do that short of healing and getting well. When you feel better, you can concentrate better. Granted, there are strong, stimulant drugs that can help you concentrate. Your doctor must prescribe them, but they all have side-effects. The best answer is to find your own answers for getting well.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accept relapses.</strong>I&#8217;ve never known anyone with CFS who did not suffer at least a few relapses before they began to get well. I guess that&#8217;s because few people really realize the scope and severity of the illness they have. They don&#8217;t begin the process of reversing it quick enough.Some people experience relapses regularly. I knew one lady who suffered two weeks of every month, depending on her feminine cycle. Now, that was new to me, but I put nothing past CFS. Most people simply have relapses when they&#8217;ve pushed too hard, allowed too much stress into their lives or succumbed to a new bacterial or viral attack. I&#8217;m sure there are more reasons.The point in accepting your relapses is not to blame yourself for having them. Most of the time, you did nothing to cause a relapse. When you do, my suggestion is simply to learn from what you did and set a new boundary there for the future. When you find out what you can and cannot do without causing a relapse, you&#8217;ll have more success in averting them in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please come back to the Health Matters Show on Friday for the conclusion of this week of CFS. I hope to wrap this up in grand style and, as mentioned above, offer you a &#8220;FREE&#8221; copy of my GET WELL HEALTH JOURNAL!

In talking about this subject, the first thing to do is ask yourself, &#8220;What is my <b>CFS lifestyle</b>?&#8221; Is it sedentary because you&#8217;re too ill to be up and active that much? Do people find you in bed most of the time? Does anyone care about your quality of life and try to help you improve and feel better?</p>
<p>Only <i>you</i>, the individual can answer these questions and surely your answers are complicated. The emphasis in this post today on the CFS lifestyle is to encourage you to think, plan and carry out the lifestyle that you want to achieve and is possible to accomplish. </p>
<p>First, what is true and best for one person may not be the answer for the next. Being successful with CFS, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, lifestyle changes may be a continual-effort work, your progress edging forward and then sliding back at times. You may struggle every day of every week to see any improvement.</p>
<blockquote><p>And, very important, <i>if</i> you begin to feel a bit better, please don&#8217;t take your positive lifestyle changes for granted and <i>assume</i> they will always be with you. It&#8217;s easy to backslide into old ways and old ideas if you experience some rough days. The return of your de-conditioned body could be right around the corner.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, what lifestyle changes for CFS can you make today that will help you feel better? And encourage your &#8220;healthy&#8221; body? </p>
<p><center><b>What About CFS STRESS?</b></center><br />
<span id="more-27097"></span><br />
Always, reducing your amount and degree of life stress is an advantageous goal. We human beings heal when we&#8217;re living with less stress and in a more comfortable, peaceful and healthy environment. However, when and if you must make a conscious decision about whether to allow more stress into your life, figure out a way of balancing the stress with stress-reducing activities and thought patterns.</p>
<blockquote><p>EXAMPLE: You may learn and practice deep breathing or another healthy self-practice called <em><b>mindfulness</b></em>. Whatever you choose to do, don&#8217;t allow your &#8220;illness symptom scales&#8221; to tip towards the negative side and start heading your body towards full blown symptoms again! CFS Stress&#8230;here you come! Instead, be wary and pro-active for yourself.</p></blockquote>
<p>What other types of lifestyle changes should you consider that are positive for controlling CFS stress? If you have the funds available, consider adding massage, yoga, meditation and light exercise into your healing and wellness routine. No, you probably can&#8217;t do any of these everyday, but try to work them into a monthly &#8220;to do&#8221; schedule, if possible. In the long run, they will help to reduce your stress level. And less CFS stress eventually leads to better health. (Note: a poor diet surely adds to to body stress, too, so think of your dietary adjustments as possible helping.<a href="http://healthmattershow.com/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-diet/" target="_blank">I talked about the advantages of eating a good diet two days ago.</a>)</p>
<p>My last suggestion is that you check out <strong>Intentional Resting </strong>with Dan Howard. He is doing phenomenal work in helping people alleviate pain and other symptoms. Plus, Dan graciously allowed me to interview him several months ago on his fabulous health and well-being technique, Intentional Resting. I&#8217;m happy to give you special access to the whole hour-long interview that we did. It&#8217;s at <a href="http://healthmattershow.com/intentional-resting-interview-great-health-resource-tool/" target="_blank">GetWellHealth.com</a> and you should insert the private password, cindadan. (*To make sure you don&#8217;t ever miss any of my interviews like this, sign up in the sign up box on this page.)</p>
<p><center><b>CFS Graded Exercise program</b></center></p>
<p>You could consider taking up an exercise or <b>CFS Graded Exercise program</b>. They are different in purpose, intensity, scale and proposed outcome. Overall, you begin with whatever level of health, agility and stamina you have and attempt to increase your abilities through something like slow, gradual walking. You can do this with a doctor or clinic or by yourself. <a href="http://me-cfscommunity.com/forum/topics/press-release-exercise" target="_blank">If a planned CFS Graded Exercise program is chosen, read up on the dos and don&#8217;ts and choose wisely.</a>.</p>
<p>If you find that you can&#8217;t do &#8220;exercise&#8221; well and your symptoms begin to worsen, do not blindly continue. If you stop when you first realize that this isn&#8217;t helping, maybe a month or six months later, your health may be better and you can try it again. <a href="http://healthmattershow.com/fibromyalgia-symptoms-human-energy-week-3/" target="_blank">Doctors, such as Dr. Charles Lapp, have proven that pushing yourself to exercise, when you&#8217;re not capable or not ready for the physical activity, can be detrimental and bring on relapse symptoms</a>. </p>
<p>Never keep pushing ahead when you relapse. When you&#8217;re ready, start again slowly. Unfortunately, that can mean never re-starting, waiting a week or waiting years. There is no uniform time table or protocol that works for every person. That&#8217;s why a CFS graded exercise program does not meet with uniform success and why graded exercise is not well regarded around the world as a universal &#8220;must-do&#8221; rehabilitation choice.</p>
<p><center><b>CFS sleep pattern</b></center></p>
<p>Other lifestyle changes to consider may include altering your poor <b>CFS sleep pattern</b>. Some people feel they need prescription drugs to adequately handle their sleep problems. Even if this works moderately well, it is an artificial answer. A less aggressive way is to add foods or magnesium supplements to your nighttime regimen -or- maybe 3 mg. of Melatonin. (*Seek your doctor&#8217;s advice.)</p>
<blockquote><p>By using Melatonin, you may be able to get to sleep easier and stay asleep longer. Health food store owners can often share information about Melatonin and other sleep products they carry. Even though my personal health is much better now, I still take Melatonin about one hour before going to bed each night to insure I get good quality and an adequate amount of sleep. Some people prefer the long-acting varieties to get the benefit of the supplement all night long. LemonBalm, B vitamins, etc. can add to the calming and peaceful sleep you desire, too.</p></blockquote>
<p>For other people, a CFS sleep pattern problem may be more of sleeping too much or at inappropriate times of the day. I suspect that stems from a person&#8217;s massive level of exhaustion and is caused in part) by the immune system fighting so hard and being on guard 24 hours a day! Getting into as much of a daily, nightly sleep regimen as possible can help there, too. Plus, if you sleep at the normal times of day, your biorhythms and biochemicals will work together for your good health. (If you don&#8217;t, they can work against you!)</p>
<blockquote><p>Pick up my &#8220;FREE&#8221; <b><font color="2f8c8c">3 Critical Things You Must Know About Sleep to Begin Feeling Better</font color></b>. The sign-up box is in the right-hand column of this page. This is an excellent resource for anyone with a CFS sleep pattern problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other sleep problems common to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome are sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome and periodic limb movements. A doctor should diagnose, advise and treat these conditions, because allowing them to continue could be dangerous to your overall health.</p>
<p>If you have any further ideas about improving your CFS Stress (e.g. with Intentional Resting), CFS sleep pattern problems, CFS graded exercise programs or lifestyle changes for CFS, please feel free to add them below. Share what works and the world heals with you!</p>

<p><a href="http://healthmattershow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Drugs-and-supplements.jpg"><img src="http://healthmattershow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Drugs-and-supplements.jpg" alt="" title="Treating CFS with drugs and supplements" width="216" height="162" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-27048" /></a>Considering our topic today, <b><i>Treating CFS Using Drugs and Supplements</i></b>, this is a huge post, packed with vital information. Let&#8217;s begin first by saying that there are no medications currently approved or recommended by the FDA for treating/ curing Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. No, none that claim to get rid of this complicated medical problem. </p>
<p>*There are a few rumored to help with immune dysfunction, etc., such as <strong>Ampligen</strong>, but none of them are available to the public at this time. (*If you type the term &#8220;Ampligen&#8221; in the &#8216;Search this blog&#8217; function on the front of the website, you&#8217;ll find at least five separate posts that address this experimental drug.)</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Hint&#8230;hint&#8230;the best suggestions I&#8217;ve found are often <a href="http://www.mitosynergy.com/idevaffiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=101_0_3_2" target="_blank"><b>supplements</b></a>!</b></p></blockquote>
<p>Prescription drugs are being used by doctors to treat these types of CFS symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bacterial and viral infections</li>
<li>Depression or moodiness</li>
<li>Anxiety</li>
<li>Pain</li>
<li>Sleepiness</li>
<li>Inflammation</li>
<li>Muscular aches and pains</li>
<li>Blood pressure and blood volume abnormalities</li>
<li>Plus more, such as pure pain management therapies and experimental treatments (See Ampligen above)</li>
</ul>
<p>*Don&#8217;t stop reading&#8211; See the guest blog tips of Robin Thomas below plus 3 of my own BEST SUGGESTIONS*<br />
<span id="more-27006"></span><br />
These are all &#8220;off label&#8221; uses of these drugs, meaning that they were not designed specifically to act on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. They were designed to treat other conditions, but doctors found that, for some people, they can help to alleviate some CFS symptoms. (If you can tolerate all the side effects, they may provide you some relief.) Off-label uses of these drugs also means that your insurance policy may or may not cover the cost of them.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve found that most insurance companies do cover the more traditional drug regimens, but if you want something less mainstream and/or more experimental, you should be prepared to shoulder the financial burden alone!</p></blockquote>
<p>Next in line to consider are single suggestions or a combination of prescription or <strong>OTC (over-the-counter) drugs</strong> that ease symptoms. &#8220;Ease my symptoms?&#8221; you ask. Yes, ease them. (Cure them? Probably not, but you do need relief from the everyday pain and agony of CFS.)</p>
<p>These may include such easily obtained drug store products as Arthritis Strength Acetominophen. It comes in many brands. Or maybe you like the deep heat relief of pain patches found right on your drugstore counter. If you normally use a heating pad, be sure not to use it at the same time as a cream, rub or pain patch. You could get a bad burn!</p>
<p>And last, but not least, there are <strong>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome supplements</strong>. Such products can fill in nutritional gaps that have left the body incapable of functioning well. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><B><font color="2f8c8c">MY BEST SUGGESTION: <a href="http://www.mitosynergy.com/idevaffiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=101_0_3_2" target="_blank">Check out the MITOSYNERGY Line</font color></B></A>. My daily regimen includes taking MitoSynergy. It is fantastic! It helps with boosting my energy, getting rid of fatigue, helping with stamina and lowering my pain levels by reducing inflammation AND&#8230;helps with promoting my mental clarity. No, I&#8217;m not kidding.</p>
<p>You can ask anyone if I regularly endorse products and the answer is &#8220;No.&#8221; With MitoSynergy, I&#8217;m making an exception. Wow, am I officially impressed with this product! I do really well on a regular basis, so for me to notice an improvement is saying something. Check out <a href="http://www.mitosynergy.com/idevaffiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=101_0_3_2" target="_blank"><B>MitoSynergy Today</B></a>.</li>
<li>SECOND SUGGESTION: Research Vitamin D. You&#8217;ll see what I mean when you dig into this topic. Taking an adequate daily amount of Vitamin D seems to be absolutely vital if you want a strong immune system. Whether for you that is 1,000 i.u. a day or much more, you should have your doctor test your blood and see where you are now. The test is a bit pricey, but worth determining your current figure. If you get this right, you immune system could get a nice, stabilizing boost!</li>
<p>But, hold on. There is one more&#8230; .</p>
<li>THIRD SUGGESTION: You need a good multi-vitamin. In the process of deciding what you need to do, don&#8217;t forget to take the standard <i>good health care</i> suggestion&#8211; a good multi-vitamin. But which one do you use? What quality? The truth is many great supplements abound, but I don&#8217;t know of any that have everything in one pill. Plus, not all of them are totally safe or include the exact ingredients listed on the label.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>USA reported in Jan 2012 that the protocols for some companies analyzing and/or manufacturing nutritional products are inaccurate and not scientifically valid.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few days ago, I read about this topic in <a href="http://robinthomas.biz/2012/03/are-your-nutritional-supplements-safe-and-effective/" target="_blank">Robin Thomas&#8217;s newsletter, &#8220;Are Your Nutritional Supplements Safe and Effective?</a> This is good information for your research about nutritional supplements. I&#8217;ve asked Robin Thomas to share some of her best thoughts about supplements for combating fatigue and boosting the immune system:</p>
<p><center><font size="3">Improve Your Immune System and Fight Fatigue</font size></center></p>
<blockquote><p>I am frequently asked about what supplements are useful for building a strong immune system and relieving general fatigue. I first want to emphasize that I am not a medical practitioner and am not licensed to give specific medical advice, but my background in biology and my personal interest leads me to keep up with the current research on nutritional supplements and their role in improving overall health. </p>
<p>There are many reasons for someone to experience an imbalanced immune system and/or chronic fatigue.  It may be triggered by infectious agents, mental or physical stress, nutrient deficiencies, immune system abnormalities, allergies, hormonal abnormalities, heavy metal toxicity and oxidative stress. Recommendations to help relieve some symptoms include ruling out allergenic foods, avoiding food additives, removing sources of toxins (including heavy metals), candida (yeast) overgrowth, viral or bacterial infections, hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, anemia, and impaired adrenal function. Of course, it is always best to work closely with your physician at all times.</p>
<p>Experts in nutritional medicine now frequently recommend adding supplements to a healthy diet to support overall health and alleviate common nutritional deficiencies. Your doctor may want to test you for certain deficiencies that may be   contributing to your specific symptoms. This could help guide your supplement therapy and dosages. Laboratories such as SpectraCell provide comprehensive testing of micronutrient levels, providing you and your physician valuable information as to your specific needs.</p>
<p>That being said, I believe strongly that everyone should be taking a quality multivitamin/mineral supplement.  However, not all supplements are both safe and effective. The FDA has been sending warning letters to supplement companies all across the nation concerning violations of current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs). How will you choose a multivitamin that works? Basically, you should look for third party verifications of safety, purity, efficacy and potency of both raw ingredients and the finished product. Ask your supplement provider if they use Pharmaceutical model Good Manufacturing Practices, and ask them about third party verification of these practices.  </p>
<p>When considering individual supplements, you and your doctor should think about what symptoms impact you most and then look for supplements that help with that symptom. When starting supplements, it&#8217;s important to only start one new one at a time, then wait a week or two before introducing another one. That will give you a chance to see what effect each supplement has on your body. The following are some excellent choices that have the potential to improve both your immune system and energy levels.</p>
<p><b>CoQ10</b></p>
<p>The energy that every cell needs to function is produced through a complex process in the mitochondria, organelles within the cell. When combined with alpha lipoid acid, CoQ10 assists in ATP (energy)production and also helps to regenerate and recycle other antioxidants, including vitamins E and C. CoQ10 is also a powerful antioxidant that helps protect against the damaging effects of free radicals. </p>
<p><b>Vitamin D</b></p>
<p>Low levels of Vitamin D has become wide-spread here in America, and is indicative of many chronic conditions. The only way to determine you are getting enough Vitamin D is with a blood test (as Cinda indicated above), now fairly commonly prescribed by physicians. The normal range of 25 hydroxy vitamin D in the blood should be 30 to 74 ng/mL. Vitamin D is important for our immune system and proper inflammatory response.</p>
<p><b>Fish Oil (Omega-3 Fatty Acids)</b></p>
<p>Studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acids, in the form of fish oil supplements, have great benefits for your overall health, including maintaining a normal, healthy inflammatory response. It is important to ask that your fish oil supplement be produced from cold-water, deep sea fish, and that it be guaranteed free of contaminants such as heavy metals, PCBs, pesticides, and organic residues.</p>
<p><b>Vitamin C/Grapeseed extract</b> </p>
<p>Grape-seed bioflavonoids and vitamin C work together to provide advanced antioxidant protection that supports a healthy immune system. USANA Health Science&#8217;s unique formulation, Proflavanol® C-100, combines the highest quality grape seed extract with USANA&#8217;s proprietary Poly-C, a blend of mineral ascorbates. </p>
<p><b>Supplements for Healthy Digestion</b></p>
<p>Poor digestion leaves the body and the immune system in the same predicament that poor nutrition does – a lack of nutritional factors that support immune functioning and the function of the entire body. This is because a poor functioning digestive system has lost some of the ability to turn what’s consumed into a form the body can use. If we&#8217;re not healthy in our gut, the probability of health issues throughout our body increases.</p>
<p>Digestive Enzymes- enzyme supplements are especially important as we age and our natural enzymes decrease. Probiotics- probiotic dietary supplements replenish beneficial microflora, which are vital to the proper development of the immune system. </p>
<p>Dietary supplements generally are better tolerated and have fewer risks than prescription medications, but it is always prudent to pay careful attention to the quality of individual supplements as you would any drug. Just because a product is natural doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s safe and won&#8217;t interact with other supplements or medications. You should talk to your doctor and pharmacist about what you&#8217;re taking, the dosages, and potential interactions. If you have sensitivities to any foods,  you need to be aware of what inert ingredients are in the supplements you take. Again, it is best to purchase supplements that have a written guarantee of potency and purity. You and your doctor will then be able to determine the supplements that will work best for you. </p>

<p><a href="http://healthmattershow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Foods.jpg"><img src="http://healthmattershow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Foods.jpg" alt="" title="Foods" width="180" height="121" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-27023" /></a>Based on all we know today, a <b>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome diet</b> needs to go against the grain of what is trendy or what other people eat everyday. Considerations such as the nature of the food itself, what it contains, how it will affect your body, what dietary need is it fulfilling and does it help or hinder your symptoms.</p>
<p>When you are very symptomatic with <b>CFS symptoms</b>, consistently eating the right foods will help to give your body a chance to recover. (See below for suggestions.)</p>
<p>Gorge with the wrong ones and you&#8217;re setting yourself up for more challenge than your body can handle right now. What are some of the wrong food substances?<br />
<span id="more-27008"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Sugar, white bread, regular pasta, potatoes and white rice</li>
<blockquote><p>Sugar has been a culprit from day one. It causes inflammation in the body. You don&#8217;t need anything else inflamed! Plus, sugar can be a big source of empty calories. White bread, pasta, potatoes and white rice can be converted to sugar in the gut rather quickly. That means these sugary foods could be detrimental to your weight and your organs that are trying to keep you healthy, moving forward and recovering.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-57407294/is-sugar-toxic/" target="_blank">Is Sugar Toxic</a> by CBS News for more of the negative ramifications of including sugar in your diet. New research is indicating that sugar &#8220;is&#8221; one of the most dangerous substances you can consume. It even promotes cell growth in cancers!</p></blockquote>
<li>Lots of heavy meats that are hard to digest</li>
<blockquote><p>When I was in my sickest, weakest state and expressing lots of CFS symptoms, I had to cut back on heavy, dense meats like beef steak. Attempting to eat it would bring on overwhelming exhaustion. My jaws even got tired from the act of chewing! Think of it this way, if you need your energy to recover, eating should not divert your body&#8217;s attention away from what it needs to do any longer than necessary. Eating a lot of dense meat only exasperates your energy situation. They are hard to digest and require a lot of your body&#8217;s energy. Plus, many meats are loaded with antibiotics, steroids and ingredients for taste that can be harmful. Choose your meat protein carefully.</p>
<p>Suggestion: lower the amount of tough meats you eat and concentrate on consuming other sources for your protein intake, such as eggs, cheese, and a few nuts per day. (I never suggest soy because I believe it to be too controversial a food product, but some people think it does more good than harm.) If you want some beef in your diet, consider getting some good quality, grass-fed beef (without hormones or steroids) and make a hearty vegetable soup with small chunks of beef included for taste. Or use ground beef and ground turkey for a nice meatloaf or meat balls. By eating the ground up meat version, at least you won&#8217;t be chewing until next Sunday before you can swallow it!</p>
<p>Suggestion: Concentrate on chicken, turkey, fish (not those with high concentrations of mercury), lean meats as discussed above, plus you can add <em>the white meat</em>, pork, if it works alright with your body (some people can&#8217;t tolerate pork), walnuts (or some similar nut that helps in regulating cholesterol) and add some dry beans into your diet. A bean soup can be delicious, hearty and healthy.</p></blockquote>
<li>Foods loaded with fats.</li>
<blockquote><p>Harmful fat sources might include bacon, cream sauces and hidden fats. Remember to read your labels. Most doctors and nutritionists recommend you consume a portion of &#8220;good fats&#8221; everyday, fats such as olive oil.</p></blockquote>
<li>Foods loaded with aspartame, MSG (monosodium glutamate), preservatives and food colorings</li>
<blockquote><p>Stay away from aspartame. Period. It is so dangerous to a healthy body, much less yours that is struggling every single day. That means you read the label on every drink and food product before drinking or eating. MSG, preservatives and food colorings are adding insults to your immune and digestive system. They are not natural foods and they can produce negative results such as food allergies and food sensitivities. Remember, the purer sources of food (what you put in your body), the better!</p></blockquote>
<li>Drinks/ foods containing caffeine or alcohol.</li>
<blockquote><p>Most people who are severely sick cannot tolerate alcohol at all. Take that as a clear warning. As for caffeine drinks, especially beware of these new energy concoctions like &#8220;5 Hour Energy&#8221; and the like.</p>
<p>Foods containing caffeine, like iced tea, may not seem so off the wall, however too much caffeine consumption from any source can cause problems. If you drink them, you&#8217;re artificially stimulating your body while setting yourself up for the inevitable crash afterwards. And we know horrible your crashes are, right? Any energy expenditure needs to be more balanced than that. What you eat and drink can help or hinder you. Having too many up and down, violent shifts can actually damage your ability to maintain a steady energy warehouse. Think&#8230;less stress on your system. Be sure to consume beverages that support you such as drinking lots plenty of fresh, clean water each day. Also see a previous post on &#8220;<a href="http://healthmattershow.com/fatigue-pacing-and-living-with-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/" target="_blank">the energy envelope theory</a>&#8221; by Dr. Charles Lapp for a novel approach to your daily energy management needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember to actively keep your CFS symptoms at bay by carefully monitoring what you eat and drink!</p>
<p>Thank you so much. The title of tomorrow&#8217;s post is &#8220;Treating CFS Using Drugs and Supplements&#8221;. Feel free to share all of this information with others. This is a week-long series on <a href="http://healthmattershow.com/treating-chronic-fatigue-syndrome/" target="_blank">Treating Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</a>. It will end this Friday, April 6th with the conclusion on the <b>Health Matters Show</b> blog and podcast.</p>

<p><a href="http://healthmattershow.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cinda-head-shot-small-lookingright.jpg"><img src="http://healthmattershow.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/cinda-head-shot-small-lookingright.jpg" alt="" title="Cinda Crawford" width="191" height="225" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-653" /></a>Anyone who is sick with <b>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</b> (or ME) wants to know the best methods for <b>treating</b> it. There is no exact science. Is there a drug that will cure CFS? Most everyone <i>assumes</i> the cure will come as a drug because CFS is such a horrible physical ailment. The answer surely will be biologically based, right? Not necessarily.</p>
<p>Is there something else that works better in helping a person heal from CFS? At this point in time, I believe the answer is that something else does work very well. (More on the specifics later.)</p>
<p>No &#8220;curative&#8221; drug for treating Chronic Fatigue Syndrome exists, although research is ongoing and more drugs are in the pipeline. Some current drugs help to relieve symptoms. That&#8217;s a far cry from healing the condition as a whole. Plus, you must continue taking the drug indefinitely to keep getting <i>any</i> relief of your symptoms!</p>
<p>To give every area of this huge topic its dues and a fair shake in our analysis, let&#8217;s open up the door and consider all your possible treatment options. There are quite a few. They can help some people with symptom reduction. However, again, I find little to help you really heal and get well, closer to that 100% mark. So, next week I&#8217;ll be addressing these options, one by one, concluding Friday in a big presentation for the <b>Health Matters Show</b> that summarizes this huge topic and let&#8217;s you in on what I believe works for a lot of people.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re looking for the best answers for getting well&#8211; really well because you&#8217;re sick and tired of being sick and tired&#8211; I have information for you. That&#8217;s because I not only suffered with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for fifteen years and struggled in getting it treated adequately, but, I got well and am now helping people heal from CFS every day!</p></blockquote>
<p>Today I share some of that info on the Health Matters Show podcast, with a bit of the audio file where Dr. Deirdre Rawlings interviewed me about how I got well:<br />

<blockquote><p><b><font color="2f8c8c">After I got better, I began to develop my own theories about what works and what doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll share many of them with you next week. Stay tuned!</font color></b></p></blockquote>
<p><center>SO WHAT ARE THE MORE COMMON TREATMENT OPTIONS?</CENTER></p>
<ul>
<li>Prescription drugs (and OTC preparations)</li>
<li>Nutritional supplements including multi-vitamins</li>
<li>Adjusting your Diet</li>
<li>Lifestyle changes- Which ones should you make? Which ones may be&#8230;dangerous?</li>
<li>Cognitive behavior therapy- What is it? Does it work for everyone?</li>
<li>Other Complementary or Alternative health and healing protocols, such as Sacred Cellular Healing</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not have all the answers. So that this can be a gathering spot for all kinds of good info, I encourage you to leave your comments here for others to see. What you know could be of value to someone else for treating Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Maybe even the missing part to their puzzle!</p>
