<p>It has been very rewarding for me to able to help others find the clarity that they need to move forward in life. I always acknowledge anyone who has the courage to put their lives into inquiry. It can be a tough and daunting task and I can attest to that from my own experience. During the mid nineties, I was becoming increasingly frustrated with where I was at in life. Although I was gainfully employed as a Construction Administrator at the time, I had hit a wall in my development. I knew that I could be doing better, but, I had no idea why I was stopped or what I needed to be doing. I began to participate in self development programs to find the answers. A dream of mine was to one day own and operate my own business, but I didn’t know what I wanted to do or if I had the ability to do so. While participating in self development seminars, I was approached about assisting in future seminars as a coach. My job would be to work with five participants who were looking to take their lives to the next level. I accepted the challenge and began working with them on dealing with whatever fears, challenges, insights or roadblocks that were coming up. Upon completion of the seminar, I was being acknowledged for the profound impact that I had in their lives. What I discovered in doing this was that I had the leadership skills necessary to help others deal with the struggles associated with transition. What followed was my being asked to Head Coach the next seminar which meant that I was not only coaching participants but the other coaches as well. Again, I did well in doing something that came natural to me. Shortly thereafter, I found out that people were getting paid to do what I was doing for free. Just like that, my professional coaching career was born. Now that I had a business, I would have to build it. Although, I had twenty years of experience being an employee, what I soon discovered was that I had no idea how to build a business. As an employee you’re given a task, you complete it and get another. As a business owner, you need to be generating 100% from scratch. Now I had to learn how to generate a business. In doing this, I came to face to face with everything that has stopped me in past, ignorance, fear and a lack of confidence. As I dealt with each of these issues, I began to think about how many other people are in the same position and could use help to overcome their obstacles and reach powerful new levels. So based on this that<a href="http://www.EmpoweredClarity.com" target="_blank"> Empowered Clarity Coaching</a> was born whose primary purpose is to make it’s clients “Unstuck, Unafraid and Unstoppable”.</p>

<p>Karin Vibe-Rheymer-Stewart, Ph.D., Founder and President of Daily Mastery, the premier peaceful productivity company, is a personal and small business expert specializing in helping people be peacefully productive. After earning a Ph.D. in Communication Systems at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, consistently recognized as one of the top three engineering schools in Europe, Karin left academia to work in corporate America in positions of increasing responsibility. Acutely aware of the profoundly negative effects of poor time management on workers and the work-life balance issues encountered by many, Karin founded Daily Mastery in 2003, providing much needed relief to a growing number of satisfied and now peacefully productive professionals. Her personal experience as a successful business owner juggling work and family life led Karin to develop simple techniques, breakthrough behavior modification tools and effective strategies that her clients use with great success, resulting in optimal productivity and rewarding work-life balance. Working both in person and by phone, Karin’s clientele of executives, small business owners, mothers and corporate clients spans the globe.</p>

<p><img src="http://yaktivate.s3.amazonaws.com/homebusinesssucccessradio/images/EdAbel.jpg" alt="" hspace="5" align="right" />Ed Abel has invested more than three decades learning how to build a successful, thriving business. <span id="more-186"></span>At age 24 with a $5,000 loan and the energy and passion of a young entrepreneur, Ed was ready to take on the world. And he did, only to emerge seven years later at the top of a $36 million organization with 585 employees. Inspired by the challenges that led him to success, Ed went on to build other multi-million dollar businesses, yet he missed the passion he experienced “in the trenches” of his formative years.</p>
<p>Determined to find a way to educate and advise others in the construction and sustainability of a vital business, he founded ABEL Business Institute. Over the course of this process, he began developing a systematic approach to the construction, maintenance, and growth of businesses—an approach that has become the philosophy and methodology of ABEL Business Institute. Ed went on to create and direct the SkillPreneur Business Alliance (SBA)—an innovative organization that helps business owners achieve success in an environment where camaraderie exists, information flows, knowledge is shared, purpose is achieved, and everyone walks out feeling like part of a larger community. The SkillPreneur Business Alliance (SBA) brings this same opportunity to small business owners everywhere—promoting a refreshing, communal alternative for sharing ideas, exchanging advice and being accountable to a group of non-competing peers. It is one of the most powerful business strategies to emerge in decades.</p>
<p>Ed is an adjunct professor of entrepreneurial studies at New York University (NYU) as well as the Director of the business division at the world class Institute for Professional Excellence in Coaching (iPEC). At iPEC, Ed directs the business division that is responsible for supporting the graduate coaches in their business development process.</p>
<p>Ed lives in New York City, where he is an avid participant in different Volleyball leagues as well as a student in boxing. He also has a huge collection of Napoleon Hill original writings.</p>

<p><img src="http://yaktivate.s3.amazonaws.com/homebusinesssucccessradio/images/m_goldfarb.jpg" alt="" hspace="5" align="right" />Matthew Goldfarb, founder and owner of Corporate Renegade Copy, is a copywriter who specializes in copy and content creation for small businesses, entrepreneurs, and people who have recently left corporate America to start their own businesses. Matthew helps companies create language and copy to help them stand out from the competition. Matthew will be talking about the difference between good and bad copy, the importance of why the words you use are important, and provide some success stories about some of his clients. <span id="more-168"></span>Matthew graduated with honors from Lehigh University with a B.A. in Psychology, and a minor in English. Shortly after graduating school he began work as a copywriter for Euro RSCG MVMBS where as a freelancer he helped create the Mr. T. campaign for 1-800-Collect. Since then, he has worked on some of the world’s largest brands including Volvo, Subaru, Viagra, American Express, and Dove. With experience in every realm of advertising and copy communications, he’s created award-winning television and print ads, crafted e-mail and banner campaigns, written websites, brochures, and helped launch new brands.</p>
<p>In 2009, Matthew launched Corporate Renegade Copy with the mission of bringing professional quality copywriting to smaller businesses, without the large agency costs. Matthew believes that the best copy is the result of a healthy relationship between client and writer, and that mutual respect and open communication is the best way to create content that is powerful and moves customers to act.<br />
