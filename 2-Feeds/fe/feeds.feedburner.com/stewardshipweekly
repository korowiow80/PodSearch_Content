When the government forces us to pay taxes, it's a form of giving that's involuntary.

When you file your annual income tax report and calculate how much you owe, it's a form of involuntary giving.

Because it's forced upon us, the emotion associated with involuntary giving is bitterness and resentment. Now consider what happens when we want to give.

The pleasure received watching a loved one open a gift from us and screech with delight is hard to beat. Watching their face break into a huge smile is worth every penny you paid for the gift.

Think back to the last time you went out to a restaurant with others and picked up the tab. It made you feel good. You held your head a little higher when you left. Why?

Because you wanted to give your money away! It was completely voluntary.

When we're forced to give, we do it grudgingly.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>This episode looks at making the <strong>right decision</strong>, at the <strong>right time</strong>, in whatever situation God has placed us.</p>
<p>I’ve just enjoyed going through the <strong>Book of Esther</strong> and again being overwhelmed at what one person can accomplish in difficult times. There are seasons when life seems to be on ‘auto-pilot’ and you feel like you’re just going along for the ride with absolutely no control. This account of Esther’s life is a celebration of victory over such times! Against a powerful foe, she accepted her role as Steward of the Jewish people and prevailed to save them from destruction.</p>
<p>Here’s a recap of the story;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Esther-crown.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1625" title="Esther crown" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Esther-crown.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="183" /></a><strong>King Ahasuerus</strong> is having a party with all his buddies. There’s lots of food, wine and dancing women.<br />
At one point near the end of the 180 day celebration, he thinks he’d like to show off his <strong>beautiful wife Vashti.</strong></p>
<p>But there’s a problem. She too has been hosting a party and when her husband, King Ahasuerus, calls for her &#8211; <strong>she snubs him!</strong> At this shocking defiance, the King and his buddies start deliberating back and forth with one another trying to decide how to handle the awkward predicament.</p>
<p>Their greatest concern is that word of Vashti’s disrespect will get out (maybe on FaceBook or Twitter) and women everywhere will stand in defiance against their husbands. They’ll start to say;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="color: #a88105;">If queen Vashti denied King Ahasuerus &#8211; then I can deny you!</span></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Their answer is to take Vashti’s crown and make another woman the Queen. But before this can happen, a nation-wide search must be conducted. The King agrees with his wise men that a beauty contest should be held with only the most desirable young virgins in all the country in attendance.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Esther was selected for this pageant by the King&#8217;s officers. She was meticulous prepared and then ultimately won the heart of the King.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="color: #a88105;">Esther 2:17 &#8211; The king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins; so he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.</span></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The story continues and we read that the pompous and arrogant Haman devised a plan to attack and wipe out all the Jews in the kingdom. But there’s a problem with his plan &#8211; Esther is a Jew.</p>
<p>God, who is all knowing and in complete control, has allowed certain events to transpire leading up to this point. Other than the King’s own wise men, there’s only one other person who could influence the King&#8217;s decisions &#8211; the Queen. And Esther is the one in that role.</p>
<p><strong>Now I’m just speculating here</strong>, but likely up to this point, Esther has felt that her life was being written for her without her consensus or approval. She had been selected as a candidate, prepared by the King’s staff, presented to King Ahasuerus and made his Queen.</p>
<p>What good could she be to anyone except to support the King in his role? As she was about to realize &#8211; Lots.</p>
<p>In the words of her uncle Mordecai;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="color: #a88105;">Esther 4:14 &#8211; &#8220;For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but your father&#8217;s house will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?&#8221;</span></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Esther had a choice. She could realize that God had purposely put her in this position to act as a <strong>Steward of his chosen people &#8211; the Jews</strong>, or she could dissolve into her new role as Queen and watch as God used some other means to protect His people.<br />

I’ve just enjoyed going through the Book of Esther and again being overwhelmed at what one person can accomplish in difficult times. There are seasons when life seems to be on ‘auto-pilot’ and you feel like you’re just going along for the ride with absolutely no control. This account of Esther’s life is a celebration of victory over such times!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>This past Saturday evening, I had the great privilege of being the <strong>guest speaker at a College &amp; Careers group</strong> hosted by friends of ours &#8211; <strong>Peter &amp; Beth Bolton</strong>. Each weekend, they open up their house and welcome an eager group of young Christians into their living room, kitchen and lives. This week, by the time the main meal was done and the dessert was being devoured, a head count was taken and the quick tally was <strong>42 people</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_1564" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 180px">
	<img class=" wp-image-1564     " style="margin: 0px;" title="White MacBook" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/IMG_0807-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="240" />
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Don&#39;t covet my White MacBook!</p>
</div>
<p>After some brief introductions, I started the evening by sharing a personal story;</p>
<p>When I was in high school, a friend of mine and I had applied for our very first <strong>credit cards</strong>. We were both approved and, day after day, we anxiously awaited our new plastic credit cards to arrive in the mail. We were all packed up and ready to head out on a road trip to New York City but we hadn&#8217;t saved any money for the adventure and desperately needed those cards!</p>
<p>Not wanting to forfeit our exciting journey, we got up early on the day we were to leave and headed on over to the postal station to sit on the loading dock. When the morning shift showed up, we pleaded our pathetic case and a search was made to find the precious envelopes and retrieve them from the bundles earmarked for each of our respective neighbourhoods. When they were handed to us, we tore into them and grinned with excitement. Look out NYC &#8211; here we come!</p>
<p>Our story goes on to explain how <strong>we foolishly charged absolutely everything we could to Mastercard</strong>. The credit cards were our new best friends although they suffered some heavy abuse that first weekend we used them. Gas for the car, fast food, souvenir T-shirts &amp; more fast food. We charged everything.</p>
<p>That 5 day adventure actually lasted about 4 months because &#8211; as best as I can recall &#8211; that&#8217;s how long it took to finally pay off the outstanding balance. <strong>My first experience with a credit card taught me some valuable lessons;</strong></p>
<p>Even though you might regret making unnecessary purchases with your Visa or Mastercard, the statement <strong>WILL</strong> show up each month in the mail. The financial institution <strong>WILL</strong> add interest to the charges. And, they <strong>WILL</strong> demand another payment.</p>
<p>My thoughts for this episode of the Stewardship Weekly podcast are what I shared with the young adults who heard that NYC story.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #a98918;"><strong>Galations 3:23-26</strong>; But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">That passage says that the law was our &#8216;<strong>tutor</strong>&#8216;. Some translations use the word &#8216;<strong>schoolmaster</strong>&#8216; instead. The law acts as a mirror to reveal to us our sinful nature and our need of a Saviour. If you’re going to try to obey every law ever laid down by God &#8211; good luck! It can’t be done!</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #a98918;"><strong>1 Timothy 2:5</strong> &#8211; For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Even though Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and men, to the unbeliever, a system of <strong>good vs. bad</strong> is what they believe will be used as the final judgement. When asked what standard God uses to determine good &amp; bad, the typical response is the 10 commandments.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I sincerely believe that Satan is doing everything he can to downplay each of the 10 commandments</strong></span>. If he can dilute the effect that each point has on the mind and conscience of the unbeliever who is lost in their sins, the need for a Saviour is eliminated.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to see how the world has turned murder, lying, adultery and theft into entertainment. Just watch almost any TV show, movie or reality series. For the purpose of this episode, I focused on commandment #10.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #a98918;"><strong>Exodus 20:17</strong> - You shall not covet your neighbor&#8217;s house; you shall not covet your neighbor&#8217;s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor&#8217;s.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s likely been awhile since you looked over the fence at your neighbours place and exclaimed “<em>That’s a nice donkey! I wish it was mine!</em>&#8220;. That doesn&#8217;t happen but we do have the tendency to covet other people’s stuff. &#8220;<strong>I want it</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p>I am proposing that Satan’s tool to manipulate that verse is quick and easy credit. More specifically &#8211; the credit card.</p>
<p><strong>We can’t covet something if we just raced out and bought it</strong>. Credit cards give us instant gratification. Credit cards enable us to quench the impulse urges within us. They also give us a false sense of contentment.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #a98918;"><strong>Philippians 4:11,12</strong>; Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content: I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>The bottom line is that Jesus Christ wants us to be content in Him! He wants us to be content with what He has already graciously given us.</p>
<p><strong>Credit cards</strong> are not evil. They are morally neutral &#8211; but they <strong>can easily become a substitute for faith and trusting in Christ if we use them to sedate our coveting hearts.</strong></p>

		<itunes:summary>This past Saturday evening, I had the great privilege of being the guest speaker at a College &amp; Careers group hosted by friends of ours - Peter &amp; Beth Bolton. Each weekend, they open up their house and welcome an eager group of young Christians into their living room, kitchen and lives. This week, by the time the main meal was done and the dessert was being devoured, a head count was taken and the quick tally was 42 people.



After some brief introductions, I started the evening by sharing a personal story;

When I was in high school, a friend of mine and I had applied for our very first credit cards. We were both approved and, day after day, we anxiously awaited our new plastic credit cards to arrive in the mail. We were all packed up and ready to head out on a road trip to New York City but we hadn't saved any money for the adventure and desperately needed those cards!

Not wanting to forfeit our exciting journey, we got up early on the day we were to leave and headed on over to the postal station to sit on the loading dock. When the morning shift showed up, we pleaded our pathetic case and a search was made to find the precious envelopes and retrieve them from the bundles earmarked for each of our respective neighbourhoods. When they were handed to us, we tore into them and grinned with excitement. Look out NYC - here we come!

Our story goes on to explain how we foolishly charged absolutely everything we could to Mastercard. The credit cards were our new best friends although they suffered some heavy abuse that first weekend we used them. Gas for the car, fast food, souvenir T-shirts &amp; more fast food. We charged everything.

That 5 day adventure actually lasted about 4 months because - as best as I can recall - that's how long it took to finally pay off the outstanding balance. My first experience with a credit card taught me some valuable lessons;

Even though you might regret making unnecessary purchases with your Visa or Mastercard, the statement WILL show up each month in the mail. The financial institution WILL add interest to the charges. And, they WILL demand another payment.

My thoughts for this episode of the Stewardship Weekly podcast are what I shared with the young adults who heard that NYC story.
Galations 3:23-26; But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor. For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
That passage says that the law was our 'tutor'. Some translations use the word 'schoolmaster' instead. The law acts as a mirror to reveal to us our sinful nature and our need of a Saviour. If you’re going to try to obey every law ever laid down by God - good luck! It can’t be done!
1 Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.
Even though Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and men, to the unbeliever, a system of good vs. bad is what they believe will be used as the final judgement. When asked what standard God uses to determine good &amp; bad, the typical response is the 10 commandments.

I sincerely believe that Satan is doing everything he can to downplay each of the 10 commandments. If he can dilute the effect that each point has on the mind and conscience of the unbeliever who is lost in their sins, the need for a Saviour is eliminated.

It's pretty easy to see how the world has turned murder, lying, adultery and theft into entertainment. Just watch almost any TV show, movie or reality series. For the purpose of this episode, I focused on commandment #10.
Exodus 20:17 - You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><h3><strong>I&#8217;d like to welcome you to Stewardship Weekly!</strong></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;ve landed here from either <strong>Jon White</strong>&#8216;s or <strong>Matt &amp; Janelle Wegner</strong>&#8216;s podcasts &#8211; <strong>WELCOME!</strong></p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1514" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 20px;" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Jon-White.jpg" alt="" width="158" height="158" />Last week I was a guest on <strong>JW&#8217;$ Financial Coaching</strong> podcast.</p>
<p>Jon asked me to explain to his listening audience a <strong>Definition of Stewardship</strong>. We then discussed whether or not stewardship refers only to money. One of the subjects that came up in our conversation was if there is any perceivable difference in the way Christians handle their money from that of our non-believing counterparts.</p>
<p>Jon then inquired as to how I became so passionate about teaching these stewardship principals, followed by asking what I&#8217;ve learned from having guests on my podcast share their stories.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also had a recent surge of visitors coming from the <strong>Living in Financial Excellence</strong> podcast. The host of that show, <strong>Matt Wegner</strong>, has just announced that he&#8217;s accepted a new career offer and will be moving soon. With everything going on in his life, he recorded his final episode and &#8211; in that show &#8211; made mention of some of his podcasting friends. Matt told his audience about Stewardship Weekly and gave his endorsement. I&#8217;ll miss hearing Matt share their life stories and I know God will be with them on this new journey.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>What Did Abby Eat?</h2>
<p>As the title of this episode tells us, Abby (our 2 year old chocolate lab &amp; Chesapeake Bay retriever mix) ate Tim&#8217;s birthday gift. More than just a personal family story, you&#8217;ll hear how love, compassion, giving and stewardship all tied together when it mattered most.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Too Good To Be True (article)</h2>
<p>Let’s suppose for a moment that I walk up to you and hand you $100 in a combination of small bills.  I also give you some simple instructions; give $10 to the man who picks up the children each week for the kids club so he can buy gas for his van.  As well, give a $5 bus pass to the lady we see standing at the stop each Sunday as we pull into the church parking lot.  Now, keep the rest for yourself to enjoy and use for your family.</p>
<h3>Good deal isn’t it?</h3>
<p>Two more weeks goes by, and I walk up to you and hand you another $100. Just like last time, I give you some simple instructions as to how I would like the money disbursed.  Once again, a small portion is given away to others and you get to keep the majority of it for yourself.</p>
<p>At this point, you’re probably thinking - <strong>keep it up, let’s do it again sometime soon!</strong></p>
<p>If we were to repeat this exercise over and over again &#8211; how many times would it work out in your favor?  Every time!  No matter how often I handed you the money, or who the different people were that I asked you to give it to, you would always come out ahead.</p>
<p>I think you know where I’m going with this.</p>
<p>Faithfully, week after week, the Lord provides income for us and simply asks that we disperse some of it back to His work.  Why is it then, that sometimes we hesitate and contemplate using all of it for our own needs instead of generously giving it away as we should?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span style="color: #a98918;">1st John 3:17 - </span></strong><span style="color: #a98918;">But whoever has this world&#8217;s goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?</span></p></blockquote>
<h3>I’ll do my giving later&#8230;</h3>
<p>It’s much easier to follow the instructions and make the disbursements immediately upon receiving the money, than to hold it and try to give it away at a later date.  Why is that?  When you first receive the money, you realize that it was a gift to you and subsequently, you have no problem following the instructions.  When you hold it in your wallet for a while, it starts to feel like it’s yours and it’s not so easy to give away.  The same is true with our paycheques.  If we diligently allocate the firstfruits to the Lord each week, and immediately give it to Him instead of incorporating all of our income into our budget, it’s much easier to follow through.</p>
<p>Just like so many other things in our financial lives, <strong>it all comes back to recognizing proper ownership</strong>. When we have the attitude that it all belongs to us &#8211; we hold on tightly. But when we recognize that it comes from our Father above and that we are called to be Money Managers for Our Master, it is with joyful hearts that we give it away. There truly is a joy to be had in seeing the Lord’s work carried out knowing that you were a part of the disbursement of the funds.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><h3>&#8216;Let&#8217;s Be Honest&#8217; &#8211; A look at doing business in cash, declaring all income to the government &amp; treating others fairly.</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1465" title="just weights" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/just-weights.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="203" />Today&#8217;s episode takes us back into the book of Proverbs. Numerous times in the writings of King Solomon we hear warnings against being deceitful and cheating people.</p>
<p>Chapter 11 starts off with this powerful verse;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #a98918;">Dishonest scales are an abomination to the Lord, but a just weight is His delight</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Then in chapter 13:11 we read a companion verse;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #a98918;">wealth gained by dishonesty will be diminished, but he who gathers by labor will increase</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Together, these 2 verses, along with numerous others found in Proverbs, call us to be upright and honourable in how we conduct ourselves in business &#8211; and I believe, in our dealings with the government as well.</p>
<p>Although the world economy seems to have improved slightly since the recession of 2008, there is still a fair amount of uncertainty in people’s minds. The housing markets are still shaky, employees are worried about job security and saving for retirement and most households have quite a bit of debt hanging over their heads.</p>
<p>With these unknown variables hanging over our heads, it’s easy to want to look for the short cuts &#8211; ways to make and/or hide a few extra bucks. But times have not changed from over 2000 years ago!</p>
<p>When we look at the verses in Proverbs for today’s thoughts, we have teaching from Solomon as to what it is that pleases the Lord. “<strong>a just weight is His delight</strong>”.</p>
<h3>Think about it;</h3>
<p>You do nice things that you know will bring a smile to your spouses’ face (flowers, a surprise dinner date, loading the dishwasher without being asked). You also know some of the things that bring delight to your children and your closest friends.</p>
<p><strong>What pleases the Lord? </strong>We don&#8217;t have to guess! Here it is &#8211; laid out for us in black &amp; white one of the many things that brings delight to the Lord &#8211; a just weight!</p>
<h3>What is a dishonest weight?</h3>
<p>There is a standard set of weight and measures used in open air market trading (refer to the image above). Small weights would be hidden on the underside of the plate to make the one side heavier in favour of the merchant. The purchaser would have to add more to their side to make things balance.</p>
<p>Although we use currency backed by the governments of our countries, it’s really not so different today and that’s why this proverb is so practical. It’s simply talking about honesty in business and personal transactions.</p>
<p><strong>How great is that!</strong> God allows us to please Him in even the little things of life. Anyone, regardless of age, can do what is right when it comes to dealing with other people and money.</p>
<p>What if we’ve already cheated someone? Is it too late? No. Make the effort (humbling and embarrassing as it might be), go back and make it right!</p>
<p>Really? How about I just repent and move on?</p>
<p>And miss bringing joy to God’s heart?!?</p>
<p>No thanks. It’s better to make it right!</p>

<p>Zacchaeus had lots of wealth that was gained by dishonesty. It pleased God&#8217;s heart when the corrective actions were taken. Look at Christ’s response!</p>
<p>As a second example of this principal in practice &#8211; go watch the movie &#8220;<a title="Watch trailer on YouTube" href="http://youtu.be/jG68TDaM8js" target="_blank">Flywheel</a>&#8221; that was produced by Sherwood Pictures.</p>
<p>When we ponder these thoughts on just weights and being honest with our money, it helps to look at the account of a young man who didn&#8217;t do things for the right reasons;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #a98918;"><strong>2 Chronicles 25:1,2</strong>: Amaziah <em>was</em> twenty-five years old <em>when</em> he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name <em>was</em>Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.<sup>2 </sup>And he did <em>what was</em> right in the sight of the Lord, but not with a loyal heart.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Do what is right. Do that which you know is honourable. Rely on the Holy Spirit for guidance.</p>
<p>Delight the Lord with a loyal heart!<br />

		<itunes:summary>'Let's Be Honest' - A look at doing business in cash, declaring all income to the government &amp; treating others fairly.
Today's episode takes us back into the book of Proverbs. Numerous times in the writings of King Solomon we hear warnings against being deceitful and cheating people.

Chapter 11 starts off with this powerful verse;
Dishonest scales are an abomination to the Lord, but a just weight is His delight
Then in chapter 13:11 we read a companion verse;
wealth gained by dishonesty will be diminished, but he who gathers by labor will increase
Together, these 2 verses, along with numerous others found in Proverbs, call us to be upright and honourable in how we conduct ourselves in business - and I believe, in our dealings with the government as well.

Although the world economy seems to have improved slightly since the recession of 2008, there is still a fair amount of uncertainty in people’s minds. The housing markets are still shaky, employees are worried about job security and saving for retirement and most households have quite a bit of debt hanging over their heads.

With these unknown variables hanging over our heads, it’s easy to want to look for the short cuts - ways to make and/or hide a few extra bucks. But times have not changed from over 2000 years ago!

When we look at the verses in Proverbs for today’s thoughts, we have teaching from Solomon as to what it is that pleases the Lord. “a just weight is His delight”.
Think about it;
You do nice things that you know will bring a smile to your spouses’ face (flowers, a surprise dinner date, loading the dishwasher without being asked). You also know some of the things that bring delight to your children and your closest friends.

What pleases the Lord? We don't have to guess! Here it is - laid out for us in black &amp; white one of the many things that brings delight to the Lord - a just weight!
What is a dishonest weight?
There is a standard set of weight and measures used in open air market trading (refer to the image above). Small weights would be hidden on the underside of the plate to make the one side heavier in favour of the merchant. The purchaser would have to add more to their side to make things balance.

Although we use currency backed by the governments of our countries, it’s really not so different today and that’s why this proverb is so practical. It’s simply talking about honesty in business and personal transactions.

How great is that! God allows us to please Him in even the little things of life. Anyone, regardless of age, can do what is right when it comes to dealing with other people and money.

What if we’ve already cheated someone? Is it too late? No. Make the effort (humbling and embarrassing as it might be), go back and make it right!

Really? How about I just repent and move on?

And miss bringing joy to God’s heart?!?

No thanks. It’s better to make it right!


Luke 19:1-10 (NIV) - Zacchaeus the Tax Collector



 1 Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through. 2 A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. 3 He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over the crowd. 4 So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way. 5 When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.” 6 So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.

7 All the people saw this and began to mutter, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.”

8 But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.”

9 Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham. 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p><img class="alignleft" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 20px;" title="open communication" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Couple-Talking.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" />When it comes to money, <strong>rarely are two people perfectly aligned and on the same page</strong>. The husband may be the spender while the wife is the saver. He thinks 1 bank account will suffice and she thinks having 2 separate accounts may be the route to go. A pile of statements and invoices sits on the corner of the dining room table, and a frustrating (and possibly heated) budget meeting is pending. The lines are being drawn and negotiation strategies are being formed. <strong>Welcome to Married Life Finance &#8211; 101.</strong><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #cca333;"><strong>Who is to blame?</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong></strong>In most situations, no one really. <strong>Probably the biggest struggle for married couples when it comes to money is having different perceptions</strong>.  We each have different upbringings and have had different experiences with money growing up.  My dad passed away when I was only 11 years old and so my mom had the challenge of raising 3 kids on her own with a very limited income.  My wife Elaine on the other hand, was brought up in a home where her dad made good money and was able to take the family of 7 on annual trips that I couldn&#8217;t even dream of as a child.  When we started courting, I was working full time for one of the big Canadian banks and had a great income for my age.  Elaine was still in university and living at home with both a minimal income and only tuition expenses to handle.</p>
<p>When we were married, as with everyone else who says &#8220;I do&#8221; at the front of the church, there was no guarantee that we would immediately begin to think alike in regards to our finances.  <strong>It takes time and openness to understand one another </strong>and learn to appreciate where each other are coming from.  Initially, because of my mom&#8217;s situation, I was extremely tight with the money and pushed hard for us to save up a downpayment on a house and then pay the mortgage off in 10 years.  Now, years later, after having constrained our family to a tight budget, I&#8217;m learning to listen to my wife when she says that the ropes need to be loosened a little.</p>
<p><strong>Am I in the wrong?  Is she in the wrong?</strong> Whenever married couples are facing situations like these where a difference in opinion exists &#8211; it&#8217;s not the time to get frustrated and start making accusations.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #cca333;"><strong>What is the root problem?</strong></span></h3>
<p>Things aren&#8217;t always what they seem.  A spouse who balances the budget down to the last penny each month may be doing so completely out of love for his or her family.  They see their extreme planning as having the foresight to anticipate upcoming expenses and ensure that there is always money available.  While they are scrutinizing each column in the complicated spreadsheet, they believe their actions will be interpreted as an act of service and care by their spouse.  What can (and often does) occur is that their behaviour is perceived as being domineering and controlling.  This misunderstanding permeates through the relationship and can cause hurt feelings and a sense of isolation from one another.  The root problem is not the action itself &#8211; there&#8217;s nothing wrong with what is being done &#8211; the root problem is a breakdown in communication.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #cca333;"><strong>Do we really need to discuss this again?  Honestly?</strong></span></h3>
<p>In a nutshell - <strong>YES</strong>.  Why?  God has some pretty clear wording regarding the relationship between a man and a woman;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Genesis 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>24. Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>We all know this verse is used in relation to physical intimacy but doesn&#8217;t it include much more than that?  I believe that the scripture makes it quite evident that we are to care for our spouse in the same way that we care for ourselves.  Do we put ourselves in situations where we might be hurt emotionally?  Hopefully not on purpose.  In the same manner then, <strong>we need to be aware of things we might be doing innocently that are hurting our wife or husband</strong>.  If there is tension whenever financial matters are discussed, most likely that&#8217;s an early warning signal that we need to hit the pause button and go back to what we did so well when we first met &#8211; talk.  My wife Elaine is very good at this.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #cca333;"><strong>How do we move forward?</strong></span></h3>
<p>When I&#8217;m oblivious to how she is feeling about our situation &#8211; money or otherwise &#8211; she let&#8217;s me know that it&#8217;s time to talk.  Once the kids are asleep, she sits on our bed and I park myself in the chair with a small cushion behind my back.  After a few minutes, we reluctantly agree that we have totally misinterpreted each others actions and misconstrued what each other said.  We obviously didn&#8217;t set out to <strong>perceive each other incorrectly</strong> - it just happened and needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>From the bit of financial coaching I have done, <strong>I think this simple break-down in communication is one of the biggest challenges facing married couples when it comes to money</strong>.  Instead of thinking and acting independently of one another when managing the money the Lord has put into our possession, married couples need to be joined to one another and become one flesh.</p>
<p>He gives us mouths to speak and ears to hear.  It&#8217;s time to talk.  It&#8217;s time to listen!</p>

<p><strong>The itinerary included</strong>; group lessons with the keynote speakers, &#8216;making it personal&#8217; time to individually complete assignments in our workbooks, sharing sessions where we sat one-on-one with our spouse to discuss certain topics, and a date night (complete with lots of open communication &amp; romance).</p>
<p>The weekend also included a few sessions where the men were in one conference room and the women were in another.

It’s not your car! It belongs to the owner &#8211; you are taking care of it. Sure, you get to enjoy it and use it for your benefit, but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">your ultimate responsibility is to keep the owner’s best interests in mind</span></strong>. How would they want their car cared for?</p>
<p>This perspective on proper ownership and, understanding the role of a steward is the basis for our appreciation of all that we have.</p>
<p>The Bible states that God owns everything. That includes all that we have and enjoy &#8211; our homes, our vehicles, our money &#8211; everything. <span style="color: #000080;"><strong>When we acknowledge God’s ownership over our lives, the income, and the assets, we learn to have a deep appreciation for what He has entrusted to our care</strong></span>. If we don’t grasp this concept and instead treat things as though they are our own (as in the above example with the car), we quickly take them for granted and don’t appreciate them for long. We fall prey to slick advertising and persistent marketing that focuses our attention on the “bigger, newer, better” mindset.</p>
<blockquote><p>In Exodus 32:7-11, Moses shows us a great example of how we should be thinking;</p>
<p><strong>7 And the LORD said to Moses, &#8220;Go, get down! For <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000080;">your</span> people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves.</strong></p>
<p><strong>8 &#8220;They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molded calf, and worshiped it&#8230;&#8217;&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>10 &#8220;Now therefore, let Me alone, that My wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them. And I will make of you a great nation.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p><strong>11 Then Moses pleaded with the LORD his God, and said: &#8220;LORD, why does Your wrath burn hot against <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000080;">Your</span></span> people whom You have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Notice that Moses correctly identifies proper ownership in verse 11 and says to God “they are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Your</strong></span> people” after they had just been referred to as belonging to Moses in verse 7. He passes the test when he correctly acknowledged God’s rightful place as the Master.</p>
<p>Although the passage is referring to people, I believe we can use it in relation to our money; Here is a man who is leading approximately two million people on a long journey. Anytime an issue arose, they came to him for a decision. Although there were no doubt other men who helped him out, Moses had the final say on every matter. Being in charge, he had to deal with all outcomes of those decisions &#8211; good and bad. It would have been very easy to believe that the ownership belonged to him. In other words &#8211; “<strong>my</strong> people”.</p>
<p>Let’s think for a moment about our income and assets. Just like Moses, any time an issue arises, we make the decisions. Being in charge, we have to deal with all the outcomes of our decisions &#8211; good and bad. It’s easy then to believe that the ownership belongs to us &#8211; “<strong>my</strong> house, <strong>my</strong> business, <strong>my</strong> money”. In every aspect of our finances, we need to acknowledge proper ownership. Everything we have belongs to the Lord. Just like Moses, God has given things into our hands to manage and care for them.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Only when we realize that we are ultimately Money Managers for our Master and not for ourselves, do we really appreciate all that we have</strong></span>. To not realize this truth is to entrap ourselves in a cycle where we strive to acquire more and more without fully appreciating who provides for us.<br />

<p>You know how I always mention that Stewardship Weekly is a show where you can share your stories with the listeners? This is one of those episodes! Today I have a listener who wanted to share her life story on the podcast &#8211; so we made the arrangements, I called her on the phone and we recorded the conversation!</p>
<p>As you listen to this episode, you&#8217;ll quickly realize that <strong>this dear sister in the Lord is sincere about how she uses her time</strong>. For her entire married life, she has remained focused on using her time wisely to strengthen her marriage, teach her children and edify her grandchildren.</p>
<p>Through talking with her, I learned that there were many times in her life when it would have been a lot easier to follow the ways of the world rather than the path of righteousness that was laid out in front of her. Every step in tandem with Jesus Christ her Saviour, along the often challenging road of life, confirmed that she had made a wise decision when she surrendered her life to Him in faith.</p>

	<img class=" wp-image-1109  " style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;" title="Countdown Club" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Logo-Colour-w-words-209x300.jpg" alt="" width="146" height="210" />

</div>
<p>Instead of being a children&#8217;s club commander, a volunteer worker for a gospel sign distributor, landlord of two rental properties and the brilliant mind behind a christian housing website (that didn&#8217;t exactly work out), the end of the calendar year has me <strong>removed from all four of these roles</strong>. My own well laid plans have been thwarted by someone who has a clearer picture of my future than I do &#8211; someone who has my best interests in mind and loves me enough to die on a cross for my sins.</p>

		<itunes:summary>2011 was my Year of Change. Like it or not, life was altered dramatically.
 



Instead of being a children's club commander, a volunteer worker for a gospel sign distributor, landlord of two rental properties and the brilliant mind behind a christian housing website (that didn't exactly work out), the end of the calendar year has me removed from all four of these roles. My own well laid plans have been thwarted by someone who has a clearer picture of my future than I do - someone who has my best interests in mind and loves me enough to die on a cross for my sins.

Before getting into the main content for the episode, I open with a few more thoughts on Twitter. As previously mentioned, I'm now using the little blue birdie to expand the reach of the show and will use it productively to promote each episode, make announcements about upcoming guests and - most importantly - to interact with you! Please find and follow the podcast; @StewardshipWeek. Tweet. Tweet.

I then share a voice message that Scott Thomson left on the listener feedback line about last weeks interview with Rob Kuban. Be sure to bookmark Scott's site - Digital Sojourner - Thoughts on the Christian life as we sojourn together through the modern world. The team of writers over there are extremely active at their keyboards and post content on an almost daily basis. Very sound, biblical teaching.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I love being the host of the Stewardship Weekly podcast!</p>
<p><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1040" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 20px;" title="Rob Kuban" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Rob-Kuban-256x300.jpg" alt="" width="205" height="240" />In this episode I had the great pleasure of speaking with author <strong>Rob Kuban</strong> about his newest book “<strong>the Secret of Generosity</strong>”. Just released on Dec 1st, Rob has already been interviewed numerous times to share his thoughts on how love, worship and service are all interwoven into this broader topic of generosity.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to Rob through his blog ‘<strong><a href="http://dollarsanddoctrine.com" target="_blank">Dollars &amp; Doctrine</a></strong>’ when I followed a link from another site for a group referred to as the ‘<strong><a href="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/christian-financial-alliance/" target="_blank">Christian Financial Alliance</a></strong> (CFA). It was back in July and I was starting to actively seek new friends online with whom I could interact and learn from. The 20 points within the CFA (each one supported by numerous bible verses) that form the framework that each member agrees to adhere to were obviously chosen by Rob in a very careful manner to keep each writer accountable to God. The alliance is an excellent idea and hopefully it will attract more participants as more people are made aware of it.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1051" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 0px;" title="the Secret of Generosity" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Secret-of-Generosity-189x300.jpg" alt="" width="189" height="300" /></p>
<p>This is not Rob’s first book. His initial work, printed back in 2008, is a complete &amp; challenging “analysis of what the Bible teaches regarding all thing financial”. Entitled ‘<strong>Dollars and Doctrine</strong>’, it is a categorized handbook that covers such topics as; giving, saving, debt, investing, poverty, prosperity, work, motivation, retirement and more. It was this book that formed the basis for Rob’s blog that bears the same name.</p>
<p>After printing his first book and starting the blog, Rob turned his attention towards his next work. Realizing that believers had become engulfed in the shallow, never-ending pursuits of the world, he wrote about how we can claim the abundant life God has promised us. Appropriately titled ‘<strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0983111804?tag=dollaanddoctr-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0983111804&amp;adid=11MZB1BCS0VZBVE2NMYW&amp;&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fdollarsanddoctrine.com%2F" target="_blank">Christ-Centered Contentment</a></strong>’, the pages are filled with wisdom on thoughts about true peace, overcoming difficulties, meaningful satisfaction &amp; the joy of choosing infinite gratification.</p>
<p>You can purchase ‘<strong>the Secret of Generosity</strong>” from Amazon by clicking <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0983111812/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=dollaanddoctr-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0983111812&amp;adid=0NY48SNEQ96R63PGRZW4&amp;&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fdollarsanddoctrine.com%2F" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

As I made my way from chapter 20 through and into chapter 22, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice <strong>a glaring difference in the way wealth was handled and regarded</strong>. The first person took an unhealthy pride in the amount of wealth that he had amassed and flaunted it excessively. The second person had hired labourers to whom he felt completely comfortable giving wealth to. <span style="color: #a88105;"><strong>The first person saw money as a tool to be used for his own glory. The second person saw money as a tool to be used to glorify God.</strong></span></p>
<h2>Hezekiah &#8211; 15 years to life</h2>
<p>Hezekiah was sick as a dog and his days on earth were numbered. One day, he received a knock at his door and there &#8211; standing in  front of him &#8211; was none other than Isaiah the prophet of God. Instead of bringing a message of hope, the words that fell on his ears sounded like those of an insurance salesman. &#8220;<strong>Set your house in order, for you shall die, and not live</strong>&#8220;. Ouch! After a heartfelt prayer to God, we read that Hezekiah hung his head and wept bitterly.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Isaiah returned to speak again to Hezekiah who at this point was completely broken. &#8220;<strong>Thus says the Lord&#8230;surely I will heal you&#8230;I will add to your days 15 years</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Some time later, while enjoying the health and physical strength given to him from the Lord, Hezekiah received letters and a present from Mr. Berodach-Baladan, the son of the king of Babylon. <strong>What better way to entertain guests than to show off what you have?</strong> Look, here&#8217;s my vaults full of silver and gold! Check out these lovely spices and precious ointments (maybe there was some frankincense and myrrh in the collection). Do you like my all my treasures? &#8211; <strong><span style="color: #a88105;">Sorry. Wrong focus. These things are temporal and won&#8217;t last.</span></strong></p>
<h2>Josiah&#8217;s Craftsman &#8211; Trustworthy beyond belief</h2>
<p>Now let&#8217;s take a look into the mind and character of young King Josiah. In his few short years as king, he ensured that those around him who held roles of leadership, moral guidance and service for the Lord had exceedingly upright morals. Even the highly skilled craftsmen who were hand selected to complete the work on the temple could be trusted to care for the things of God.</p>
<p>As king, Josiah didn&#8217;t want anything to hamper the progress being made by the carpenters, builders and masons. Instead of having to report to the treasurer and constantly request additional money to purchase more supplies, Josiah thought it best to hand the money directly over to the craftsmen to spend as needed. Absolutely nothing is stated about any one of them individually, but verse 7 gives a glowing report of their characters &#8220;&#8230;<strong>there need be no accounting made with them of the money delivered into their hand, because they deal faithfully</strong>&#8220;. Wow! What an example for us to follow. The bar has been set. The benchmark to which one is measured is high.</p>
<p>Josiah knew that he, nor Hilkiah the high priest, would have to worry that the money was being spent foolishly or carelessly handled. These faithful craftsmen had proven themselves before and now had the distinct honour of caring for God&#8217;s treasury. <strong><span style="color: #a88105;">Correct. Proper focus. Faithful stewards know that eternal rewards for a job well done last forever.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Other topics discuss in the episode</h3>
<p>I share that one of the things the kids and I like to do sometimes is watch a YouTube video done by the Prince George High School. It features the song &#8220;Creation Sings&#8221; by Stuart Townend, sung by Steve Green. The video clips that are included are awesome! We like to crank up the volume and sing along with Steve as the kids laugh at the animals bumping into each other and sliding around. To enjoy it, click <strong><span style="color: #a88105;"><a href="http://youtu.be/vXyqg1YKv78" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a88105;">HERE</span></a></span></strong>.</p>
<p>A brand new, hot off the presses book entitled &#8220;the Secret of Generosity&#8221; has been given to me by the author Rob Kuban. Actually, Rob gave me 2 complimentary copies &#8211; one for me to enjoy and another to give away to a lucky listener of the Stewardship Weekly podcast. Rob&#8217;s blog &#8220;Dollars &amp; Doctrine&#8221; has an alliance of which I&#8217;m a member. This upcoming week, I&#8217;ll be speaking with Rob on the phone and will be able to share some of that conversation with you in an upcoming episode. To learn about the alliance, click <strong><span style="color: #a88105;"><a href="http://dollarsanddoctrine.com/2010/12/christian-financial-alliance-bringing-together-sound-biblical-teaching-2/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a88105;">HERE</span></a></span></strong>.</p>

Josiah's Craftsman - Trustworthy beyond belief
Now let's take a look into the mind and character of young King Josiah. In his few short years as king, he ensured that those around him who held roles of leadership, moral guidance and service for the Lord had exceedingly upright morals. Even the highly skilled craftsmen who were hand selected to complete the work on the temple could be trusted to care for the things of God.

Faithful stewards know that eternal rewards for a job well done last forever.

 
Other topics discuss in the episode
I share that one of the things the kids and I like to do sometimes is watch a YouTube video done by the Prince George High School. It features the song "Creation Sings" by Stuart Townend, sung by Steve Green. The video clips that are included are awesome! We like to crank up the volume and sing along with Steve as the kids laugh at the animals bumping into each other and sliding around. To enjoy it, click HERE.

A brand new, hot off the presses book entitled "the Secret of Generosity" has been given to me by the author Rob Kuban. Actually, Rob gave me 2 complimentary copies - one for me to enjoy and another to give away to a lucky listener of the Stewardship Weekly podcast.</itunes:summary>

<h1><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-867" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 20px;" title="Jay Ball" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Jay-Ball-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" />This is Jay.</h1>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>He is a good little monkey and always very curious. Today he is going to be a guest on the Stewardship Weekly podcast and share his story with Glen Steinson, his friend with the yellow hat.</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
For those of you who are familiar with the children&#8217;s books &#8220;Curious George&#8221;, you&#8217;ll know that George goes on all kinds of exciting adventures, makes lots of new friends and learns all kinds of valuable life lessons.  <strong>Jayson Ball is very much alike</strong>.  He has traveled North America extensively, developed a huge network of close friends and been repeatedly encouraged to continue on in his service for Jesus Christ his Lord.</p>
<p>Jay counts it a great priviledge to have been a part of <strong><span style="color: #000080;"><a href="http://teamc3.info/about/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000080;">Cross Canada Cruisers</span></a></span></strong> and the spread of the gospel from coast to coast. Using 3 classic cars and a unique message of <strong>Ruined, Rescued &amp; Restored</strong>, the team of young Christian men spent the entire summer moving around visiting parks, downtown carnivals and any outdoor celebration where they could find an audience.  Tens of thousands of tracts were handed out and hundreds of conversations were had with curious onlookers who wanted to know about &#8216;the restoration process&#8217;.</p>
<p>From June through August there were a lot of believers who got involved in the outreach. These included the Saints at Sudbury Bible Chapel, New Liskeard Bible Chapel, Forest Bible Chapel, Oakwood Bible Chapel and many more.</p>
<p>In this podcast, <strong>Jay shares his personal testimony with enthusiasm and passion</strong>.  Near the end of the episode, as he shares how others supported him financially when he took a 5 month leave of absence from work, he also shares how he&#8217;s able to periodically do something special for others. The Holy Spirit prompts him to take action and do something that many Christians have never had the opportunity to do. As I was listening to the recorded conversation getting it ready for the podcast, I thought &#8220;what if everyone did that?  Wouldn&#8217;t that be great!?&#8221;  But then a thought hit me &#8211; What if 2 different people, took the same action and yet, because of their completely different situations, only one was acting as a good steward?</p>
<p><span style="color: #000080;">You&#8217;ll see what I&#8217;m referring to as you listen</span>.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Pouring Water on the Ground</span></p>
<p>Picture this in your mind &#8212;&gt;  Images of a sever drought. The ground is dried up and cracked open. It&#8217;s unbearably hot and dry with tumbleweeds blowing in the wind. The scorching sun blazes down all day long with not even the smallest cloud in the sky.  It&#8217;s a severe famine with very little food and even less water.  Any water that stills remains is extremely valuable and not a drop is to be wasted. Imagine people lined up by the thousands wherever the precious allotments of supplies are available for distribution.</p>
<p>Now imagine someone who completely ignores the severity of the situation walks right up to the water supply, fills a dozen water pots up to the brim and then proceeds to dump the water out onto a pile of rocks nearby!  As the water disappears into the deep cracks in the ground, the onlookers stare in shock while they can barely swallow because their mouths and throats feel like sand paper! Who on earth would have the audacity to do such a thing?  Is there ever a situation like that where it would be appropriate to act in that manner?</p>
<h3><span style="color: #000080;">Read the story in 1st Kings 17:1-7. Then read all of chapter 18.</span></h3>
<p>Listen to the podcast to hear my thoughts on how 2 people can be in exactly the same circumstances, take exactly the same action and yet yield completely different reactions. Being good stewards does not always mean the same actions done by 2 different people will yield the same results. Pouring the water out onto the ground would be completely cold-hearted and cruel in the visual example I gave you.  Whereas, the same <strong>action taken by Elijah to win the hearts of the Israelites back to God was done in obedience to the Lord&#8217;s command</strong>. The events that unfolded on Mount Carmel with the 450 false prophets of Baal teach us that God is faithful.  He is never changing, steadfast in all His ways and the provider of all that we need, whether it be earthly provisions or rain from the clouds.</p>

He is a good little monkey and always very curious. Today he is going to be a guest on the Stewardship Weekly podcast and share his story with Glen Steinson, his friend with the yellow hat.
 
For those of you who are familiar with the children's books "Curious George", you'll know that George goes on all kinds of exciting adventures, makes lots of new friends and learns all kinds of valuable life lessons.  Jayson Ball is very much alike.  He has traveled North America extensively, developed a huge network of close friends and been repeatedly encouraged to continue on in his service for Jesus Christ his Lord.

<p>I have two thoughts for today. The first one relates to the idea of <strong>building a name for ourselves</strong>. The other thought was submitted to me just yesterday by a friend as an idea for the show.</p>
<h2>Managing our Talents Wisely</h2>
<p><strong>Acts 9:36-43</strong>. This passage is an account of how Tabitha (also known as Dorcas) was raised from the dead by God through Peter.  As I read this story, there was one verse that really caught my attention.  The author of Acts was lead by the Holy Spirit to finish the account with these words &#8220;<strong>and it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p>If you had the ability to perform miracles, how quickly would the news spread and the media flock to your doorstep?  Less than 6 hours I&#8217;m sure.  Your instant fame would catapult you to instant stardom.</p>
<p>Although the world at that time didn&#8217;t have any of the technology that we enjoy today, they still found a way to communicate relatively quickly amongst themselves.  Word-of-mouth would fuel excitement within the city and the fastest riders on horseback could then carry the news to adjoining regions within hours.  We cannot overlook the possibility that Peter and the other disciples would have been revered as &#8216;gods&#8217; themselves and given the opportunity to bathe in the spotlight for a season!  Instead, from reading this one closing verse, it&#8217;s evident that <strong>Peter was a wise steward</strong> and ensured that all praise and glory was directed to the rightful owner of the talent he was utilizing.</p>
<h2>Managing our Time Wisely</h2>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-858" title="hourglass" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/iStock_000003394623XSmall-203x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="300" />When you exclude the Lord from your finances, often there never seems to be enough money to cover all the expenses each month.  Yet, time and time again, you hear testimonies of people (like <a href="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/hear-alan-rachel-speak-indonesian/" target="_blank">Alan &amp; Rachel Whatley in episode 16</a>) say that they set aside the first fruits of their income to God and they found that they were able to accomplish more with the remaining 90% than they ever did with the original 100%.  How is that?  I like to say that God uses a different calculator than we do!</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://kernelsofwheat.com" target="_blank">Jim Kerwin</a> says that <strong>the same concept holds true with our prayer life</strong>.  Time spent in quiet, reflective and non-rushed prayer is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> beneficial.  It&#8217;s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> a good use of our time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #c2a23d;"><strong>By God&#8217;s great power, the following math equations hold true;</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c2a23d;"><strong>24 hours subtract time spent in prayer &gt; 24 hours</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #c2a23d;"><strong>More time praying = More time to do things</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Martin Luther is reported to have said, &#8220;I pray two hours every day; and days that I know will be very busy, I pray three hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time to consider <strong>tithing your time</strong>.  To this world, it doesn&#8217;t even come close to making sense.  That&#8217;s OK.  Just like Peter, we&#8217;re not living for this world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&#8212;-&gt; P.S.</strong></span> &#8211; This is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">first</span> episode I&#8217;ve released with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no editing</span>.  It might not be as polished as some of the others but it&#8217;s genuine!</span></p>

Managing our Talents Wisely
Acts 9:36-43. This passage is an account of how Tabitha (also known as Dorcas) was raised from the dead by God through Peter.  As I read this story, there was one verse that really caught my attention.  The author of Acts was lead by the Holy Spirit to finish the account with these words "and it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord".

If you had the ability to perform miracles, how quickly would the news spread and the media flock to your doorstep?  Less than 6 hours I'm sure.  Your instant fame would catapult you to instant stardom.

Although the world at that time didn't have any of the technology that we enjoy today, they still found a way to communicate relatively quickly amongst themselves.  Word-of-mouth would fuel excitement within the city and the fastest riders on horseback could then carry the news to adjoining regions within hours.  We cannot overlook the possibility that Peter and the other disciples would have been revered as 'gods' themselves and given the opportunity to bathe in the spotlight for a season!  Instead, from reading this one closing verse, it's evident that Peter was a wise steward and ensured that all praise and glory was directed to the rightful owner of the talent he was utilizing.
Managing our Time Wisely
When you exclude the Lord from your finances, often there never seems to be enough money to cover all the expenses each month.  Yet, time and time again, you hear testimonies of people (like Alan &amp; Rachel Whatley in episode 16) say that they set aside the first fruits of their income to God and they found that they were able to accomplish more with the remaining 90% than they ever did with the original 100%.  How is that?  I like to say that God uses a different calculator than we do!

My friend Jim Kerwin says that the same concept holds true with our prayer life.  Time spent in quiet, reflective and non-rushed prayer is always beneficial.  It's always a good use of our time.

 
By God's great power, the following math equations hold true;

24 hours subtract time spent in prayer &gt; 24 hours

More time praying = More time to do things
 

Martin Luther is reported to have said, "I pray two hours every day; and days that I know will be very busy, I pray three hours."

It's time to consider tithing your time.  To this world, it doesn't even come close to making sense.  That's OK.  Just like Peter, we're not living for this world.

 

----&gt; P.S. - This is the first episode I've released with no editing.  It might not be as polished as some of the others but it's genuine!</itunes:summary>

In this episode, I had the great pleasure of interviewing a new friend of mine who also hosts a weekly podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Stewart</strong> is a self proclaimed &#8216;Personal Finance Architect&#8217;.  He&#8217;s the voice behind the microphone over at the <strong><a href="http://www.moneyplansos.com/" target="_blank">Money Plan SOS</a></strong> podcast and his desire is <strong>not</strong> to help people manage their debt.  His desire is to teach people how to <strong>eliminate</strong> debt. As he coaches clients, both in-person and through his show, he guides them on how to use a budget to build a firm foundation and then how to secure the four financial walls around them, topped off with a good roof for fiscal shelter.  His &#8216;<strong>Financial House of Freedom</strong>&#8216; serves as an excellent example of how to move from the bondage of credit to the freedom of wealth.</p>
<p>One of his favorite passages of scripture to teach from is <strong>Matthew chapter 25</strong>.  The parable of the talents is deeply practical for believers as we need to understand how God wants us to manage what we have for His glory and good pleasure.</p>

<h2>Laundry Room Renovations</h2>
<p>As the tagline in the header reads, Stewardship Weekly is also about honoring the Lord with our time. My thoughts for this episode are drawn from a personal story.  Over the past few days I&#8217;ve been covering the laundry room walls with chipboard and building some shelves where the kids can pick up their clean clothes.  I was initially planning on recording some extra podcast episodes and working on the <a href="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/spreadsheet-spending-plan-video-tutorial-in-the-making/" target="_blank">Spreadsheet Spending Plan</a> video tutorials, but God had other plans.  He wanted to shift my focus away from the income and assets and teach me what it really means to be a good steward of my time.  Listen as I share how passages of scripture from both Psalm 32 and Acts 9 influenced my attitude.</p>
<h2>The Whatley&#8217;s Reach Out To Their Community</h2>
<p>I love hearing someone speak another language.  In this episode, I&#8217;m joined by Alan &amp; Rachel Whatley who are home in Canada for a few months visiting friends and family before heading back to Indonesia where they are serving the Lord with <a href="http://usa.ntm.org/" target="_blank">New Tribes Mission</a>.</p>
<p>Joined by their two young children, the Whatley&#8217;s are faithfully following Christ&#8217;s example and reaching out to those who are lost in their sins.  Their weekly routine often involves in-home bible studies, children&#8217;s ministry, office support for other team members and an endless list of repair &amp; maintenance projects at the missions station.  I honestly believe that every newsletter and e-mail we&#8217;ve received from Alan &amp; Rachel has had at least one picture of Alan with a hammer in his hand!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-814" title="Indonesian Girl" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Indonesian-Girl.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="282" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Listen as they share their story of God&#8217;s leading them both into missionary work as a result of attending a conference together in their early marriage.  Their adventure into learning of God&#8217;s faithfulness to provide for them is heard as they recount how they gradually increased their giving in increments of 10%.  Once they finished their training and moved overseas, the Lord continued to reveal His hand of provision over and over again.</p>

<h2>Bob &amp; Jen McDonough Interview</h2>
<p>The other night I had the great privilege of speaking with the McDonough family of Minnesota. Theirs is a remarkable journey of a Christian couple who have faced incredible challenges head-on and are a <strong>true testimony of the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness to those who choose to serve Him</strong> with their income and assets.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, two life changing obstacles stood looming in front of them; a <strong>burden of debt</strong> that was crushing them slowly, and the devastating news that their son had an <strong>incurable medical condition</strong>. Today you&#8217;ll hear their story. Armed with the wisdom found in the book of Proverbs and a financial coach that they now consider to be a close friend, Jen and Bob, along with their 4 children embarked on a life-long journey with the hope that someday they&#8217;ll hear their Savior say &#8220;<strong>well done good and faithful servants</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-766" style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;" title="Bob &amp; Jen McDonough" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Bob-Jen-McDonough-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></p>
<p>After we hear from Mom and Dad, their daughter Maggie gives us a firsthand report of how the entire family is following the pattern; work, give, save, then spend. A lot of people do it the way the credit card companies and retail stores want us to, which is to spend first then work forever to try to pay it down. And once that pattern starts, often there isn&#8217;t any money left over to save or give.</p>
<p>A brief interview with their son Robbie wraps up the episode.  This is a brave young man who, through his medical issues, motivated his parents to be responsible <strong>Money Managers for the Lord</strong>. If Robbie was completely healthy and the trips back and forth to the medical center in Denver weren&#8217;t needed, just think &#8211; where would his family be today? Probably where they were back at the start of 2009 &#8211; buried in debt and living their lives thinking everything was normal and that life was fine.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><h2>Tithes &amp; Offerings, Pure Gold &amp; a Pure Heart</h2>
<p>In this episode of Stewardship Weekly, I begin by telling you a little bit about our Labor Day weekend at Camp Li-Lo-Li.  I have to admit that <strong>I underestimated the responsibilities of a Camp Director</strong> as I had been hoping to meet with John Benson while we were there.  Although we did enjoy a short time around the fire with him one evening, I was not able to sit down and record an interview for the podcast.  As always, all the families at camp had a fantastic time and <strong>the Lord was honored</strong> through the singing, ministry and fellowship enjoyed by everyone.</p>
<p>This week, I share that I have spent some time in 1<sup>st</sup> Kings chapters 6 &amp; 7 reading the passages about the temple construction. It’s mind-boggling to think how much gold was used in the building project.  Absolutely everything was overlaid with pure gold, the cost of which was almost too great to measure.  What’s amazing to consider is that <strong>a lot of this gold came a from the free will offerings of the Israelites</strong>.  We read in 1<sup>st</sup> Chronicles 29:9 that “the people rejoiced for they had offered willingly to the Lord.”</p>
<p>As one who uses a <a href="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/spreadsheet-spending-plan-video-tutorial-in-the-making/" target="_blank">spreadsheet spending plan</a> to manage our finances, and having just signed the <a href="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Financial-Covenant-with-God.pdf" target="_blank">Financial Covenant With God</a>, I’ve been thinking about the condition of my heart when giving.  Am I always giving to the Lord willingly and with a joyful heart, or am I in part following a routine of dispersing funds as dictated by our budget?</p>
<p>A familiar passage in 2<sup>nd</sup> Corinthians 9:7 reads  “so let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity, for <strong>God loves a cheerful giver</strong>”.</p>
<p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the podcast is a couple of short messages from <strong>Larry Ball</strong>.   As he shares his thoughts, Larry draws some <strong>comparison between having our portion in this world versus having our portion and fulfillment in Christ.</strong></p>
<p>The episode concludes with a playback of the messages you hear when you call into the <a href="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Voice-Mail-Image.jpg" target="_blank">Listener Feedback Line</a>.   You can hear the 3 different options and get familiar with the voicemail.  Please call.  I’d love to hear from you!</p>

<h2>An Interview with the Host of the &#8216;Kernels of Wheat&#8217; podcast</h2>
<p>I found Jim through iTunes.  His new podcast has some great artwork that jumps off the screen at you.  After corresponding via e-mail, we enjoyed a recorded telephone conversation together.  He submitted the following details about himself;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-695" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 20px;" title="Jim Kerwin" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Jim-Kerwin.jpg" alt="" width="146" height="160" />Jim Kerwin</strong> was saved by the Lord Jesus Christ in 1968.  Ordained since 1971, most of Jim’s adult life has been spent in full-time teaching and pastoral ministries.  Ready to serve wherever he’s sent, Jim has been privileged to minister in a variety of countries, as well as closer to home in Canada and the U.S.  He heads up Finest of the Wheat Teaching Fellowship, a small local assembly of believers with a large and growing online Bible-teaching ministry (www.FinestOfTheWheat.org), featuring free articles, audios, and books.  He also posts a weekly Bible-teaching podcast at <strong><a href="http://www.KernelsOfWheat.com" target="_blank">www.KernelsOfWheat.com</a></strong>.  Since his late-in-life return to graduate school (Regent University School of Divinity, where he earned a Master’s degree in Biblical Studies in 2005), Jim has also authored and edited four books and is working on two more.  Through Denise, his wife of nearly forty years, God proves to Jim every day the truth of Proverbs 18:22, and together they are the parents of three daughters and two granddaughters.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><h2>An Interview with Scott Thomson &#8211; Serving the Lord through Stewardship</h2>
<p>This new episode is substantially longer than previous ones. In it, I had the great privilege to interview a new friend that was introduced to me by <strong><a href="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/upcoming-interview-with-kaz-ortiz/" target="_blank">Kaz Ortiz</a></strong> who you&#8217;ll remember from <a title="Episode 4" href="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/4/" target="_blank">episode 4</a>. I was introduced to <strong>Scott Thomson</strong> when our family was down at Greenwood Hills Pennsylvania this summer. Scott, who was heavily influenced by his dad at a young age when he was taught <strong>solid teaching on biblical finance</strong>, lives in York, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>He holds a <strong>Masters Degree in Corporate Finance</strong> and has recently become a <strong>Certified Financial Planner (CFP)</strong>.   For many years now, both as his passion and occupation, Scott advises Christians on how to be good stewards. He works with a group called <strong><a title="Believers Stewardship Services" href="http://www.believerstewardship.org" target="_blank">Believers Stewardship Services</a></strong> who encourages believers to follow biblical principles in alignment with US tax laws and regulations.</p>
<p>He draws to our attention that there is teaching about money in almost every book of the bible &#8211; from Genesis to Revelation. He references Abraham&#8217;s wealth and the role it played in his life. He also points out that Job&#8217;s wealth (and sudden removal of it) hold many valuable truths for us to glean. Then in the New Testament, our attention is drawn to the time when a poor, lame man approached Peter and John asking for money. Instead of handing the man some coins, Peter and John are able to offer something far better.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-592" title="Scott &amp; Glen" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Scott-Glen-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" /></p>
<p>Our conversation then turned to <strong>estate planning</strong>. Scott advises that this is something that all adult Christians should seriously think about. You want to have a proper will in place for asset distribution in accordance with your Christian beliefs. Should you pass away before the Lord returns, and you don&#8217;t have a will, it&#8217;s highly unlikely that the government will choose to distribute some of the funds to the Lords work.</p>
<p>I then mention this great little reference book - <a href="http://www.christianbook.com/what-the-bible-says-about-money/9781597899925/pd/899925?item_code=WW&amp;netp_id=503299&amp;event=ESRCG&amp;view=details" target="_blank">What the Bible says about money</a>.</p>
<p>There is another organization that Scott has been heavily involved with over the years named <strong><a title="Christian Missions in Many Lands" href="http://www.cmml.us/" target="_blank">Christian Missions in Many Lands</a> (CMML)</strong>.  His time with both Believers Stewardship Services and CMML  has corresponded nicely with one another allowing him to be a blessing to many, many people over the years.</p>
<p>Scott shares with passion how his dad taught him some valuable truths about finance. Using a simple calculator and the traditional numeric tables, he learned all about compound interest and the time value of money. It was explained to him that this can be a very powerful force when working for you, but can be an even more powerful force when working against you. <strong>Avoidance of debt was stressed and the freedom associated with working hard and living on less than you make</strong>.</p>
<p>One of the consequences of having outstanding debt as a believer in Jesus Christ, is that if you feel led to serve the Lord outside of your income earning occupation,  your intentions will be hampered by your repayment obligations. <strong>It&#8217;s hard to serve, tithe and give generously when our allegiances are to the financial institutions.</strong></p>

<h2>Interview with Ismail Nemr &#8211; Part 2 of 2</h2>
<p>One of the opening thoughts in this episode focuses on contentment. Do people get contentment from money? How about from physical possessions?</p>
<p>To get us started this week, Ismail makes a startling statement. “If sin was never introduced, <strong>we would never have had the need for money</strong> because we would still have been in perfect harmony with God and with one another and therefore had no need to buy and sell.”</p>
<p>One of the bitter consequences of sin is <strong>selfishness</strong>. Men and women live for themselves trying to quench the thirst in their souls. The book of Ecclesiastes, in chapter 2, reminds us that these pursuits are all in vain. One can only derive <strong><span style="color: #cca333;">true fulfillment through the Lord Jesus Christ</span></strong>. We came into this world with nothing and will likewise leave with the same.</p>
<p>Once you listen to this episode you&#8217;ll agree with Ismail and myself that the Lord himself chose 2nd Corinthians 8:9 to be a key verse for our thoughts today. Unknown to each other before we recorded this interview, the words of this verse were on both our minds.  <em><strong>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich</strong>.</em></p>
<p>As many of us do when discussing the topic, Ismail quoted the verse &#8211; <em>The love of money is the root of all evil</em>.  He stresses that money itself is not evil but that money is &#8220;a blessing from the hands of our loving Father and we should be sure to use it for His honor and glory”.  What is the object of our hearts? Money or Christ?</p>

Interview with Ismail Nemr - Part 2 of 2
One of the opening thoughts in this episode focuses on contentment. Do people get contentment from money? How about from physical possessions?

One of the bitter consequences of sin is selfishness. Men and women live for themselves trying to quench the thirst in their souls.

We came into this world with nothing and will likewise leave with the same.

Once you listen to this episode you'll agree with Ismail and myself that the Lord himself chose 2nd Corinthians 8:9 to be a key verse for our thoughts today. Unknown to each other before we recorded this interview, the words of this verse were on both our minds.  For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.

As many of us do when discussing the topic, Ismail quoted the verse - The love of money is the root of all evil.  He stresses that money itself is not evil but that money is "a blessing from the hands of our loving Father and we should be sure to use it for His honor and glory”.  What is the object of our hearts? Money or Christ?

<h2>An Interview with Ismail Nemr &#8211; Part 1 of 2</h2>
<p>In this episode, I had the great privilege of being able to interview a dear friend of mine named Ismail Nemr.   This brother in the Lord lives in Detroit Michigan after having <strong>moved to the United States from Lebanon</strong>.   Unlike most of us, his fellow countryman back home hates him.   Having come from a Shiite Muslim background, his conversion to Christianity has made him a target whenever he returns to visit family.</p>
<p>Our interview starts out with Ismail telling a story of plans he had back in 2006 for a gospel outreach in the greater Detroit area. He shares how he had a vision for a <strong>3 night gospel outreach to the Arabic community</strong>. After tallying the expected costs to rent a facility, provide meals and cover miscellaneous expenses, it was determined that approximately $20,000 would be needed. Not sure where the money would come from, Ismail and the committee that had formed to oversee the event proceeded in faith. Appropriately named “<strong>The Great Physician Conference</strong>”, this outreach is going into its 7th year. Ismail shares with us that, in the 1st year of the conference, 100 people in attendance repented and surrendered their life to Christ.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-546" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 20px;" title="Ismail Nemr" src="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Ismail-Nemr-236x300.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="300" /></p>
<p>The 2nd story that he shares in the podcast is how he was off work for 8 months in 2008. Lying in bed for <strong>21 days in excruciating pain</strong> and looking at a possible surgery &#8211; he wasn&#8217;t worried about their finances. His employer at the time reassured him that his paycheck would continue to arrive in the mail as usual. However, things do not always go as planned. Promises made with good intentions are not always honored. Listen as <strong><span style="color: #cca333;">Ismail draws parallels between what happens in our lives and a ship being tossed to and fro in a violent storm</span></strong>. It&#8217;s obvious from his testimony that Ismail has read Matthew 6:25-34. “Therefore do not worry, saying, &#8216;what shall we eat?&#8217; or &#8216;what shall we drink?&#8217; or &#8216;what shall we wear?&#8217;&#8230; for your Heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The interview finishes with Ismail sharing how he and his family are now in a time of transition.  It appears that the Lord is calling him into full-time ministry and that his time working for his current employer may soon be drawing to a close. He shares with the listening audience how <strong>it&#8217;s his desire to fully utilize the spiritual gifts entrusted to him by God</strong>.</p>
<p>This dear brother  reminds us that “the Lord gives grace and he renews the energy&#8221;. Next week in episode 11, we will enjoy the 2nd half of the telephone interview as Ismail continues and shares some thoughts he has on money and stewardship.  You definitely want to ensure that you&#8217;re subscribed to the podcast so you don&#8217;t miss his powerful and motivating message.</p>
<p>If after listening to this episode you would like to leave some feedback for Ismail, please call the Listener Toll-Free Hotline and leave a voicemail for him.</p>

<h2>Book Review &#8211; Money, Possessions &amp; Eternity by Randy Alcorn</h2>
<p>As mentioned back in episode 2, I have read quite a number of excellent books on biblical finance and have selected a handful that I&#8217;d like to encourage you to look into.  For this first review, I purposely selected my favorite book.</p>
<p>This is a heavy duty read with 422 pages.  But don&#8217;t let that turn you off.  Money, Possessions &amp; Eternity is <strong>not</strong> milk &#8211; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it&#8217;s all meat</span>.  Not the chewy kind though.  <strong>This is the delicious meat that falls off the bone and melts in your mouth</strong>.</p>
<p>The author, Randy Alcorn shares his thoughts in a logical and well thought out structure and gives chapter and verse reference to support each of his findings.  The verses are <strong>not</strong> taken out of context to fit his beliefs &#8211; they are carefully studied on their own and then conclusions drawn from the truth that they contain.  A lot of other &#8216;Christian&#8217; books on finance draw their own beliefs and then go hunting to find verses to support those beliefs.  Not this book.</p>
<p>Check out Randy&#8217;s blog &#8211; <a href="http://www.epm.org/blog" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Listen to part of the book &#8211; <a href="http://www.christianaudio.com/money-possessions-and-eternity-randy-alcorn" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>A blank copy for you to pray about and sign &#8211; <a href="http://www.stewardshipweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Financial-Covenant-with-God.pdf" target="_blank">Financial Covenant with God</a></p>
<h2>Transfer Treasurers On Ahead Home</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently observed a handful of Mexican workers living north of the border for the summer.  Their simple but sufficient living quarters provided a great illustration for where we should store our treasure.</p>
<p>Their 3 bedroom trailer located on the edge of the vegetable fields where they diligently work each day, isn&#8217;t filled with extravagant luxuries.  Instead of buying all the latest and greatest that money can buy here, they make their way to the bank each week and transfer their money &#8211; on ahead home to Mexico.</p>
<p>Enjoy the podcast as we use this example to focus our thoughts and hearts &#8211; on ahead home to heaven.</p>

<p>When trying to be good stewards for the Lord, it sure is nice to get some encouragement along the way.</p>
<p>This episode looks at a select few individuals who have gone out of their way to be an encourager to someone else.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Podcast Outline;</h3>
<h2>Onesiphorus</h2>
<p>To start this episode we refer to <strong>2 Timothy 1:16-17</strong> and look at a man who Paul said &#8220;often refreshed him&#8221;.  Instead of sitting around and discussing Paul&#8217;s imprisonment with the other believers, he journeyed to Rome and managed to track down the military compound and very cell that his friend was sitting in.  Knowing the state that Paul was in, Onesiphorus utilized his time well and &#8220;zealously&#8221; sought out a friend who desperately needed encouragement.</p>
<p>It was a message spoken by my brother-in-law, <strong>Brian Cretney</strong>, that first drew my attention to Onesiphorus.  Although I had read that passage numerous times before, I had completely glossed over those two short verses that define his true character.</p>
<h2>Leslie Samuel</h2>
<p>Through his podcast at <a href="http://www.learningwithleslie.com" target="_blank">Learning with Leslie</a>, this new friend of mine in the Lord is helping me be a better steward of my time and internet resources by teaching me how to enhance this web site.  After I left a message for Leslie on his voice mail, he talked about Stewardship Weekly on his podcast and suggested that his listeners check it out for themselves!  I discuss how much that meant to me and then included a clip from his show for you to hear.</p>
<h2>Philemon</h2>
<p>Although the shortest of all Paul&#8217;s letters preserved for us in the Bible, his brief correspondence to Philemon reveals a remarkable man.  Because of Philemon&#8217;s well known reputation as one who &#8216;refreshed the hearts of the Saints&#8217;, Paul was confident and bold enough to request pardon for run-away salve <strong>Onesimus</strong> who had recently accepted Christ.  It seems likely from our insight into his character, that Philemon was a good steward of all that was in his household &#8211; including his slaves.  Paul asks him to accept Onesimus back, not as a slave, but as a &#8220;beloved brother&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s safe to assume that Paul&#8217;s intervention on his behalf was a great encouragement to Onesimus.</p>
<h2>Guest Feedback</h2>
<p>Whenever you listen to an episode that features a guest sharing their stewardship testimony or teaching on financial biblical truths, please <strong>call the toll-free voice-mail feedback line at 1-888-546-0325</strong>. Leave a message of appreciation and encouragement for the guest and I&#8217;ll be sure that it&#8217;s forwarded to them after four weeks (along with all other feedback received).</p>
<h2><strong>In Closing&#8230;</strong></h2>
<p>What can you do this week to be an encouragement to someone?  Send an e-mail? Work along side of them on a project?  Anonymously give some money to a friend in need?</p>

To start this episode we refer to 2 Timothy 1:16-17 and look at a man who Paul said "often refreshed him".  Instead of sitting around and discussing Paul's imprisonment with the other believers, he journeyed to Rome and managed to track down the military compound and very cell that his friend was sitting in.  Knowing the state that Paul was in, Onesiphorus utilized his time well and "zealously" sought out a friend who desperately needed encouragement.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><h3><strong>Hi everyone, welcome back!</strong></h3>
<p>This week&#8217;s episode of Stewardship Weekly is going to be a little different.  Usually I take the first half of the show to share my thoughts on a passage of scripture or a concept relating to biblical finance.  Then after 15 minutes or so, the second half is either a success story or a guest message.</p>
<p>This week however, the plans have changed.  <strong>The entire episode is an interview I just had with a friend of mine named Peter Zein</strong>.  My original intent was to edit the recording and bring it down to 20 mins or so, but, one of the reasons I&#8217;m hosting the Stewardship Weekly podcast is to have the show be an encouragement to the listening audience.  After going over the content numerous times, I decided that it would be in your best interest to hear almost the entire conversation.  Once you hear it, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree.</p>
<h3><strong>About Our Guest</strong></h3>
<p>Peter Zein is a man who <span style="color: #c19b00;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">will never achieve financial independence</span></strong></span>.  It&#8217;s not because he makes foolish money decisions.  It&#8217;s not because he lacks the knowledge required for long term planning.  Quite the opposite.  He&#8217;ll never achieve financial independence &#8211; because <strong>he doesn&#8217;t want to</strong>.  If financial independence is reaching the point in your life where you feel safe and secure with what you have and no longer have to trust in anyone else &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t want it.</p>
<p>Peter has placed his trust in God alone to provide for his every need &#8211; financial and otherwise.  Through obedience and sacrifice, he has yielded his will to that of his Heavenly Father and, over many years, has never been disappointed.</p>
<p>The podcast is a 35 minute personal testimony of a man who has faced many challenges and adversities in his life.  It reveals a loyal steward who has been a faithful servant &#8211; and is an example for all of us.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Hi everyone, welcome back!
This week's episode of Stewardship Weekly is going to be a little different.  Usually I take the first half of the show to share my thoughts on a passage of scripture or a concept relating to biblical finance.  Then after 15 minutes or so, the second half is either a success story or a guest message.

This week however, the plans have changed.  The entire episode is an interview I just had with a friend of mine named Peter Zein.  My original intent was to edit the recording and bring it down to 20 mins or so, but, one of the reasons I'm hosting the Stewardship Weekly podcast is to have the show be an encouragement to the listening audience.  After going over the content numerous times, I decided that it would be in your best interest to hear almost the entire conversation.  Once you hear it, I'm sure you'll agree.
About Our Guest
Peter Zein is a man who will never achieve financial independence.  It's not because he makes foolish money decisions.  It's not because he lacks the knowledge required for long term planning.  Quite the opposite.  He'll never achieve financial independence - because he doesn't want to.  If financial independence is reaching the point in your life where you feel safe and secure with what you have and no longer have to trust in anyone else - he doesn't want it.

Peter has placed his trust in God alone to provide for his every need - financial and otherwise.  Through obedience and sacrifice, he has yielded his will to that of his Heavenly Father and, over many years, has never been disappointed.

The podcast is a 35 minute personal testimony of a man who has faced many challenges and adversities in his life.  It reveals a loyal steward who has been a faithful servant - and is an example for all of us.</itunes:summary>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p>This episode opens with a brief story of a family going on a much anticipated trip to Florida.  One of the young siblings loses his little wallet containing his spending money!  Find out what happened.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Jesus the Wise Coach</strong></span></p>
<p>We then spend some time together looking at <strong>Matthew 6:19-21</strong> and thinking about <strong>how</strong> and <strong>where</strong> we store up our treasure.</p>
<p>A good coach figures out what motivates someone and then uses that knowledge to drive them to achieve excellence!  That is exactly what we see the Lord doing in this passage.  God knows that we, as emotional beings, are motivated by rewards.  And the reward in this case is treasure!  (He made us and gave us those emotions).  Now He wants to use those emotions for our own good.</p>
<p>First he gives us a warning about our treasures &#8211; don’t keep them where you will lose them.  He then presents the preferred alternative &#8211; a guaranteed safe place where they will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">yield dividends for eternity!</span>  He didn&#8217;t give us a warning and then end the conversation and walk away &#8211; He told us what we should do to ensure that we don’t lose it.</p>
<p>Christ Jesus wants us to have the true rewards (the treasure) once we reach our final destination &#8211; not focus on the temporal ones here on earth!</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;"><strong>Lessons with Larry</strong></span></p>
<p>I first welcomed Larry Ball onto the show in episode 1.  A few weeks ago, he sat down at my desk in front of the microphone and recorded a series of short, ‘on-the-fly’ messages for Stewardship Weekly.  Don’t be mistaken, these are golden nuggets of rich truths.  Some people might take days to put together what he shares here on the show.</p>
<p>In this episode, Larry shares two different thoughts that tie in nicely with our study of where you store your treasure.  The first discussion is on the world’s obsession with collecting ‘stuff’.  Materialism is the focus and distraction of the society we are living in. In the second, he looks at the vineyard parable and the misguided emphasis of seizing the inheritance &#8211; the here and now.</p>

This episode opens with a brief story of a family going on a much anticipated trip to Florida.  One of the young siblings loses his little wallet containing his spending money!  Find out what happened.

Jesus the Wise Coach

We then spend some time together looking at Matthew 6:19-21 and thinking about how and where we store up our treasure.

A good coach figures out what motivates someone and then uses that knowledge to drive them to achieve excellence!  That is exactly what we see the Lord doing in this passage.  God knows that we, as emotional beings, are motivated by rewards.  And the reward in this case is treasure!  (He made us and gave us those emotions).  Now He wants to use those emotions for our own good.

First he gives us a warning about our treasures - don’t keep them where you will lose them.  He then presents the preferred alternative - a guaranteed safe place where they will yield dividends for eternity!  He didn't give us a warning and then end the conversation and walk away - He told us what we should do to ensure that we don’t lose it.

Christ Jesus wants us to have the true rewards (the treasure) once we reach our final destination - not focus on the temporal ones here on earth!

<p>Waiting when we <em><strong>don&#8217;t</strong></em> <strong>know</strong> when something will happen is even harder!</p>
<p>In this episode, I start the show by reflecting on the life of King David to learn about patience, self-control and how to wait on the Lord&#8217;s timing.  This past week, there have been a number of things that have driven me to <strong>think about what really matters</strong> &#8211; making things happen based on my schedule, or being obedient to what He has called me to do and waiting for things to happen in His perfect time.</p>
<p>In the middle of the show, there is a <strong>great story from a young couple</strong> who saw the Lord&#8217;s timing play out in the middle of their real estate shopping when purchasing their first home.  It&#8217;s a back and forth account of making multiple visits to multiple properties &#8211; all the while trying to decipher God&#8217;s plan for their new family.</p>
<p>The episode wraps up with my personal story of trying to find a <strong>scuba diving</strong> partner, <strong><em>almost</em> purchasing a motorcycle</strong> and having a heart-felt discussion with <strong>my life coach</strong> (my Mom).  I share some details on our line-of-credit and our 10 year old son teaching me the proper way to making a &#8220;major&#8221; purchase.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Have you ever had to make a difficult decision concerning a major purchase?  Of course you have.  Who hasn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>In this episode, we spend some time together <strong>looking at the start of Gideon&#8217;s public life</strong> as he gets ready to lead the nation of Israel.  As we well know, he was quite unsure of himself and used the &#8220;<strong>fleece test</strong>&#8221; to learn the mind of God.</p>
<p>Do we do the same?  Is there merit to asking for a sign from above when faced with big decisions?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Show Contents -</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Gideon is called by God.</li>
<li>Israel is again at a low point in their history and have turned their backs on God.  They are living in complete disobedience and are doing evil in the sight of the Lord.</li>
<li>The Lord has delivered them into the hand of the Midianites for 7 years.</li>
<li>Judges 6:2-5</li>
<li>We see Gideon working hard to provide for his family during difficult circumstances.</li>
<li>Judges 6:6, 12-13</li>
<li>Gideon did not have a clear picture of the way things really were.  He thinks that God has forsaken them!</li>
<li>It wasn’t God that had forsaken them, it was the nation of Israel that had forsaken God!</li>
<li>What happens when we slack off and take our relationship with the Lord for granted?</li>
<li>Judges 6:14-16</li>
<li>Gideon is looking at himself and doubting his ability to carry out the Lord’s plans.  And you know what?  He should!</li>
<li>But he wasn’t going to be alone!  God said “Have I not sent you?”  &amp; “surely I will be with you”.</li>
<li>Gideon was thinking ahead to the challenges that would await him and was unsure of things.</li>
<li><strong>What about when we have a genuine need and are truly unsure what the Lord would have us to do?  Is it OK to put out a fleece like Gideon did and ask God for a sign?</strong></li>
<li>Judges 6:36-40</li>
<li>Instead of ignoring the Lord and returning to his routine of secretly threshing wheat at the winepresses, he asks for clarification &#8211; a sign.</li>
<li>Why not do as Gideon did and ask for a sign?  <strong>Give God a chance to clarify things.</strong></li>
<li>Nowadays, with quick and accessible credit, the world has made it extremely easy to skip these opportunities for the Lord to show us a sign.</li>
<li>Gideon had to sleep on it.  His answers from the Lord didn’t come until the next morning.</li>

		<itunes:summary>Have you ever had to make a difficult decision concerning a major purchase?  Of course you have.  Who hasn't?

In this episode, we spend some time together looking at the start of Gideon's public life as he gets ready to lead the nation of Israel.  As we well know, he was quite unsure of himself and used the "fleece test" to learn the mind of God.

Do we do the same?  Is there merit to asking for a sign from above when faced with big decisions?

Show Contents -

	Gideon is called by God.
	Israel is again at a low point in their history and have turned their backs on God.  They are living in complete disobedience and are doing evil in the sight of the Lord.
	The Lord has delivered them into the hand of the Midianites for 7 years.
	Judges 6:2-5
	We see Gideon working hard to provide for his family during difficult circumstances.
	Judges 6:6, 12-13
	Gideon did not have a clear picture of the way things really were.  He thinks that God has forsaken them!
	It wasn’t God that had forsaken them, it was the nation of Israel that had forsaken God!
	What happens when we slack off and take our relationship with the Lord for granted?
	Judges 6:14-16
	Gideon is looking at himself and doubting his ability to carry out the Lord’s plans.  And you know what?  He should!
	But he wasn’t going to be alone!  God said “Have I not sent you?”  &amp; “surely I will be with you”.
	Gideon was thinking ahead to the challenges that would await him and was unsure of things.
	What about when we have a genuine need and are truly unsure what the Lord would have us to do?  Is it OK to put out a fleece like Gideon did and ask God for a sign?
	Judges 6:36-40
	Instead of ignoring the Lord and returning to his routine of secretly threshing wheat at the winepresses, he asks for clarification - a sign.
	Why not do as Gideon did and ask for a sign?  Give God a chance to clarify things.
	Nowadays, with quick and accessible credit, the world has made it extremely easy to skip these opportunities for the Lord to show us a sign.
	Gideon had to sleep on it.  His answers from the Lord didn’t come until the next morning.
