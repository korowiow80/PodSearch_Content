The difference between successful people and people that don’t make it are their reactions when these experiences were upon them. Successful people realize that failure is an opportunity to learn and not an opportunity to give up. Successful people realize that obstacles are an opportunity to learn and not an opportunity to turn around. Successful people realize that all negative experiences are opportunities to learn new ways to succeed and not opportunities to throw in the towel and settle for what life gives them. Successful people take control of their lives and never give it back to circumstance, luck, and coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you listened too many of the stories of people that have become successful in life? Usually they came from humble beginnings and against all odds, they overcame their situations. They looked at their current situations and realized that in order to obtain what they have never had, they must do what they have never done. They realized that in order to rise above and out of their current situations, they would need to develop a whatever it takes attitude and let nothing get in their way or deter their pursuit of success. Each person that took the lemons in their life and made lemonade realized that opportunities to be successful are available to all of us but nothing comes easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you approach an obstacle, you always have a choice, you can either overcome or over-complain. Let me give you an example from the bible that will show you how two people looked at obstacles and how their reactions changed the world. When Peter denied Jesus (basically betraying his friendship) he realized that he had failed Jesus and tried to turn and go back to his normal life. Jesus knew that Peter would be a great man of God once he realized who he was and what his destiny entailed but it was up to Peter to walk in that calling. Peter realized his mistake and overcame it, he didn’t let his mistake overcome him. Peter knew he was a disciple of Jesus that made a mistake, not a fisherman posing as a disciple therefore as time progressed he stepped back into his calling and fulfilled his purpose…therefore overcoming his obstacle. Now Judas on the other hand, when he betrayed Jesus, he felt so bad that he hung himself. He let his mistake overcome him and eventually take his life. Judas could have been forgiven because Jesus forgives all that call on Him but Judas didn’t think he was worthy of forgiveness…his mistake was to great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, you are called to greatness and you will have failures, obstacles, rejection, disappointment, hindrances, difficulties, refusal and be told no but don’t let anything stop you from becoming the great man or woman of God that you are destined to be. You know that you are called to do a great thing in this life, you see it when you are thinking about your future, you see visions of you doing great things…that’s what your calling is…its you becoming what you see in those visions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walk in it and let nothing stop you because Success Is Inevitable...So Get Ready!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17651990-116097526042140064?l=jsuccess.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

When you listen to how they overcame great obstacles to achieve their overwhelming success you start to see similarities that set them apart from the masses. In every successful person you see the confidence and courage to make a change. You see the confidence and courage that says, no matter what happens, I will not stop until I achieve success, and I will not settle for a life that is less then what I deserve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial;font-size:85%;"&gt;Many times before we have heard that there were two types of people in life. One time I heard the two types were “people that do or doers” and there were “people that watch or watchers”. Another time I heard there were people that “talk about it” and people that “make it happen”. The last one that I heard was more recent and it was that there were people that “hope success happens” and then there are people that “make success happen”. Now since the last one speaks about success, I'm sure you know why it caught my attention, because we all know success is inevitable. The confidence that comes from people who make success happen comes from them having an understanding of who they really are and what they really can achieve in life. When you start to understand who you are and what you have the capability to accomplish, you start to operate on a level of existence that is higher then most people who let life dictate them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial;font-size:85%;"&gt;According to the bible in Hebrews 4:16 it says “Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.” That verse says to come before God boldly with confidence knowing who you truly are. The problem is that so many people lack confidence in themselves and therefore lack confidence in what they can accomplish in life. It takes courage to step out of the norm and open your own business. It takes courage to step out of the norm and accept your calling. It takes courage to step out of the norm and minister to your friends who don’t want to hear it because they can remember when you were acting a fool yourself. It takes courage to step out of the norm and set goals so high that you have to become a totally different person to achieve because if you can achieve them like you are now then you are not thinking big enough. It takes courage to step out of the norm and write a newsletter every month to thousands of people you don’t know but if you don’t write it you feel like you are not walking in the purpose God has for you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial;font-size:85%;"&gt;Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward ( Hebrews 10:35). Your confidence is what sets you apart. Many people confuse confidence with arrogance or conceit but usually those people are intimidated by a confident person so they try to attack what they cant have. Jesus says that once we accept Him into our hearts we are His brothers and sisters, children of the Lord, therefore let's exhibit the confidence and courage of royalty because success is inevitable…so get ready. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17651990-116097540028397195?l=jsuccess.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Now I am not saying that I didn’t have hard times or go through tribulations that ranged from almost being evicted, sickness, financial despair, loss of a business, back sliding, marriage issues, loss of my spiritual covering, loss of hope, despair, unanswered prayers and many other shortcomings that came and went. The interesting thing I keep noticing is that no matter what comes into my path, my faith never wavers and instead of saying “here we go again”, I say “Come on God, here’s another opportunity to show up and show out”. Although I’m not perfect and I do get upset with God and ask Him why, I have decided that I will believe no matter what and have the faith to let Him come in my life and teach me how to win in every situation…even the ones that look like I have lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I read through the bible and look at all the promises that God has made for us I often wonder how many apply to me today and how many were for the people at those times. When I ask God why I go through things that the promises are supposed to keep me out of, He always tells me, “You already have the victory, just believe”. Now we all know how hard it is to believe those promises when we are going through tough times. When times are rough we sometimes feel those promises are basically just words on paper instead of answers to our problems. Well as of late I have decided to believe every promise that is in the bible. I have decided that my life has had enough mediocrity, enough of just getting by, enough of just making it, enough of I’m just okay. I wanted to experience more success, more prosperity, more healing, more faith, more wisdom, more answered prayer, more anointing and overall more POWER.&lt;br /&gt;When I started to believe everything and change my mindset to one of a conqueror, no, I take that back, I meant the mindset to one of “more then a conqueror” (Romans 8:37 - Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.), I started to see how even when it looked like I was losing, I still had the victory. I started to see how all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to [His] purpose (Romans 8:28). Have you ever noticed how even your worst situations turn into blessings when God is in control? I’ll give you an example, when I was putting together my first business I paid a woman $400 to setup my business for me. She took my $400 and I never heard from her again. Well that infuriated me because I was unemployed at the time and $400 was a lot of money to donate to her purse. The outcome of that was a blessing because I was so motivated to not let anyone take my money again that I setup my own business, wrote a book on how to setup your own business in one day, created a workshop to go with the book and also created a DVD to go with the book. That one incident helped start my information empire that I am currently building because I felt that if I know what’s going on then no one can take advantage of me again. The cost of ignorance (not knowing how to setup my own business) was $400 and now I will make 4 billion dollars teaching others how to start their own business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you approach a situation you have to believe that no matter what happens you are going to win. You have to have the confidence in who you are, the power you have, what you were sent to do and most of all, who lives in you (Hebrews 10:35). You have to believe that you are more then a conqueror and understand that conquerors never lose. You have to understand that Jesus said we will do greater things then He did (John 14:12) and Jesus never lost. Even when people thought He was dead, He rose and defeated all strongholds and gave us the power to win each and every time. The battlefield is the mind and as a man thinketh so is he (Proverbs 23:7). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you don’t know that you are fighting a defeated enemy then you will give them the power to overcome you. We fight enemies that have their hands under their shirts talking about stick em up. Well from here on out we will let them know that we will not lose anymore battles, for even in defeat there is a lesson learned so we still win…we always win and the thanks be to God, Who in Christ always leads us in triumph [as trophies of Christ's victory] and through us spreads and makes evident the fragrance of the knowledge of God everywhere, (2 Corinthians 2:14).&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17651990-116097563538372840?l=jsuccess.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Well step out of that world where life dictates you instead of you dictating your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Life for many people is like a game of poker. When I watch championship poker on ESPN I notice that every player gets two cards to start with. Even though those cards are different, it's still two cards. That's how we start life, we start with different cards but we all have cards. Next the players bid on the cards they are dealt, calculating the risks and rewards of the cards they are dealt. They also consider bluffing or folding if their cards are not what they feel they can win with. This is how we all look at life and the experiences of life. We can either fold, bluff or play the hand we are dealt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here is where successful people are separated from the masses, as the dealer lays out the next three cards, you start to see people fold, get nervous, bluff, panic, think long and hard, as well as pray that the cards that are laid out will help with the cards they already have. Successful people know that no matter what cards are played they will win. If the cards played don't make for a great hand then they will either learn from the experience or make their hand work. The average person will look at the cards that were dealt to them and what the dealer put out and fold until the dealer gives them a good hand. Successful people will make their hand into good hands or better yet...BECOME THE DEALER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In life many people wonder who is controlling their situations and if you ask many people they will usually say "God controls what does and does not happen to me". According to the bible, God is not the one that controls what happens to you…YOU ARE. Your faith lets God come into your life and make things happen, your trust in Him lets Him come in and anoint you to impact this world and your words that you speak based on His word give Him the capability to step into your life and make things happen. Take control of your life and let God work thru you to fulfill your purpose, then you will see how your choice let you start to control your destiny and step into success, because Success in Inevitable…So get Ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17651990-116097548941832854?l=jsuccess.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Merry Christmas is a common saying for this time of year. When you see someone usually between the day after Thanksgiving and December 25, you say Merry Christmas to them to symbolize the Christmas season. Christmas has an underlying meaning that has been changed and commercialized to fit our capitalistic society. Now I am not going to go into the issues with the Christmas because that would just bring down the spirit of the season. But I will say that trying to take Jesus out of Christmas is like taking Dr. King out of his birthday. Instead I want to focus on the true meaning of the term Merry Christmas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial;"&gt;Merry Christmas has three words in it. Most people see two, which are Merry and Christmas but in actuality there are three words. The first word is Merry, which means high spirited delight, to delight one self in. The second word is Christ, which is referring to Jesus Christ, the Messiah, Savior or Anointed One. The third word is mas, which in Spanish means more. Therefore what we are really saying is Merry (delight yourself), Christ, mas (more) or “delight yourself in Christ more”. When you take Christ out of Christmas you are saying Merry -Mas, which means to delight yourself more. Delight yourself more in "what" is the question and when you take Christ out of it, then people will delight themselves in whatever they please and that's the downfall that we see our society experiencing today. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:arial;"&gt;Delight yourself in Christ more is a great way to live life and I appreciate the opportunity to do that everyday. I always heard in my Christian circles that Jesus was the reason for the season but I never realized how much Merry Christmas really sends that message home. Therefore, the next time you tell someone Merry Christmas or someone says Merry Christmas to you remember to delight yourself more in Christ so that His love can delight itself more in you.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17651990-116580383509165656?l=jsuccess.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Whether it be a drastic event, a missed opportunity, a tragedy, a sudden change of fortune or any other unfavorable outcome that has befallen our lives.  We all are guilty of wondering "why me"? Of course we wonder why me prior to blaming numerous people, things, luck or God for our current situation. Things would be so much easier if we just knew the reason for our season. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: arial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Everything in life happens for a reason, whether the reason is caused by you or someone/something else, there is still a reason.  Reasons, explanations, and why's seem to elude us most when we wonder why our lives are not where we want it to be. When many people take a look at their life or their current situation they usually have a sense of non-accomplishment.  When many people look at their lives they feel a lack of purpose and direction.  When many people look at their current situation the question that runs through their mind is "why me". Now if this doesn't apply to you and you have it all together, then go tell someone how you accomplished it but if you have “why me” moments, then please, keep reading. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="font-family: arial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;When you look at the successful future that you know you are going to walk in, you only seem to want to see the final steps of the journey. When we look at the successful people we only desire the end of the road blessings, no one wants the journey lessons that make you into the successful person that you are to become. For example, no one looks at comedian Steve Harvey and says “I know he's rich but I wish I could live in my car for two years so that I can be rich like him”. No one looks at Writer/Producer/Actor Tyler Perry and say “I know he's rich now but I wish I could have my first few plays tank and then get evicted and lose everything so that I can be rich like him.” Everyone wants the glory of crossing the finish line but no one wants to run the race. No one wants to endure falling during the race, scrape their knees, crying profusely only to realize that you have to wipe your own wounds and dry your own tears. We seem to forget that every successful person endured their hardest times right before their breakthrough. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="font-family: arial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Success doesn't come to the lucky, it comes to the persistent. Success doesn't come to the wishful, it comes to the determined, focused and faithful people who change hard times into great lessons. We have to realize that we go through hard times for three reasons. Reason one is so that we can grow, learn and progress. Reason two is so that we can help someone get through their situation when they go through what we already came through. Reason three is so that God gets the glory, God will put you in a situation that you cannot get out of by your own power, gifts, talents and abilities. He wants to bring you out but He wants you to depend on Him to get you out. Once He brings you out He wants you to realize that it was Him that brought you out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="font-family: arial;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;When God is leading all your steps then no matter what comes your way, you will not worry nor fret because you know that the battle is not yours, it's the Lords. Therefore instead of saying “Here we go again” or “Why me” when hard times come upon you, you will say “Here's another situation for you to show up and show out God, so have your way, I'll let you lead me out of this once again.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt;Why me” is the question, “Let me” is God's answer…you are not alone..so don't try to be.

Whether it be a drastic event, a missed opportunity, a tragedy, a sudden change of fortune or any other unfavorable outcome that has befallen our lives. We all are guilty of wondering "why me"? Of course we wonder why me prior to blaming numerous people, things, luck or God for our current situation. Things would be so much easier if we just knew the reason for our season. Everything in life happens for a reason, whether the reason is caused by you or someone/something else, there is still a reason. Reasons, explanations, and why's seem to elude us most when we wonder why our lives are not where we want it to be. When many people take a look at their life or their current situation they usually have a sense of non-accomplishment. When many people look at their lives they feel a lack of purpose and direction. When many people look at their current situation the question that runs through their mind is "why me". Now if this doesn't apply to you and you have it all together, then go tell someone how you accomplished it but if you have “why me” moments, then please, keep reading. When you look at the successful future that you know you are going to walk in, you only seem to want to see the final steps of the journey. When we look at the successful people we only desire the end of the road blessings, no one wants the journey lessons that make you into the successful person that you are to become. For example, no one looks at comedian Steve Harvey and says “I know he's rich but I wish I could live in my car for two years so that I can be rich like him”. No one looks at Writer/Producer/Actor Tyler Perry and say “I know he's rich now but I wish I could have my first few plays tank and then get evicted and lose everything so that I can be rich like him.” Everyone wants the glory of crossing the finish line but no one wants to run the race. No one wants to endure falling during the race, scrape their knees, crying profusely only to realize that you have to wipe your own wounds and dry your own tears. We seem to forget that every successful person endured their hardest times right before their breakthrough. Success doesn't come to the lucky, it comes to the persistent. Success doesn't come to the wishful, it comes to the determined, focused and faithful people who change hard times into great lessons. We have to realize that we go through hard times for three reasons. Reason one is so that we can grow, learn and progress.

When God is leading all your steps then no matter what comes your way, you will not worry nor fret because you know that the battle is not yours, it's the Lords. Therefore instead of saying “Here we go again” or “Why me” when hard times come upon you, you will say “Here's another situation for you to show up and show out God, so have your way, I'll let you lead me out of this once again.” Why me” is the question, “Let me” is God's answer…you are not alone..so don't try to be.

If opportunity came and knocked at your door and said, come with me, would you pack up and go?  If an opportunity to have what you've never had meant that you had to do what you've never done, would you do it?  Most people would say yes to these question because everyone is looking for an opportunity to do better but I believe that many people are comfortable right where they are at. They believe that opportunities come to the lucky or only to those who already have everything going right for themselves.  Opportunities come to those who have their eyes open to see them and the courage to act upon it.  But let's focus on what an opportunity is first.   &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-family: arial;"&gt;The definition of opportunity is as follows:    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style="font-family: arial;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;An appropriate or favorable time or occasion. &lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;A situation or condition favorable for attainment of a goal. &lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;A good position, chance, or prospect, as for advancement or success. &lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;A chance for progress or advancement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: arial;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the definition, an opportunity has a variety of favorable attributes that lead( s) to a successful outcome.  The main attribute of an opportunity is the focus on progress towards a goal.  Many opportunities come across our plates everyday, as a matter of fact I once heard a rich man say ; "We all come across a million dollar opportunity once a day".  Now I don't know about you, but a million dollar opportunity is definitely progress towards a goal.  Another important attribute of an opportunity is a favorable time and situation.  When divine opportunities become available to you, somehow you must realize that the time is right to prosper and therefore understand how favorable the situation is for you.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="font-family: arial;"&gt; On the other hand, we all know people that continually speak or complain about missed opportunities.  We all know people that say how much they could achieve if they had the chance, but when opportunity knocks they don't want to leave the comfort of their bed so they don't answer.  Many people would love to have the opportunity to better their lives but they live only hoping that opportunity falls in their lap.  They become comfortable with a life that (s) just good enough and let their dreams continue to be put on hold.  The reality is that many people are scared to leave the comfort zone of their current life because that could possibly propel them to a level of existence that they might not believe they deserve.  Then again maybe the best line from the movie Coach Carter starring Samuel Jackson sums it up, "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlighten ing about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own lights shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt; When the opportunity came for me to relocate from Chicago to Los Angeles, I had to take a real good look at myself and figure out if I was really ready to take my life and family to another level.  I had to realize the true meaning of divine timing, progress towards success and seizing the day.  In Chicago I was living a life that was good for the moment but the path to get to the great future I had was never clear.  I was very comfortable in my present existence but God always showed me visions of a great future and how I would impact many people with my gifts, talents and abilities. Now we all know that in order to walk in greatness we must take advantage of great opportunities and moving to California provided a great opportunity.  It would get my wife back near her family which she greatly loves, it would give me the opportunity to experience year round summer (I really don't like cold weather) and it would give me an opportunity to showcase my abilities to people that could help me gain exposure.  Within a week of arriving we had all we needed including income, daycare, transportation, lodging and contacts for me to network.  See when God gives you an opportunity He makes sure it goes smooth and according to His plan so that He can get the glory when you testify about how it all came to pass.  So today look at the opportunities in front of you and attempt to pursue one to the fullest and live the life that exceeds just settling.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17651990-825146578732587539?l=jsuccess.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Now I don't believe there are only two types of people in the world, I believe there are many types. I also believe that of those many types, victor or victim is a type that can be added to the list.  Victors and victims define not only where people are in life but where they are going.   Now of course there aren't many people that will say they live their life like a victim, therefore we won't ask the question of whether you are a victor or victim.  It's much easier to look at their actions, listen to their words and analyze where they are trying to go in life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, lets look at the definition of victor and victim.&lt;br /&gt;                           &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table style="font-family: arial;" border="0" cellpadding="3" width="100%"&gt;            &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;              &lt;td valign="top" width="50%"&gt;Victor            &lt;li&gt;a person who has overcome or defeated an adversary &lt;/li&gt;            &lt;li&gt;a conqueror &lt;/li&gt;            &lt;li&gt;a winner in any struggle or contest. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/td&gt;              &lt;td valign="top" width="50%"&gt;Victim             &lt;li&gt;a person who is deceived or cheated, as by his or her own emotions or ignorance, by the dishonesty of others, or by some impersonal agency; &lt;/li&gt;            &lt;li&gt;A person who suffers injury, loss, or death as a result of a voluntary undertaking. &lt;/li&gt;            &lt;li&gt;A person who is tricked, swindled, or taken advantage of &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/td&gt;            &lt;/tr&gt;          &lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;  &lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt; Based on the definitions we see that victors always overcome, victors conquer any situation or obstacle that gets in their way and victors are winners no matter what.  On the other hand, victims are always being taken advantage of, continually lose and are unable to even overcome their emotions or ignorance.  Victors have potential, victims are pitiful.  Victors are conquerors, victims deal with consequences. Victors always win, victims hope they win.  Victors control their life, victims let life control them.  Many people desire to live a life of victory but their situations and words are those of victims.  How many times have you heard people say, well thats just how I am?  That's just how I am is a victim statement, it's an excuse to not have to change, progress or overcome a situation so they would rather be a victim of the situation or their ignorance of the benefits of change.  How many times have you seen people mock, deride or pull someone down who wants to better themselves.  Victims don't want to see others who were like them become victors because victors expose the weaknesses of victims and their desire to complain but do nothing to change.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial;"&gt; Victors are always in control even when the situation appears out of control.  Have you ever wondered why some people are able to keep their cool no matter what's going on around them?  Have you ever wondered why some people don't let anything get to them and even when it appears they are about to crack they seem to still hold it together?  Victors receive their victory from within, they have tapped into that inner peace and inner joy that surpasses all understanding.  Victors have found a source of victory that seems to convince them that they will win no matter the situation, circumstance or odds.  Victors realize that no matter what they will win because for some reason they have accepted victory as the only option, so even when it looks like they are going to lose, they still win.  See the source of this victory that I am speaking of, that gives joy to the victor before the battle is done or the obstacle is overcome, well that source goes by the name of Jesus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17651990-6061632088497946886?l=jsuccess.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

See the source of this victory that I am speaking of, that gives joy to the victor before the battle is done or the obstacle is overcome, well that source goes by the name of Jesus.Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>success,christian,God,Jesus,entrepreneurship,jason,caston,j,success,business,my,success,academy,motivation</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://jsuccess.blogspot.com/2007/04/victors-vs-victims.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/jsuccess/~5/Gc4ycTbAg9g/victorsvictims.mp3" length="3277116" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://www.iamsuccess.net/success/victorsvictims.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Today matters</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/jsuccess/~3/MBK0DcklsQc/today-matters.html</link><category>bible</category><category>success</category><category>motivation</category><category>today</category><category>joseph</category><author>jasoncaston@gmail.com (J Success)</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jun 2007 16:06:36 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-17651990.post-3212771449677215048</guid><description>&lt;h3 style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.iamsuccess.net/success/todaymatters.mp3"&gt;For audio click here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What do you plan to do today?  What will happen in your life today that was different from yesterday?  Does today even matter to you or is it just a day in the way of the weekend?  In the constant pursuit of what we are to become, what we are purposed to achieve and what we see as our destiny, we often lose sight of what's right in front of us.  We get so focused on the frame that we don't see the picture. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You know that you are destined for greatness in the future but today looks so bleak.  Therefore we don't want to look at what appears different then what we want to see.  If we took a look at the bigger picture and saw the transformation and progression that's taking place then we would see things quite differently. In a previous article titled "Why Me" I wrote: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;When you look at the successful future that you know you are going to walk in, you only seem to want to see the final steps of the journey. When we look at the successful people we only desire the end of the road blessings, no one wants the journey lessons that make you into the successful person that you are to become. For example, no one looks at comedian Steve Harvey and says “I know he's rich but I wish I could live in my car for two years so that I can be rich like him”. No one looks at Writer/Producer/Actor Tyler Perry and say “I know he's rich now but I wish I could have my first few plays tank and then get evicted and lose everything so that I can be rich like him.” Everyone wants the glory of crossing the finish line but no one wants to run the race. No one wants to endure falling during the race, scrape their knees, crying profusely only to realize that you have to wipe your own wounds and dry your own tears. We seem to forget that every successful person endured their hardest times right before their breakthrough.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best example of the perfect mindset to take and appreciate today would be Joseph.  Joseph dreamed a dream that his father and brothers would one day bow down to him.  After that dream he was thrown into a pit by his brothers, became a slave, falsely accused of rape, thrown in jail, become a part of the kings court and eventually became a major figure in Pharaoh’s court.  Never did we hear Joseph complain about his circumstances, never did he not take advantage of each day knowing that every step he took got him closer to his destiny and never did we see Joseph give up and complain that he was not going to be anything in life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today is the only day that you can use to take steps towards the great future you see.  Yesterday is gone forever and tomorrow never comes, it’s always today.  When we start to realize that time is the most important resource that we have in life, then we appreciate today more because the minute we are born our lives are on a countdown.  Carpe Diem is the French term for “seize today”.  Remember, today is the beginning of the rest of your life, today is the best day of your life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17651990-3212771449677215048?l=jsuccess.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

That question has confused and defined many men throughout the ages.  The general consensus is that whoever is able to find themselves, their purpose and why they are here would experience great success in life.  Those that struggle to find themselves and their path would be left to hoping, wishing and searching for the true meaning of the reflection in the mirror.  This pursuit of self often translates into success or lack thereof within the workplace. Many people either excel or underachieve based on their view of self and where they see themselves in the future.  They also understand that future outcomes are based on today's actions therefore if they do much today they will have much in the future and if they do nothing today then they will have nothing in the future.  To develop "You: The Brand", you have to have quite a few characteristics that are displayed by today's strongest  brands.  When you hear people speak about top brands such as Coca Cola, Microsoft and GE, you think of things such as dependability, visibility, innovative and successful.  These are qualities that each of us should have in developing ourselves as a brand.  The people that are most successful understand themselves so well that they are in essence their own brand and they sell themselves with the utmost skill, they become the person they want to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A key step in developing "You: The Brand" is to develop unwavering confidence in yourself.  Confidence is defined as belief in oneself and one's powers or abilities. In order for you to show others that you can provide what they are looking for, you have to believe that you can provide what it is they need.  There have been many situations where I had no idea how to reach the solution that someone required of me but because I spoke with confidence people were more then comfortable that I could figure it out within the required time frame.  When approaching a problem you have to believe that you can either figure out or find the solution.  There can never be a problem without a solution.  The issue that most people run into when they approach a problem isn't that there is "no solution", it's that they don't have enough confidence in "their" ability to find the solution.  Remember, people don't know what you are capable of until you let them know, if you are confident that you can do anything then people can either believe you or sit back and watch you achieve it.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Communication is another key skill in developing "You:The Brand".  Communication is the key to solving many problems in today's society.  Not only is communication the key to solving problems but communication is a primary key in advancing in career and business aspirations.  Effective communicators are able to easily and efficiently speak their thoughts, intentions and desires.  They are able to communicate so well that their audience is able to see a visual picture based on their oratory explanation.  Many times when we watch talk shows, newscasts, or any talk based media we find that we are drawn in more by hosts who can communicate at the highest levels without filler words such as ah, um and so.  I am a part of the professional speaking organization known as Toastmasters International and when I give speeches I am critiqued based not only on my presentation but my adequate usage of words.  I always thought I was an effective communicator but I wasn't aware of the filler words that I used in speaking and how fast I spoke.  The people that I were around most spoke that way so I never noticed that I spoke the same and since people have short attention spans, I had learned to speak as quickly as possible.  Within a few presentations I had corrected my word usage and now I speak clearly and more slowly to make sure I pronounce all words to further impact my point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Communication is indeed a lost art but speaking without substance is a quick way to turn people away from "You:The Brand".  We have all come across people who talk much about nothing.  You have to have knowledge behind the words you use so that when you speak on topics, people listen.  John Maxwell said that only 1/3 of all adults read a book after high school.  How can we acquire knowledge if we don't read?  I make it a point to read many websites and many books on the topics that I strive to become knowledgeable in.  Daily I read books and websites on leadership, technology, ministry and web design.  It has been said that if you read 3 books on a topic then you are knowledgeable, if you read 5 books you are well versed in it and if you read 10 books then you are an expert.  I found that when I spoke on topics, many people would listen because I had researched the topics prior to speaking.  I learned in the book of Proverbs that the wise are quick to listen and slow to speak, but fools are quick to speak and slow to listen.  Therefore I would listen and learn from many on topics and when I could add to the conversation I would then speak.  In my previous article "Reading is fundamental, research is critical", I wrote that research is critical to advancement and when you stop learning you stop growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final step to developing "You: The Brand" is to become unique.  When you look at the major brands, you see they are unique in their field.  Coca Cola has a secret formula that makes it unique from all other beverages.  Microsoft is the only company that provides all the software and computer related solutions that it does.  When you start to look at what you are bringing to the table, you need to make sure that you are unique from your competitors.  You want to make sure that the solutions you provide, talents you bring and leadership you exemplify sets you apart from anyone or any company that tries to out perform you.  Your approach, insight and process should be one that shows that you may not be the cheapest, fastest or shortest way to the solution but you are the best and your way is the only way they should use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now take steps to become the person you want to be, start to walk in who you believe you are and you will become that person.  The steps you take today get you closer to your goals of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17651990-7310669222228207143?l=jsuccess.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

A few Sundays ago Pastor Conley spoke about praying and the benefits of praying consistently.  He also spoke about the necessity of prayer and how it impacted the life of Jesus and how it impacts (or detracts) from our lives.  While explaining the importance of prayer, Pastor Conley gave a great acronym for the word Pray.  It was Praise, Repent, Ask and Yield.  These simple four steps helped Pastor Conley develop a structured prayer life and continually get answers when he petitioned God for anything that his heart desired.  As he broke down each one, I listened intently on the explanation.&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;Praise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you start your prayer to God you should always start with praise.  We all know God is an awesome God so we should take time to let God know that we believe He is awesome still.  We want to let God know that we are not taking Him or His blessings for granted in our lives and each additional breath is better then the one before it.  When we offer our praises up to God we can continue to let Him know that He is first in our lives and that His splendor, glory and grace give us more then enough reasons to praise Him.  Make sure when you pray you are letting God know that in this moment, I am overjoyed at all that you have done, are doing and will do in our lives and my words are just not enough to speak on all that I am thankful for. &lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;Repent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you praise God to your hearts content, ask for forgiveness for the sins that you have committed.  Repentance is a key part of our Christian walk, 1 John 1: 9 says "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."  Therefore, once we repent we are back walking in our righteousness and able to walk in the authority that God has given us.  Remember when you have unforgiven sin, if you are saved you will still go to Heaven but you are out of the righteousness of God but not uncovered by the blood of Jesus Christ.   Repentance is heartfelt sorrow for the sins you have committed, a strong desire to not continue to commit sins and new outlook that will not dwell on past sins.  When you ask God for forgiveness then God says that He will remember your sins no more for your own sake.  Therefore if God forgets our sins then why would we continue to carry them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are done repenting then it is time to ask for what it is your heart desires.   In Hebrews it says to come boldly to the throne room to make your petitions of the Lord.  Therefore when you ask God for what it is that you desire, make sure you have the faith and confidence that He will do it.  Everyone believes that God is capable of answering their prayers but not everyone believes that God "will" answer their prayers.  Isaiah 45:11 says "Thus says the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker: Would you question Me about things to come concerning My children, and concerning the work of My hands [would you] command Me?"  Many people hope that God answers their prayers but according to the bible, God asks us to command His hands...interesting isn't it?  Remember when you ask to ask in Jesus name, for John 16:23 says " And when that time comes, you will ask nothing of Me [you will need to ask Me no questions]. I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, that My Father will grant you whatever you ask in My Name [as presenting all that I AM]."  Therefore, ask in confidence and faith what you desire of the Lord and make sure it is in Jesus name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yield&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, when you are nearing the end of your prayer, yield and listen to what God has to say.  I was listening to a song by Deitrick Haddon recently and he said, "Stand still and know that He is God".  When you are yielding make sure you stand still and know that God wants to speak to you and it is imperative that we learn to listen.  Many of us are the world's best speakers but very few of us can listen to anyone.  It took me a long time to learn to listen and my wife will attest to that but now I have learned to listen when I pray and make sure that anything and everything God has to tell me, I will hear.  God's got a message for each and every one of us, let's all listen to what He has to say.  &lt;strong&gt;AMEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17651990-8046088902913163317?l=jsuccess.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

We want to let God know that we are not taking Him or His blessings for granted in our lives and each additional breath is better then the one before it. When we offer our praises up to God we can continue to let Him know that He is first in our lives and that His splendor, glory and grace give us more then enough reasons to praise Him. Make sure when you pray you are letting God know that in this moment, I am overjoyed at all that you have done, are doing and will do in our lives and my words are just not enough to speak on all that I am thankful for. Repent After you praise God to your hearts content, ask for forgiveness for the sins that you have committed. Repentance is a key part of our Christian walk, 1 John 1: 9 says "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." Therefore, once we repent we are back walking in our righteousness and able to walk in the authority that God has given us. Remember when you have unforgiven sin, if you are saved you will still go to Heaven but you are out of the righteousness of God but not uncovered by the blood of Jesus Christ. Repentance is heartfelt sorrow for the sins you have committed, a strong desire to not continue to commit sins and new outlook that will not dwell on past sins. When you ask God for forgiveness then God says that He will remember your sins no more for your own sake. Therefore if God forgets our sins then why would we continue to carry them. Ask When you are done repenting then it is time to ask for what it is your heart desires. In Hebrews it says to come boldly to the throne room to make your petitions of the Lord. Therefore when you ask God for what it is that you desire, make sure you have the faith and confidence that He will do it. Everyone believes that God is capable of answering their prayers but not everyone believes that God "will" answer their prayers. Isaiah 45:11 says "Thus says the Lord, the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker: Would you question Me about things to come concerning My children, and concerning the work of My hands [would you] command Me?" Many people hope that God answers their prayers but according to the bible, God asks us to command His hands...interesting isn't it? Remember when you ask to ask in Jesus name, for John 16:23 says " And when that time comes, you will ask nothing of Me [you will need to ask Me no questions]. I assure you, most solemnly I tell you, that My Father will grant you whatever you ask in My Name [as presenting all that I AM]." Therefore, ask in confidence and faith what you desire of the Lord and make sure it is in Jesus name. Yield Finally, when you are nearing the end of your prayer, yield and listen to what God has to say. I was listening to a song by Deitrick Haddon recently and he said, "Stand still and know that He is God". When you are yielding make sure you stand still and know that God wants to speak to you and it is imperative that we learn to listen. Many of us are the world's best speakers but very few of us can listen to anyone.

Many times I get a blank stare, followed by an "ummmmm"  and then usually I don't know.  Quite a few times I received an answer  such as to be rich, comfortable in life or something along those  lines.  Now I am definitely an advocate of being financially  comfortable in life and having more then just enough but when the best  answer someone has to "what's your goal in life" is to be rich, well  then that's what I call the equivalent of chasing the wind.  Money is a  byproduct of a greater goal in life, not the greatest goal in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chasing  the wind is a symptom that I have seen more often then not in many  people.  Chasing the wind was something that I did as a child and in my  mind I believed that I had caught the wind many a days.  If you have  never chased the wind, let me explain it to you how I would do it. I was born and raised in Chicago Illinois, commonly referred to as the windy city and on many days  I would go out with a jar and catch the wind.  I would hold out my jar  and let some of the wind blow into it and then I would quickly seal up  the jar and run in the house.  Funny thing would happen when I got into  the house and opened my jar to experience the wind that I had caught,  there was nothing there.  Since I was a child my thoughts were to go  outside and try harder, run faster or chase longer to get more wind  into the jar but in reality I was just passing the time because wind is  uncatchable.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I see people today chasing after  materialistic things today I picture them as children with jars running  around the yard as I used to.    Materialistic riches are never enough  and no matter how much we get, we always want more.  The only people  that say they don't want more material things are dead people.  When I  explain to people how to see life with a wider lens and see the bigger  picture, I want them to learn that money, fame, and material things are  a byproduct of a bigger goal in life.  When I tell them that the more  they walk in their purpose, see the actual worth of their life and  realize they are here to do something great, the more they will see  that material things are great to have but small in the grand scheme of  things.  Money and material things can come and go but a person who is  living a life of purpose will never go without because their  determination and focus will provide them with numerous ways to make  money over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt; When  you take a look at your life today, what motivates it?  Are you chasing  the wind day in and day out hoping that one day the wind will jump in  your jar?  Or do you live a life of purpose and see that you will be  something great in life and that you are just getting prepared for your  time to showcase what it is that God has put in you to show the world.

I couldn't understand why the sun had to go away every night  for no apparent reason.  I knew that when I would wakeup in the morning  the sun would be there for me to go outside and play but for some  strange reason as the day progressed, the sun would leave me.  When the  sun fully left for the day then my playtime would come to an end and I  would have to get home quickly, always before the street lights came  on.  My mother tried to explain to me that the sun will come back  tomorrow and I will be able to play again, but it wasn't until the sun came back a few times that I finally believed her. I could have believed her based on what she said but more often than not experience has to replace words as our teacher because of our lack of understanding and faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When  hard times are visiting our daily lives all we see are dark nights  followed by dreary days and both have no light in sight.  "A night is  only as dark as you think it appears", are great words usually quoted  by people that are not going through present difficulties. To hear the  night is only as dark as we think it appears seems to have no helpful  effects because we believe this is the darkest night that we have seen  thus far.  We also believe that since our life is going through this  dark period, there is no way it could be lighter if we could somehow  change the way we "thought" about it, what does our thinking have to do  with the darkness we see and are experiencing.  Again, we see that even  though the words stated are true, it's the &lt;em&gt;experiences &lt;/em&gt;that  we are having that have the most impact on us and thus we disregard  great words as just letters spoken that have no application to our  lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When  attempting to endure a difficult period we want to often just say,  "don't teach me just tell me", but the question is, will we really  learn from words alone?  In school we learn lessons, facts, methods and  quotes from the words of an instructor but we are given tangible tests  because there needs to be validation of words learned.  In  life we desire to get the great results but never want to walk the  difficult paths that those goals require.  It takes a great amount of  faith to walk through a valley, with a map that says take the difficult  path, and believe that at the end of that path is the increase that you  so dearly seek.   The true lesson seems to be learned not when someone tells you that the  increase awaits you, not when you read the map and see the actual steps  to take to the increase and not when you are walking the path and  cannot see any increase.  The true lesson is learned when you obtain the  increase that was promised to you and look back and realize that  everything said to you was true, then and only then will you go tell  someone else how to walk in faith and hopefully they will believe your  words.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17651990-684451619030383161?l=jsuccess.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Now remove the word bar and input the word basketball court and you actually have a snapshot of my daily life.  Every evening around 7pm I meet up with my friends and we play basketball.  Normally, we only like to play on each other’s team and if there were ever any altercations on the court, we are the first to step up for each other.  This unspoken bond is an example of tolerance and progress at its best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are an eclectic bunch of gentlemen and even though we have differences, we embrace our similarities.  We don’t need to speak about the years of fighting known as the crusades, which would have people of our religions fighting each other upon sight.  We don’t need to speak about the holocaust, which shines a dark light on our history and unnecessary persecution.  We don’t even speak about the fear some people have that comes from the perception of the Muslim religion.  See these things are divisive and in order for us to keep winning on the basketball court and in our friendship, we need to stand together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though we make jokes about each other’s differences, it’s all in good fun because we know that our differences are only important enough to laugh at.  We are only serious when the basketball game is on the line and we need to score the winning basket.

We seem to thrive and grow the more we know about each other and therefore the bonds grow stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is much more then I ever expected in life since I grew up around people who were like me and never had the opportunity to embrace others who weren’t like me.  I went to church with only people who shared my beliefs so I could never ask other people why they believed what they believe.  I only associated with people who did the things I did therefore I never had the opportunity to ask other people what they like to do.  This is the best of embracing my new friends because they are so different from me but share the best similarity in basketball.  Therefore, let me retell my joke the correct way.  Three guys walk onto a basketball court, one’s a Jew named Reid, one’s a Muslim named Rasheed, and one’s a Christian named J. Success.

Now remove the word bar and input the word basketball court and you actually have a snapshot of my daily life. Every evening around 7pm I meet up with my friends and we play basketball. Normally, we only like to play on each other’s team and if there were ever any altercations on the court, we are the first to step up for each other. This unspoken bond is an example of tolerance and progress at its best. We are an eclectic bunch of gentlemen and even though we have differences, we embrace our similarities. We don’t need to speak about the years of fighting known as the crusades, which would have people of our religions fighting each other upon sight. We don’t need to speak about the holocaust, which shines a dark light on our history and unnecessary persecution. We don’t even speak about the fear some people have that comes from the perception of the Muslim religion.

Success and IamSuccess.   My goal was to have 2 - 3 articles/podcasts per month on a motivational topic to help each of you in your pursuit of purpose and success.  In the midst of posting these articles/podcasts, I started to get ideas on how to reach you in a better and more useful manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last six months I have created 10 books and ebooks, 4 additional ecourses, 3 training videos, an online store with downloads, a magazine, an online tv station, an online school, a social network and a variety of other success related products and services that will help you in your pursuit.  I am putting this altogether into a newly revamped IamSuccess Network that will be your #1 success destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, I have broken down my approach to success based training into 6 hours of impact that I call the HomeBase method.  By focusing on physical health, spiritual health, financial health, pursuit of purpose, career progress, and family relationships as the pillars of true success, I have found the foundations for a truly successful life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coming soon, the new and improved IamSuccess.net, your online success destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class='zemanta-pixie'&gt;&lt;img src='http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=718a9864-5c26-4644-8709-fcdec4961433' class='zemanta-pixie-img'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17651990-6155767930259461153?l=jsuccess.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Yesterday I went to see Chinese Herbal doctor &lt;a href="http://leslieduong.com/"&gt;Leslie Duong&lt;/a&gt;, she is a straight forward, humorous lady with a great knowledge for Chinese Herbal medicines.  The reason I went to see her was that a co-worker referred her when I mentioned that my cholesterol had went up "again" due to my lack of exercise.  The reason I had not exercised in the past 3 - 4 months was due to some over zealous weekend jock trying to &lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--E-mT1f8VAM/ThoFMZNO0cI/AAAAAAAADx8/WM4p20OChns/s1600/photo.jpeg" target="_blank"&gt;break my entire hand&lt;/a&gt; on the basketball court.  The reason I was even playing basketball was that I had just gotten my cholesterol under control and I was exercising 3 times a week and eating great.  Well once I got hurt, I lost interest in working out and thus my cholesterol suffered a bit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last week, I went to my regular doctor and had a physical and he said my cholesterol (and weight) had went up substantially and I then informed him that I had gotten away from exercising. Fast forward to yesterday, I spoke with Leslie and informed her that I just wanted to lose about 15 - 20 pounds over 6 months, get back to working out, get my cholesterol down and eventually get my wife in there to see her and get on a regiment as well that included basketball.  Leslie took a look at me and asked if my back hurt when I played ball, to which I responded yes at times.  I thought it was due to stretching but she said it was my kidneys...ummm..ok.  She then said that I appeared young and relatively healthy but she knew that I needed to change my eating habits and cleanse my body.  My first thoughts were that she wanted me to do a detox, of which I was against, ive already had moments of taking to much exlax and I refused to take anything that would resemble that.  Leslie explained to me that Chinese Herbs are a different type of cleanse, a more gentle cleanse and they get my cholesterol, as well as a host of other issues, under control and back to normal.  Once my body was cleansed of the "processed garbage" I had been putting into it for years, I would then be able to maintain a healthy diet, weight and lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was prescribed 2 things todo, one was to drink 40 ounces of these special teas, and the only thing I could add to them for taste was honey.  I figured I could do that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WZIDeflFrDs/ThoH3m-sJ4I/AAAAAAAADyM/wcG2y_lUfAA/s1600/11%2B-%2B1-2.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WZIDeflFrDs/ThoH3m-sJ4I/AAAAAAAADyM/wcG2y_lUfAA/s200/11%2B-%2B1-2.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Guz5shLx8-w/ThoIBESYPrI/AAAAAAAADyU/kcQL6ygLAMs/s1600/11%2B-%2B1-1.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Guz5shLx8-w/ThoIBESYPrI/AAAAAAAADyU/kcQL6ygLAMs/s200/11%2B-%2B1-1.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Next, after every meal, which was 3 of them, I was told to take 20 pills....yep, thats right, 20 pills.  They look like this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nDR5Y_TwBe0/ThoIcqMk0QI/AAAAAAAADyc/XAHkovMpzHk/s1600/11%2B-%2B1.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="239" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nDR5Y_TwBe0/ThoIcqMk0QI/AAAAAAAADyc/XAHkovMpzHk/s320/11%2B-%2B1.jpeg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Yesterday I took the pills for the first time in the afternoon and today I have drank the tea and taken more pills.  I can only say that I have noticed three things:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;My kidneys didnt hurt this morning when I woke up, they normally do because I have to use the bathroom very badly when I wake up..not the case today. &amp;nbsp;Well, I still had to go but there was no back pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have been to the bathroom ALOT today, mainly doing #1 because of drinking this tea..but I have also went #2 twice. &amp;nbsp;That's one time more then I usually go per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pills (these are the small ones, she said they have bigger ones) are hard to swallow for me because I dont like to take pills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's all for now....see ya tomorrow&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17651990-4142633236191986549?l=jsuccess.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Well I overslept and then I had to play catchup on some work tasks and didn't end up eating breakfast till 11am.  From there I didn't get to my first set of pills until 12pm and my tea at 1pm.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tea is amazingly easy to drink, and this is from someone who doesn't drink tea, coffee, water, or anything besides juice.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WZIDeflFrDs/ThoH3m-sJ4I/AAAAAAAADyM/wcG2y_lUfAA/s1600/11%2B-%2B1-2.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WZIDeflFrDs/ThoH3m-sJ4I/AAAAAAAADyM/wcG2y_lUfAA/s200/11%2B-%2B1-2.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Guz5shLx8-w/ThoIBESYPrI/AAAAAAAADyU/kcQL6ygLAMs/s1600/11%2B-%2B1-1.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="150" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Guz5shLx8-w/ThoIBESYPrI/AAAAAAAADyU/kcQL6ygLAMs/s200/11%2B-%2B1-1.jpeg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The problem I am having isn't even my restrictive diet of fruits, veggies, chicken and fish.  No, my issue is these FREAKIN PILLS:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nDR5Y_TwBe0/ThoIcqMk0QI/AAAAAAAADyc/XAHkovMpzHk/s1600/11%2B-%2B1.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="239" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nDR5Y_TwBe0/ThoIcqMk0QI/AAAAAAAADyc/XAHkovMpzHk/s320/11%2B-%2B1.jpeg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Im telling you, these pills ain't no joke.  I find myself able to get maybe 6 - 10 down with no problem, but those next 10 - 14, yea those are a problem for me.  I mean, for real, the pills look like little coco puffs, and who wants to swallow cocoa puffs whole...not me!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As for my bathroom runs and so on, I am pretty normal now, just a few times a day, with only one time doing #2 and 4 - 5 times doing #1.  It seems my body is adjusting.  Oh, and I played basketball today and I didnt have that much backpain afterwards, I did stretch tho.  Maybe, these pills are helping my kidneys more than I thought...time will tell.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;Success is Inevitable...So Get Ready...www.iamsuccess.net&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17651990-6519439456683433253?l=jsuccess.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;
