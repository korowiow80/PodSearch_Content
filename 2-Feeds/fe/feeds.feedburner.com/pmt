Please grab a cup of coffee, tea or whatever you want to sip on and join me for awhile as I run through a hot topic that’s been on my mind lately.</p>
<p>I can sum up today’s topic with this statement:</p>
<p><strong>Moms, stop fighting all of your kid’s battles It’s going to turn them into whiny, weak adults.</strong></p>
<p>Think about it, if you always run to your child’s side, fight their battles and fix everything for them, how will they ever learn to stand up for themselves and figure things out with confidence?</p>
<p>During today&#8217;s show I am talking about how jumping in too soon to fight your child&#8217;s battles actually cripples them throughout their childhood and into their adult lives as well. I am also sharing a few tips on how you can help to boost your child&#8217;s inner strength and give them the tools that they need to fight their own battles and make good decisions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been blogging about this topic for the past week and my most recent blog entry &#8216;<a href="http://www.reallifecoaching.net/nobody-likes-a-whiner/" target="_blank">Nobody Likes a Whiner</a>&#8216; has sparked up quite a good conversation.</p>
<p>Be sure to listen to the entire show because I have a big announcement. I am hosting a totally Free Coaching Class on Thursday, February 2nd at 9:00pm Eastern. You can sign up for that class by clicking on this link&#8211;&gt; <a href="http://www.reallifecoaching.net/class/" target="_blank">http://www.reallifecoaching.net/class/</a></p>
<p>During the class I will be sharing strategies that will help you know when and how to step into or step back from the battles our kids face.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>Are you a parent who&#8217;s hitting the proverbial &#8220;brick wall&#8221; with your teen? Our teens are mysterious creatures. We set them on a path to independence and yet if they hang with the wrong crowd or if they don&#8217;t mature as quickly as we want (or need) them to, they can make mistakes with serious consequences.</p>
<p><a href="http://parentingmyteen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sues_photo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2508 alignright" title="sues_photo" src="http://parentingmyteen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/sues_photo.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="241" /></a>My guest this week is Sue Scheff, a parent who, through her own experiences, has become an expert at finding reputable help and resources for troubled teens and their parents. Sue is the founder of <a href="http://helpyourteens.com/" target="_blank">P.U.R.E., Parents Universal Resource Experts</a>, a teen and parenting advocacy organization that has assisted families with valuable information and resources for their children and teens who are struggling with today&#8217;s peer pressure, experimenting with drugs and alcohol, and simply good kids starting to make bad choices.</p>
<p>Sue is very open in this interview, sharing her story about how she was desperate to help her daughter and resorted to sending her away to a &#8220;treatment program&#8221;. She very clearly states that sending her daughter away for treatment was NOT the mistake; the mistake came in not doing enough research about this particular program.</p>
<p>Listen in as Sue talks about the many steps that parents and guardians can take when finding help for troubled children when we feel we&#8217;ve lost hope and exhausted all of our resources.   Sue explains that the 1st step is to not play the &#8220;Blame Game&#8221; and she also lets us know that we are not alone.</p>
<p>Most of all, Sue reminds us to not give up on our teens. Yes, it&#8217;s difficult and no, they won&#8217;t want to listen to what we say as parents, but there IS hope.</p>
<p>For more information about P.U.R.E. visit <a href="http://helpyourteens.com" target="_blank">http://helpyourteens.com</a></p>
<p>Sue is also the author &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wits-End-Resources-Out-Control/dp/0757306977/ref=ase_reallifesolut-20" target="_blank">Wit&#8217;s End! Advice and Resources for Saving Your Out of Control Teen</a>&#8221; . This book  is the shockingly gripping story of how Sue turned her mistakes—and her relationship with her daughter—around.  This book is a much-needed guide—written by a parent who has been there—that helps parents navigate the choices and methods available to them and their child. It serves as an action plan that empowers parents—and their children—toward healing.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>We all know how popular cell phones are with teens these days. How many times a day do you see teens either chatting or texting their friends? It can seem endless, right?</p>
<p>But with the advances in technology come certain threats or issues that can plague teens. In the case of cell phones, the biggest challenge is <strong>sexting </strong>and Aurelia offers parents some tips for helping their teens to avoid this dangerous trap.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1346" title="Parenting My Teen Podcast" src="http://parentingmyteen.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/sexting.jpg" alt="Parenting My Teen Podcast" width="146" height="173" />Sexting is a term that describes when teens take texting messages to their friends one step further by sending revealing &#8211; or even nude &#8211; photos of themselves to other kids. Sometimes these are sent as a way to start a relationship but other times these images can be manipulated on the computer and sent around schools as a way to ostracize or make fun of a student.</p>
<p>Think it&#8217;s just girls sending these photos, in hopes of landing a boyfriend? Think again! Studies show <strong>21 percent of teen girls and 18 percent of teen boys</strong> have electronically sent, or posted online, nude or semi-nude images of themselves.</p>
<p>So what can parents do?</p>
<p>Most importantly, talk to your children.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discuss the dangers of having these photos online anywhere because once they are posted, they never actually disappear.</li>
<li>Know your child&#8217;s friends, both online and offline.</li>
<li>Talk about the consequences of sexting. Many states consider sexting a form of child pornography, which can lead to being labeled a sex offender.</li>

		<itunes:summary>We all know how popular cell phones are with teens these days. How many times a day do you see teens either chatting or texting their friends? It can seem endless, right?
But with the advances in technology come certain threats or issues that can plague teens. In the case of cell phones, the biggest challenge is sexting and Aurelia offers parents some tips for helping their teens to avoid this dangerous trap.
Sexting is a term that describes when teens take texting messages to their friends one step further by sending revealing – or even nude – photos of themselves to other kids. Sometimes these are sent as a way to start a relationship but other times these images can be manipulated on the computer and sent around schools as a way to ostracize or make fun of a student.
Think it’s just girls sending these photos, in hopes of landing a boyfriend? Think again! Studies show 21 percent of teen girls and 18 percent of teen boys have electronically sent, or posted online, nude or semi-nude images of themselves.
So what can parents do?
Most importantly, talk to your children.

Discuss the dangers of having these photos online anywhere because once they are posted, they never actually disappear.
Know your child’s friends, both online and offline.
Talk about the consequences of sexting. Many states consider sexting a form of child pornography, which can lead to being labeled a sex offender.

If you need help talking to your teen but don’t know where to start, check out our special report, Real Life Guidance to Understanding Your Teen.

We spend so much time over the years keeping our kids safe and teaching them life lessons that we can only hope they&#8217;re listening to.</p>
<p>But at some point, after doing all this work, it&#8217;s time to let them experience their own independence and this can be very difficult for some parents.</p>
<p>This week my guest is my podcast producer, Christina Lemmey, who is a work at home mom and owner of <a href="http://multimediava.com/services-rates" target="_blank">Multimedia VA</a>. She shared her concerns about her 6th grader going on a field trip to an amusement park and how difficult it is as a mother to cut the strings and allow her to go with a new group of friends and unknown chaperones.</p>
<p>I gave Christina some important tips for talking with her daughter about how she expected her to act and behave on the trip and I explained why it was a <em><strong>good</strong></em> thing her daughter didn&#8217;t want her mom to chaperone the trip (and no, we&#8217;re not blaming the tempermental tween hormones!)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not too late to help plan an exciting summer for your teen.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>Time is flying by.. summer is fast approaching and summer vacation is around the corner.</p>
<p>Even if your teen is very mature and you are comfortable with them staying home by themselves during the summer, for your teen it would be good if he or she has some activities planned that will keep them busy and out of trouble.</p>
<p>This week I&#8217;m joined by Mary Lutz of <a href="http://www.provbs.com" target="_blank">Professional Virtual Business Solutions</a> and we chatted about our own kids&#8217; graduations and how fast the school year went. We also spoke about what we&#8217;ve done with our own teens during the summer break and gave lots of great ideas for your teens.</p>
<p>Not that your teen needs supervision or a baby sitter, but your teen needs something that will encourage thinking, give her some responsibility, accountability and guidance. Here are just a few of our suggestions for keeping teens busy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volunteering (most schools require 100 community service hrs. so volunteering over the summer is a good idea.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Getting a Summer job or a creative self employment idea &#8211; earns money, gain some independance &amp; teaches responsiblility. Using resources that your city has available.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>YMCA/community centers &#8211; some off free programs for teens, sporting events</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reallifeguidance.com/schools-out.html" target="_blank">School’s Out! Plan For the Perfect Teen Summer Toolkit<br />
</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you and your teen plan for the summer &#8211; I hope it will be a safe and enjoyable one!</p>
