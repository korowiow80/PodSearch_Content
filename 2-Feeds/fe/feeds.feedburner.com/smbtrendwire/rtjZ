Small and medium sized companies have the opportunity to do business in new and emerging markets, but they need international payment solutions and customized advice on foreign exchange. Despite advances in technology, cross border payments continue to present challenges for businesses. The major causes of these challenges are hidden fees, a lack of transparency, and inefficient processes.</p>

<li>(8:08) What does &#8220;hedging&#8221; actually mean to a small business?</li>
<li>(9:28) Is that something that Western Union can provide?</li>
<li>(10:23) How can a company keep up with the speed of global payments?</li>
<li>(12:50) The current economic landscape has been brutal these last couple years.  How do you manage international payments in that type of environment?</li>

		<itunes:summary>With the rise of globalization, the world is increasingly trading across borders. Small and medium sized companies have the opportunity to do business in new and emerging markets, but they need international payment solutions and customized advice on foreign exchange. Despite advances in technology, cross border payments continue to present challenges for businesses. The major causes of these challenges are hidden fees, a lack of transparency, and inefficient processes.

Western Union Business Solutions Senior Corporate Trader, Sherif Gabriel, joins Anita Campbell in this episode to discuss how small businesses can manage international payments.

Below are the questions we asked Sherif:

	(2:28) Sherif can you tell us a bit about yourself and your background and how you came to be with Western Union?
	(3:23) What are some of the changes, specifically, as they relate to small businesses? nbsp;What's been changing in the 15 years since you've been involved?
	(4:54) Why is the idea of making/receiving a payment internationally something that can stop business cold? nbsp;What are some of the challenges they face?
	(6:18) If you're importing supplies from Europe or India, what advice do you have for the importer in the United States?
	(8:08) What does "hedging" actually mean to a small business?
	(9:28) Is that something that Western Union can provide?
	(10:23) How can a company keep up with the speed of global payments?
	(12:50) The current economic landscape has been brutal these last couple years. nbsp;How do you manage international payments in that type of environment?
	(14:41) What else does Western Union do as far as these services you're talking about?
	(19:36) What does it cost for that type of service?
	(20:30) How do you make sure that international funds are delivered safely and effectively when you're a small business?
	(23:22) Where do you see business to business payments five years from now?
	(24:48) Is that commerce being transacted in the English language?
	(25:59) Where can people find out more?

What small business owners need are the same cost-effective, targeted media tactics and interview techniques that successful businesses use. Some of the most valuable business and marketing skills today are navigating the media; getting past the gatekeepers, creating sound bites that go viral and creating pitches that &#8220;get the word out&#8221; about who you are and what you do.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4664" style="border: #E0E0E0 3px solid;" title="Interview Tactics" src="http://www.smbtrendwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/interview-tactics.jpg" alt="Interview Tactics" width="250" height="39" />Gayl Murphy, Founder of <a href="http://www.interviewtactics.com" target="_blank">Interview Tactics</a> joins Anita Campbell to share how to “tell it to sell it,” what the media wants from you, the four questions you will always be asked by gatekeepers, why sound bites are crucial and translating your story into media language.</p>
<p><strong>Below are the questions we asked Gayl</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1:43) Gayl, can you tell us a bit about yourself and your background and how you got into this business?</li>
<li>(3:55) You&#8217;ve interviewed 15,000 people?</li>
<li>(4:31) Why are interview tactics important?  Can you explain?</li>

		<itunes:summary>In these changing times, the need to be seen and heard above the roar of the crowd is far more challenging than ever before. What small business owners need are the same cost-effective, targeted media tactics and interview techniques that successful businesses use. Some of the most valuable business and marketing skills today are navigating the media; getting past the gatekeepers, creating sound bites that go viral and creating pitches that "get the word out" about who you are and what you do.

Gayl Murphy, Founder of Interview Tacticsnbsp;joins Anita Campbell to share how to ldquo;tell it to sell it,rdquo; what the media wants from you, the four questions you will always be asked by gatekeepers, why sound bites are crucial and translating your story into media language.

Below are the questions we asked Gayl:

	(1:43) Gayl, can you tell us a bit about yourself and your background and how you got into this business?
	(3:55) You've interviewed 15,000 people?
	(4:31) Why are interview tactics important?nbsp; Can you explain?
	(6:48) Are small business owners ready for this?
	(10:17) How can you prepare for an interview?
	(14:21) If you had to point to one or two things to create a memorable, killer interview, what would those be?
	(16:45) When you find you're ready to do media events, does this take a lot of preparation to get yourself ready?
	(18:21) Can you talk about what the interviewers goal is and how it can differ depending on the show, interviewer, etc.?
	(21:58) What is the most memorable sound bit you can think of?
	(24:06)nbsp;Where can people find out more?
	(25:26) Any final comments before we close?

<li>(4:13) The book has been referred to as a print version of a marketing Ideas File.  Tell us a bit about marketing ideas files.  Is that something that professional designers use, David?</li>
<li>(5:35) What kind of ideas should go in the file?  Should you put things that you like in there or bad examples as well?  Or should you just take notes?</li>
<li>(7:16) Sometimes people get the idea that a swipe file or marketing ideas file implies that you&#8217;re going to steal someone else&#8217;s idea.  You never want to steal someone&#8217;s idea, right?</li>

<li>(16:26) When we were doing Visual Marketing, we used a tool, <a href="http://wufoo.com/" target="_blank">Wufoo</a>, where people could submit projects online to be included in the book.  Do you see that as something that companies should do?</li>
<li>(19:15) What other tools are out there for creating a marketing Ideas File?</li>
<li>(20:37) Visual Marketing has 99 case examples using visual marketing in a notable way.  You wanted a hand in laying out the pages in the book.  Can you talk about that?</li>

<li>(25:41) Understanding who you are and what business you&#8217;re in, how might a company articulate that?  What would you be looking for as a designer that would give you good input?</li>

The fundamentals of this program were developed in Silicon Valley during the dot-com era - but while all the world is focused on tech, StartUp Cup focuses on the other 98% of business startups.

<li>(9:47) So the winners not only get a cup, do they get ongoing coaching and mentoring in addition to the cash?</li>
<li>(10:51) You&#8217;ve created a guide that organizers can follow.  What would they get in exchange once they contact you?</li>
<li>(12:35) Is there a fee for a community to get involved and gain access to all of this and gain access to the StartUp Cup name?</li>
<li>(13:20) Is this something that you feel is limited to your local geography?  Or are there other ways to define what type you&#8217;d like to do?  Like an online community StartUp Cup or can a vendor do a StartUp Cup for the customers it has?</li>
<li>(15:18) There are some other startup events and competitions out there.  How does StartUp Cup differ from something like Startup Weekend or a business plan competition?</li>
<li>(18:09) What types of entrepreneurs and businesses would be involved in something like StartUp Cup?  How would you describe them?</li>
<li>(20:10) You mentioned you had seen a business based on bacon drippings?  Is that right?  Is that real?</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-33910" style="margin: 8px; border: #E0E0E0 3px solid;" title="Julie Gordon White" src="http://www.smbtrendwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/juliegordon65.jpg" alt="Julie Gordon White" width="65" height="65" />After working with hundreds of business owners over the last 10 years, certified business broker Julie Gordon White discovered a pattern of problems when owners contacted her to sell. As founder of BlueKey Business Brokerage M&amp;A and author of &#8220;EXIT! 12 Steps to Sell Your Business for the Price You Deserve&#8221;, Julie knows that these roadblock to selling could have easily been removed had the owner knew they existed and planned in advance for the sale.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4664" style="border: #E0E0E0 3px solid;" title="EXIT! 12 Steps to Sell Your Business for the Price You Deserve" src="http://www.smbtrendwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/juliegordonLG.jpg" alt="EXIT! 12 Steps to Sell Your Business for the Price You Deserve" width="130" height="200" />Julie Gordon White, Founder of <a href="http://www.bluekeybma.com" target="_blank">BlueKey Business Brokerage M&amp;A</a>, helps listeners to discover both the problems and the 5 simple, but powerful fixes to ensure their ability to sell their business for the highest market price.</p>
<p><strong>Below are the questions we asked Julie</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1:35) Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your background and explain what led you to develop BlueKey Business Brokerage?</li>
<li>(3:22) What are the four reasons most business can&#8217;t be sold?</li>
<li>(4:26) What percentage of businesses are like that?</li>
<li>(9:00) We just covered the 4 reasons why business won&#8217;t sell.  Talk us through each of the 5 fixes.</li>
<li>(10:31) How difficult is it for a business to make sure that they value themselves accordingly?</li>
<li>(11:58) Let&#8217;s jump to number two.</li>
<li>(12:44) Do you have an example of someone that has done that? </li>
<li>(13:52) What is the number three fast fix?</li>
<li>(15:26) Would an example of that be some of these loyalty programs that make it more likely to have people come back and buy things on a regular basis?</li>
<li>(16:18) Ok great, what is number four?</li>
<li>(18:19) How often should they do that to keep it up-to-date?</li>
<li>(18:43) We&#8217;re at number five, what is the number five fix?</li>
<li>(20:16) Is that something that potential buyers look at in addition to customer lists?  Having an email list, is that something they also look at in terms of valuing something?</li>
<li>(21:50) Overall, someone who had all four issues that took the time to implement these five fixes, when do you think they&#8217;d be ready to sell?</li>
<li>(23:25) Let&#8217;s say a business did the five fixes and got a great offer and decided to sell, but then had second thoughts.  Have you seen that happen and, if so, what happens in that case?</li>
<li>(25:43) I understand you have a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">special offer</span><strong> </strong></span>for our listeners? </li>
<li>(27:12) Where can people find out more?</li>

Human nature says, <em><strong>&#8220;If its a hassle, put it off.&#8221;</strong></em> This leads to forgetfulness, which then leads to a mad scramble at the end of the year to get that disorganized shoe box of receipts to the tax professional who then must do his or her best to help you realize the tax deductions your business provides. In the end, it leads to lost deductions and lost dollars due to over-payment of taxes.</p>

<li>(13:47) When talking about the IRS, what is it that the IRS really wants to see when small businesses take deductions?</li>
<li>(17:05) Can you take a minute to explain a bit more about how to use the online app and the mobile app?</li>
<li>(18:51) Are there significant deductions that small business owners can take but do not because they are unaware of them?</li>
<li>(23:31) Is Deductr only for sole proprietors or can any business use it?</li>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4664" style="border: #E0E0E0 3px solid;" title="UPS: United Parcel Service" src="http://www.smbtrendwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/ups.jpg" alt="UPS: United Parcel Service" width="155" height="165" />Learn from the masters of shipping, <a href="http://www.ups.com" target="_blank">United Parcel Service</a> (UPS), as Tom Langa, UPS Small Business/Occasional Customer Marketing Manager, joins Anita Campbell to offer shipping tips so your Holiday season will be the most painless and successful yet for your small business.</p>
<p><strong>Below are the questions we asked Tom</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1:38) Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your background?  How did you end up at UPS?</li>
<li>(3:03) How can small businesses prepare for the Holiday rush?  It starts earlier and earlier each year so what should we be doing, Tom?</li>
<li>(4:55) So are UPS drivers up all night? How do they get things delivered so fast?</li>
<li>(5:38) What do you recommend that we do when it comes to shipping?  How do we get prepared and how do we carry that out?</li>
<li>(7:44) Can you explain why NOT to use masking tape and newspaper as packing materials?</li>
<li>(9:30) You mentioned an offering UPS has to track shipping.  Can you tell us more about that and more about creating an account with UPS?</li>
<li>(10:55) What is the advantage of having an account with UPS?  Is it that you don&#8217;t have to fill out forms each time and input credit card information?  Can you describe the benefits of having an account?</li>
<li>(12:44) So these are efficiency tools and a benefit of a result of using the site and having an account with UPS?</li>
<li>(13:06) How does UPS help you in a situation where you&#8217;re standing in line with loads of boxes and holding others behind you up?</li>
<li>(14:56) I assume you can arrange for picks ups at your place of business?</li>
<li>(16:06) So are you saying that if you use the technology, it will automatically alert the driver to pick up the package?  You don&#8217;t have to schedule a pick up, is that right?</li>
<li>(17:20) Is there anything else we can do to make sure that gifts or packages arrive in time?</li>
<li>(20:17) You have told us that UPS has launched a new service, My Choice, just in time for the Holidays.  Can you tell us more about that?</li>
<li>(23:06) This is something that the recipient in a residential situation would arrange for, correct?</li>
<li>(23:44) Are there links that you can put in a website to invite customers to use that?  How would you recommend that businesses alert their customers that My Choice is available to them?</li>
<li>(25:20) What&#8217;s the best way to ship perishable goods?</li>
<li>(26:50) Would you explain what UPS stores are and how to use them?</li>
<li>(30:50) Where can people find out more?</li>

	(16:06) So are you saying that if you use the technology, it will automatically alert the driver to pick up the package?nbsp; You don't have to schedule a pick up, is that right?
	(17:20) Is there anything else we can do to make sure that gifts or packages arrive in time?
	(20:17) You have told us that UPS has launched a new service,nbsp;My Choice,nbsp;just in time for the Holidays.nbsp; Can you tell us more about that?
	(23:06) This is something that the recipient in a residential situation would arrange for, correct?
	(23:44) Are there links that you can put in a website to invite customers to use that?nbsp; How would you recommend that businesses alert their customers that My Choice is available to them?
	(25:20) What's the best way to ship perishable goods?
	(26:50) Would you explain what UPS stores are and how to use them?
	(30:50) Where can people find out more?

She will explain the importance of establishing a branded domain and social media profiles for your small business, she will walk you through the steps to establish and register a domain and share interesting stories of different way small businesses are using their web domains to grow their business.</p>
<p><strong>Below are the questions we asked Karla</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1:52) You are an employee of Verisign, correct?</li>
<li>(2:19) How did you get into this business?</li>
<li>(3:33) The web is about 15 years old at this point, correct?</li>
<li>(4:09) So here we are, a quarter century later.  Do you find that there&#8217;s still a hurdle to convince business owners that they should have an online presence?</li>
<li>(6:55) A common thing I hear is that all the good domain names are gone, especially the .com names.  What does Verisign say to that?</li>
<li>(8:46) Lets talk a bit about the name of your company, your brand, and how that relates to a domain name.  Is it better to get a descriptive domain name or a brand domain name?</li>
<li>(10:19) You mention social media profiles.  When choosing a domain name, should you be checking on the availability of the social media profile name as well?</li>
<li>(10:50) What social media sites do you think are important for small businesses?  We have Facebook and Twitter.  Are there other sites we should all be thinking about?</li>
<li>(12:28) Walk us through what it&#8217;s like to establish a domain name.  How should I be searching for that domain name?  Are there any insider tips to make sure you&#8217;re as creative as possible and do as good a search as possible when looking for a domain name?</li>
<li>(14:35) Why is it important to register the .net name as well?  Does it give you an advantage or protect you in some way?</li>
<li>(15:17) So you&#8217;re really protecting your brand that you&#8217;ve built, correct?</li>
<li>(15:33) Can you tell us some stories about how small businesses are using their web domains to grow their businesses?</li>
<li>(19:34) Why does a company like Verisign run a contest like that?  What are your goals as a company for that?</li>
<li>(21:46) Can you tell us about the winner, <a href="http://www.vibrantchocolate.com/" target="_blank">Vibrant Chocolates</a> out of Seattle, Washington?</li>
<li>(22:54) Can you tell us what the new product, Mobile View, is and how it works?</li>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4664" style="border: #E0E0E0 3px solid;" title="Inside Sports and Entertainment Group" src="http://www.smbtrendwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/inside1.jpg" alt="Inside Sports and Entertainment Group" width="182" height="49" />Ety Rybak is the Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of <a href="http://www.Insideseg.com" target="_blank">Inside Sports and Entertainment Group</a>, a provider of once-in-a lifetime event experiences for a cross section of small business, corporate and individual customers. Ety joins Anita Campbell to talk about the consumer spending trend towards experiences versus “things” or merchandise and how you can motivate clients, employees and prospects with carefully selected exciting experience-based Holiday gifts.</p>
<p><strong>Below are the questions we asked Ety</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>(2:03) Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your background and how you came to start this business?</li>
<li>(3:04) Why do you think that people are more apt to spend money during a recession on experiences versus things?</li>
<li>(4:45) What is the number one most popular event or experience that people want to enjoy?</li>
<li>(6:16) Can you give us an idea of what an experience might be like?  Do you arrange a variety of activities around the event?</li>
<li>(7:39) How do you get tickets?  I&#8217;m assuming these are not events open to anyone just walking in off the streets are they?</li>
<li>(8:40) So you&#8217;re acting as a source to get into these hard to get into events?</li>
<li>(9:38) Are there some best practices?  Where does one start to figure out what&#8217;s a good incentive and a good thank you to an employee or client?</li>
<li>(11:44) Would you say that&#8217;s true even for women?</li>
<li>(13:20) What are your thoughts about giving experiences to your employees, clients, etc. at the Holidays?</li>
<li>(15:15) What kind of lead time do you need for a Holiday experience-based gift?</li>
<li>(15:43) So you accommodate last minute requests?</li>
<li>(16:29) Can you give us some ballpark figures?</li>
<li>(17:16) Would you say that the best practice for an employee experience-based gift would also include a companion of their choice to accompany them as well?</li>
<li>(18:30) What&#8217;s the process to do this?  How does one go about doing this, what would you recommend?</li>
<li>(19:54) Do you have any tips for businesses about making the most of an event?  You want this to be a great, memorable experience so what would you recommend there?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Ety Rybak feels that nothing beats a memorable experience - from tickets to a Broadway show andnbsp;a backstage meet and greet to 50 yard line seats at the Superbowl.

Ety Rybak is the Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Inside Sports and Entertainment Group, a provider of once-in-a lifetime event experiences for a cross section of small business, corporate and individual customers. Ety joins Anita Campbell to talk about the consumer spending trend towards experiences versus ldquo;thingsrdquo; or merchandise and how you can motivate clients, employees and prospects with carefully selected exciting experience-based Holiday gifts.

Below are the questions we asked Ety:

	(2:03) Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your background and how you came to start this business?
	(3:04) Why do you think that people are more apt to spend money during a recession on experiences versus things?
	(4:45) What is the number one most popular event or experience that people want to enjoy?
	(6:16) Can you give us an idea of what an experience might be like?nbsp; Do you arrange a variety of activities around the event?
	(7:39) How do you get tickets?nbsp; I'm assuming these are not events open to anyone just walking in off the streets are they?
	(8:40) So you're acting as a source to get into these hard to get into events?
	(9:38) Are there some best practices?nbsp; Where does one start to figure out what's a good incentive and a good thank you to an employee or client?
	(11:44) Would you say that's true even for women?
	(13:20) What are your thoughts about giving experiences to your employees, clients, etc. at the Holidays?
	(15:15) What kind of lead time do you need for a Holiday experience-based gift?
	(15:43) So you accommodate last minute requests?
	(16:29) Can you give us some ballpark figures?
	(17:16) Would you say that the best practice for an employee experience-based giftnbsp;would alsonbsp;include a companion of their choice to accompany them as well?
	(18:30) What's the process to do this?nbsp; How does one go about doing this,nbsp;what would you recommend?
	(19:54) Do you have any tips for businesses about making the most of an event?nbsp; You want this to be a great, memorable experience so what would you recommend there?
	(21:51) You've sound as if you've seen just about everything.nbsp; What's the most unusual request you've ever had for one of these experiences?
	(23:36) Do you see any particular trends with this in the future?
	(25:07) Any final thoughts or tips that you'd like to cap off with?
	(25:55)nbsp;Where can people find out more?
