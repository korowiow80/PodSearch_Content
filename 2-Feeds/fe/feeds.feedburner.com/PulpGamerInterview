Marcelo A. Figueroa is one of few individuals who have participated in every tier of the hobby games industry, first as a consumer, then in Retail (All Star Games), in Distribution (&lt;a href="http://www.acdd.com/" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/acdd_com');" target="_blank"&gt;ACD Distribution&lt;/a&gt;), as Media (&lt;a href="http://www.spacegamer.com/spacegamer/default.asp" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/spacegamer_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadis" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/awikipedia_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Shadis Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, Games Quarterly Magazine), and Publishing (&lt;a href="http://www.alderac.com/" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/alderac_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Alderac Entertainment Group&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.avalanchepress.com/" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/avalanchepress_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Avalanche Press&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.playrooment.com" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/playrooment_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Playroom Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;). And somewhere in there he found time to be a published writer &amp;amp; game designer. His years of experience have made him a respected industry expert in Customer Service, Marketing, Product Demonstration &amp;amp; Sales, including an Origins Award.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While on the Caribbean cruise with &lt;a href="http://gameradventures.com/" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/gameradventures_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Gamer Adventures&lt;/a&gt;, Don had the opportunity to sit and visit with Larry Roznai, president of &lt;a href="http://mayfairgames.com/" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Mayfair Games&lt;/a&gt;.  Games brought up during today's show include &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/4500-4699/pages/4500.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Empire Builder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/phalanx/pages/pha6028.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Sutter's Mill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/0450-0479/pages/0469.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Silverton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3000-3299/pages/3061.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Settlers of Catan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3300-4499/pages/4401.htm" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;Family Business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Larry Roznai is a German-speaking native of Chicago, and a U.S. Navy veteran. An avid gamer, he hosted weekly game nights for many years before discovering the new generation of fine parlor games. When he brought home Darwin Bromley's Empire Builder game in 1989, his whole family became great fans of Mayfair Games.   Larry became informally associated with Mayfair Games when his younger brother Joe--Mayfair's accountant since 1988--brought him to Mayfair's offices in 1989. There, they played or play-tested a host of Mayfair's games. Their first development work was on Eurorails in 1989-90. Both Joe and Larry became fans of the game system and began working on projects in the early 1990s. They later co-designed Nippon Rails. Larry has since designed Australian Rails and developed Lunar Rails and Russian Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://mayfairgames.com/" ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://images.pulpgamer.com/webart/lroznai.jpg" alt="Larry Roznai" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Larry became a part of Mayfair Games' extended family when he attended Gencon as a company guest in 1990. He began working game shows in his off-hours. Meanwhile, he worked for Honeywell. An electronics specialist, he worked on or oversaw major HVAC projects. His strong operations and management skills impressed the new Mayfair Games ownership team, and in 1999 he left the forced air industry and joined Mayfair Games as a board member, President, and COO.   Larry moonlights as the bass player for the highly semi-legendary rock band "Byte," which he co-founded uncounted decades ago. He likes rock-n-roll. It is almost as dear to him as his great family. His wife Bridget and daughter Loren both work for Mayfair Games, while his son Karl attends school and helps play-test Mayfair products. (Of course, having worked for Mayfair Games since 1997, Bridget has longer tenure than her Johnny-come-lately spouse.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <itunes:summary>While on the Caribbean cruise with Gamer Adventures (http://gameradventures.com/), Don had the opportunity to sit and visit with Larry Roznai, president of Mayfair Games (http://mayfairgames.com/).  Games brought up during today's show include Empire Builder (http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/4500-4699/pages/4500.htm), Sutter's Mill (http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/phalanx/pages/pha6028.htm), Silverton (http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/0450-0479/pages/0469.htm), Settlers of Catan (http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3000-3299/pages/3061.htm), and Family Business (http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3300-4499/pages/4401.htm).




Larry Roznai is a German-speaking native of Chicago, and a U.S. Navy veteran. An avid gamer, he hosted weekly game nights for many years before discovering the new generation of fine parlor games. When he brought home Darwin Bromley's Empire Builder game in 1989, his whole family became great fans of Mayfair Games.   Larry became informally associated with Mayfair Games when his younger brother Joe--Mayfair's accountant since 1988--brought him to Mayfair's offices in 1989. There, they played or play-tested a host of Mayfair's games. Their first development work was on Eurorails in 1989-90. Both Joe and Larry became fans of the game system and began working on projects in the early 1990s. They later co-designed Nippon Rails. Larry has since designed Australian Rails and developed Lunar Rails and Russian Rails.

Larry became a part of Mayfair Games' extended family when he attended Gencon as a company guest in 1990. He began working game shows in his off-hours. Meanwhile, he worked for Honeywell. An electronics specialist, he worked on or oversaw major HVAC projects. His strong operations and management skills impressed the new Mayfair Games ownership team, and in 1999 he left the forced air industry and joined Mayfair Games as a board member, President, and COO.   Larry moonlights as the bass player for the highly semi-legendary rock band "Byte," which he co-founded uncounted decades ago. He likes rock-n-roll. It is almost as dear to him as his great family. His wife Bridget and daughter Loren both work for Mayfair Games, while his son Karl attends school and helps play-test Mayfair products. (Of course, having worked for Mayfair Games since 1997, Bridget has longer tenure than her Johnny-come-lately spouse.)</itunes:summary>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a ="urchinTracker('/outgoing/gama_org');" href="http://gama.org/" target="_blank"&gt;GAMA&lt;/a&gt; welcomes John Ward as its new Executive Director.  Don welcomes John to the Inside Track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John holds a Master&amp;sup1;s degree in public administration with an emphasis in fiscal and policy management. His bachelor&amp;sup1;s degree is in criminology, with both degrees from Ohio University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionally, Ward has extensive experience in the military and in state government. Ward is a retired Army officer with over 23 years of combined service in the military police and engineer corps. His military experience has provided him opportunities to deploy to Europe, Central America, Korea, and the Persian Gulf for the first Gulf War.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Ward also has over 20 years of government service in the criminal justice field, most recently in the juvenile system as the state of Ohio's Bureau Chief of Parole and then Bureau Chief of Community Facilities. In this last role, he supervised 12 small correctional facilities and managed revenue generation for Ohio&amp;sup1;s juvenile corrections agency, as well as working with 12 governing boards in a variety of endeavors. He enhanced volunteer programs, developed data and outcome measures, and was able to assist them in operationalizing both economic and procedural efficiencies. He still serves on a national level working and consulting in the criminal justice arena.&lt;/p&gt;

He is in more places in the game industry than his name appears and his design ranges from &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/hasbro_com');" href="http://www.hasbro.com/default.cfm?page=browse&amp;amp;product_id=22514" target="_blank"&gt;Yatzee Free for All&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/boardgamegeek_com');" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/45" target="_blank"&gt;Liars Dice&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/fantasyflightgames_com');" href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/battlelore/" target="_blank"&gt;BattleLore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/daysofwonder_com');" href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/memoir44/en/" target="_blank"&gt;Memoir 44&lt;/a&gt;.  We also mentioned &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/riograndegames_com');" href="http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=213" target="_blank"&gt;Wyatt Earp&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/paizo_com');" href="http://paizo.com/titanicGames/v5748btpy7vq5" target="_blank"&gt;Stonehenge&lt;/a&gt; in today's show.  Richard was a blast to visit with and is full of good information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard&amp;rsquo;s professional game credits cover a broad spectrum, which includes over 50 titles. Milton Bradley published his first game, &amp;lsquo;Liars Dice&amp;rsquo; a family dice game, in 1988. Following up this initial success were AD&amp;amp;D games (TSR), X-Men games (Pressman Toy) and another hit for Milton Bradley &amp;lsquo;Times to Remember&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1993 &amp;lsquo;Liars Dice&amp;rsquo; went to Europe as &amp;lsquo;Bluff&amp;rsquo; and won the German Prize &amp;lsquo;Spiel des Jahres&amp;rsquo;. Richard was part of the &amp;lsquo;Star Wars&amp;rsquo; customizable card game design team and involved with a number of other collectible card games. Some of his recent designs, that are currently available, include: Hera &amp;amp; Zeus (Rio Grande Games), Memoir &amp;rsquo;44 (Days of Wonder), Commands &amp;amp; Colors: Ancients (GMT Games), BattleLore (Fantasy Flight) and Stonehenge Anthology (Paizo Publishing). Richard's newest family game design, Yahtzee Free For All (Parker Brothers) is already receiving acclaim from the game community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because his body of work does encompass so many age groups and genres, you just may have one or more of Richard&amp;rsquo;s designs in your personal game collection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah had the pleasure of visiting one of the biggest and baddest men in gaming, Erik Yaple. Erik has taken over the &lt;a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/monsterpocalypsegame_com');" href="http://www.monsterpocalypsegame.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Monsterpocalypse&lt;/a&gt; project with &lt;a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/privateerpress_com');" href="http://privateerpress.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Privateer Press&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very appealing game of monstrous combat. He caught him between games at &lt;a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/gencon_com');" href="http://gencon.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Gen Con&lt;/a&gt; where he spent a lot of his weekend showing the game with a horde of fans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nick talks about the crossover between improv acting and roleplaying and about several projects he has been working on. We most recently know have been seeing his work on Paizo's &lt;a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/paizo_com');" href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder" target="_blank"&gt;Pathfinder&lt;/a&gt;, several great articles in &lt;a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/koboldquarterly_com');" href="http://koboldquarterly.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Kobold Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/open-design_com');" href="http://open-design.livejournal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Open Design Project&lt;/a&gt;, and of course, &lt;a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/sinisteradventures_com');" href="http://sinisteradventures.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Sinister Adventures&lt;/a&gt;. We wish him well on his adventures to come and hope to see him again very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

Nick has done extensive work on Paizo&amp;rsquo;s new Pathfinder Chronicles campaign setting and the Eberron Campaign Setting for Wizards of the Coast. His recent credits include numerous adventures and articles in Dungeon and Dragon magazines, Crown of the Kobold King, Voyage of the Golden Dragon, Eyes of the Lich Queen, Monster Manual V, Dragons of Eberron, Carnival of Tears, Hook Mountain Massacre, Edge of Anarchy, Hangman&amp;rsquo;s Noose and City of Stormreach.&lt;/td&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While at Origins, Don was able to sit down with Dave Wallace.   You may have heard Dave on many of the &lt;a href="http://www.pulpgamer.com/gama/" target="_blank"&gt;GAMA Trade Show Seminars&lt;/a&gt;.  He and his wife, Kelli, run a small chain of stores and do a considerable amount of work for &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/gama_org');" href="http://gama.org/" target="_blank"&gt;GAMA&lt;/a&gt; helping other retailers get started.  He has also just recently taken a position for the online store, &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/trollandtoad_com');" href="http://www.trollandtoad.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Troll and Toad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don brings us another great conversation from Origins.  This time he visits with &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/princeofcairo_livejournal_com');" href="http://princeofcairo.livejournal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Kenneth Hite&lt;/a&gt;.  Kenneth has written a number of our favorite games, but today we talk mostly about &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/pelgranepress_com');" href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/trail/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Trail of Cthulhu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="10"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Kenneth Hite has designed, written, or co-authored more than 70 books, roleplaying games, and supplements, including the Origins Award-winning Star Trek: The Next Generation RPG, GURPS Infinite Worlds, and Call Of Cthulhu d20. He has been Line Developer for Chaosium's Nephilim and Last Unicorn Games' original-series Star Trek RPG, and has written for White Wolf, Pinnacle, Atlas, and many other companies. His most recent works include the Mythos miscellany Dubious Shards (available in print and PDF), the Trail Of Cthulhu RPG from Pelgrane Press, chapters in Wild Talents and Grim War from ArcDream, and Adventures Into Darkness, a Lovecraftian Golden Age superhero sourcebook available in PDF. He explores the Higher Weirdness roughly biweekly in his "Suppressed Transmission" column in Pyramid Magazine (&lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/sjgames_com');" href="http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid&lt;/a&gt;); it has been collected in two volumes. Since 1997, he has written "Out of the Box," an RPG industry news and review column most recently at &lt;a onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/gamingreport_com');" href="http://www.gamingreport.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.gamingreport.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Jeff Bellinger began his life in Jersey and spent many hours developing games as he grew up.  He took those games with him to the United States Navy to see the world until he was finally dropped off in San Diego where he created Saren's Stuff to take his games to market.  Killer Bunnies caught the attention of Playroom Entertainment in 2002 and has become nothing less than a phenomenon.  Jeff teaches math during the school year and continues to travel extensively.  He still does most of his work with a paper and pencil and takes advantage of quiet rainy days to work.&lt;/td&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don had a great time talking to Phil Chase at Origins. Phil was joined by his son Auden, who was equally as entertaining. We spoke on a variety of educational topics, emphasizing linguistics in a way we had not yet explored. We also talked about a lot of games, even outside of Phil&amp;rsquo;s designs. Some of them include &lt;a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/setgame_com');" href="http://www.setgame.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Set&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/fantasyflightgames_com');" href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/thelotr.html" target="_blank"&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/catan_com');" href="http://www.catan.com" target="_blank"&gt;Settlers of Catan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/3300-4499/pages/4113.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Shear Panic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/phalanx/pages/pha6017.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Hey!

&lt;td&gt;Phil Chase has been an educator for 14 years, working now for the State of Michigan's Department of Education. His board game design career, under the pen name P. R. Chase, started in 2002 with the release of &lt;a onclick="urchinTracker('/outgoing/mayfairgames_com');" href="http://www.mayfairgames.com/shop/product/0450-0479/pages/0477.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Theophrastus&lt;/a&gt; with Mayfair Games.
