      <title>Top 5 Business Article Authors 2006</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi Folks</p>
<p>Instead of recording a 'Top 5 Business Articles' Podcast this week, I've decided 
  to simply announce who is my optinion has been the top contributor to BuildYourOwnBusiness 
  over the last year.</p>
<p>Listeners of <strong><a href="http://business.hipcast.com/deluge/b1cf3574-fe35-dfee-aee1-5d559dd57e3c.mp3">last 
  week's podcast</a></strong> will know that I've already announced the 5 authors 
  who I believe have contributed the most to the BuildYourOwnBusiness website 
  over the period.</p>
<p>The following business article authors aren't necessarily the top article producers 
  by volume, but they are the authors in my opinion who have taken the time and 
  effort to provide good quality business advice articles on a regular basis. 
  These authors have been building a long-term relationship with readers, in the 
  knowledge that the quality content that they publish will represent their brands 
  extremely well for many years to come.</p>
<p>So many people suffer from Internet myopia. They beleive that all they need 
  are links back to their website in order for them to be succesful online. The 
  reality is however that operating a succesful online business isn't much different 
  to operating a succesful offline business. Both require a good product or service, 
  and both require good customer service. The follwing top 5 business article 
  authors for 2006 recognise this and are in it for the long-term.</p>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Hi Folks</p>
<p>Instead of recording a 'Top 5 Business Articles' Podcast this week, I've decided 
  to simply announce who is my optinion has been the top contributor to BuildYourOwnBusiness 
  over the last year.</p>
<p>Listeners of <strong><a href="http://business.hipcast.com/deluge/b1cf3574-fe35-dfee-aee1-5d559dd57e3c.mp3">last 
  week's podcast</a></strong> will know that I've already announced the 5 authors 
  who I believe have contributed the most to the BuildYourOwnBusiness website 
  over the period.</p>
<p>The following business article authors aren't necessarily the top article producers 
  by volume, but they are the authors in my opinion who have taken the time and 
  effort to provide good quality business advice articles on a regular basis. 
  These authors have been building a long-term relationship with readers, in the 
  knowledge that the quality content that they publish will represent their brands 
  extremely well for many years to come.</p>
<p>So many people suffer from Internet myopia. They beleive that all they need 
  are links back to their website in order for them to be succesful online. The 
  reality is however that operating a succesful online business isn't much different 
  to operating a succesful offline business. Both require a good product or service, 
  and both require good customer service. The follwing top 5 business article 
  authors for 2006 recognise this and are in it for the long-term.</p>
