			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cracker.jpg" rel="lightbox[2370]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2371" title="cracker" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cracker.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="263" /></a>I positioned myself on the edge of the young boy’s bed, close to his outstretched legs with tiny wiggly toes dancing in my direction as he smiled wide. His face was glowing in heightened anticipation of impending story and music I had come to share with him. He’s only four, a magical age where the line between enchantment and reality is blurred by an uninitiated fascination with the world and an unhinged imagination.</p>
<p>For our purposes I’ll call him Josh; not his real name of course but you’ll understand why a pseudonym in a second.</p>
<p>Josh was munching on crackers and watching cartoons when I came into his room. He is a cancer patient at Children’s Hospital. His mother has never been more than two steps from his bedside each time I’ve visited.</p>
<p><span id="more-2370"></span></p>
<p>I sometimes visit Children’s Hospital and they allow me to go room-to-room on various floors and engage the children with songs, music and stories. On this particular day I wanted to visit Josh and his mother because I had met them the week prior and promised to return. Josh has a love for train sets and, more specifically, “Thomas the Train (a cartoon character).”</p>
<p>As I sat there on his bed staring into two beaming, hope filled eyes, his smile overtook me and I broke into a wide grin of my own. It felt like old, long lost friends reuniting and being filled with immense joy over the gift a moment in time brings.</p>
<p>I began playing my harp for him and singing. He loves the sounds of the words being sung in an African language even though he doesn’t comprehend the meaning. I continued playing the strings gently and flowed into a tale about a brave lion who had been king of the jungle. This King Lion was facing a challenge greater than any he had ever faced before.</p>
<p>Little boys tend to love tales of lions and great beasts with gentle natures. Josh’s eyes grew even wider when I described King Lion. Those moment’s when I would pause for effect, Josh would chime in with his own uncontrollable epiphanies on our protagonist’s motivations.</p>
<p>I interrupted the tale two or three times by breaking into song and singing softly. Josh’s toes danced ever so slightly as his head bobbed up and down, right to left in that childish “don’t-have-a-care-in-the-world” way that only the most innocent among us possess.</p>
<p>When I finished my telling of the tale and closed out by letting the loudest string on my harp fade to silence, Josh and his mother clapped enthusiastically for me. It was only an audience of two but it might as well have been thousands at Carnegie Hall because I was feel the same sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>I sat there on the bed after their clapping subsided and asked Josh what did he think of the story, did he really like it?</p>
<p>He cocked his head to one side, a bit askew, looking up towards the ceiling as if deep in thought over his potential answer to my question.</p>
<p>Josh brought his eyes back down to meet mine and kept those chubby cheeks churning out the brightest, most adorable smile. He then reached into a bag that was resting between his legs and pulled out a cracker and held it out toward me, a square almost covering his entire tiny hand.</p>
<p>I accepted my compensation with grace, as if he had just handed me a million dollars. It felt no different. My heart melted at the thought that this little child found value in me and what I was there to do.</p>
<p>Before leaving the room I wrapped my gift in tissue paper and put it away safe and secure.</p>
<p>When I got home earlier that evening I placed Josh’s gift to me on my office desk.</p>
<p>There it sits as I type these words to you, a reminder to me that life’s affirmations may come in many forms.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blog-4.jpg" rel="lightbox[2334]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2335" title="blog-4" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blog-4.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="350" /></a>After yesterday’s torrent of activity, today seemed almost like a day of ease. I had a single performance in the afternoon, which freed up my morning to take a walk into the city.</p>
<p>My main objective was to visit “El Museo del Hombre Dominicano (Museum of the Dominican Man).” It is the only place I could find here in Santo Domingo that offered information on the original inhabitants of the island before Columbus’ arrival. I had a two-fold reason for wanting to visit the museum; the first being that I love archeology, history and anything to do with learning the culture of another people. Additionally, I feel that visiting the relics of ancient societies is a simple way we can demonstrate our respect for their contributions to the world.</p>
<p>Once I arrived at the museum I was excited to see three large, bronze statues standing in front of the building. Facing the building, and to my right was a full figured statue representing a Taino man. On the opposite side was an African man, arms raised in the air with broken shackles attached to each wrist. In the center of these two was Bartolome de las Casas. There are so many aspects to las Casas that I don’t even know where to begin. There are the stories that we learned in history classes in the U.S. and then there is the additional research we do as adults that give us a more complete picture. I wish I could delve more into the feelings that the three images evoked in me but maybe later, and not in blog form.</p>
<p>The museum visit was fascinating. I was enthralled by the amount of information coming to life right before my eyes that I had only read about previously. I took more pictures than I probably should have but I was here and who knows when, if ever, I’ll return.</p>
<p>The walk back through the city was a bittersweet experience. The traffic congestion, smog and overbearing street peddlers were all impediments to really appreciating the “Island Experience.” Despite this, it was refreshing to be out and among the people of the Dominican Republic. A few times during my visit I received the greatest compliment from Dominicans asking me what part of the island I was from. I worked my butt off in the last 22 years to perfect my Spanish and that is definitely a compliment.</p>
<p>My performance in the afternoon was at an area known as Boca Chica. I arrived there with Enesto Lopez. The children were already seated (about 150) when we were quickly escorted into the building. The children were out back under a covered patio. There was no time to waste. Ernesto and I agreed on performance parameters and he started with a puppet show. The children really enjoyed his performance and I thought it was exceptionally creative the way he engaged them with puppets and stick figures. Before finishing, Ernesto gave me a really glowing introduction and I took the small stage to resounding applause.</p>
<p>My entire performance was in Spanish and I made sure to mix a little history and social commentary between singing and telling a tale. The children’s rhythm during moments of call and response was phenomenal. A few times I caught myself dancing as we sang together. That happens to me sometimes you know.</p>
<p>When Ernesto and I finished we headed for the van awaiting us out front. We were, pleasantly accosted by several employees who wanted to take pictures. I enjoy it when my work is appreciated.</p>
<p>I made it back to my hotel just in enough time to clean up, change and make it to a restaurant called “Shaharazad.” What a wonderful way to end my time at the festival, attending a dinner hosted by the Library for all of the storytellers.</p>
<p>We ate, laughed and even shared tales. It was a short, and fast paced trip but I count myself fortunate to have been able to participate. Late in the evening I returned to my hotel room, exhausted. I don’t remember much from that point. All I remember thinking was that I had a flight to catch back to Los Angeles in the morning and sleep was a welcomed companion.</p>
<p>Good night my friends.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DR-Blog-Day-3.jpg" rel="lightbox[2330]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2331" title="DR-Blog-Day-3" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DR-Blog-Day-3.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="350" /></a>When I began my day this morning I entered a vortex of activity that kept me going throughout the entire day until my head hit the pillow at night.</p>
<p>I started the morning with an interview at a radio station, Viva FM, with hosts Carmen Imbert Brugal and José Antonio Rodriguez.  I loved their laid back, relaxed style. They made me feel really comfortable. I played a little music, sang and conversed about the festival and the craft of storytelling. At one point Carmen tossed a question at me that I wasn’t expecting. She spoke of how many people have stated that President Obama isn’t “really” an African American because his father was actually from Kenya and his mother was white. She ended her question by asking me, “so what is your opinion.”</p>
<p>My explanation was rather lengthy and I might publish the audio of it a little later if anyone is interested.</p>
<p>Following the interview I was wisked away by Dulce Elvira, the woman responsible for organizing this amazing festival, and a storyteller and author in her own right. Dulce dropped me off at the main library where I had a talk to facilitate with educators and students.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my talk with the teachers and students of Santo Domingo at the Biblioteca Infantil y Juvenil. I mixed the session up with a few tales, a little music and even some game playing.</p>
<p>When I finished that session they had a driver bring me back to the hotel where I had just enough time to clean up, take 7 bites, put my shoes back on and head back to the library for an interview.</p>
<p>As soon as I arrived at the library a few of the staff were waiting for me. I ran through the entrance and halls of the library and into a small room where an interviewer and television camera were awaiting. I really really enjoyed the interview. The fact that I was able to comprehend 97% of what I was being asked and respond boosted my self confidence in my language abilities immensely.</p>
<p>Immediately following the interview I had enough time to go to a quiet, secluded room and tune my Kora (maybe 15 or 20 minutes). I was retrieved from the quiet seclusion of one room and placed upstairs in the library in a room charged with the energy of about 200 children. Wow! Talk about exciting! I started my program by introducing myself, telling a short tale and playing music. I’ll post the video of this after I get back to the United States. I was having such an good time that it was difficult to bring the session to a close. The majority of the Dominican people attending were so gracious and kind that I, quite literally, felt at home.</p>
<p>At the door of the auditorium, Dulce and her assistant Pamela were waiting for me. They quickly escorted me out of the auditorium as I was being chased by half of the audience for who knows what reason. Talk about a Rock-Star moment! I ended up in a room laid out with snacks and drinks. All for me!</p>
<p>The driver arrived to escort me back to my hotel. By the time I made it up to my room I fell face first into the mattress and remember almost nothing else.</p>
<p>Am I enjoying the Internacional Festival de Cuentacuentos here in The Dominican Republic?</p>
<p>Need you ask?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DR-Blog-Day-2.jpg" rel="lightbox[2326]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2327" title="DR-Blog-Day-2" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DR-Blog-Day-2.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="263" /></a>Today I met some really amazing teachers during a workshop I gave on the Power of Storytelling. The questions they asked were so poignant and their passion for their work was inspirational to me. I carried their enthusiasm for their students and the obvious love of their country with me as I set out to explore the city of Santo Domingo.</p>
<p>I started out strolling through the neighborhood nearest my hotel. It was recommended that I only take taxis when venturing out into the city, but anyone who knows me would understand that would never work for me. One of the things I enjoy most about traveling is the time spent with the people. I love the sights and sounds of bustling cities and villages. This city provided me with plenty of both. As I walked, I saw Haitian women walking with baskets of fruit on their heads. Their grace and elegance made me smile as I reminisced about my time in Africa. I listened to the sounds of horns honking and men yelling to each other down the street about the news of the day. I saw children peeking around corners to catch a glimpse of a foreigner walking through their neighborhood.</p>
<p>As I was immersing myself in this sensory experience I arrived at my destination. I looked out across an expansive courtyard, devoid of the sights and sounds of the previous blocks. There were very few Dominicans, but the amount of tourists had definitely increased. The place I had arrived at, was the actual house of Christopher Columbus’ son, Diego. He and his wife (niece of King Ferdinand) were given this palace in the 16<sup>th</sup> century. As I entered, it struck me that the people I had read about in history books as a child, Ponce De León and Hernando Cortéz, walked the hallways of this building. I found a quiet corner and sat for a moment reflecting on what I imagine was a time of opulence for some and turmoil for others.</p>
<p>Something that gave me mixed feelings was that I was really enjoying the tour of this historical building. Living in California does not afford me with many opportunities to visit five hundred year old buildings. However, what I couldn’t escape was the fact that an entire population of Taino people was destroyed when Columbus set foot on this island in the late 1400’s. This house was representative of a powerful turning point in European history; One of new beginnings and opportunity for the Spanish.</p>
<p>As I exited the uninhabited building that has become simply another tourist destination, I started back the way that I had come. Only this time, rather than simply enjoying the sights and sounds, I was haunted by the feeling that the struggle to survive in this crowded city, where poverty is rampant did little to quell the uneasiness I had as I walked back to my beautiful and luxurious hotel.</p>
<p>I couldn’t shake the feeling that despite the passage of five hundred years, is it possible that the mark left by the colonization of this island has made time stand still?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DR-Blog_01.jpg" rel="lightbox[2318]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2324" title="DR-Blog_01" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/DR-Blog_01.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="350" /></a>Anyone have any ideas how to get an extremely fragile West African harp from Los Angeles to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic? You know it is too big to carry on, too exotic to gate check, and way too precious to send down a luggage conveyor belt. What any decent griot does is stand at the Delta counter for more than an hour talking with very helpful agents who are also in a quandary as to what to do. After much searching codes on the computer screen, phone calls to headquarters, and locating supervisors…the agent handed over “the situation” to “special assistance needed” representatives. They were able to solve the problem economically in about thirty minutes. The solution, you ask? “CAGPT” stickers placed all over the kora case. Whatever that means….Thank goodness for it. The kora made it to the Dominican Republic in one piece with only one broken string.</p>
<p>The journey begins…</p>
<p>Today I flew into Santo Domingo to participate in the second annual “Festival International de Cuentacuentos” sponsored by the First Lady of the Dominican Republic. When I stepped off the plane I was greeted by a man carrying a sign with my name on it. He escorted me to a VIP room reserved for guests of the Dominican Embassy. Once inside, I was offered water and a comfortable couch to sit on while officials walked my passport through customs and immigration AND picked up my luggage. I was escorted out a private door and into a waiting taxi. My suitcase, kora, and passport were waiting for me as I blissfully exited the VIP room. Is this how the other half live?</p>
<p>After a short drive along the beautiful Caribbean coast, I was delivered to my hotel. A gift was waiting for me, along with some of the most hospitable hotel staff I have ever encountered. I was escorted to my room so I could freshen up. I had twenty minutes to change clothes and get ready for an opening reception of the festival. My first thought was that it would have been nice if they could have at least given me time to relax for a few minutes, but then I remembered…they had. There were probably still people from my flight in line at customs. I pulled it together and headed downstairs to another waiting taxi. We drove through the crowded city, giving me an opportunity to see some of the buildings that were hundreds of years old. I was just settling into the “tourist” thing when we pulled into the parking lot of a newer building. This was the site of the reception held to welcome the storytellers who were attending the festival.</p>
<p>I was led into the building and brought into an auditorium filled with storytellers from several different countries. Speeches were made and the festival officially began. The best part for me though, was the reception afterward. I was greeted by about fifteen children and their mothers who were all really eager to learn more about where I was from. I spoke briefly to some of them regarding our shared African ancestry. Some of them seemed genuinely surprised to hear me share that Africans were brought to this island centuries ago. I’m excited to have the opportunity to present my love of ancestry to a warm and welcoming people here in Santo Domingo.</p>
<p>After this, I’m thoroughly exhausted but I wanted to make sure that I blogged something for my most faithful readers. I know as the adventure proceeds into tomorrow I will have more to share.</p>
<p>¡Buenas noches mi familia!</p>

<p>I was in a line just the other day at a video store (Yes there are a few of those still in existence) and a woman was standing a few people behind me. From her place in line she began instructing her teenage son on movie choices.</p>
<p>She was holding their place in line while her son was trying to figure out what movie to choose for their family to watch that evening.</p>
<p>Here were her instructions to him and the words that made me rush to have to pen this blog, “Violence and horror are ok but no sexuality.”</p>
<p>Violence and horror are ok!</p>
<p>This probably won’t be an issue for many of you but it is for me. I spend an inordinate amount of my time in the presence our youth and I’m often perplexed by their collective level of desensitization to violence. When I am storytelling, or simply conversing, with these same children and I begin to speak on issues of love or relationships they act as if I’m introducing them to something salacious.</p>
<p>These stories and conversations that I’m talking about contain the most innocuous content you could possibly imagine but their dissonant responses betray any appreciation for a resonance towards the amorous.</p>
<p>This topic isn’t new. I’ve had conversations over the years with many parents and organizations about the acceptance of violence in our children’s video games but the covering of eyes when certain “inappropriate” scenes make their way to television or movie screens.</p>
<p>How can we accept little boys yelling at video screens, “Kill’em! Kill’em! Kill’em!” and then cover the eyes of these same kids when witnessing two consenting adults engaged in a warm embrace or sharing a tender kiss? The question isn’t rhetorical. I’d really like an answer.</p>
<p>I know the mother I was standing in front of in that line had the best of intentions in mind concerning the movie she and her family were going to watch that night but telling her teenage son “violence and horror are ok but no sexuality.”</p>
<p>Really?</p>

Most of the people I’ve seen making these threats appear possessed by anger, fear and, often, an irrational hubris crying out for immediate medication or therapy.</p>
<p>I’ve listened to these zealots of myopic thought pontificate vehemently on the savagery and ignorance of other cultures; commanding time on major television news networks, radio stations, and mainstream print media.</p>
<p>If I am to believe the popular, and consistent, commentary of the social/political far-right in their assessment of Muslims the world over, then I must ask, “Why are Muslim’s not burning Bibles?”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Joanna-Ramos.jpg" rel="lightbox[2235]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2236" title="Joanna-Ramos" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Joanna-Ramos.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="305" /></a>Last friday two young girls agreed to meet off-campus from their school to fight one another here in the City of Long Beach California. According to witnesses the fight only lasted about a minute after which each of the girls went home.</p>
<p>Later that evening Joanna Ramos, 10 years old, complained that her head was hurting to her parents. Within hours she was dead. Today the coroner ruled her death a homicide as a result of blunt force trauma.</p>
<p>Part of my work involves visiting many of the schools here in Long Beach and I take pride in the honor of being able to serve our community in this capacity. I did not know the little girl or any of the children involved. I am touched because just a day prior to Joanna’s death I was in a classroom talking to 10 and 11 year olds about the choices they make having unimaginable consequences. During these classroom visits I feel a sense of urgency to reach as many of our children as I can to get them to begin thinking critically and see one another as allies rather than adversaries. Among many young girls there is a mantra of confrontation ignited by words as benign as, “She was looking at me!” There is even a trend among our youth participating in an activity known as “Bumping.’</p>
<p>“Bumping” occurs on campuses when a child will purposely bump into another child as a signal that they are challenging them to a fight. The two children involved in the bumping ritual agree to meet somewhere off campus and fight one another.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this is what occurred with Joanna Ramos but it is a pattern of behavior among our youth that adults in the community seem oblivious to.</p>
<p>What is not happening, and may not happen even now, is that the right questions are not being asked and answered. The death of Joanna Ramos is an indication of much greater systemic problems in our schools and communities. We are very good at asking the questions and treating the symptoms after the fact. That does not serve our children well at all. In fact, it is a disservice to function from a reactionary stance when it comes to our children.</p>
<p>Here is one question that should be asked: “Why do our youth feel compelled to engage in violent behavior?”</p>
<p>I assure you that there is no innate capacity for violence in “any” child and I am willing to stand by that statement against any evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>As I continue to visit more schools and classrooms, this little girl’s death is going to weigh heavy on my heart.</p>
<p>I will ask one more time, “Why do our children feel compelled to engage in violent behavior?”</p>
<p>I think the truth is more frightening to us then we care to admit, which is why questions such questions as these continue to go unanswered. If we answer questions such as these then we are forced to have to do something about them.</p>

I experienced such warmth and true affection that I’m  inspired to pull my car over and pen thoughts to paper. I travel the world, literally, and I’ve met with people from every station in life. I’ve spoken at, or performed in, synagogues, temples, mosques, churches, schools and even a few smokey bars but there is something about presenting before a room full of people, passionate our history, that imbues me with a deeper sense of purpose.</p>
<p>Less than 10 minutes ago I was in a room filled with people singing loudly with me, responsive to my insights, and not ashamed to shout words of encouragement during the performance. We laughed out loud and shared in the storytelling. At no time did I ever feel less than held in high esteem by those present. We shared in a level of timing and communication that can only be described as transcendent. The pastor of the church, Pastor Smith, came to me after my performance and pulled me into a deep, heartfelt embrace before inviting me back to perform for more of his parishioners. What a gift.</p>
<p>I like to think that I, and many others who do the type of work that I do, are continuing the legacy of Carter G. Woodson; the man who inaugurated, in 1926, a week recognizing the contributions of our ancestors to the world. With my life, I am attempting to represent with as much precision, class and integrity the inheritance of our history. The men and women of Primm Tabernacle AME Church in Pomona fed me in a way that is not easily described in words. I am humbled by the outpouring of love and respect heaped upon me during our time together this afternoon.</p>
<p>When my brother Jeff or Pastor Smith call, you can rest assure that I will be returning to do what I do for the good people of Primm Tabernacle AME Church in Pomona.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/standing-in-line.jpg" rel="lightbox[2227]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2228" title="standing-in-line" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/standing-in-line.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="395" /></a>I know what I’m about to ask is going to sound a bit strange but recent events have me re-thinking of lot of what I had considered the norm. Here’s my question, “Why is it important to teach our children that they must be able to stand in a line?”</p>
<p>Before you answer, hear me out.</p>
<p>Over the years, as a storyteller, I’ve traveled to, quite literally, thousands of schools. Yesterday I noticed something that struck me for a greater desire of insight. It wasn’t as if it was the first time I was seeing this, but yesterday, for some reason, it stood out.</p>
<p>All schools are not equal. That goes without saying and I don’t think many will debate the thesis, but there seems to be a shift in the equality of our expectations on our children.</p>
<p>I visit more public schools than any other type. Occasionally a private school will bring me to their campus to share tales of my travels, music and even allow me to do a little storytelling every now and then. In every single public school I’ve ever entered, the importance of getting students to form and remain in “straight” lines has been an “entry-level” aspect of the meta-curricula. There are a host of other reasons why educators and parents deem it of paramount importance that our children be able to form lines but I’ll leave that to the more informed among us to expound on.</p>
<p>Yesterday I visited one of those campuses where resources are not in question and equestrian instruction is a part of physical education. One of the things that struck me immediately as I watched whole classrooms of children walking to their dinning hall (they had a dinning hall, not a cafeteria), was that they were not walking in a line. The student’s were walking across their campus similar to the way college students do. They were chatting, laughing and playing around but moving in the direction of their desired destination. There was no disruption to the campus, no classrooms were being disturbed. These were young elementary age children, not middle or high schoolers.</p>
<p>As I watched these children able to move themselves from place to place on this campus without standing in line, I really started to question the importance of the concept of “standing in line.”</p>
<p>So, I ask this once again, “What is the importance of teaching our children to stand in a line and why is this not important at “all” socio-economic levels of education?”</p>

As I write this I’ve got a huge smile plastered across my face.</p>
<p>I was invited to play my Kora and do a little singing for the school’s “Multicultural Festival.” It seems each day the students celebrate different cultures from around the world. Today, my day, they were focusing on the continent of Africa.</p>
<p>The students from the ASB set the tone with me. They were all accommodating beyond belief and made me feel right at home. They even helped me get set up by hanging my banner and asking if there was anything else I needed. I have “never” got that kind of treatment at high school before… never.</p>
<p>As I walked around getting the lay of the land before performing I was greeted with smiles and warm greetings. Did I say that this is a high school? It wasn’t what I had anticipated. There was maturity about the kids I was encountering that put me right at ease.</p>
<p>When I came time for me to perform, it was during the student’s lunch time. I wasn’t expecting to get a large crowd gathered around me, and I didn’t. Most stood off in the distance enjoying their meals, talking with friends and horsing around. It reminded me of my days in high school. I was feeling a bit nostalgic as I glanced up from my Kora to the sights and sounds surrounding me from the outdoor stage.</p>
<p>I had an hour to play for them and so I went though the songs on my new CD, playing each of them in extended form, live. It was fun! I was really enjoying this and they seemed to as well. Usually I combine the music with storytelling and colorful commentary, but not today. Today I went into a musical zone and just poured my heart out through the strings of my harp. It was amazing, therapeutic even.</p>
<p>When I finished with the final song the entire campus erupted in loud applause. I wasn’t expecting it and so it surprised me. I wasn’t sure how many had actually been listening. As I looked up I could see hundreds of kids, all over the campus, and staff too, all applauding. I beamed a bright, uncontrollable smile and felt affirmed on a grand scale.</p>
<p>If anyone from Covina High ends up reading this, let me just say, “Thank you for today, your school has gone a long way in renewing my faith in our youth… thank you Covina High staff and students for an unforgettable day.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Coke_post-350px.jpg" rel="lightbox[2179]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2180" title="Coke_post-350px" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Coke_post-350px.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="288" /></a>Seven years ago my preferred beverage at “every” meal was Coca Cola in a nice tall glass and poured over several small cubes of ice. It is embarrassing to admit now, but I used to drink at least four 12 oz. cans with every meal. I am not joking! I had grown up drinking the beverage and, to this day, can’t even recall the first time I tasted it.</p>
<p>I ended my relationship with Coke oh so reluctantly. I made the choice to end my ritual of having four 12 oz. cans at every meal simply because I was packing on the pounds like a sumo wrestler. I also had been given advice by several friends that there would be other health consequences if my over consumption continued unabated.</p>
<p>During that time I never viewed my little guilty pleasure of Coke consumption as an addiction; that was until I tried to stop drinking it.</p>
<p>Initially I figured, “No big deal, I’ll just stop cold turkey and change up what I drink at meals.”</p>
<p>I received a rude awakening each time I attempted, early on, to deny myself my favorite drink. I, quite literally, was going through withdrawals. I had headaches for the first time in my life and felt agitated, easy to anger. This was not my personality. Those who know me, know how even tempered I am.</p>
<p>I began my path to being Coke free by cutting my consumption in half and giving myself a timeline of gradually decreasing the amounts I drank over time.</p>
<p>It took me more than a year to reach the point where I could say that I was no longer drinking Coke. A year! Well… that was seven years ago and I could have said, before yesterday, that I was seven years Coke free.</p>
<p>Now, about my little experiment yesterday.</p>
<p>Oh, before I start getting the emails, phone calls and strange looks in the streets let me clarify something. This was not an “official” Scientific Method variable compensated blind double blind type of experiment. No it was not. This exercise was purely anecdotal so don’t run off to the presses with an application of my results as evidence for anyone’s social or political agendas.</p>
<p>Here’s what happened yesterday.</p>
<p>I had a long drive I was making, listening to music and felling a little nostalgic. Somehow, some way, and I don’t know where the thought came from but, I got the idea that having a nice cold Coke  would be refreshing. I rationalized the decision by telling myself that the caffeine would help keep me awake for the drive.</p>
<p>So I stopped into a gas station convenience store and purchased a bottle of Coke.</p>
<p>I got into the car, opened the bottle, heard the familiar sizzle and fizz and then tilted the bottle back to enjoy my first sip in seven years.</p>
<p>It was disgusting!</p>
<p>There was no familiarity in the taste at all. My first impression was that it tasted like watered down carbonated castor oil. To add to the horrible taste in my mouth, the interior of my nose felt a slight burning sensation and my  eyes watered a bit.</p>
<p>It was only a sip!</p>
<p>These physical responses were immediately followed by me belching about four times in a row.</p>
<p>I thought my experience had ended after the final belch but then I was left with a nasty chemical-like castor oil after-taste in my mouth and what felt like a thin layer of milky coating on my tongue.</p>
<p>It took me half a bottle of water to wash down the majority of the after-taste and that still did not do it completely.</p>
<p>My Coke experiment was a disaster for me physically but a success mentally. I won’t be trying Coke again and I am quite sure that I’ve been cured of my nostalgic reflections over the good old days when I could sit and drink four 12 oz. cans with each meal.</p>
<p>Yesterday I definitely did not have a Coke and a smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Because I know so many of you will ask, I am just going to tell you. The symbol on my head in the post picture is an Adinkra symbol known as Kuntunkantan. Kuntunkantan is a symbol representing consciousness, among many other things.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/child-reading.jpg" rel="lightbox[2175]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2176" title="child-reading" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/child-reading.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="311" /></a>I recently returned from a school where I spent the day in classrooms, performing assemblies and having lunch with students and staff. The school was immaculate with manicured landscaping, plenty of windows, a huge gymnasium and even an Olympic size swimming pool. Art was displayed “everywhere,” both student work and that of professional artists. The cafeteria prepared meals upon student requests and all of the children had unfettered access to the campus library. Oh… by the way, did I mention that this school is an elementary school serving grades K though 5?</p>
<p>I am dismayed at the inequity of resources distributed to our educational institutions. It is unconscionable what we are doing to entire generations of citizens in many of our schools.</p>
<p>Equally, I can speak about schools I’ve visited where poverty, in all of its insidious forms, is devouring the hearts and minds of our children; where educators, pummeled by political agendas appear desperate and destitute of a desire to teach.</p>
<p>I am well aware that there are those among us with a desire to totally dismantle public systems of education. I am also aware that these same ideologues have been hard at work over the decades deconstructing what has taken centuries to build.</p>
<p>Are we a society or simply a population sharing a landmass?</p>
<p>I think that I periodically write these blog posts decrying the state of miseducation because it is difficult visiting schools and bearing first-hand witness to the inequalities.</p>
<p>While so much attention is being given to the financial crisis and the domestic political wars waged in partisan politics; little, or no, focus is being directed to the deconstruction and dismantling of our educational infrastructure.</p>
<p>If education is our passport to the future and tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today, then our future is not very bright.</p>
<p>Please disagree with me or offer a rebuttal that will change my perspective. I am so open to it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/hospice_hands1.jpg" rel="lightbox[2165]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2167" title="hospice_hands" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/hospice_hands1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="397" /></a>While in Mexico I received an email from the director of volunteers and bereavement services, Kaiser Permanente. It was a request that I perform for a group of hospice volunteers during one of their social gatherings.</p>
<p>My heart was touched that someone would think to include me. I felt honored. There was “no-way” that I was going to miss participating in that gathering, even if it meant that I had to move a few mountains to be there.</p>
<p>So much of my work, over the years, has consisted of being at the bed-side of the ill or those in transition and playing my Kora. It may seem like a terribly heart wrenching experience to voluntarily subject oneself to an environment where another human being has passed or is dying but, there is an indescribable beauty that is born in those moments.</p>
<p>My most cherished memories are not the performances where I’ve had a few thousand people in the audience, but the rare  opportunities I’ve been invited to play my Kora in a room of family members helping their loved one ascend onto the next levels of life.</p>
<p>So… like I said before, there was no way that I was going to miss sharing space and time with men and women who give of themselves so completely as do hospice volunteers.</p>
<p>Patty, the director and I, completed coordination my participation while I was still performing on tour in Mexico. We were all scheduled and set before I returned back to the States.</p>
<p>December 3rd was the day of my performance for the group. I couldn’t wait to be there! Hospice volunteers possess a rare and special soul. My admiration for their work extends far beyond simple respect into adoration.</p>
<p>Not too long after I arrived, I was on stage playing my Kora, singing and sharing a few tales. For me, it was magical. The gathering was small intimate gathering of about 30 or 40 people, all hospice volunteers. They were a lively, energetic crowd. Active participating wasn’t an issue as they were more than ready, willing and totally able.</p>
<p>When I requested they sing with me, they sang with such enthusiasm that I felt like I was sitting at home among friends and family. When they unearthed little tidbits of my tales, they laughed and spoke out unapologetically. I was in performer’s heaven.</p>
<p>By the close of my performance I felt like I had made a lot of new friends. I even found one woman who loves sewing and volunteered to help me out if I needed any tailoring (what a find!). I may have also been talked into doing a “Cure for Cancer Walk.”</p>
<p>I can honestly say that I loved being a part of this gathering. It was one of those small, intimate performances that feels most gratifying. There is something about being in the presence of people who are not only giving but equally demonstrative as well that feeds the spirit.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my time with the Kaiser Permanente Hospice Volunteers. I think I walked away with more from than I was able to give.</p>
<p>It was truly a blessing to have been permitted to be of service to such selfless souls.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Culiacan.jpg" rel="lightbox[2140]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2141" title="Culiacan" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Culiacan.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="263" /></a>I’ve been sitting here in the airport of the City of Culiacán for the last hour and a half. I finished performing for the students of Instituto Senda. It is an odd feeling sitting in this tiny airport listening to the Blues being played over the loudspeakers and hearing everyone speak Spanish.</p>
<p>I really must relate my experience at Senda because it was extra ordinary. This the school held an assembly of all of the students, parents, administrators and staff. Apparently they do this every Monday. The children have been raising money for causes such as Cancer, feeding the hungry and other things. There was a young child there who was on stage saying thank you to the entire school for the support and resources he received to treat a hearing defect.</p>
<p>I was taken onto a stage of an outdoor amphitheater and introduced to the school. It grew silent when I took the microphone. I began addressing the audience in Spanish and you should have seen the smiles explode all across the audience. It felt so good! Parents were nodding their heads in agreement with me and students were cheering. One of the administrators approached me after the address and hugged me and said, “We weren’t expecting you to be able to speak Spanish.” Another small triumph for decisions made in my youth.</p>
<p>I performed for three separate sessions, which went really well. I also visited a several classrooms. My classroom visits ranged in age from children 4 and 5 years of age to those much older, a few rooms of 14 and 15 year olds. My host, Edgar Sandoval was the most magnanimous host I’ve ever had. You can tell he really cares about his students. He treated me with such deference and respect that it made me want to not leave Senda. If I could’ve stayed a few more days then I would have. The school has a fantastic and enthusiastic population of learners.</p>
<p>Last night when I arrived in Culiacán I was a bit wary of how my visit my go, I mean, well… when you arrive at your hotel room and there are women dancing professionally on tables immediately next door to your room… well you get my drift.</p>
<p>Edgar drove me around a little in the city and then was kind enough to drop me off at the airport.</p>
<p>Culiacán has a reputation for being the drug capital of Mexico but I didn’t encounter anything sinister during my brief stay.</p>
<p>John Lee Hooker just started playing his guitar and singing on over the speakers here in the airport. I’m sorry, I’ve got to go. It is sacrilegious to do anything when the Blues Man is pouring out his soul. I’m going to kick back and take in some of Hooker’s wisdom.</p>
<p>I’ll be writing again once I get back to Mexico City. I’ve got another school early tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>I did say I could use a nap didn’t I?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mexico-city-street-art_01.jpg" rel="lightbox[2133]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2134" title="mexico-city-street-art_01" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mexico-city-street-art_01.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="262" /></a>There are many things to dislike about Mexico City: the smog, the insane traffic, profligate smoking, where 51.2% of all men can be found toking on cancer sticks in every crevice of public space. Add to these issues the congestion of 8 million souls populating a land mass not meant to sustain half that number and you have a recipe for sustained urban planning nightmares.</p>
<p>What is it about this city that continues to attract and inspire people in spite of its many faults? For me it is quite simple. Art.</p>
<p>In this city reside some of the world’s most gifted artists and installations of breathtaking works of art.</p>
<p>While walking through the city I couldn’t help but notice the over abundance of public art and displays. Every corner of the city, the center of every public park, on sidewalks and the walls of buildings are canvases for all mediums of artwork. There are also “traveling” displays, which move from parkways to the larger squares on weekends, allowing people to savor the beauty of Mexico.</p>
<p>In the United States artists struggle to find places to display their art and are often confronted with miles of red tape and bureaucracies if they have the “audacity” to desire a display their work publicly. I am not aware of the process that artists in Mexico have to go through, but upon quick glance it would appear that the process is less then intensive. To the outside observer, artists seem to be welcomed and supported here.</p>
<p>What caught my attention even more is that amidst all of this amazing art are ruin, overcrowding, and poverty. There are still many buildings destroyed in the 1985 earthquake that have been left as though no time had passed. There are signs everywhere to be careful with water consumption because the city has a difficult time getting water to all of its inhabitants. There are large holes in the streets, lead paint peeling openly off of buildings, and many structures leaning precariously due to the city having been built upon a lakebed. The roads are crowded and some streets even reverse directions at certain times during the day to handle congestion. There are problems with infrastructure that would make most engineers shudder. Many of the places that these people call home would be condemned and labeled uninhabitable in the USA.</p>
<p>Despite all these things, the art is still beautifully displayed for everyone, rich or poor, tourist or resident. Some people might wonder why a government would prioritize funding toward public art displays rather than infrastructure. Any ideas?</p>
<p>As a professional artist of more than 20 years, I’ve engaged in this “Either-Or” debate concerning Infrastructure vs. Art in the U.S.</p>
<p>It is difficult to get myopic minds to envision a conversation facilitated by infrastructure “and” art.  Poverty manifests itself in more ways than economically. In the U.S. we are currently suffering as much from a poverty of vision as anything else.</p>
<p>Mexico’s public art surrounds and envelopes its citizens and, its beauty, provides a vision of hope for a future that is bright. Mexico City has the potential to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world.</p>
<p>As an artist, I see art as an ingredient in unification. Art unites people in a way that no other discipline is able to. It promotes identity, self-awareness and a sense of pride. Nations are identified more by their art than reams of pedantic legislation or governmental structures.</p>
<p>Most people I have come into contact with here in Mexico City love and appreciate it despite the obvious issues. I have lived in places with much more in resources and beautifully supported infrastructure where people have less a sense of community and commitment than I experienced during my travels here in Mexico.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/cuentacuentos-02.jpg" rel="lightbox[2128]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2129" title="cuentacuentos-02" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/cuentacuentos-02.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="321" /></a>It would be a misnomer to say that last night I attended a &#8220;dinner party&#8221; because the gathering was so much more than that. Ever since I first began this tour of Mexico I’ve been looking forward to meeting two phenomenal storytellers, Victor Árjona and Ángel del Pilar. They are cornerstones of the Storytelling Movement here in Mexico and represent my aspirations as a cultural artist really well. The fact that they offered their home as an oasis in the evening made my respect for them grow exponentially.</p>
<p>We arrived, a few other storytellers and I, around 7:40 pm or so. The electricity was out in the building and we had to ascend about five flights of steps. As an aside… it seems to me that there exist an incalculable number of steps in this country, from the ancient Pyramids of Teotihuacan to ones inside of the mountains and mountains of contemporary buildings that dissect Mexico City.</p>
<p>The Angel was gracious enough to come down and meet us at the entrance of their flat. Yes… her name is Angel and not “The Angel” but I prefer to follow my first impressions. My imagination runs rampant and I find stories, poetry, humor and symbols in almost everything. I loved the fact that we were ascending a dark stairway being guided by a woman named Angel who was the only one who possessed light. I’m smiling to myself right now.</p>
<p>Once The Angel got us safely to the entrance of their home, we were greeted by a snowy white cat with more personality and vigor than any cat I’ve come across to date. He ran around, excitedly in circles and darted into a little box on the floor. He would disappear and reappear at the most odd moments, reminiscent of an “Alice in Wonderland” Cheshire cat manner. It was an entertaining sight to behold.</p>
<p>From around the corner of the kitchen Victor appeared. The first thing you notice about Victor are his eyes. Victor has the most honest eyes of any man I’ve ever met. They are both childlike and mature at the same time. A smile graced his face that made me feel as if I were at home. The scent of something cooking, something unfamiliar, permeated the house. It was both a pleasant and curiosity inducing smell.</p>
<p>Their home is an artist haven, it has art everywhere and an atmosphere of both creativity and well managed business. There seemed to have achieved a purpose filled balance in their home.</p>
<p>While Victor was busy preparing the evening’s meal, The Angel seated us and conversed with our little group.</p>
<p>I had had a moment a few days before, while traveling to the City of Mixquic. My cab driver was passing a mountain called “The Sleeping Woman.” It is actually a dormant volcano. The driver shared with me the legend of a young warrior and woman who were in love. The story possesses an enormous dose of pure enchantment and I thoroughly enjoyed it when the driver related it to me.</p>
<p>As synchronistic as my life tends to be, it was not surprising when Victor and The Angel shared a bit of the same tale, but with a twist. They had actually created, with the help of family and friends, a Kamishibai version of the ancient Mexican Tale. Kamishibai is an ancient Japanese form of storytelling where a box houses a rolling scroll of images that the storyteller rotates while telling the tale. They had beautifully decorated Kamishibai boxes with images of the themes of their stories and illustrations which slid into the back of the box. Most traditional Kamishibai boxes are plain, rather simple but these had a Mexican cultural spin put on them with lots of bright colors and images.</p>
<p>I was excited because my friend in Poland, Michael, has been working with Kamishibai for some time now and encouraging me to do the same.</p>
<p>They had several decorative Kamishiai boxes and well planned out tales to tell with them. I was impressed. These two are definitely storytellers heart and soul.</p>
<p>A couple of other local storytellers arrived and we all gathered around a circular dining room table. A circle. Yes… really, a circular table. For some of you that won’t mean much but for others it will have metaphysical and cultural significance. I was delighted to be seated at “The Round Table” with this gathering of other storytellers.</p>
<p>Initially I was going to say that Victor is a wonderful cook but, after having tasted the caramelized onion he prepared for us to start the meal with, I have to retract and declare that he is an authentic chef with tantalizing culinary skills.</p>
<p>I had some hesitation in biting into an onion that had been oven baked for a few hours but I quickly overcame in favor of desiring the experience. I was not disappointed. I wanted so badly to savor every single bite of that onion but I would have held up the evening. Seriously, I think I could have taken an hour to slowly and purposefully eat that caramelized onion. The textures, the flavors, the meat of the vegetable that melted in your mouth… oh my God! Ok, obviously it was good. To let you know how detail oriented Victor can be, our main dish was comprised of chopped vegetables whose colors mirrored the many colors you find all over Mexico and in Mexican Art. I was in a scene from &#8220;Como Agua para Chocolate&#8221; and loving every second of it.</p>
<p>The conversation flowed around the table easily. No one competed with anyone else to be heard. One of the tellers, Andy from New Zealand, and his son, performed a soul stirring Haka for everyone. If you’ve never watched a Rugby match or seen a Tongan Haka performed then go to YouTube and put the work in and be prepared to have an experience. I thought the walls and floors were going to come tumbling down. It was one of the highlights of the night, besides Victor’s culinary delights of course.</p>
<p>It was part dinner party, part ritual and part gathering of kindred spirits. There were laughs, tears and a ton of sharing. I found myself so at ease with the members of this gathering that it reminded me of the rites and rituals I’ve been blessed to be a part of over the decades.</p>
<p>I left late in the evening with a deep desire for all of our paths to cross once again. It was an evening of being fed both physically and spiritually that I will not soon forget.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/crecer.jpg" rel="lightbox[2113]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2114" title="crecer" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/crecer.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="186" /></a>Last week I visited a school called “Crecer” which means “to grow” in Spanish. The school is located in the City of Tlaxcala. I didn’t know much about the city except that it was located outside of the metropolis of Mexico City. I always love getting away from the noise and crowds of big cities so a trip to Tlaxcala was perfect for me. I had already suffered a week of hearing sirens every few minutes, incessant horn honking and music blaring around every corner I turned. The fact that I was going to have a two-hour bus ride to get there was even more of an enticement.</p>
<p>I boarded the bus and felt that, “sit back and relax” feeling you get when someone else is doing the driving. My plan was simple. I would stare out of the large window of the bus for two hours taking in the country’s landscape.</p>
<p>No sooner did the driver pull away from our stall when, miraculously, television monitors descended from the ceiling of the bus with their volumes already set on maximum. Television monitors! I could have screamed!</p>
<p>I rode for two hours being subjected to a diaper-wearing Panda who apparently knows kung-fu and simultaneously channels the spirits of Larry, Curly and Moe. I knew I was in the minority as someone who was desperately seeking solace in silence because, the entire trip, there were bursts of raucous laughter, loud conversations and, believe this or not, people actually playing music aloud from their phones.</p>
<p>I did manage to stare out into the vast expanse that is Mexico and view some beautiful land. Dormant volcanoes, snow capped mountains, fields upon fields of corn and other vegetation. Mexico is truly a blessed piece of earth.</p>
<p>I was met at the bus station in Tlaxcala by Martha Jáuregui, director of Crecer. From the beginning, Martha’s warm and inviting demeanor made me feel welcomed in her city. On our way through Tlaxcala to her school I was treated to some of the most picturesque sites of colonial architecture and baroque inspired iglesias. Prior to arriving, Martha warned me that her campus was very small. What Martha didn’t know at the time was that “small” and “quaint” was just what I was in need of after Mexico City.</p>
<p>The campus was indeed small but grand in vision. The feel of the campus reminded me of a throwback to an era when a small community shaped the environment of its school.</p>
<p>I was scheduled to perform for the upper grades only. The youngest, kinder and pre-k, had been excluded. I didn’t feel so good about those children, on such a small campus, having been excluded so I asked Martha if it would be alright for me to visit their classrooms for just a few minutes. She was excited to consent and escorted to me the kinder and pre-k classrooms. It was so much fun!</p>
<p>I got a chance to sing “Los Pollitos” with the children and find out their names. One little girl, about 4 or 5 years of age, wrapped her arms around my neck when I squatted down to get eye-to-eye with her group. What a wonderful feeling.</p>
<p>The sessions with the older groups went exceptionally well. I got the feeling  from these small groups of teens that they had not yet been tainted by the cynicism or angst of their peers in the larger cities. Their questions were both thoughtful and probing. By the time I had to leave I felt as though I had been in the company of an extremely mature group of young adults. How refreshing!</p>
<p>I told Martha of my interest in I.B. Schools (International Baccalaureate) and she introduced me to their I.B. coordinator, Guadalupe. There was a light shining in Guadalupe’s eyes that immediately enamored me with her. As we spoke I could tell that her passion for learning and teaching was beyond the pale. She and Martha are definitely two peas in a pod. I think that by the time I left the school I must have hugged everyone 4 or 5 times each. It was a refreshing experience to visit “Crecer.”</p>
<p>You might have thought that I would have been left with my good feeling and placed back on the bus to head back to Mexico City but that was not in Martha’s plans. She and her husband personally escorted me around the city of Tlaxcala and patiently answered my touristy questions. There is a bull- fighting ring in the city that I got to see, a beautiful church and, in the square, some amazing artwork.</p>
<p>My visit to Tlaxcala gave me back the solace that I was so desperately seeking. I can honestly say that I found tranquility in Tlaxcala. Thank you Martha and the entire staff of Crecer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mexico-city-metro.jpg" rel="lightbox[2102]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2103" title="mexico-city-metro" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mexico-city-metro.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="233" /></a>While in Mexico I decided that I would make sure to use public transportation. I honestly feel that public transportation is a sure fire way to get to know the city and people up close and personal. Little did I know when I boarded the subway in Zona Rosa that I was going to experience one particular person up close and “real” personally.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what happened&#8230;</p>
<p>I jumped onto the subway just as the doors were closing. I scanned the train car looking for a seat. There was only one available so I raced toward it trying to beat the crowd. I didn’t even take time to see who it was near or next to. I flew into the available seat and noticed, for the first time, that no one else was competing to get there before me. I’ve caught this train before and this was the “first” time that I was able to get a seat. I was feeling really lucky until I looked to my left and saw an elderly woman who was obviously homeless and, as her eyes indicated, a bit unbalanced mentally.</p>
<p>I have to speak honestly. She smelled badly, her long black raven satin hair was oily and dirty. The many layers of soiled clothing and tattered coats would have given the average person a heat stroke. In her hands, falling from her toothless mouth and covering her clothes and the floor around her were pieces of a half eaten, very messy sandwich. It didn’t seem that much of it was making it into her mouth.</p>
<p>In that moment I had a decision to make (I seem to be faced with these a lot lately). I could either sit down next to her and brace myself for all that might come with sharing space with her, or I could walk a little bit further away and stand comfortably by myself. Ok&#8230; You know me by now. You know that I chose to stay seated next to her. After all, she is a human being simply down on her luck economically. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>So I sat down there, turned toward her, and looked her in the eyes to validate that I saw her as a human being, not simply an &#8220;undesirable&#8221; in society. I was feeling pretty good about my decision until her demeanor flipped and my eyes felt an empty, glassy stare that looked through me to some distant point behind me.</p>
<p>I wasn’t prepared for what she did next. She totally caught me off guard. I’m looking into her vacant eyes and expression when, out of nowhere she draws back and, with her full force, punched me in the arm.</p>
<p>Yes! She punched me!</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t really hurt, but it was in that moment that I realized I was going to have to up my game exponentially if I was going to remain seated next to her. In that split second, I turned to her and gave it my best shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you!”  I whispered aloud to her.</p>
<p>Immediately she softened, her entire disposition changed to one of an enamored, flirtatious little girl.</p>
<p>At this point, she extended her hand, food and condiments dripping and falling from the side, and offered me some of her sandwich. Sensing that this was going in the right direction I immediately asked her a few things about herself. She was genuinely pleased with having someone to talk with. I thought things were really looking up. She was happy. I was comfortable. It was at this point that I felt her shift in her seat and begin leaning over to move closer to me. Before I knew it she was rubbing her grubby head and oily hair affectionately against the side of mine. She was really moving our &#8220;budding friendship&#8221; along faster, and more intimately, than I expected. Fortunately, for me she wanted more sandwich than cuddling. She sat back in her seat, flashing her wide toothless smile every few minutes as we continued with a little more small talk. I could see the faces of the passengers around me. I think they either felt sorry for me or they may have been questioning my sanity.</p>
<p>When my stop came up I turned to her and told her it had been nice chatting with her, as I would have done in any &#8220;typical&#8221; encounter. She smiled that wide, toothless, gummy smile once more and I could see that those few moments of discomfort on my part might have given her the gift of feeling &#8220;normal&#8221;. Maybe in that moment she didn&#8217;t feel invisible.  It gave me the chance to reflect on how easy it is to overlook some people in society.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pyramids.jpg" rel="lightbox[2096]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2097" title="pyramids" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/pyramids.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="179" /></a>I had ascended to the top of the Sun Pyramid at Teotihuacán and was feeling rather proud of myself until I spotted an old man and woman in about their mid-70’s appear over the crest of the steps about 20 minutes later. My jaw dropped. This was no easy climb. The steps are uneven and narrow in some places, the incline is ridiculous in others and climbing the distance from top to bottom puts a burn in your body equivalent to a punishing workout.</p>
<p>The old man was being held up on his right arm by a woman equal his age. She appeared a bit stronger while he actually walked with a limp. These two had climbed the Pyramid of the Sun together without any assistance! It was both a thing of beauty and awe inspiring at the same time.</p>
<p>I lost track of the elderly couple while walking around the top of the pyramid. It is huge. I didn’t see them again until I began my descent down the dangerous steps. They had already begun going down before me. They were about 10 steps down below me and moving at a very slow pace. The steps are uneven and jagged in some areas and I noticed people in a rush crowding the elderly couple, almost trying to make them move faster. There wasn’t much room but some of the impatient philistines found ways to maneuver around them. I was appalled at the behavior of these people and rushed down the steep steps to position myself between the elderly couple and the remainder of the people descending the pyramid. I slowed the crowd behind me and wasn’t allowing anyone to pass. The elderly couple ahead of me were finally making their way down without interruption. I felt good about that.</p>
<p>As we were going down I noticed the old man’s foot slip once and it frightened me so much that I ran down and grabbed his right arm. On his left was his companion and, on his right, me. There were many steps left and the rest of the crowd seemed to get the hint and remained behind us.</p>
<p>It was a slow pace but we finally made it to the bottom of the pyramid. The old man and woman smiled as he said to me, “Gracias Señor.”</p>
<p>As I left the couple I was feeling good about my minimal role in their visit to the pyramids. I smiled to myself as I recalled the motif of tales that have spirits entering our world to interact with human beings, testing us or challenging us to be better. It occurred to me that, in those types of tales, the elderly couple I encountered would have represented a pair of spirits sent to test our humanity.</p>
<p>Be honest with me. Would you have passed the test?</p>

I was heading to the cafeteria to get a bite to eat when then swooped in and surrounded me. I was being held captive in the middle of a circle by about group of 8, 9 and 10 year olds pummeling me with questions.</p>
<p>I loved it!</p>
<p>I promised the girls that I would write something about them because, and this was an awakening for me, they actually read my blog! So here’s a little shout out to each of you:</p>
<p>Mikaela thank you so much for writing a comment to me on Facebook.</p>
<p>Aranza you also wrote a comment to me on Facebook and, for that, I am very grateful as well.</p>
<p>Ximena thank you for sharing the story I told you with your brother. I hope he liked it.</p>
<p>Ana you went above and beyond by getting home and telling your mom, grandma and brother the story I shared with you. Oh… and, by the way, tell your mom, the illustrator, that we need to talk :)</p>
<p>Elena you were another gift to me because you shared the story with your mom too. Have your mom “friend me” on Facebook, I’d love to hear her thoughts on the tale.</p>
<p>Claire, in the middle of all the questions and hugs the little group was throwing my way you interrupted and asked, “Would you like a cookie?” Wow! A little girl walking around the playground passing out cookies. That made me so happy.</p>
<p>Lucie I won’t forget you either. You were walking around handing out “toys.” That is awesome. I still have my little turtle you gave me. Thank you.</p>
<p>There was a list of names at the bottom of the paper and on the back who I don’t have references for so I’m justing going to say thank you to Anna, Carolina, Paula, Victoria and Zarah for putting your names on the note.</p>
<p>Each and everyone of you have helped to make my trip to Mexico an absolutely glorious experience.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/growth.jpg" rel="lightbox[2088]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2089" title="growth" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/growth.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="214" /></a>I’ve been in Mexico City for about a week now. The city’s tempo is just like most other urban centers of the world, fast paced and congested simultaneously. The streets overflow with pedestrians, careening taxis and sirens morning, noon and night.</p>
<p>I haven’t blogged in a few days. I’ve been walking the streets of the Mexico city for hours at a time when not working. Public transportation and walking are great ways to learn a city’s secrets. I have to admit though that Ive been a little anxious about getting back to my hotel to return emails, phone calls, and respond to communications on social networks. My tour manager, Alberto, has helped me to divide my days in half. One half = work and, of course, the other half = enjoyment.</p>
<p>I did have an incident occur a few days ago that I wanted to share with you. My tour manager and I completed work at a school early in the day and headed back to our hotel. When we arrived to the hotel I noticed, as we were exiting the cab, that neither of us had my camera bag.</p>
<p>Time to panic right? We searched the cab and didn’t find it. We assumed that we had left it at the school. There was nowhere else it could be. Since I had to return to the same school the following day it wasn’t an issue.  I found a silver lining for this mishap. Had I managed to bring all of the audio/video equipment back with me, I would have been trapped in my hotel room working. Since I couldn’t work without the equipment I took it as a sign that I needed to just relax. What did I do to relax you may ask? Well, of course, I walked the streets of Mexico City for a few hours.</p>
<p>The next morning when I arrived at the school and inquired about my cameras I discovered that they were not there. They were missing. Time to panic right? I had, literally, no idea where the cameras could be. The school’s administrator went into action searching high and low, calling in the assistance of everyone on campus. The entire school was on alert and searching for my missing cameras.</p>
<p>Here’s my point in writing about this. There was a time, when I was much younger, that I would’ve probably jumped to the assumption that “Someone stole my stuff!” This negative assertion would have been accompanied by a great deal of, self-inflicted, psychological and physiological stress.</p>
<p>The school’s administrator had made my loss a priority and was doing everything humanly possible to bring it to a positive resolution in my favor. When we had a moment to talk, I pulled her aside to speak privately. I let her know that I had no anxiety associated with my loss. There was no one to blame or at fault for whatever might have happened. I told her that if I, the owner of the missing items, was able to put them out of my mind and be at peace, then she should the same.</p>
<p>She wasn’t buying into my Zen theory of loss and continued on her focused mission of recovery.</p>
<p>I was here to share culture, music and time with the students of this campus. I was well aware that the “potential” stress aligned with my missing equipment possessed the power to derail my usual successes. I wasn’t going to allow that to happen, regardless of the circumstances. There is a line in one of my favorite films that I sometimes recall in moments like this. The movie is titled “Daughters of the Dust” and I believe it debuted in the early to mid-90’s. In the film there is a child who has yet to be born speaking in the opening. The child says, “I’m on a spiritual mission but sometimes life gets in the way.” I could be quoting that inaccurately but you get the point.</p>
<p>If I take a step back and examine my reactions to this situation, I have to say that I am really proud of the manner in which I was handling it. The equipment was expensive and yet, I was not feeling any of the turmoil that one typically feels when something like this happens. I chose to celebrate my calm disposition as opposed to fixating on my loss.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the first session with the children and didn’t permit any thoughts of loss to disrupt my focus on them and their needs. The second session I felt even more successful and managed to have all of my learners engaged from start to finish.</p>
<p>The students were laughing, smiling and soaking up every word that I spoke. There was nothing else in the world but our time together and whatever we chose to fill it with (music, stories, question/answer, conversation, etc.).</p>
<p>At the end of the second session, while I was releasing the students back to their teachers, the administrator entered from the back of the room. Cradled in her hands was my black bag of camera equipment.</p>
<p>I grabbed her and hugged her with the tightest most sincerely thankful hug I could give. I asked her where she found it. Her answered embarrassed me a bit. It had been left in the cab, she explained, and the cab company brought it back. She, personally, gave them a reward of 500 pesos for returning it. The cab company didn’t want to accept it, they were returning the equipment based on their honor.</p>
<p>It was an ephiphanal moment for me. To leave anything in a cab, anywhere in the world, and have it returned, is nothing short of a miracle. If it had not been for this school’s administrator and staff, I know, with certainty, that I would never have seen my equipment again.</p>
<p>It would be self aggrandizing for me to put forth the premise that my disposition of release, and making the students a priority, helped to create the conditions which allowed for the return of my equipment. My only success is that I never permuted the negative thought of “Someone stole my stuff” to creep into my mind. The bare truth of the matter is that one little tenacious woman, assisted by the staff of the school, refused let the issue rest until they prevailed.</p>
<p>Thank you Frances and all of the staff at Green Gates school for your warmth, hospitality and patience.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/language-magic.jpg" rel="lightbox[2079]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2080" title="language-magic" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/language-magic.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="222" /></a>While waiting to board my flight to Mexico at the Los Angeles International Airport yesterday, I decided to purchase a local newspaper for Spanish speakers . I used to do this more often when I first began learning Spanish, in order to challenge my word knowledge and increase vocabulary. I’ve been a Spanish speaker for a little more than 20 years now. I enjoy languages and my trip to Mexico is a perfect opportunity to hone my love of linguistics.</p>
<p>Back to the story. Well… I’m at an airport kiosk and I place my newspaper, “La Opinion,” on the counter along with a few decadent snacks that I should not be eating. The woman behind the counter takes the paper off of the counter and tries to replace it with another paper. “You’ve made an error, this paper is in Spanish,” she says to me.</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t make an error, that is the paper I want,” I respond.</p>
<p>“You speak Spanish!” she replies in a tone of astonishment.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why this happens but it happens often enough for me to take notice.</p>
<p>The woman behind the counter began speaking to me in Spanish, and, as we conversed, she asked me where I was from. I said, “Los Angeles,” and began to explain my affinity for languages when she interrupted me. “No,” she says, “I mean where in South America.”</p>
<p>Here’s a synopsis of how the conversation went and this happens more often that you’d believe:</p>
<p>Me:  “I’m from the United States.”</p>
<p>Her:  “No… you’re family, where in South America is you family from?”</p>
<p>I take this as a compliment that a native speaker can’t detect the accent in my speaking. I thoroughly enjoy when this happens. I was finally able to explain to her that I wasn’t a native speaker. She was impressed and her enthusiasm heightened as we spoke. She was from Colombia. We started talking about my last  trip to Colombia, the food, the people, the history, etc. Our conversation went on for awhile until it was interrupted by a long line of clients waiting to make their own purchases. Initially I had been the only person standing at the kiosk. We had both become oblivious to our surroundings and were enjoying our conversation in Spanish so much that we lost track of time. Those moments when we are immersed in exchanges with other human beings, and lose ourselves, are enchanting.</p>
<p>I was finally permitted to purchase my “La Opinion” newspaper and continue on my way after a warm hug from her and a few more words of praise for my Spanish. This sort of exchange occurred with me regularly while I was in Colombia last year.</p>
<p>Whether you’ve established fluency in another language or not, people tend to open themselves up to you more when you make an attempt to engage them in their mother tongue. I can’t tell you the innumerable opportunities that have been presented to me simply because I have made an effort to comprehend, not just the languages of others, but their cultures as well.</p>
<p>When I got on the plane and took my seat, I opened my little bag of “decadence” and found a few extra pieces of imported dark chocolate. Had the kiosk operator put them in there by accident or, was this another, typical, Colombian gesture of kindness?</p>
<p>I prefer to think of it as the magic of language.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/muhammad-ali.jpg" rel="lightbox[2070]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2071" title="muhammad-ali" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/muhammad-ali.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="388" /></a>Late in the evening on October 19th I stood in line with hundreds of other passengers hoping to make it to the ticket counter of Continental Airlines at Guarulhos International Airport in São Paulo Brazil. I could have given in to the temptation to fume with anger and frustration but I chose to self-medicate. I took out my iPod and placed the earphones into my ears and put on my playlist of old Motown smoothies. Um… you cannot be irritated when listening to Marvin, The Temptations or the Supremes. It is just not possible.</p>
<p>A few times I caught myself singing out loud, really loud, while the line moved at a snails pace. I wouldn’t even have noticed if it had not been for the odd looks and stares I was getting from others in line. What is up these days? People don’t sing anymore?</p>
<p>So I’m standing in line, moving slowly, standing some more followed by additional slow movement until, hours later I finally reached the ticket counter and put my iPod away. Hooray! Right?  Well as soon as the ticket agent eyeballed my instrument case and registered a countenance of shock I knew I was about to have trouble.</p>
<p>“You’re going to have to pay extra for that!” he quipped.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to measure it first?” I asked.</p>
<p>He went on to explain that he had worked for Continental many years and didn’t have to weigh or size “that” oversized/overweight case. He knew.</p>
<p>All I had asked was if he was going to measure it first and that seemed to put him in a defensive posture.</p>
<p>Trouble was “officially” present and I was directly in his crosshairs.</p>
<p>“Please do not try and tell me how to do my job sir!”</p>
<p>I hadn’t even spoken another word and trouble had already grown another foot taller.</p>
<p>At this point, now I was starting to get irritated. My consciousness altering iPod with its tons of tunes was tucked safely away in my pocket and I was feeling the need to whip it out and put the earphones back where they belonged, in my ears. But even the sultry voice of Mary Wells wasn’t about to redirect the path of this, inevitable, collision of male egos.</p>
<p>He sent one of his assistants to measure and weigh my case. The assistant came back with a measurement and, for the first time, I saw a smile grace his face. Immediately I felt the virtual vinyl LP drop onto the turntable of my mind and play an old Temptation’s track “Smiling Faces.” The lyrics danced around in my head, “smiling faces show no traces of the evil that lurks within…”</p>
<p>“Can you dig it?”</p>
<p>Believe it or not I was managing to remain pretty calm. My irritation was subsiding during his soliloquy of rules and regulations, which I was not hearing because, by this time in my head Stevie Wonder was belting out his song entitled “Uptight.”</p>
<p>“Baby everything is alright, uptight, way out’a sight…”</p>
<p>I smiled during his tirade and it must have caught him off guard because his entire disposition changed like maybe he thought he was dealing with a madman or something.</p>
<p>“Do you understand why you must pay?” he asked.</p>
<p>I hadn’t heard a single word he had said. I knew he was functionally fixated on his position. I reminded myself of the old adage, “All the proof in the world will not change the mind of a cynic.”</p>
<p>I gave it the old college try anyway and spoke, “Before leaving Los Angeles I had taken my case to the airport and had it weighed and measured by Continental. I have copies of your website’s baggage policies as well as the names of the Continental agents who verified that the case does not require a fee…”</p>
<p>I was about to take out my copies of paperwork and the copies of Continental’s baggage policies when he interrupted me and said, “You’re taking up time of other passengers, you’re going to have to step aside!”</p>
<p>He was angrier.</p>
<p>I could see that this was going nowhere good.</p>
<p>I breathed in for a second, weighed my options and told him, “Go ahead and charge me what you believe I should pay.”</p>
<p>His head cocked to the side like that old RCA victrola dog. Ah… I had the element of surprise on my side. He was expecting a continued argument and I appeared to be acquiescing. I assure you that I was not giving in.</p>
<p>I, my friends, was practicing the ancient Art of War.</p>
<p>1st rule: Know your opponent.</p>
<p>2nd rule: If you can avoid it, never battle in another man’s land.</p>
<p>There’s more to it but you can read Sun Tzu for yourself if you want.</p>
<p>I smiled again and told him to go ahead and charge me.</p>
<p>He wasn’t speaking. He was just looking at me rather curiously.</p>
<p>I then said, “Excuse me, there are so many people in line behind me and I don’t want to hold them up. Could you please go ahead and process the case?”</p>
<p>He then asked the oddest question, “You do understand that your are going to have to pay?”</p>
<p>I smiled once more and said as simply as I could, “Yes.”</p>
<p>He processed me and I went on my merry way subconsciously humming “War” by Edwin Starr… “What is it good for… absolutely nothing, say it again…”</p>
<p>Here’s what I had reasoned to myself, as the agent’s earlier tirade  played as low decibel background to my thinking.</p>
<p>I knew the policy better than he did. I had researched and was much more informed. I also knew that any errors on his part would need to be corrected by someone of a more accommodating disposition. I, after all, am a patient man (sometimes anyway).</p>
<p>I walked away feeling as though I had just won a battle without fighting. Something between good karma and intuition allowed me to quickly put this incident behind me knowing I would deal with it later.</p>
<p>Following 15 hours of travel from Brazil to Los Angeles, I was finally back. I went and spoke with the Continental baggage claim people who, instantly, verified that I should not have been charged for my case. The agents annotated my record and assured me that the issue would be rectified.</p>
<p>I was so tired at this point I just nodded, said thank you and went home to sleep.</p>
<p>The next day, a bit more energized I headed to Los Angeles International Airport. I don’t live that far from the airport and going there is much quicker than pressing all of those buttons on the phone and getting disconnected before you even get another human being to communicate with.</p>
<p>I got to the airport and made it to the ticket counter in no time flat. The ticket agent advised me a refund had already been issued. Now check this out… he apologized for the other agent!</p>
<p>The agent then handed me a receipt and explained that the refund would be back on my card within 3 to 5 days.</p>
<p>I left feeling really good and, when I got to my car I realized that I had not even looked at the receipt to make sure that they had refunded me the correct amount. The payment I made in Brazil was in their currency, Reais.</p>
<p>I sat in my car and pulled out the receipt. My jaw dropped and my eyes opened wide. It was the amount!</p>
<p>A big, mischievous smile slowly spread across the expanse of my face.</p>
<p>“Don’t let the handshake and the smile fool ya, I’m only trying to school ya… Smilin faces, smiling faces…”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Lycee.jpg" rel="lightbox[2064]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2065" title="Lycee" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Lycee.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="207" /></a>Today I visited my last school on the final leg of this 3 city tour in Brazil. Did I enjoy myself? More than I can say. Do I feel as though my work was appreciated and respected? Yes, and with such grace and dignity that I can honestly say that I was an honor to visit the beautiful nation.</p>
<p>The school I just left, not more than an hour ago is called Lycée Pasteur. It is a French school based in São Paulo. “All” of the students are fluent in French. I was amazed at the level of fluency each and every child demonstrated. Our guide at the school explained that the majority of the children who attend Lycée Pasteur begin in preschool together and continue all the way through their high school graduation as one class. Impressive.</p>
<p>I performed for two groups of 11 and 12 year olds today. I had such an amazing time! The children were warm, inviting and so receptive.</p>
<p>I had a chance to not feel like a complete failure linguistically here in Brazil because I was able to communicate in French with the students.</p>
<p>While I was performing for the second group of children, I couldn’t help but to notice a young girl who kept mimicking my movements. I have a tendency to appear to dance when I tell stories. Ah… who am I kidding? I love animating words and emotions and it comes so naturally that I dance while telling tales, and I love it! Every small gesture and movement I made, the young girl was right there with me. She was seated all the way in the back row, but I noticed here easily. I was intrigued because she didn’t appear to be joking, she was actually enjoying my unrehearsed choreography.</p>
<p>When the session ended, before dismissing the children, I made a point of letting her know that I was aware of her copying “my style.” Everyone laughed. I pointed directly at here and the sea of children parted because they knew who I was talking about. I said to her in front of the entire group, “You like the way I move don’t you?”</p>
<p>The child nodded in affirmation and then I put out a challenge, “Come dance with me then!”</p>
<p>I was surprised when the little girl jumped from her seat in the back row, navigated past her peers and was standing before me in no time flat.</p>
<p>What was I going to do? I just knew she would refuse. Well… I am no coward so I did what any man would do.</p>
<p>I took her hand into mine, placed her other hand on my shoulder and instructed the audience to sing a song that I had taught them earlier.</p>
<p>I wish I could remember her name. This child’s courage was inspirational. Not only was she dancing with me but she was clearly able to enjoy herself in front of more than 70 or so of her peers. I love children like this, they remind me of why I do what I do.</p>
<p>When we ended our little ballet I made sure to end with a dip. She loved it, I loved it, the entire group loved it!</p>
<p>As she returned to her seat, her peers cheered and applauded her loudly.</p>
<p>Then I dismissed the children they came running down the lecture hall from their chairs straight at me. It was a sea of excited adolescence careening straight for me. There was hugs and hand shakes happening all over the place. I must have done my job well because there didn’t appear to be a single soul in the auditorium who wasn’t offering some gesture of appreciation.</p>
<p>This was a wonderful way to end my tour here in Brazil.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/graffitti.jpg" rel="lightbox[2059]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2060" title="graffitti" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/graffitti.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="218" /></a>Whenever I travel to other urban areas of the world I try to explore their graffiti. Graffitti, not tagging, those are two totally different things. I know we get them confused sometimes but, to me, tagging is ego tripping and graffiti is self-expression.</p>
<p>While cruising around Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo I noticed that much of their graffiti seemed much like the graffiti of the late 70’s and 80’s in urban areas of the United States. I’m continually noticing similarities between Brazil and the United States of 20 to 30 years ago, not just in graffiti.</p>
<p>Graffiti as art makes statements both social and political. I found some amazing graffiti in Rio and São Paulo. I’m thinking of putting a slideshow together of just the graffiti artwork that I’ve taken pictures of. Bogota and Cali in Colombia had some really dynamic stuff as well.</p>
<p>I’m often asked how I&#8217;ve learned so much, so fast about places I travel and languages. There are two methods of immersion that I use. Before traveling, I read, research, view documentaries and inundate my brain with more than is humanly possible to “outwardly” retain. Secondly, when I get to another country I “hit-the-streets.” You won’t learn anything about the people sitting in your comfortable hotel room watching television.</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to hit the streets in Brazil as much as I would have liked. I had schedules to maintain and performances to prepare for, but the graffiti gave me a gift of sight that I otherwise would not have received.</p>
<p>I can remember when graffiti artists were the scourge of big urban centers in the United States. Now, when I travel, I see whole governments and businesses setting aside funds to patronize these artists by giving them wall spaces they would have had to sneak in and paint in the dark of the night 30 years ago.</p>
<p>I’ve got to get ready to head to another school. Today is my final day in Brazil. I’ve got a 3 day break back in the U.S. and then I head to Mexico.</p>
<p>I’ll try to get back and update as soon as I can.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/dinner.jpg" rel="lightbox[2054]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2055" title="dinner" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/dinner.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="225" /></a>It’s late in the evening here in São Paulo, around 11 pm, and I’m just getting back to my hotel room. I attended a small, very intimate dinner hosted by a couple who reside here, Patrick and Teresa. It was an unforgettable evening and, instead of going to bed, as I should because I’ve got an early morning performance, I’m sitting here writing about it.</p>
<p>Early in the day, with rain falling heavily and the scent of São Paulo’s air absolutely satiating the senses, I contemplated canceling my attendance. The thought of staying in my room and relaxing or doing some reading while the rain beat against my 11th story window was very seductive.</p>
<p>I have a thing about commitments though. It disturbs my sensibilities when people do not keep their word and I don’t ever want to be anyone’s hypocrite. Although vacillating in my decision to attend or not, I knew that I would go regardless of how I felt. I value my word above all else.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Patrick and Teresa’s house it was a beautiful, meticulously landscaped, home. Teresa welcomed us and apologized for the jungle that she had created on her front terrace, but I loved it.</p>
<p>We entered and I met her husband Patrick, a journalist who is very gentle and accommodating. Patrick introduced me to the man I had come to meet, Geraldo Tartaruga (Tartaruga means turtle and it is a named he earned in his youth).</p>
<p>We all sat around a dinner table in the kitchen and talked while Teresa prepared the meal. It felt like a moment out of one of the old black and white movies, reminding me of a time when people gathered just for the sake of being together. There was no television, no radio and the conversation flowed like a steady stream.</p>
<p>Geraldo spun off about 7 to 10 stories in a row with ease, each as entertaining and enlightening as the last. Patrick chimed in wanting me to share and, of course, I did. I reached deep into my repertoire and offered a few tales I had learned while in Mali that I’ve never told publicly. Geraldo seemed as delighted with my tales as I was enchanted by his. He and I went back and forth a few times trading tales between conversations as topics changed. It was an extremely enriching experience.</p>
<p>I noticed that, while we were all enjoying our free-flowing conversation, Teresa was busy cutting, chopping and cooking in the background. I was noticing a universal theme being played out here as I watched her glide across  the floor between the sink and the oven and then the oven to the cupboards. The person who usually does all of the work, the cooking, no matter where I’ve traveled in the world, always seems to fade into the background of  whatever is going on around them. I felt the need to bring Teresa into the fold. I interrupted our conversation and asked Teresa if I could take a few pictures of her cooking and the food as it was being prepared. I’ve done this before when in Africa and Teresa was just as pleased and receptive as any of my hosts have been there. She smiled and posed near the oven as I explained to everyone that her role as preparer of our meal was an ancient sacred gesture that sometimes gets taken for granted. I didn’t want to take Teresa or her cooking for granted. There’s a proverb out of Mali that says, “the kitchen was born before the mosque.” I wanted to honor Teresa and, hopefully, I did.</p>
<p>Another two guests arrived as we were sitting in the kitchen talking, Henry and Kazuyo. I would find out later that Kazuyo has been teaching for over 40 years. 40 years of teaching! I was honored to be in her presence.</p>
<p>Teresa served the most amazing meal. The talking and storytelling continued even while we ate. We were definitely a menagerie of conversationalists.</p>
<p>It was getting late and my tour manager, in the most gentle tone ever, requested that I play a little Kora for everyone before we had to leave.</p>
<p>We all adjourned to the living room. Doesn’t that sound kind of 1940’ish, “we adjourned to the living room?” But that is exactly how it felt and what we did.</p>
<p>I was going to do my best to pay for Teresa’s beautifully prepared meal and her husband’s overwhelming hospitality with my music.</p>
<p>As it was getting late, Jana reminded me that we did not have much time before we needed to be leaving. I was able to play two songs for the group, sing a little and share a few proverbs before I resigned myself to my schedule. As I was putting the Kora away, the doorbell rang. It was Rinata, stunningly gorgeous Rinata, Henry’s girlfriend. She entered the room and gave hugs and kisses to everyone before taking a seat. I believe Jana was busy calling us a cab when I noticed Geraldo was trying to get my attention.</p>
<p>Patrick translated for me. Geraldo wanted one more song before I left, he was almost demanding it.</p>
<p>I smiled because I knew what he was doing. I couldn’t resist and told the crowd that I was going to read Geraldo’s mind and tell everyone what he was thinking. A gamble on my part? Yes, but it was fun.</p>
<p>I explained that Geraldo had the largest heart of anyone in the room and that he was not interested in the least in hearing another song. I exposed Geraldo for the romantic he truly was by telling everyone that he was requesting the song, not for himself, but for the beautiful Rinata.</p>
<p>A nice laugh and big smile burst though Geraldo’s lips as he nodded in affirmation.</p>
<p>I played one more song and, as I was playing, a torrent was released from the sky beating down on Teresa and Patrick’s home loudly. It was such an intimate setting. I let Rinata know that I would sing a song to her, for her, but it was a gift from Geraldo.</p>
<p>The room felt energetic in a way that is difficult to describe. It wasn’t intense. It wasn’t a tumultuous type of energy. It was calm and peaceful yet very powerful.</p>
<p>When I ended the song I could hear everyone exhaling. It was a thing of beauty to witness.</p>
<p>I explained to Rinata that she was now obligated to give her hero, Geraldo, a kiss on the check to thank him for thinking of her.</p>
<p>Jana and I were about to step out into the rain to catch a cab down the street when Kazuyo stepped in. She offered to return us to our hotel and refused to have it any other way. She wanted to be the one to take us back to our hotel.</p>
<p>We departed everyone with hugs and kisses. While in Kazuyo’s car she let me know, in all sincerity, that she was trying to figure out a way to compensate me for the song and music that touched her heart. She told me that driving us was a small bit of compensation for what she had received.</p>
<p>My heart was touched once again here in São Paulo, and, as I sit in my room preparing for tomorrow’s performances I can’t help but to feel that something magical happened to me this evening.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/samba.jpg" rel="lightbox[2051]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2052" title="samba" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/samba.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="225" /></a>Well when I left off on my last post I sort of said that I was going to take dance lessons at a Samba School here in São Paulo. That didn’t quite end up being the case. We went but the school wasn’t a school it was actually a club. A Samba Dance Club.</p>
<p>Permit me to set the scene for you. My tour manager, Jana, and I were heading to, what I believed to be, a Samba Dance School. I was very excited until our taxi turned down a very questionable street. You know the type of street that you might peer down into from the main boulevard but never enter? One of those streets that seems to tell its own tale of “nothing good ever happens here, go the other way.” So instead of going the other way, we turned down the street to find the “Samba School.”</p>
<p>I believe I lost my illusion that I was entering a school when the door man demanded to pat me down and search my belongings. Hmmm… I said to myself, this is not like any school that I’ve ever attended. It was easy to see that the disheveled building was a gathering place of some sort.</p>
<p>As I entered I had this really nostalgic feeling that I was entering some place familiar. I was. This place was the Brazilian equivalent of a “Juke Joint!” Alright I know I’m telling on myself, and my history, a little bit but I don’t have any other way to set the scene for you. Kind of dark, a little musty, and the smell of fried food and alcohol permeating the air. There was a solo musician on stage seated playing his guitar and singing to an almost empty house. We were early and had our pick of tables.</p>
<p>It seems there’s a rhythm to how these clubs function and they are as ubiquitous as churches. Most of the clubs open for lunch around noon or so. People from the community gather to eat and meet. Around 4 pm, the band takes the stage and then… Samba!</p>
<p>As we were ordering food and water (I don’t drink and this seems to really freak everyone out when I travel so I try not to mention it), people were coming in and claiming tables. Apparently people send others in advance as a form of reconnaissance table procuring because the clubs get really crowded. Watching the door was so entertaining that I could have come to the club just for that. I watched as a woman walked in with her infant child swaddled. A few elderly women, who must have, at least, been in their 70’s entered dressed to kill and already had their hips swaying to the playing rhythms. At one point an entire family of about 12 people walked in together. There were children, teens, elders, and everything in between. There was something familiar about the scene as I watched people who looked like my own family members take their places in different sections of the club.</p>
<p>Our host arrived with a friend and we ate, talked and laughed a bit. I was really enjoying the mellow mood and then the clock struck 4 pm. The band ascended the stage and, within seconds, the music was pumped up a notch in energy and volume. It was Samba time!</p>
<p>There was a dance floor but it seemed that people just danced everywhere, between tables, near the steps, back against the walls, everywhere. The mood was infectious.</p>
<p>I’ve never been one to hold up the walls so I hit the floor as soon as everybody else. Did I know how to dance Samba? Well… no, but why should that stop me. While on the floor I was being taught a few simple moves. There were arms swinging and legs flailing everywhere but no one was in danger of being hurt. There was a grace in the chaos of movement that made it safe to experiment with my new Samba moves. I don’t even know how I did, I really didn’t care. I just enjoyed the mood of the place. I kept my mouth closed and didn’t talk to too many people. It seemed, and this was told to me by a Brazilian, that I fit right into the demographic as long as I wasn’t saying anything. I was warned that, if the women knew I was a foreigner, I would be swarmed. Now that might be nice for you younger single guys but I’m chill, I like to take it slow and easy. That’s what happens you cross the mid-40 bridge.</p>
<p>I danced and danced some more before my legs started cursing at me, and loudly too. Samba is muscle intensive and if you are not in shape be very careful about how far you take yourself with the dance.</p>
<p>The place began to get hot and the smell of alcohol far outweighed the grease burning meat in the back. It was time for me to go.<br />
I have an intuitive sense of when to make my exits (It’s a southern Juke Joint thing, some of ya’ll will understand and some won’t).</p>
<p>We made our way back to the hotel. I entered my room and collapsed on my bed.</p>
<p>If you were wondering why the blog was a little late getting out, well now you know.</p>
<p>Blame it on the Samba!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Americana-School.jpg" rel="lightbox[2042]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2043" title="Americana-School" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Americana-School.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="197" /></a>I probably didn’t mention it in previous posts but I received an email from the school I visited on October 11th, Lorenço Castanho. They were asking if I could fit, at least, one more visit into my schedule before leaving Brazil. Friday was a scheduled day off, a morning of snoozing, extended dreaming and breathing heavily into my pillow. Who needs that, right? I would much rather spend time with an entire school of people who openly and unashamedly tell me they love me and my work. Can you blame me?</p>
<p>Clara, my contact, was asking if I’d return to meet with their 7th grade classes. The 7th graders, much like the 7th graders in California, have West Africa as part of their curriculum and, in particular, griots.</p>
<p>I returned to the Lorenço Castanho love fest once again and was not disappointed. The 7th graders were equally as warm and endearing as their 9th grade counterparts. I loved their questions about music’s affect on the mind and body. Who would have expected 7th graders to ask such questions? Their laughter left me feeling accomplished and their focus on my words was so affirming.</p>
<p>After I completed the performance I made sure to spend enough time taking pictures with the students, laughing and talking. I think I disrupted the class schedule again but no one seemed to mind. There is something really special happening in that school and the entire staff and student body seem quite aware of it. I wish it was something I could manufacture and distribute.</p>
<p>I had to leave the school a bit earlier than the previous day, at the conclusion of my performance, because my tour manager and one of the teachers at the school had arranged a private tour for me of the Afro-Brazilian Museum.</p>
<p>Yes, a private tour! Me! VIP treatment? Wow!</p>
<p>Once at the museum my tour manager and I were greeted by our host, Renato. This young man was an exceptional docent as he escorted us through the museum. His knowledge of history, art, and religion was impressive. He freely shared legends, tales and history related to Afro-Brazilian culture. As an added benefit my tour manager, Jana, was equally knowledgeable about the art and artifacts in the museum. I could not have dreamed of a better scenario for myself, two Brazilians in love with their history and culture focused on my learning about it. Each of them was so gentle and patient in sharing their impressions throughout the exhibit that I forgot to turn on my audio recorder. I was so immersed in the tales and history that I walked around in an anticipatory haze waiting for the next tale or tidbit of information.</p>
<p>As Renato was explaining a section of the exhibit to me, we were interrupted by a young teenage boy. He approached me, timidly, and said, “Excuse me sir do you mind if I ask who you are?”</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what had attracted his attention. Maybe it was the two piece kaftan I was wearing or the fact that I had a private guided tour. I wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>The young man wanted to know who I was and where I was from. He was with a school touring the museum and, apparently, I had, somehow, attracted their attention. Before I knew it the entire group were standing around me while a few of them asked questions. It was a surreal moment, if you can imagine. I told them that I was a storyteller and musician and that I was visiting schools here in São Paulo. I sang a little for them (you know I had to right?). I spoke a little about history and culture. They were listening! They were actually listening and taking it “all” in! What an absolutely amazing feeling. I was standing before a group of about 20 to 30 teenagers who were hanging on my every word and I was loving every second of it. The best part? A beautiful young girl with the most alluring Portuguese-English accent looked me in my eyes and said, “I love you.” Out of no where she just spoke here heart. I’m not sure I’m going to be able to leave Brazil.</p>
<p>The group was from a school in a city outside of São Paulo called “Americana (really interesting history about this city and its settlement by confederate fleeing the end of the U.S. Civil War… look it up when you get a chance).” The students were asking me if I would please come visit their school. They wanted more stories and singing. They wanted to hear the instrument I showed them a picture of, my Kora.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’m doing the situation justice here, it felt like a Salvador Dali painting brought to life.</p>
<p>It was difficult to pull away from these teens and continue the tour. The student’s chaperones and I exchanged information. I let the two women know that I wasn’t sure if, or when, I might return to Brazil but, if I did, they would definitely be contacted about my performing at their school.</p>
<p>What an amazing experience! An impromptu storytelling session, a little singing, some kisses to the cheek and then possession of a memory that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Renato completed our tour of the museum by offering even more enthusiastic revelations and tales. The tour of the museum was very special for me. I’ve never had a private tour of any institution such as this before. It really made me feel appreciative of all the people who have gone out of their way for me since my arrival here in Brazil.</p>
<p>I had to end our time with Renato so that we could get back to the hotel to rest up a bit. Why you may ask?</p>
<p>Well, if you must know, I have a Samba lesson in the morning and I need to be ready. I’m not in my 20’s anymore and these old-bones don’t quite follow orders as quickly as they used to.</p>
<p>Come back tomorrow, maybe I’ll be able to tell you a little something about my Samba adventure (or maybe misadventure depending on if I can get my legs to obey me).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Panoramic-vew-of-Iran.jpg" rel="lightbox[2039]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2040" title="Panoramic-vew-of-Iran" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Panoramic-vew-of-Iran.jpg" alt="" width="466" height="310" /></a>Last year I received an invitation to attend a festival of storytelling in the country of Iran for 2012. I haven’t spoken much about it since almost everyone I encounter seems to think it would be a horrible idea for me to go.</p>
<p>At odds are two trains of thought. On one hand I know that the average person, in any country, is much like the average person in any other country. We all dream, desire and love in similar fashion. If my travels haven’t taught me anything else, they have taught me this. Citizens of most countries are preoccupied with trying to put food not the table, create a better life for their children, and balance the various responsibilities of friends, family and community. On the other hand, there are the political realities of the world that we’re forced to digest even if we would rather not.</p>
<p>Recent events have motivated me to write to my readership and, hopefully, get some feedback from you.</p>
<p>I had made up my mind that I was going to the International Storytelling Festival in Iran next year, 2012, and then, while here in Brazil I was watching the news and heard that a terrorist plot backed by the Iranian Government had been intercepted in the U.S.</p>
<p>Attorney General Holder announced that authorities had foiled a plot by men linked to the Iranian government to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States and bomb Saudi Arabia’s embassy in Washington. This announcement was followed up by a stout condemnation by Vice President Biden.</p>
<p>I sat in my hotel room thinking about the areas of the world that I’ve traveled. Many places I’ve been aren’t exactly tourist destinations and, part of my purpose for traveling is to offer my friends, family and community back home an alternative perspective on the world. A perspective not filtered through the lens of popular media. I had made up my mind to go to Iran next year because I know the people who’ve invited me and they are genuinely kind-hearted and gentle souls. They have hosted this festival for years now and people from all over the world have attended.</p>
<p>As I sat in my room staring up at the ceiling ceiling thinking about the political repercussions of my travel, the issues of instability due to recent events, the opinions of family and friends, I found myself at a cross roads, unable to gain any moment in thought.</p>
<p>Do you have an opinion?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/construction-01.jpg" rel="lightbox[2001]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2004" title="construction-01" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/construction-01.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="208" /></a>I often struggle with how much information about one’s personal life should be shared with others. What is the limit on information we should give people about ourselves? How much of what we might divulge about ourselves could be deemed inappropriate?</p>
<p>Over the years, more like decades, I’ve noticed a trend towards people promulgating their personal affairs to the world (i.e. blogging, tweeting, texting, face booking, etc.). what I’m noticing is that the majority of us, without exception, tend to divulge only personal information which we’ve thoroughly screened first; you know, edited out the no-too-flattering details that make us appear less than perfect.</p>
<p>I seemed to have been born in the era of, “Me, me, me… look at me!”</p>
<p>Before you say it, I know, yes… me, a storyteller and performance artist, talking about seeking attention. How ironic right?</p>
<p>Let’s just ignore that little fact for the moment if you don’t mind (Big Smile).</p>
<p>Here’s an idea I’m tossing around in my mind. What if we “all” were to not filter any information that we choose to tell others about ourselves? What if we simply had an all or nothing policy when it came to talking about ourselves with others?</p>
<p>Personally I think there would be a lot less talking in the world and a whole lot more listening.</p>
<p>Let me throw caution to the wind and just give you an example of what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>A few days ago I arrived in São Paulo Brazil. It was a little late in the evening, I hadn’t eaten much, I was tired… you know the situation right?</p>
<p>Confession: My patience grows thin and I tend to get a bit snarky when I’m tired or hungry. I think this is a hold over from childhood that hasn&#8217;t quite released its grasp on me yet.</p>
<p>It is a flaw in my characters that I am aware of and working on. As I am always saying, “I am under construction.”</p>
<p>Well we arrived at our hotel and, because I was tired and a little hungry, I began looking around for things to complain about.</p>
<p>Wow, this truth telling thing isn’t easy!</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m searching the lobby, the staff, everything, everywhere for something to complain about. The first thing I am able to grab ahold of is that the entire staff look like teenagers. I have raised teenagers and I would choose not to be placed in their care if at all possible. I love them yes, but I’m not quite sure I want to trust them with my well-being. Finally I had something to grasp and fume about (slim but available none the less).</p>
<p>Weren’t there any older people still working in the hospitality industry? Had they all been laid off and replaced by low wage workers? I wasn’t liking this hotel already!</p>
<p>Ah a second thing to raise my level of irritation! They were all wearing yellow sweat shirts. Yellow sweat shirts! What kind of a hotel uniforms its staff in yellow sweat shirts?</p>
<p>Alright bear with me here, I’m not looking too good in this scenario. In fact I’m appearing downright ugly but I’m going to continue because the truth needs to be told.</p>
<p>I must have found, at least, 10 things to complain about before being given the key to my room.</p>
<p>Yes I’m flawed and I am aware of it. I am, after all, under construction.</p>
<p>My mind kicked into overdrive with things to bemoan or complain about. I reached an all-time low when I began to have an attitude with the elevator buttons. Stupid elevator buttons! I don’t like this hotels elevator buttons!</p>
<p>When I exited the elevator, turned down the hall and entered my room I discovered it to be a veritable treasure trove of issues for me to complain about. I had hit the jackpot. I was about to become the mayor of “Complaintville (a small town just south of the City of Impatience).</p>
<p>My mind raced with a list of inadequacies about the room. I needed something. I didn’t know quite what, but I needed something. And then it hit me. I needed an issue worth calling the front desk to complain about. I searched the room and found it. There was no remote-control for the television. Someone had stolen it obviously.</p>
<p>I picked up the phone, attached to the wall next to my bed. Well they had done one thing right, the phone was easily accessible. I punched in “0” to get the front desk. Nothing. No sound, no dial tone… nothing! Ah ha another thing to complain about! I was on a roll.</p>
<p>I kept trying to punch in other numbers, hitting other buttons to see if I could get the phone working. Someone was going to hear my complaints this night and they were going to listen and listen well.</p>
<p>I started to place the phone back in it’s receiver, preparing myself to just take the elevator back down to the lobby in order to register my mountain of complaints. As I was putting the phone back onto the receiver I noticed it was one of those “powered” phones, you know the old type of in-house phones that are more like walkie-talkies than actual telephones?</p>
<p>Incredible! I couldn’t believe it!</p>
<p>I pushed the power button on the phone and, you’re not going to believe this.</p>
<p>The television came on.</p>
<p>I held the phone away from my ear and examined it a little closer.</p>
<p>Low and behold it wasn’t a phone, it was the remote control for the television.</p>
<p>I had been trying to dial a remote control. This never would have happened in the rotary phone era. Back then, a phone was a phone, a huge clunky thing that could be used for smashing walnuts.</p>
<p>Even though I was tired, a bit hungry, my self-imposed state of irritation began to dissipate as I laughed aloud.</p>
<p>Sitting in my hotel room, on the bed holding the television’s remote control in my hand I couldn’t help but to laugh and smile while noticing the source of all of my angst. What was the source of all of my irritations? Me!</p>
<p>As I was sitting there on the bed thinking, I realized that none of the issues I had “chosen” as irritants (yellow t-shirts, age of staff, elevator buttons, inoperative telephone, etc.) possessed any real merit. There was nothing worthy of the negativity “I” had immersed myself in.</p>
<p>The irritation, angst, impatience and negativity were all self imposed, creations of my own thought processes that were only discomforting me physically and no one else around me. In fact, I can honestly say that no one else was even aware of my state. I hadn’t had the opportunity to infect others yet with my, potentially, nonsensical behavior. I was the designer of the scheme placing myself in dis-ease with my surroundings and those around me.</p>
<p>There is an old African proverb I say to myself in times like these, “An angry heart devours its owner.”</p>
<p>In no other instance was this more true than now.</p>
<p>I could have kept this little tale to myself, after all, there was no one in the room but me when I sat there fuming and looking irritatingly at the inoperable phone.</p>
<p>My job though, as a teller of tales, a traveler and seeker, isn’t to become the best self-promoting publicist in the industry. My job is to grow as a human being and, being as flawed as most of us are, to share invaluable lessons that help, hopefully, make each one of us better people.</p>
<p>I know that some of my true-to-life tales don’t cast me in the most complimentary light but who am I to hide the truth of myself from others? Maybe it will make me a better teacher, storyteller, if I can continue to learn from my own foibles. Maybe it will make me a better teacher, storyteller, if others can learn from my errors.</p>
<p>Don’t forget, I’m under construction.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Lorenco-Castanho-paintings.jpg" rel="lightbox[1997]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1998" title="Lorenco-Castanho-paintings" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Lorenco-Castanho-paintings.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="624" /></a>When I woke this morning, had I know that I would hear hundreds of teenage voices telling me that they love me and drowning me with hugs, I would have gotten up earlier and arrived at the school I was set to perform at before they opened.</p>
<p>Today I visited, here in São Paulo, Lorenço Castanho. I performed for students between 12 to 15 years of age, two assemblies.  It was fortuitous that the school’s focus was on the continent of Africa prior to my arrival. They were specifically focusing on West Africa (my specialty!).</p>
<p>It’s so true that the general tone of a school is set by the administration and staff, moreso the leadership of the school. Our liaison at the school was Clara. It would be insufficient to say that Clara loves, not only her work, but the children she oversees for the entire school. It was Clara who found value in my work and enthusiastically opened to doors of her school for me to perform there.</p>
<p>Clara set the tone for my day as well. When we entered the school and she met us, there was no hiding her joy and enthusiasm. As an artist you live for contact with these types of people. They are not only affirming, but also help you to realize that there are others in the world whose values align with yours.</p>
<p>Clara hugged us, introduced us to every staff member on campus, and escorted us to the performance area. Just the walk from the front entrance and through the campus to the performance area left me with the feeling that Lorenço Castanho was more than simply “a school.” There was not one person working there who did not smile at me when I met them. I’ve also become accustomed to the hug and nice little kiss to the cheek thing that women do in Brazil. I’m thinking about importing that to the U.S. Can you imagine all of the women you meet kissing you as you are introduced? There’s something magical in that.</p>
<p>Before performing I must have taken pictures with more than 12 people. As I was setting up, Clara continued to escort a stream of people into the room to introduce them to me. I’m smiling as I write this. People who understand that there is depth to my work and are capable of critiquing its nuances capture my loyalty and friendship instantly. I don’t talk about it often but the work I do is not easy at all. Maintaining language fluency in 4 languages and working on a 5th, keeping musicianship sharp, researching, creating… etc. Although I love what I do, I will tell you that there is nothing simple about it. I just make it look easy because I’m so darn good. (Big Smile)</p>
<p>A huge part of my performing is ad-libbing. Improvisation is a tool I employ in every performance. In fact, my improvising tends to give me inspiration for future performances. The students at Lorenço Castanho gave me so many opportunities to turn left instead of right. There was a young man who kept touching, rather affectionately, the young woman sitting next to him. I couldn’t resist. I am a dad after all and I would want another dad to intervene on my behalf if the same situation arose with one of my daughters. It was innocent enough, nothing over the top, but I enjoyed singling “Rafael” out. He was definitely a good sport about it and didn’t touch that young woman again during my entire performance. Thanks Rafael! The dad in me appreciates you.</p>
<p>There was one young girl in the second performance at the school that just captured my heart. Every time I would walk near where she was sitting she would burst into uncontrollable giggles. I loved it! During one of the stories I told her that I loved her and that I thought she was beautiful (it’s all a part of the story, you’d have to hear the entire tale to fully understand). She burst into those little, cute giggles again. I couldn’t resist it, I kept walking over to where she was sitting just to make her giggle and cover her face some more.</p>
<p>When the second performance finished, the teachers allowed the students to take pictures with me. We took hundreds of pictures together. It seemed like every student there had a cell phone. While we were taking pictures, we were exchanging pleasantries and they were trying to teach me some Brazilian Portuguese, the cool stuff. For some reason they kept wanting me to say, “I am cute!” I verified with the adults around me that people actually say this about themselves in Portuguese and, yes, it is true, especially the youth. I felt a little strange, being a man in the upper register of his 40’s, walking around saying, “Yes, I’m cute… Hello, I’m cute… Pleased to meet you I am cute.” I cut that part of the my language learning short.</p>
<p>Another very memorable moment was when one of the teen boys approached me and invited me to lunch at his home when school was over. I laughed and asked him who would be preparing the lunch, him or me? “My mother of course,” he responded. I had to laugh again and ask him if he thought that his mother would appreciate him walking through the door with a stranger and asking her to prepare us lunch? “My mother would love you, I want you to meet her, she would love you!” He assured me that he lived really close to the school and we could walk there at lunch time. I’m still smiling as I write this. Needless to say, I wasn’t about to make a surprise visit on his mom in search of a meal. I thanked him and let him know that the gesture was most appreciated.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Clara had approached me with an idea that the art teacher had. They had a wonderful, very creative idea to bring in 3 blank canvases to the room I was performing in. The students were going to community pain these canvases and the art instructor thought it would be a great idea to have me administer the very first brush strokes on each canvas. What an honor! I love painting and put my own little spin on it for the students. Before choosing the colors and brushes, I asked the students to choose one of three words that I was going to give them (Love, Honor, Friendship). The majority chose the word “Friendship.” I proceeded to choose the brushes and colors combinations and then, with a flourish, offered my own abstract canvas interpretation of the word friendship. Talk about fun!</p>
<p>Clara and the rest of the staff would not allow me to depart the school without lunch. They fed me too! Can you believe it? All of that love heaped on me and they fed me as well.</p>
<p>As I was leaving the school, there were more students stopping me to take pictures with them, staff offering final hugs and students shouting that they loved me.</p>
<p>It was another complete day filled with enchantment and meaning.</p>

Initially, It seemed like it was going to be a scorching hot day. The sun was beaming and hot. The wind was almost nonexistent, and then, all of a sudden, clouds came together and rain began pouring down from the sky.</p>
<p>Brasilia, for being a city famous for its heat and dryness, has been extremely wet the past 4 days.  I’ve experienced nothing but downpours and misty mornings. The locals are all telling me this is a miracle, what they’ve been hoping for since the drought began more than 6 months ago.</p>
<p>As I was leaving my hotel this afternoon, riding in the back of the taxi, I indulged in a day-dream. When I was a young student, bored to death sitting in class, I used to day dream often, at very inappropriate times (like when the teacher is trying to teach). My fantasy: “I had come to Brasilia and bought the rain with me. I had become, for Brasilia and it’s people, an omen of good! You’re welcome people of Brasilia! I ask for nothing in return but your blessings on all of my future travels! May the water continue to fall long after I’ve departed!”</p>
<p>What is fantasizing worth if you can’t be a deity in your own day dream, right? Hmmm… there’s a story there somewhere. Hero, story as a metaphor for life, creating your own legend, water deity, etc. You see, all those years of tuning out in class weren’t all bad.</p>
<p>At this moment I’m sitting in the airport typing out this blog.</p>
<p>I enjoyed Brasilia and, I hope, the people I met enjoyed me.  I wish I had more time on these tours to immerse myself in the local cultures and customs like when I’m in West Africa. Maybe another time.</p>
<p>I’m getting ready to board my plane and head to São Paulo. I’ll spend a few weeks there before heading back to Los Angeles for a few days. After only 3 days in Los Angeles, I’ll board a plane for Mexico.</p>
<p>I’m sitting across from a huge window with a view of the tarmac and mountains behind it. I keep looking up from my computer keyboard and getting lost in the landscape. The rain is falling hard. Although the gate area is full of people, it is quiet. Tiny murmurs here and there, the smell of coffee everywhere and the sound of the rain beating down on the roof.</p>
<p>Today Brasilia, tomorrow São Paulo.</p>
<p>I am so blessed to be doing this work.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/?attachment_id=1974" rel="attachment wp-att-68869"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-68869" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Brasilia.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="268" /></a>The city that I’m in currently is Brasilia. Brasilia is the political capital of Brazil. It is where the president works and resides. Brasilia is where the different branches of government have their own office buildings and there is a long main thoroughfare where you can walk or ride a gauntlet of these buildings.</p>
<p>In speaking wit Brasilienses (people from the city of Brasilia) I’m consistently being told how dry and hot the climate of their city typically is. One woman was telling me that the heat can become so oppressive here the many people become ill during the dry season. I was speaking with a teacher yesterday who told me that they are just coming out of a drought that has lasted more than 6 months.</p>
<p>Apparently the drought ended and the rain began to fall heavily on the day I came to Brasilia. It has rained each day that I’ve been here in Brasilia and the locals are telling me that this is highly unusual. Read into that whatever you would like (BIG SMILE). I was joking with some teachers at the end of the day, sharing some of my “traveler’s perspectives.” I let them know that, without their information, if anyone asked me about Brasilia I would have told them that it is a lush green land where it rains everyday. They got a good laugh out of that.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning I had one of those magical moments that remind me why I chose this path. At around 6:45 am I was in the theater of the school when a young man walked in. He approached me timidly and spoke Portuguese. I understood a little of what he was saying as he handed me a small envelope. He told me to open the it and so I did. Inside was a small note folded in quadrants and a beautiful blue and white polished stone. The young man’s name was Johan and he had worked extremely hard to translate his note for me into English. Here is what the note read, verbatim:</p>
<p>____________________</p>
<p><em>Baba,</em></p>
<p><em>This present (or rock, if you prefer) represents</em></p>
<p><em>the sky of Brasilia. The stone is from my</em></p>
<p><em>personal collection, and I just give one of them for</em></p>
<p><em>special people. You are one of them. I am from</em></p>
<p><em>the 8th year, 7th grade, and this presentation is just</em></p>
<p><em>for the 9th, but I am your great fan. Big successes and </em></p>
<p><em>a life with a lot of lights,</em></p>
<p><em>a big hug from your fan,</em></p>
<p><em>Johan</em></p>
<p>____________________</p>
<p>After reading the note I looked into the eyes of this young man and felt such a high degree of sincerity and humility in him that it left me feeling I was in the presence of someone whose maturity could not be measured in years.</p>
<p>Around my neck I sometimes carry a pouch filled with cowry shells that I bring back with me whenever I return from West Africa. These shells have become a signature of mine and I disperse them sparingly to people who touch my heart. I hugged him and asked if he spoke Spanish. Fortunately he did. We were able to communicate clearly then. I let him know that his gesture touched my heart. He hugged me. I told him that I felt sorry that he could not attend the presentation. He hugged me again. I had him wait there while I attempted to find some way of allowing this young man to stay and attend the performance. The administration explained they could not allow it because many in his grade level wanted to be there and, if they found out that he participated, it would create problems. The other students would demand to know why they weren’t able to attend. Both Johan and I understood this.</p>
<p>Before he left the room, I reached into my pouch and handed him 4 uncut cowry shells. I have my own reasons for distributing these shells (cut and uncut, in numbers of 1, 3, 4, or 7). He hugged me again.</p>
<p>As Johan was leaving he pleaded with me to return next year when he would be in the grade level that was permitted to attend my presentation. I could not promise him that but said that I would do what I could.</p>
<p>It was a very touching moment watching him leave the small, dark theater.</p>
<p>The students who entered ranged in age from 15 to 17 years. They were a large, very well mannered group. The program coordinator for the school explained that many were reluctant to come for fear of their inability to comprehend English.</p>
<p>I work with English language learning so often in the U.S. that I’ve developed my own little storytelling techniques to aid in comprehension. I also have my own assessments to know how I’m doing. Let me give you a few examples. A head nodding in affirmation is a universal sign of understanding and, if you see this occurring in your audience, whose language is not primarily English, then you know you are reaching some of them. Using humor to make people laugh is probably one of the single most valuable tools of assessment in my arsenal. If I can get the majority of the audience to laugh at something I say that requires them to infer the entire meaning, then I know I am, at least, dealing with an intermediate level of language fluency. I have a ton of these “on-the-fly” assessments that I use while performing.</p>
<p>Ooops… was that a tangent? Ok, I seriously hope I didn’t start boring you with all that “Art of Storytelling” stuff.</p>
<p>In yesterday’s blog I wondered, “what school has children assembled at 7:30 am for the start of a performance.” Well I found out.</p>
<p>This school is called CECAN/CLIC and the performance was optional for this grade level. The fact that it was at 7:30 am and optional gave me a little pause, which I should not have had. The room was crowded and the teens valued my artistry enough to be there on time with warm, welcoming, enthusiastic smiles aplenty.</p>
<p>The performance went extremely well and I found myself boxed in the middle of a huge throng of teens immediately afterwards on the stage. I had been warned by my tour manager that we had another performance across town and that I needed to pack up so that we wouldn’t be late. The crowd, and the love they were sharing, made this a little difficult for me. I don’t know about you, but, for me, when you are surround by 30 or 40 people and they all are showering you with praises and hugs… well… it is a bit difficult to walk away from that. Hey, come on, I’m human and that level of positive reinforcement feeds me in so many ways.</p>
<p>It went sort of like this, “Baba we love you, Baba that was a great performance, Baba can I have a hug, Baba you’re the greatest, Baba may I take a picture with you, Baba will you sign your autograph for me, Baba…”</p>
<p>So you see what I mean? Who would walk away from that?</p>
<p>I did. I had to. It hurt tremendously, but I didn’t want the next school I had to visit to have a bad first impression of me.</p>
<p>My tour manager and I raced across town in a cab to a school called, Thomas Jefferson. It is a language institute that serves many of the schools and colleges here in Brasilia. I had two performances in intimate settings with much smaller groups. Many of them had only been studying English for 1 year. My assessments worked just as well with them as with the older students I had performed for that morning. Younger children either are focused and enthusiastic or not. To capture their enthusiasm and get them to focus requires an entirely different set of performance tools, especially when dealing with lower levels of language fluency. I was ecstatic that the groups were kept to between 10-15 in attendance, with parents present. It is so much easier to illicit language comprehension when you can spend a good amount of time looking directly into the eyes of each of your each audience members. With 10 to 15 people this is easily accomplished. I could see that some of the children were having problems during my introduction so I used some of the techniques that I’ve learned from griot cultures in Africa (guided repetition, slow rhythmic speaking, elongating words, extended eye contact with those struggling to comprehend, etc.)</p>
<p>There I go again. Technique, pedagogy, process, methodology … blah, blah blah. Honestly I can’t help myself sometimes, I just can’t help myself.</p>
<p>Anyway those performances went equally well and I was able to return to my hotel room and relax. I love sitting in silence. I know that sounds boring but, after performing all day, one of my favorite things to do is just return to a space where I can sit in silence.</p>

I was pleasantly surprised when this did not end up being the case.</p>
<p>The school I visited is called The International school. They had a really creative way of preparing for my presentation. They sold tickets. I love that concept because the children who are present are there because they desire to be and not because it is a forced-to-attend assembly.</p>
<p>My first performance was at another campus for kinder and 1st graders. Initially I allowed a little fear to creep into my psyche when I saw the teachers marching the children into an open area performance space and their line seemed never ending. More than a hundred kindlers and 1st graders. Someone up in heaven either really believes I’m the “go-to” guy for these performances or I’m being tested. I breathed in deeply, reminding myself that I am a professional and that I’ve done this so many times over the years that it should be easy. Has your mind ever debated itself offering rebuttals between positivity and negativity? Well mine does but it is a character flaw that I am working hard to eliminate.</p>
<p>Positivity won out this time and I approached the task at hand, performing for more than a hundred or so kinder and 1st graders, with grace and honor. After all, if I was going to go down it wasn’t going to be without a fight. My pride wouldn’t allow me to court the idea of defeat and so I ascended the performance area with the idea that all things are as they should be and I am where I am needed in this moment.</p>
<p>I must say that, by the close of the performance, I was very proud of myself. You should be proud of me to. I took an almost impossible task, performing for a large group of 5 and 6 years olds, and made it look easy. Well… maybe not exactly easy but I did it nonetheless and did it successfully.</p>
<p>The director of the school was kind enough to take me on a tour of the campus. What an amazing campus! It is a compound style campus geared towards progressive programing, learning and teaching techniques. To say I was impressed would be an understatement. Oh… and lest I forget. The school shares it’s campus with several monkeys who inhabit the surrounding trees and visit every once in awhile to be fed by the children. Can you imagine? I actually got a few pictures of one of them hanging out on a tree near the play area. I was so enjoying this campus tour. Monkeys!</p>
<p>I know that I am more fortunate than most when it comes to a perspective on education across the world. I actually spend my time visiting schools in different countries. I can say with certainty that the developmental needs of each and every child on this campus are not only be met but, in many areas, exceeded. The staff are all warm and friendly. They speak of plans for the future with such enthusiasm that it makes me want to see how I can be a part of their progress.</p>
<p>We left the campus of 5 and 6 year olds and were driven to an adjacent campus about a mile or so away.</p>
<p>I was initially schedule to do one more performance on this campus and leave but I guess they sold so many tickets that two more performances were required.</p>
<p>I loved hearing that. They sold so many tickets that two more performances were required. I could keep saying that over and over again. when others find value in your work it is not only affirming but rewarding in so many unspeakable ways. Today I felt affirmed.</p>
<p>I completed the performances and spent some time with a few of the children talking.</p>
<p>The librarian of the school, the one responsible for me being there, actually came in on her vacation to make sure I was comfortable and everything ran smoothly. She came in on her vacation! Did you hear me say she came in on her vacation?</p>
<p>I left the International School here in Brasilia feeling honored by having shared time with some very motivational people. If there is ever an opportunity to return to this school in Brasilia I know I will, even if only to witness the progress I know they will have made since my last visit.</p>
<p>I’ve got a 7:30 am performance tomorrow morning. Yes I did, indeed, say 7:30 am. What school has children assembled and ready for a performance at 7:30 in the morning?</p>
<p>Well my friends I guess I’m about to find out tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Até logo, chau chau..</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/?attachment_id=1964" rel="attachment wp-att-66604"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-66604" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Baba_Brasilia.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="533" /></a>Today I visited another school here in Rio called The German School. I am in awe at the amount of greenery enveloping these schools. There are fruit trees, creeping vines of all sorts, and flower beds everywhere. It almost feels like your in the middle of a rain forest. When we arrived at the school we were greeted by a group of screaming teenagers running towards us. I turned to look behind me wondering who, of teenage importance, was following us. When turned back around I realized they were running at me. Me? Teenagers? They were shouting Benvindos Baba, Baba legal (Welcome Baba, You’re so cool Baba!) The word &#8220;legal&#8221; in this context is actually a Brazilian Portuguese slang term pronounced &#8220;Leygahl.&#8221;  Talk about a boost to an old man’s ego, you couldn’t have wiped the smile from my face with a Brillo pad.</p>
<p>I performed for two different age groups in the school and loved every second of it. They made me feel so welcomed and they had to have been a couple of the easiest crowds I’ve performed for. They were primed and ready even before they walked in the door.</p>
<p>When we were trying to leave the school we were totally disrupting classes. One teacher lost control of his younger students who ran from their class and started following us, asking questions.</p>
<p>Not quite Beatle Mania but I’ll take it.</p>
<p>I had barely enough time to eat, check out of the hotel and get to the airport.</p>
<p>Our flight was delayed and we got into Brasilia later than expected. You know what’s wonderful about having a tour manager?</p>
<p>You don’t have to handle any of the, inevitable, unforeseen disruptions to itinerary. What a luxury!</p>
<p>I let my tour manager know that I appreciate each and every single thing she is doing to make me comfortable. I’m making sure that any issues that arise for her are not of my making.</p>
<p>Well… I’ve finally made it to my hotel room. It’s 12:30 am and I’m exhausted. I’ve to an early morning performance tomorrow but before I can go to bed I’ve got to:</p>
<p>1) Re-assemble my Kora and tune it.</p>
<p>2) Blog my daily experiences for those hardcore readers out there.</p>
<p>3) Return emails to people in the U.S.</p>
<p>4) Invoice clients</p>
<p>5) Review promotional material that has deadline attached.</p>
<p>6) Upload all media from the days camera and video shoots onto the portable hard drive.</p>
<p>Are you guys feeling sorry for me?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/?attachment_id=1959" rel="attachment wp-att-65476"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-65476" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-04-2011_blog.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a>I was performing at my first school of the tour here in Rio de Janeiro today for a group of about 6 eighth grade classes, yes dreaded middle schoolers, when about 2 minutes into my performance the power went out. No lights, no air, nothing! What would you do? How would you handle that?</p>
<p>If you know anything at all about developmental levels then you know that a large group of eighth graders are the last people on earth you want to be standing in front of on a stage in a blacked-out room. I could feel the tension in the air, not coming from the children but their teachers and administrators.</p>
<p>I used the environment to my advantage. I shifted mental gears, re-arranged my repertoire and altered prosity in an attempt to affect my audience’s attentiveness. Remember that when one of our senses becomes impaired, and I would consider their sight as having been impaired being thrust into sudden darkness, our other senses heighten. They had become, not by choice, listeners and my jobs was to aid them in becoming focused listeners. I paced around and across the stage more than I would normally do in order to redirect the angles my voice was coming to them. I, purposely, walked into blind areas of the stage where it was more difficult to see me while continuing to talk in order to challenge those among them who were more sight oriented. As a performer, artist, teacher, musician or whatever, you’ve got to use the environment to your advantage.</p>
<p>I can’t take all of the credit for the ease with which the performance went or total sense of harmony that was established in the pitch black room. I would like to say, “Me, yes I… myself am responsible for the amazing performance under less than desirable conditions,” but I must give credit where credit is due. Theses 8th grade classes exhibited such a high degree of maturity that every adult present was left in awe of them.</p>
<p>During the performance I made sure that they knew how stellar I thought their behavior was under the conditions.</p>
<p>By the time “my” 8th graders left, we were indeed a community. The reciprocity that I experienced left me feeling energized for the next group that I would have to perform for in the dark, 4th and 5th graders.</p>
<p>Let’s fast forward to my impromptu meeting with the 4th and 5th grader teachers at the side of the stage before the performance. You could not have imagined a more frightened group of people. They were frightened for me and the inevitable lack of discipline that they thought I was about to experience on a dark stage in front of their classes. I smiled. I smiled even more and then let them know, “I’ve got this handled. If anyone gets injured or there is a loss of blood involved, I’ll call on you guys.”’</p>
<p>They all seemed to exhale, albeit cautiously, for the moment and allowed me to ascend the stage (alone, sans armed guards).</p>
<p>I could go into more details about the performance and what occurred but suffice it to say that the 4th and 5th graders were as calm, cool and collected as their 8th grade counterparts.</p>
<p>I love it when people who work with a set group of children on a daily basis get an opportunity to witness them exceed everyone’s expectations. I live for that and I love it!</p>
<p>I possess an incalculable number of experiences where I’ve been approached by educators with concerned or worried looks on their faces because, not knowing me, they doubt their students abilities to conduct themselves in a mature manner. I “always” let them know, “I’ve got this.”</p>
<p>The last performance was for the 7th grade classes. Still no power, no lights, no air.</p>
<p>How did it go? Smooth as butter baby!</p>
<p>Yes… I said it that way. After 3 successful performances in a pitch black room with middle schoolers I’ve got every right to gloat.</p>
<p>I’m proud of the people I met today and myself as well. This was one of those challenges that helps you demonstrate, for yourself and others, what you’re truly made of.</p>
<p>My attitude after today? Bring on tomorrow… I’m ready for ya baby!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/?attachment_id=1954" rel="attachment wp-att-64928"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-64928" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10-03-2011_Seleron.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a>Since I’ve arrived in Brazil I’ve become enamored with the Rio de Janeiro.  I only have one more day here before I have to travel to other cities in Brazil and so I’ve wanted to make the most of my time. My tour manager has been “The-Most-Gracious-Host” by taking me around and introducing me to locations off-the-beaten path (which is the way I love to travel).</p>
<p>We hit the streets early yesterday morning going all over the city, visiting sites, checking out historical architecture, and taking-in breathtaking landscapes. Mid-day we made it to Corcovado and visited the famous landmark of Christ the Redeemer with outstretched hands.</p>
<p>Following the visit to Corcovado we went to “Escadaria Selerón.” This is the iconic tiled stairway extending from Rua Joaquim to Rua Pinto Martins. The artist, Jorge Selerón, started placing tiles scavenged from around Rio on the steps outside of his own apartment in 1990. Today, 21years later, he has installed more than 2,000 tiles given to him from donors around the world. Those tiles presently cover more than 250 steps and Selerón expects to continue this work until the day of his death.</p>
<p>My interest in the artist had less to do with the famous tiled pathway and more to do with the theme of his paintings. For some reason, which Selerón will not tell, the subject of the majority of his paintings is the pregnant figure of a black woman. He has said that it has something to do with troubles from his past. I was hoping to have a chance to take pictures of the tiled images of his paintings along the stairway.</p>
<p>As I was taking some pictures of different tiles, Selerón’s assistant showed up. Fortunately for me he spoke Spanish. We conversed for some time and he invited me into their studio. We entered the studio, a cramped, dark space. I could barely stand up some in some areas of it without bumping my head into the low-hanging beamed ceilings. I looked around at all of the paintings, trying to figure out which one I could afford. I settled on a really nice painting of two pregnant black women playing musical instruments against the backdrop of a favela.</p>
<p>We hadn’t been in the studio for too long before Selerón himself walked in. It was a great surprise. We struck up a conversation in Spanish, Selerón originally being from Chile. Once he found out that I was a storyteller he became animated. He talked about his grandmother in Chile and the stories she used to tell him, he told me about his travels and some of the stories of his life. As we were conversing he began telling me about a storyteller from Africa he had once seen in Rio. A storyteller musician from West Africa who made such an impression on him that he has never forgotten the performance so many years later.</p>
<p>The irony in the situation was that he seemed to be describing me. I was standing before him in jeans and a t-shirt. He had no way of knowing that the colorful robes he was describing, the elaborate hats and strange stringed instrument were all part of my artistry. As I stood there not saying a word, my tour manager interjected excitedly, “That sounds like you Baba!”</p>
<p>It obviously wasn’t me, but another griot who had traveled through Rio performing many years ago.</p>
<p>Our conversation was so engaging that I didn’t want to leave, but we had a schedule to maintain. As I was leaving Selerón surprised me by handing me a gift. I was so touched by his generosity that I promised to return later in the afternoon to play my instrument, sing for him and share a story.</p>
<p>I returned later in the day and stood below of Selerón’s balcony. I sang a traditional praise song. He appeared on his balcony, smiled, and then came down the steps to sit outside of his apartment on the tiled stairway. I played my Kora, sang and shared a tale in Spanish with him. Once again, it was hard to leave. An impromptu performance for a world famous artist; what a memorable experience.</p>
<p>After I left Selerón, my tour guide took me to a dinner hosted in my honor by a group of local Brazilian storytellers. I had an exceptional time there as well.  I told a few tales but also got to hear a few as well. I received gifts of books, food (and more food), tales and wonderful conversation. I was exhausted because the day had been a nonstop itinerary of moving from one thing, or place, immediately to the next.</p>
<p>I love my work!</p>

When I got to my hotel room yesterday I was surprised to find a garden hose attached to the wall next to the toilet. I know how communal and environmentally friendly some cultures can be so I had no problem with the “not-so-subtle” hint that hotel management wanted me to water the flower bed outside of my 2nd story room window.</p>
<p>I was more than happy to help out with the watering until I realized that the aluminum hose attached to the sprayer wouldn’t reach across the bathroom to the window.  It only came out a few feet from the wall. I was perplexed. You would think that a hotel would plan better so, for the first day of my stay, I filled the ice-bucket with the hose and used it to water the flower bed outside my window.</p>
<p>It was somewhat awkward using the ice-bucket. I’m two stories up and I found myself spilling water on the people walking below. The miniature hose would work so much better if I could get it to reach. I called down to the front desk and explained that I needed an extension for my hose. Apparently there was something lost in our translations from Portuguese to English because the person who answered the phone at the front desk kept telling me that they don’t have such things in this hotel. I let her know that if they wanted my assistance with maintaining the flower bed then they would need to provide the proper tools and all I needed was an extension for my hose.</p>
<p>She told me that she would send someone up to see what I was talking about and we hung up.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes there was an older gentleman knocking at my door. He had his head cocked sideways in that quizzical, perplexed manner when one’s brow is furrowed from confusion. “Your hose needs an extension for the flowers sir?” he asked.</p>
<p>I was a bit miffed. I’m no handyman by any stretch of the imagination but I’ve been to home depot enough times and do a lot of my own work around the house. I know what a hose extension looks like. It was a simple request.</p>
<p>I escorted him into the bathroom to show him that the hose would not reach across the length of the bathroom to the flower bed outside of my window.</p>
<p>He began laughing hysterically and seemed unable to stop for some time. Once he finally settled down and wiped the tears from his eyes he took the hose from my hands. “Sir,” he said while choking back inaudible giggles, “this is not for watering the flower bed outside of your window.”</p>
<p>With the hose in his hand he then gestured to show me where the nozzle actually belonged.</p>
<p>All I could say was, “Oh!”</p>
<p>Once he left my room and I shut the door I could hear him break back into his fit of uncontrollable laughter.</p>
<p>I, my friends, was about to become the talk of the hotel.</p>
<p>__________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ok, you guys do know that I’m joking right? Even we storytellers need to have a bit of fun every now and then.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/?attachment_id=1950" rel="attachment wp-att-62894"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-62894" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Rio-10012010.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="322" /></a>I arrived in Rio de Janeiro yesterday morning after having spent 12 hours in flight. If I had possessed the common sense of a mule I would have gone straight to my hotel room to relax and recuperate from an entire day of travel. My mind, imagination and adrenaline wouldn’t permit it. I dropped my luggage off at my hotel and, within an hour, I was back in the streets.</p>
<p>I’m fortunate because my tour manager is a not only a <em>carioca</em> (a person born in Rio de Janeiro) but also extremely passionate about Rio and has a thorough foundation of social/political and historical knowledge regarding both Brazil and the city.</p>
<p>I know most would like to know about “first impressions.” For me Rio possibly possesses the greatest juxtaposition of wealth and poverty that I’ve ever experienced in my travels. Simply leaving Galeão International Airport and crossing the expanse of the city offers views of everything from favelas (Brazilian term for economically impoverished neighborhoods that, historically, once were the places inhabited by former slaves) to expensive tourist hotels and beach condominiums. As far as the people I’ve experienced thus far, I’ve had nothing but patience and compassion for my butchering of the Brazilian Portuguese language.</p>
<p>I spent most of the day visiting the District of Santa Teresa an historical and art district paved with beautiful stoned roadways. While the stone streets don’t make for the most comfortable ride they are a beautiful aesthetic companion to the sloped and curving walls throughout the area and the colonial era architecture.</p>
<p>In one day I was taken to the top most areas to overlook Rio and then down into the lowest areas closest to the beaches. I walked, talked, ate and drank pure coconut.</p>
<p>Probably my most memorable experience of the day was visiting with the artist, Getúlio Damado, the man who makes art from garbage. I had read about him before coming to Rio and it was nice to meet him personally. Getúlio has a really small artist workshop called “Atelier Chamego Bonzolandia.” The workshop is actually a replica of a small  trolley but with only enough room for Getúlio to work in (barely). I could not come all this way and not buy something so I purchased a small seated figure made from wood and other recycled materials. I’ll put a picture of it up on Facebook along with a few images of Getúlio. Before I left he let me know, through a translator, that he has survived three different mayors who have attempted to shut his little shop down. I hope those are the last beauracratic battles Getúlio has to fight. His art serves as a political/social statement on waste and over indulgence. I wish him luck.</p>
<p>Well exhaustion has “officially” set in. I would love to hit the streets of Rio again today but, for now, I’m going to take a nap.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/?attachment_id=1948" rel="attachment wp-att-62250"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-62250" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Baba_LAX.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="240" /></a>I have a “Do-Not-Like-To-Rush” policy that I like to adhere to whenever I’m planning on doing “anything” and that includes traveling. Instead of getting to the airport the 2 hours ahead of time that the customer service agents recommend, I usually am there 3 1/2 to 4 hours ahead of my flight. Why? Because I get there at a leisurely pace and going through all of the checkpoints, scans, pat downs and de-shoeing is so much less a hassle when you’ve got time.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got to the airport 3 1/2 hours before my scheduled flight time. I made it through check-in, customs, and the security check-points with ease. Getting to my gate was an issue because of the level of renovation going on at Los Angeles International Airport. It seemed as if every nook and cranny of that airport had some type of construction going on. I watched many people late for their flights trying to navigate detour signs, whole boarded up sections and gate changes. I felt sorry for the ones that got stuck in the long lines at the metal detector, dancing anxiously around grumbling about the flight they were about to miss. I let people cut in front of me 3 different times out of empathy for their plight.</p>
<p>I know there are times when falling behind in time cannot be helped, especially if you’ve got children or an elder to care for. I’ve been there.</p>
<p>When I finally got to my gate there were fewer seats available than normal. Most of the gate area was boarded up and this cut the seating to more than half of what it normally is. Since I was early it was really easy to find a seat. I found a seat by a window that had an electrical outlet which could charge my phone and laptop and sat down to start communicating with you guys.</p>
<p>About an hour and 20 minutes before time to board the flight, the area is packed with most people standing. I look around the room and there is an elderly woman, alone, leaning against a pillar holding a cane and her carry-on luggage. You know I didn’t have a choice in the matter.</p>
<p>I placed my things down in my well positioned chair and went over to get her and escort her back over to take my seat.</p>
<p>Don’t clap or give me any accolades because I was fuming that one of those game-playing, burger munching, self-absorbed youngsters didn’t get up before me. I’m just being honest. She thanked me profusely and I let her know that I could not have had it any other way.</p>
<p>So I went and joined the throng of late-comers standing against a construction wall.</p>
<p>When I boarded my flight I had a thought. What if my getting there early and not rushing was meant, not for my own comfort, but to place me in a position to give aid or comfort to another? I like that thought. I think I’ll keep my “Do-Not-Like-To-Rush” policy. It seems to be working.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/?attachment_id=1933" rel="attachment wp-att-56560"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-56560" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/teahouse.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="263" /></a>I received a phone call from an old friend, a man more like an elder to me, about two weeks ago. Some readers might remember him from previous blogs. He was the elder who suffered a stroke sometime back and the community rallied together to help him through a very difficult time.</p>
<p>Well&#8230; he is still recovering and doing much better. While we spoke on the phone he expressed his desire to have me attend to the blessing of a little tea house he was opening in South Los Angeles.</p>
<p>A little background might be in order here. This man has “always” been active in trying to secure resources and opportunities for the youth in the community and his stroke has not seemed to slow him down. He is more active now than he was before his illness. His idea for the tea house is to create a space where elders and the youth may gather together. He has collected books, board games, donations of food and toys. Over the decades he has embarked on similar missions with others. Decades ago they had a community center called “The Malcolm X Community Center” that did a lot to help further the education and cultural awareness of thousands of people here in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>His invitation for me to bring blessings to the tea house was humbling and not an invitation I could refuse. Our schedules were initially conflicting because he wanted to host a gathering during the time that I would be in Brazil. We settled on a date before my departure.</p>
<p>Last night I went to the little store front he has rented for the community tea house. It always gives me an immense sense of pride when people set out on their own, not seeking government or corporate aid to give life to their visions. I stood outside of the small store front thinking that it was the answer to so many of the questions I’ve been asking myself over the past few weeks. What would happen if most of our communities who are suffering from the austerity measures of the past 20 odd years pulled together in recognition of a common vision that served our elders and youth? In Brazil they have a concept similar to this in what they call Quilombos. Today, in Brazil, these are often small community centers in store fronts or homes of average citizens. Quilombos also have an historical antecedent that date back to the era of slavery and Maroon Societies.</p>
<p>I entered the tea house and found him sitting in his wheel chair surrounded by a few friends. I don’t know about you but I love those moments of recognition that occur when you first meet eyes with someone you haven’t seen in awhile and they flash a bright, big smile at you. I returned the smile, gave a hug and found myself a chair to sit right next to him. I pulled out my Kora and started playing while everyone talked. We sat reminiscing and catching up. People began coming in, sitting and contributing to the conversation. Throughout the hours several people came and went. Most people I knew but there were a few new faces I was able to get to know. We shared laughs, a few tears and even some differences in opinions.</p>
<p>I’ve been continually confronted with inequities in our educational system every time I visit or perform at schools. Maybe I needed the invitation to this little tea house to remind me of how powerful a single individual with a vision can be. My visit to the tea house was a perfect send off for my trip to Brazil.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/?attachment_id=1931" rel="attachment wp-att-56127"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-56127" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/motk_face.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="204" /></a>There must be some reason why I continue having these dualistic experiences. Yesterday I had a performance at a school in the city of Los Angeles. The school was one of those progressive educational institutions housed in a corporate high rise with underground parking, security guards and beamed ceilings. I’ve performed at the school previous years but this was the first year that I had to leave it and go to visit another school back across town.</p>
<p>The school in the City of Los Angeles is one in which parents pay more than $30,000 a year in tuition. The school I had to get to across town in the City of Long Beach is a public school. The student teacher ratio at the private school is approximately 12 to 1. The student teacher ratio at the public school is approximately 30 to 1. The private school as music programs, choral programs, a photography studio, state-of-the-art computer labs, kilns for clay work, and so much more. The school I visited in Long Beach has none of these things except for the shadow of a music program that has become emaciated by budget cuts and computers that where outdated even when the school received them.</p>
<p>I could continue with the disparities in resources but I think you get the picture.</p>
<p>A private education or attendance in a school fortunate enough to be situated in high property value areas are both part and parcel of the American-Dream. I would never suggest that the disparity between educational institutions in our country be alleviated by punishing the more fortunate. My issues with the inequities in our educational system have much more to do with the core democratic values and ethics that we promulgate the world over.</p>
<p>Every child across this land is taught that a democracy is a representative type government where society’s interests and needs are met through collaborative decision making.</p>
<p>I am continuing to have these, what I call, “Kozol Experiences” each time I visit classrooms and schools. The inequities are glaring and what I am left to wonder is this, “is there room in a democracy for a social/economic structure where the divide between the “haves” and the “have-nots” is wider than it has ever been at any time in our history since the Great Depression? I am asking this in all sincerity because I am witnessing the erosion of core democratic principles giving citizens certain inalienable rights such as Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p>As I see it, the child attending most public schools in our country stands little to no chance along side his/her private school counterpart in competing in tomorrow’s global economic and political world.</p>
<p>At a very basic level we’ve sold our children on the idea that a democracy means equality for all. Are our inequities in education obvious examples that more lip-service is applied to principles of democracy than actual practice.</p>
<p>I left the private school that morning feeling optimistic for the futures of the students I encountered. This wasn’t the case when I left the public school classroom.</p>
<p>Am I being naive in thinking that a nation as rich in ingenuity and diversity as the United States should lead the world in education, not fall further behind it?</p>

<p>There have been so many budget cuts during this era of austerity that many of the basic necessities required by our educators, to do their jobs, are basically nonexistent. Last night&#8217;s school was unable to provide translation services and so I stepped in to volunteer.</p>
<p>Having traveled to schools throughout the world I can say, with certainty, that our educational structure here in the U.S. is crumbling. The disparity between schools within the same district, only miles apart, is horrendous to any objective observer. Schools may be only a mile from one another and yet function as differently as if they were in separate countries.  It is disheartening to know that little has changed since Kozol&#8217;s first edition of &#8220;Savage Inequalities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last night, while translating I began thinking about my experiences in schools in Poland, France, Colombia and West Africa. Touring schools in those countries has given me a perspective that I wish more educators possessed. Having had those experiences, sometimes I fear that our educational system is in opposition to serving our youth rather than building them up.</p>
<p>We catalog more academic theories than any other nation on earth, yet we permit disassociated testing and partisan economics to dictate our directions. Why does our academic system act in opposition of the well being of its students? Why do parents and community leaders permit the dominance of a system practicing mediocrity?</p>
<p>As I think about this situation I&#8217;m recalling a proverb I once heard in Thioroye Senegal that says, &#8220;The Ruin of a Nation begins in the home of its people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks for allowing me this little rant.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/?attachment_id=1927" rel="attachment wp-att-53316"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-53316" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/flight-case.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="263" /></a>I&#8217;ve been performing since early 94, telling stories, playing Kora and singing. I&#8217;ve always managed to get around the expense of a flight case. That is until now. I used to have my clients just pay for an additional seat for my Kora and, because I was only touring 10-15 shows a year, that wasn&#8217;t bad. The number of requests I&#8217;ve begun to receive to travel abroad has increased. I had to go to a professional company and order a customized flight case.</p>
<p>The company that made my case for me is called GOMC (Get Off My Case) and they do incredible work. My contact there was Nate. I did a ton of research before hiring them. In fact, I first contacted them two years ago when I started my research but wasn&#8217;t ready to commit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s taken a week to complete construction, but my case is finally finished. It weighs 70 lbs. (with the Kora inside) and has dimensions of  53&#8243; W x 22&#8243; D x 15&#8243; H.</p>
<p>As far as International travel, I&#8217;m right at the tip of most weight and size restrictions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still going to take it to the airport in a few days so that I can get an exact read on cost in order to quote clients a more accurate rate.</p>
<p>I know it may seem like a small thing, but for me, this is a sort of rite of passage as far as my ascension as an artist.</p>
<p>My case&#8217;s first test will be my trip to Brazil next week. I&#8217;m a little anxious about letting my instrument out of my sight and leaving it in the hands of baggage handlers. I&#8217;m going to try to exercise my breathing and relax into the idea that everything will be as it should be. I know that sounds a bit Zen but if I don&#8217;t think that way I&#8217;ll drive myself insane.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try to remember to update the blog once I&#8217;ve gone to the airport and gotten my exact costs.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/?attachment_id=1925" rel="attachment wp-att-52272"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-52272" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/stone.jpg" alt="Nahuatl Calendar" width="274" height="187" /></a>While most of my friends were partying during our early years and engaged in unmentionable activities (at least that&#8217;s what I heard), I had my head buried in books. Sometimes I lost in conversations with old friends because I wasn&#8217;t present when they had some of their most harrowing adventures. In my early 20&#8242;s I was fixated on history, biographies and languages. I never dreamed that all those years of reading, studying sans an objective, just for the love of learning, would one day prove to be beneficial.</p>
<p>When I complete my tour of Brazil I go immediately to Mexico. I&#8217;ll spend 3 weeks in Mexico visiting schools there and celebrating &#8220;El Dia de Los Muertos (Day of the Dead).&#8221; If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the Day of the Dead then just do a quick internet search. It is an amazing tradition in Mexico.</p>
<p>When I first moved to Los Angeles in the late 80&#8242;s, one of the first things I noticed where I was living was the high number of people surrounding me that did not speak English. The majority of them spoke Spanish and most were also from Mexico. I began teaching myself Spanish in order to be able to communicate with those around me. Back during that time I figured that, if there are a huge number of the population that speaks Spanish then maybe I should learn a little something as well.</p>
<p>I was so driven to acquire fluency that I even attended a local community college for a couple of years to get the rules of grammar, syntax, verb conjugation and cultural literacy under my belt.</p>
<p>The reason why I&#8217;m explaining all of this is because I had no clue at the time that language would play such a pivotal role in my life. I explored language for the joy of it. I immersed myself in cultures for the pure fun of it. I would love to say that I had some intellectual pursuit in mind or that I had the foresight of wisdom but that wouldn&#8217;t be true.</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230; here I am preparing for a trip to tour both Brazil and Mexico to share my music and stories. Had I chosen to do many of the things my peers were doing during our youth, I would not be in the position I am today to exploit my acquired skills/talents.</p>
<p>There is a Spanish dicho (saying or proverb) that I&#8217;ve always held on to whenever it I reached a point of exasperation with attempting to gain language fluency: Poco a poco se van lejos (little by little one goes far). I&#8217;ve subscribed to that philosophy in many areas of my life and it has really served me well.</p>
<p>To say that I&#8217;m excited about my upcoming trip to Mexico would be an understatement. I&#8217;m hoping to explore some of the ancient Aztec structures, hear the Nahuatl language spoken regularly and visit some of the battle grounds where Gaspar Yanga fought for liberation.</p>
<p>I think, when I return, that I will have so much more to share with my dual immersion schools and billingual audiences.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep posting while in Brazil and Mexico and, hopefully, you&#8217;ll share your comments with me as I travel. I look forward to it!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/?attachment_id=50449" rel="attachment wp-att-50449"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-50449" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/favela.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="204" /></a>I&#8217;m having a lot of thoughts of my upcoming trip to Brazil and I&#8217;m trying to reconcile time constraints with a desire to provide service. The truth of the matter is that most schools that can afford to bring me to their respective countries are private and never seem not belong to the lower socio/economic rungs of the ladder. My heart often aches because I have an intense need to spend time with schools and community organizations that mirror the grassroots structures that I began with here in South Los Angeles years ago.</p>
<p>I can typically work in one or two school/community center visits during my month long tours but even that is difficult to schedule. The needs of the host schools usually extend beyond the typical school day, as we view it here in the United States. I would not trade my dinners in the evening with staff and teachers who plan such things nor would I alter the impromptu gatherings I&#8217;m invited to be a part of in people&#8217;s homes.</p>
<p>One of my biggest regrets while I was in Colombia was not making it to the coastal area of Choco. In Bogota and Cali I was able to spend time with families from the region but there is nothing like traveling to an historical area and encountering, 1st hand, things that you&#8217;ve only read about (the earth, air, architectural structures, music, food, etc.). Choco has its historical roots as a coastal city built up from the slave trade. People often forget that, during slavery, families where separated on many levels. A persons mother could be sent to North America, a father to Central America and the children might end up in South America. This is not an exaggeration. Slavery was not the neat, clean peculiar institution that many would make it out to be. For me, knowing that there is a chance that, by blood, many I could be connected to another without our knowing it is profound.</p>
<p>In the upcoming trip to Brazil I&#8217;ve been seriously thinking about whether or not I&#8217;ll be able to visit a few of the contemporary community quilombos and Casas de Candomblé. Having spent many years in the center of rodas, playing birimbau, dancing Candomblé rituals, and studying maroon societies such as Palmares, I am overly excited about placing my feet in a land that celebrates so many of its African roots.</p>
<p>Brasilians have adopted a Portuguese word, favelas, to designate slums. I&#8217;m always hesitant to use words like slum or ghetto because that may not be what they represent to those who live there. I hope that I am able to take some of my own time, free time as they call it, and visit some of the schools and community centers located in, at or near the some of the favelas. I know most of these schools would never be able to afford to fly me in and host me but maybe a small donation of my time would go a long way in showing that, across the world, there are others who care about what is happening to the less fortunate in societies.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on it and I&#8217;ll update you with how things are going. Two weeks and we&#8217;ll board the plane to Brazil. Are you as excited as I am?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/?attachment_id=1917" rel="attachment wp-att-47249"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-47249" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/36_207111dundun.jpg" alt="" width="466" height="360" /></a>The other day I was at a small arts festival being hosted by a school. I&#8217;ve been visiting this school and performing there for almost 10 years now. They host a festival where artists spend the day going from room to room, visiting with students and performing their respective craft.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always enjoyed these campus festivals, not only for the chance to perform, but I also get to reconnect with other artists and arts personnel.</p>
<p>This day was a little different though. The arts coordinator let me know that morning when I arrived that I would be needed in the faculty room at lunch. She was going to have all of the artists and many of the teachers gather there for some announcements.</p>
<p>I set out visiting my classroom and switched classes every 45 minutes or so up until lunch time. The last class that I was with prior to lunch was a classroom of 5th grade students.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this has ever happened to any of you but, sometimes, you&#8217;re just having such an incredible time that you just don&#8217;t want to leave. Everything was amazing between the students and I. When it reached time for me to leave the room and go to lunch, the students demanded another story, another song. My time was up but they wanted me to stay. The funny thing was that, if I stayed not only would I be eating into my lunch time (get it&#8230; eating into my lunch time&#8230; I&#8221;m so darn clever!), but they were also sacrificing valuable recess play time.</p>
<p>How could I not want to stay with those issues on the line? So, remembering the arts coordinator&#8217;s words, I decided lunch wasn&#8217;t all that important and, if I had ears enthusiastic about listening to another tale or two, then I would stay.</p>
<p>About 15 minutes into our singing together and guided interactive tale there was a knock at the door. It was the arts coordinator. There was nothing I could say but, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>I promised to finish up the tale and head over to the staff&#8217;s lounge.</p>
<p>I really love it when listeners want more of what you have to offer, it is so affirming.</p>
<p>I finished up with the children and sprinted one the faculty lounge. When I walked into the door the coordinator had me stand at the front of the room and explained that I was needed there. At this point I wasn&#8217;t sure what was going on but it didn&#8217;t matter, I know the coordinator well and she is a wonderful person.</p>
<p>There were about 20 to 30 artists, administrators and teachers gathered together in the lounge. I&#8217;m standing up front for who knows what reason. Well&#8230; they all knew but I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The coordinator began to speak and explain the reason for the gathering. Apparently there was a presentation to be made to me. My ears perked up. Me? For what? Why?</p>
<p>The coordinator then bought one of the schools teacher&#8217;s forward. Her name was Susan.</p>
<p>Susan spoke to the crowd that she had communicated with the rest of the faculty about hosting this presentation on this date, at this time and they all agreed it would be apropos.</p>
<p>Susan then began to explain that her father had died about a month ago and that before he passed there was something that he wanted me to have. She said that her father had never met me but was aware, through her and many of the other teachers, of the impact I had had on the children of the school.</p>
<p>As she spoke she was holding a large box in her arms.</p>
<p>This was so unexacting that I began tearing up listening to her.</p>
<p>Susan talked about her father&#8217;s commitment to community and education and said that he wanted to make sure, before he passed, that his most treasured possession was put in the right hands.</p>
<p>By this time I was flat out crying, tears running down my checks. The more I tried to keep myself in check, the more tears streamed down my face. Embarrassing? Yes!</p>
<p>She handed me the box. I stood there for a moment staring at the crowd and the teachers standing around me. I placed the box on the table before opening it and grabbed Susan and gave her a hug.</p>
<p>To say I was honored is truly an understatement.</p>
<p>I was handed the box again and told to open it. I did.</p>
<p>Inside of the box was a beautiful Nigerian Talking Drum, also known as a Dundun.</p>
<p>Susan&#8217;s father had received it in 1966 when he was working with the Peace Corps and it was his most prized possession. Susan told me that her father wanted it to remain in the hands of an educator, someone who would use it while working with children and I was his logical choice.</p>
<p>I took the drum out of the box and held it, in shock.</p>
<p>If masculinity is measured by your ability to hold back tears then this day I was possibly the least masculine guy on the planet. I don&#8217;t even know when the last time I cried was but, on this day, I cried in front of my peers, the staff, in my car.</p>
<p>As I write this, I&#8217;m recalling the intense feeling of honor that gripped me that day.</p>
<p>This is truly a gift that will be put to use the way it was intended and, having been entrusted with it, I will always remember its&#8217; purpose.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/?attachment_id=1915" rel="attachment wp-att-46458"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-46458" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/CHOC-Bear.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="265" /></a>I just left the Children&#8217;s Hospital after being there for two hours. What an amazing time I had! I got to visit with a few of the children that I met last week and share new stories. I love having the chance to perform for people who&#8217;ve already seen me perform.</p>
<p>Today was a bit different. I usually visit a play room and then spend my time visiting bed sides. Today I spent most of my time in two different play rooms and visited fewer rooms.</p>
<p>An interesting occurrence happened when I arrived at the hospital. There was a young father there entering at the same time as I was with his daughter. We exchanged pleasantries and he let me know that his younger daughter was a patient in the hospital. He was very interested in having me tell his daughters a few stories. As fate would have it, the children&#8217;s services representative had me start on the same floor as his daughter, in the play room. The young father and his two daughters entered the room just as I was about to begin. What a great feeling!</p>
<p>All of the children, and adults as well, were very engaging in the 3rd floor playroom. Have you ever had one of those moments when everything is in sync, everything just seems to fall into place? Today&#8217;s performances were like that for me the whole day.</p>
<p>When I was finishing up I asked the father if he had any questions. He asked me for one more song. How could I resist? I immediately thought back to the time I was leaving Children&#8217;s Hospital a few years ago and came across a man sitting in his car crying. Being a father myself, that was one of the most difficult encounters I ever had. We men don&#8217;t typically share emotions and I didn&#8217;t know how to comfort the father I came across in the car.</p>
<p>I played one more song for the young father in the playroom and sang. He was so grateful that it made me feel really good about my work. I think sometimes when we thing about serving the children stricken with illness in hospitals such as these, we forget that there are whole families affected by their diseases.</p>
<p>Previously I got a chance to tell a few tales in Spanish. I love it when I get the chance to use my other language skills. Today I met a woman from Cuba and got a chance to chat in Spanish with her. I love Cuban culture!</p>
<p>I meet so many people through my work that I sometimes feel as though I&#8217;ve got the greatest job in the world.</p>
<p>I went into the room of a 3 year old girl. Now you might think that a 3 year wouldn&#8217;t have the focus or concentration to listen to a story from start to finish, but this little girl was not your average 3 year old.</p>
<p>Of course you have to give a 3 year old exactly what they want, nothing less. The child wanted a &#8220;Princess&#8221; story and so a &#8220;Princess&#8221; story she received. I love telling tales to this age when they have her level of focus. She smiled during the story, laughed when it was appropriate and showed me a level of respect beyond her years. It was awesome!</p>
<p>Well I guess you all can tell how my day went. It was an extraordinary day. Thanks for taking the time to read.</p>

I&#8217;m not feeling as apprehensive as I was last week and I&#8217;m hoping to re-visit a couple of children who I played music for and told stories to.</p>
<p>There is one young girl that I want to check in on just to know her current state. She was a child who had an horrendous surgery, one that would have folded the souls of most of us but she was coping incredibly well. I want to check on her not to tell her stories or play music but just check in with the staff to see how she&#8217;s doing.</p>
<p>Each year I&#8217;ve visited this hospital about twice a year for the past 3 years. Sometimes I feel a bit guilty because I feel as though I am taking more than I am giving. The children have a way about themselves that makes you feel as though they are caring for you, instead of you caring for their needs.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;ve prepared some new stories and I&#8217;ve even collected a few of my music Cd&#8217;s to give away as gifts. My performances in the play rooms are great but what I love more than anything is strolling the hallways and visiting room to room.</p>
<p>The staff prepares a list of children who want storytelling and music before I come and I do my best to complete every visit to every room on that list if I can. I haven&#8217;t missed a child yet so let&#8217;s cross our fingers.</p>
<p>Well&#8230; I&#8217;ve got to hit the road. I&#8217;ll fill you in on the visit a little later when I&#8217;m back in front of my computer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I wrote about my nervousness in preparing for a visit to Children&#8217;s Hospital Orange County (CHOC). It was a therapeutic process putting pen to paper and helped me deal with the performance anxiety that only seems to rear its ugly head when I&#8217;m going to CHOC.</p>
<p>Needless to say that I had an amazing time with the children. I know that I will never get over the sight of young people&#8217;s bodies invaded by tubes or scaring and maybe I never should.</p>
<p>My first performance was in a small play room. The aids went through the halls soliciting children to come to the play room to hear music and storytelling. As the children were filing in, most of them pulling rolling  I.V. stands, I spotted a young girl who looked familiar. I ignored the thought and greeted everyone entering. The young girl who caught my attention was with her mother. The girl&#8217;s mother shook my hand and said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve been to my daughter&#8217;s school!&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked at the girl and she did, indeed, look familiar. Her face was beaming and she had the most gorgeous smile. I asked her what school she attended and she explained that I had worked with her class, and several others, to prepare them for a performance more than 3 years ago. She also told me that her family moved during the preparation and she was never able to finish preparing for the presentation.</p>
<p>The duality of feeling overjoyed at reconnecting with an old student again and regretting meeting with her during an obvious period of despair didn&#8217;t escaped me. I wanted to do something special for her so I allowed her to choose the theme for the story I would tell. Her choices were: 1) Greed 2) Love 3) Honesty or 4) Honor.</p>
<p>For her first story she chose greed and I pulled out all the stops to put a smile on her face and the face of every other child there. The second them she chose was &#8220;Love&#8221; and that was an easy one for me. She was about 12 years old so I placed her inside of the story as the heroine and described her features as the most beautiful anyone had ever laid eyes on. I use this technique a lot with both boys and girls, identifying their characteristics as those possessed by the main character of the story.</p>
<p>I closed the playroom performance with a song for the parents in the room. I played Kaira and explained that the word meant Peace in the West African Language of Bambara. It was a wonderful way to close the performance in the playroom. I wasn&#8217;t able to hug the young girl because of her I.V.&#8217;s but we did manage to share a few really great smiles and laughs.</p>
<p>Following the performance I was escorted to several rooms where children had requested the storyteller. I love walking the halls of CHOC with my harp and sweeping into rooms singing and telling tales to the children. That is actually my favorite part of my visits to CHOC.</p>
<p>I could discuss the pain of what I witnessed or the few moments that nearly brought me to tears but that would detract from the profiles in courage that I felt honored to serve.</p>
<p>The families, staff and volunteers at CHOC are &#8220;all&#8221; amazing human beings. In a conversation with the woman responsible for me being there I asked her how she was able to function in this environment with witnessing so many children in pain everyday?</p>
<p>Her answer held so much wisdom for me. She said, &#8220;When I first started working here I was horrified by the scars, the visual impact of the surgeries and the suffering but each day I returned. After some time I began to actually &#8220;see&#8221; the children and not their scars or suffering. Even though they are each having horrendous experiences, they are all still children. I treat each and everyone of them as the child I see in them.&#8221;</p>
<p>What more should I write following that?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a few hours I&#8217;ll be at Children&#8217;s Hospital visiting room and sharing stories and music. I&#8217;ve performed in almost any type of venue you could possibly imagine but, for some reason, whenever I&#8217;m called upon to visit the Children&#8217;s Hospital I get really nervous. Way too many thoughts race through my mind about stories I&#8217;d like share, am I prepared, don&#8217;t want to forget anything, is my instrument tuned correctly, etc.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought a lot about why Children&#8217;s Hospital puts me on edge so much and I think I know why. It&#8217;s simple.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to disappoint one single child in that hospital and I want to give them the best of what I have to offer. Although I&#8217;ve been visiting and telling stories there for years, there is still that deep desire to bring a smile to one of their faces or share a nice laugh.</p>
<p>The irony of my visits to Children&#8217;s Hospital is that the children often give more than they receive from me. I &#8220;always&#8221; leave the hospital with a great sense of graciousness and hope. I don&#8217;t think today will be any different. I wish I could relax and just go do what I do since I already know that there will be positive outcomes. That would be operating from a place of wisdom wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Just getting these words out has helped tremendously. When I finish my day at the hospital I&#8217;ll return home and update you all on how it went.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before I begin this story let me tell you something, “I do not like lines…not standing in them, near them, on them or anywhere around them. Also, I have never eaten green eggs and ham and I deplore lines because that is just who I am.”</p>
<p>Now on to my adventure of how I ended up standing in a line for 3 ½ hours. Blame it on the iPad 2 or, as Flip Wilson used to say, “The Devil made me do it.”<br />
You see, here is what actually happened…</p>
<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/photo.jpg" rel="lightbox[1657]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1658" title="iPad 2 purchase card" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/photo-e1300078004834.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="478" /></a>Last Friday, March 11th, 2011 the much anticipated Apple iPad 2 went on sale in Apple stores at 5 pm. Yes 5 in the afternoon. I knew that I wanted to purchase one for my business, but spending hours upon hours in a line on a Friday afternoon? Get real! I figured that I would wait for all the hype to die down and just mosey into a store, pick up the one I wanted and get on with my life.</p>
<p>I was following the news and saw more than 300 + people lined up outside of our local Apple store at the Cerritos Mall.</p>
<p>I furrowed my brow in astonishment, asking myself why people would do this. Why would people subject themselves to this sort of torture?</p>
<p>(Ok, I never said that I was the smartest person in the world so before you start judging me, just read the rest of the tale.)</p>
<p>I figured I would do it an easier way. I figured that I would go the to mall the next morning and swoop up my 64 gig iPad 2 and be out of the door in a matter of minutes. I know, I know… you are thinking that I may not be grounded in reality. I have to admit that sometimes I have occasion to question my own intelligence.</p>
<p>Continuing on. I woke up the next morning and remembered that the store at Cerritos mall opened at 9 am or so. I think. I wasn’t sure but it didn’t matter because I had chosen to take my day slowly and enjoy a pace in opposition of the weekly hustle and bustle.</p>
<p>I headed out the door about 8:15 or 8:30 am and stopped at my local Starbucks to get a muffin and some apple juice.  Yes I said apple juice. I don’t drink coffee. I just don’t.<br />
So I arrived at the mall in Cerritos and when I walked in there was a line of people standing outside of the Apple store. There were about 60 people standing in line! There was a line there! A line! You know how much I hate lines!</p>
<p>So what did I do? I went and got in line behind the last person. Why? Because I wanted an iPad 2, of course.</p>
<p>Are you laughing at me yet? Wait, allow me to finish.</p>
<p>I started talking with the guy in front of me who told me that the store didn’t open until 10:00 am.</p>
<p>In an age of an overabundance of information and technology I had failed to simply “Google” the store to find out what time they actually opened. Once again, I didn’t say that I was the brightest bulb in the bunch.</p>
<p>I decided that waiting for about another 40 minutes or so for the store to open wouldn’t be such a bad idea, after all, I had my muffins and apple juice and no where to really be and I had already decided to make this one of my slow-motion days. Yes, I actually have a name for days that I consciously choose to move slower than every one else. I call them my “slow-motion” days and I love them.</p>
<p>So, while I was standing in line, there were people starting to arrive behind me. The closer we got to 10 am, the longer the line grew. By the time the representative from the store came out to make an announcement there were about 100 people behind me. Incredible!</p>
<p>The Apple store rep came out and announced that they were out of iPads and didn’t know when, or if, they would be getting any more ….but that possibly, or maybe, there was a chance that they might  have a shipment coming into the store sometime during the day. She then advised us that if we chose to wait in line it was our choice, but to not expect anything.</p>
<p>Nobody moved. I was processing the confusing jumble of information that I had just received when the people in front of me helped give me clarity. “There is a delivery of iPads coming in sometime today.” That is what she said, “a delivery coming today.” No one moved. Why? Because there was a delivery coming sometime today.<br />
It is amazing how the human mind begins to rationalize.  I told myself, just like everyone else there that day, “Hey there is a shipment of iPads coming in sometime today.”<br />
Have you been in a spot like that? Have you turned your desire for something into a series of rationalizations? I was quickly falling into that space. Apparently, I wasn’t the only one.</p>
<p>Within minutes, our little line turned into a small village of sorts. People began communicating and others went on reconnaissance missions for provisions (food, water, cupcakes). It was awesome. I forgot I was standing in a line and simply began enjoying the moment. It was odd. I, the man who had waged war on lines all of his life was standing in one and enjoying himself.”</p>
<p>Our villages joy-buzz was displaced by the buzz-killing Apple manager who came out of the store and informed us that they had no information and knew nothing. She also said that, “if” a shipment did come in there definitely would not be enough for all of the people in line.<br />
She looked right at me and said, “I would just go home if I were you.”</p>
<p>Her words didn’t seem to penetrate my “I want an iPad 2” filter. I had clearly heard, like everyone else, “A shipment of iPad 2’s will be in “sometime” today.”<br />
Many people started exiting the line, abandoning our little village. It was actually sort of sad. We had built up a  camaraderie in our tiny “line village” and we were slowly losing citizens to hopelessness.</p>
<p>I have been accused of many things in my life, but I have never been accused of being hopeless. I watched people settle back into their spots, and once the Apple interloper had receded back into the confines of the store our joy slowly returned.</p>
<p>Approximately half an hour later, our conversations and laughs were interrupted by a sudden cheer erupting from the front of the line.<br />
A Fedex delivery truck had just entered through the front door of the Apple Store! People were jumping and clapping. I got swept up in the mob mentality and felt a strong desire to do my own little happy dance.</p>
<p>The Apple Authoritarian came out and issued her proclamation that she would be opening the delivery boxes soon and that she would come out and ration tickets to the limited number of souls that would receive an iPad 2, according to their place in line. Once again, she looked down the line in my direction and shook her head in a disapproving manner. Again she stated, “I really would not wait around if I were you guys. There are not that many in the shipment.”</p>
<p>All I heard was, “The iPad 2’s just arrived”.</p>
<p>A little while later, applause erupted again as a platoon of 5 to 7 Apple store soldiers headed toward the line led by their brave buzz-killing leader.</p>
<p>Gripped tightly in her left hand, she had those highly sought after little white tickets! She began distributing them to each person in line from the front and heading back. “Each person may purchase 2 iPads!” She announced as she looked my way. There was that look again! That disapproving, “You’re wasting your time here because I don’t have that many tickets look.”</p>
<p>I stood my ground. 3 ½ hours and counting.</p>
<p>I heard some people down the line grumbling as they left. They were way ahead of me. What had happened? Everyone near me wanted to know. Were all of the tickets handed out already?</p>
<p>The guys leaving explained that there were no more A.T. &amp; T. iPads, only Verizon. More deflated souls departed the line ahead of me. Why didn’t I leave? I’m not sure because I had wanted to purchase the 64 gig, A.T. &amp; T. model. I wanted it because of its SIM card capabilities. I probably should have left but something told me to just hang out, after all it was a slow-motion day and this was getting interesting.</p>
<p>The Apple commandant slowly made her way down the line as she announced, “There are only the 32 gig Verizon models left.”</p>
<p>She was about 5 people down from me and I couldn’t tell how many tickets she had left, but I knew she had some so I stood my ground. She was 4 people away and then 2.<br />
She had 2 tickets left and there were 2 people in front of me. I don’t know why but this made me smile inside, it was a bit humorous. She had 2 tickets left and there were only 2 people in front of me, a guy and his girlfriend. It turned out that she didn’t want an iPad and so there was one ticket left.</p>
<p>Who got it? Me.</p>
<p>I felt like I had just won some grand prize, the lottery or something. There was a huge communal grumble from the line behind me. People were pointing at me saying, “He’s the last one.” I had earned a title in our little dissipating village. I was “The One.” The “Last One” to be more precise and I wore my honorific title with a sense of pride.</p>
<p>As I stood there with the Verizon 32 gig ticket in my hand which would allow me to purchase an iPad 2, reality began to set in. I hadn’t wanted a 32 gig Verizon iPad, I had wanted a 64 gig A. T. &amp; T.</p>
<p>I didn’t feel sad about it though, I simply rationalized my acceptance and felt the joy of being “The One.”</p>
<p>The guy in front of me gave his condolences that I didn’t get the 64 gig. I told him that things usually work out so well for me that I had no room to complain in life.<br />
The employees started coming out getting us one-by-one to bring us into the store to purchase our iPads.</p>
<p>We stood in line being brought in one-by-one for about another 40 minutes when a guy about 4 people in front of me started shaking his head in disappointment. There may have only been about 15 or so of us still left in the village, but we were still capable of demonstrating concern for one another. I leaned in close to him and asked what was wrong. Here is what he said, no joke, “I took 2 tickets but I don’t really want to purchase 2 iPads. I only want the Verizon one.”</p>
<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/photo-02.jpg" rel="lightbox[1657]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1659" title="iPad 2 64 gb black" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/photo-02.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="478" /></a>The second ticket in his hand was for an A. T. &amp; T. 64 gig. He turned to me and said, “Hey didn’t you want a 64 gig A. T. &amp; T?” He then just handed me the ticket. Wow!<br />
So I’m standing there now with 2 tickets. A number of people gave me cheers and bright smiles. The guy directly in front of me said, “You got exactly what you wanted. I see what you mean about things working out for you.”</p>
<p>I turned to a guy that had appeared behind me who should have gone home but didn’t. I asked him if he wanted my 32 gig Verizon ticket. His face lit up. He had chosen to just stay in line when all others had given up hope. He was rewarded by my giving him that “last ticket.” It was a bit sad to pass on my honorific title of being “The One” but all good things must come to an end. Everyone in line was happy, especially me.</p>
<p>There is another bit of reality that struck me. I, along with many others, had stood in line for hours to give our money over to a retail establishment for an item that has a shelf life of approximately a year before a newer, shinier version will come out and make it look antiquated. If this is a bad economy then the parking lot at the mall doesn’t know it.</p>
<p>I went into the store and purchased my 64 gig A.T. &amp; T. iPad 2.</p>
<p>What will I do next? Buy more stock in Apple of course.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0853.jpg" rel="lightbox[1623]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1624" title="IMG_0853" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0853.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a>There is a pattern that plays out in my mind whenever I leave a new city or country that I am visiting. As I am preparing to leave my mind offers observations such as, &#8220;this time tomorrow I will be back in Los Angeles,&#8221; or &#8220;this will be the last morning I hear the church bells of Candelaria.&#8221; I think I started this quasi-game of sorts as a child when travel seemed the only permanent fixture in my life. Tonight I depart Bogota and return to Los Angeles. There are many things which I am already missing, the most prominent of which will be the people.</p>
<p>I am jotting down these few words as I get ready for my final performances here in Colombia at a school this morning. This won&#8217;t be a long blog as many others because I feel like I&#8217;ve said most of what I&#8217;ve wanted to say.</p>
<p>Last night a group of teens took me out to dinner and made some very convincing arguments as to why I should return to Colombia, and often. Who knew teens could be so savvy? I could not help but to listen with  the deepest, most intense level of humility. I don&#8217;t ever recall teenagers sitting me down and delivering cogent arguments as to my responsibility to them and their younger peers. My heart was touched in a way that is difficult to detail to you. I listened to these young men speak of the depth of my craft and the need for more profound exchanges between myself and other Colombians. Teens? Yes, teens.</p>
<p>I sat at a table dining with them feeling as though I were breaking bread with my peers. That is such an odd thing for a man who has children much older then them and is, in fact, a grandfather.</p>
<p>When we parted ways last night I was left with so many things to contemplate. I guess those young men still have me thinking into the next day as I write these few words.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to get to this school and not be late so I&#8217;m going to end here. My words written in previous Bogota Blogs, I think, will suffice to let anyone know how I&#8217;ve felt about this trip.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to miss you Colombia.</p>
<p>Chau&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0834.jpg" rel="lightbox[1620]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1621" title="IMG_0834" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0834.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a>I&#8217;m back in Bogota! The rain last night delayed some of the services at the airport and so I got home really late. I woke up this morning thinking about a friend I made at Colegio Jefferson in Cali. Her name is Claudia and she is such a beautiful person. Claudia is the woman I wrote about previously who invited Pablo (my tour manager) and I to her home to meet her husband and children. She had not been feeling so well recently and I was a little concerned about her. On the day we were scheduled to return to Bogota, she sent me an email saying that she wanted to meet one last time before I left. She said that she had something she wanted to share with me.</p>
<p>We scheduled time to meet between check-out and the time we would take the taxi to the airport. Claudia met Pablo and I in the lobby of our hotel and she was as radiant as ever. Do you know people who, with ease and grace, simply exude inner beauty? She is one of those people.</p>
<p>After hugs all around the three of us sat down and Claudia pulled a strange looking fruit from her bag. She called it a &#8220;Zapote.&#8221; Claudia has been, somewhat, Colombia&#8217;s ambassador of goodwill and fruit tasting for Pablo and I while we were in Cali. I have to tell you all something. I have traveled to the far ends of this earth and Colombia has got to have more fruit than any other place on the planet. Every time I turn around I am trying a different fruit. With motherly patience, she taught me how to peel the fruit and pull its meat apart from the core to eat.</p>
<p>I wish I could describe all the different tastes of all of the different fruits but I can&#8217;t. I have to honestly say that the blends, scents and textures of many of the fruits defy explanation. The beauty in this tasting was that this woman went out of her way to come to us and share something culturally that she felt we needed. How often does that happen? Experiences such as these, and they have been too numerous to chronicle each and every one, but experiences such as these have made this a cultural adventure.</p>
<p>The Zapote was extremely messy and colored my fingers a bright orange at the tips but I didn&#8217;t care. The child in me inadvertently took over as I found myself licking the remaining juices from my fingers. The adult in me caught myself doing but said, &#8220;Who cares! Enjoy!&#8221; Luckily I didn&#8217;t go as far as kicking my shoes off (another habit I acquired as a child when eating something really good). Oh! It is sort of funny because when I was at Jefferson Claudia gave Pablo and I an assortment of things to try one day and what did I do? Kicked my shoes off! I didn&#8217;t even realize it. I apologized and she let me know that, and this was so beautiful the way she put it, she said, &#8220;that puts you in closer contact with the earth.&#8221; Life can be poetry at times can&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>In recalling this moment earlier I just felt the need to share it with you.</p>
<p>I have always said that we living, breathing storytellers have an advantage over popular media in that we touch, see, embrace and hear our audiences. In all of the years I have been storytelling and playing my music professionally, I have gained friends (true friends) all over the world. I am in constant contact with people who I met more than 15, even 20 years ago.</p>
<p>The experience of sharing that single piece of exotic fruit was poetry physically manifested and an example of what relationships may be if we invest ourselves in them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Pic_1042_18.jpg" rel="lightbox[1614]"></a><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/mg05-2.jpg" rel="lightbox[1614]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1616" title="mg05-2" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/mg05-2.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="250" /></a>As I´m preparing to leave the beautiful city of Santiago de Cali, I´m feeling a bit sad. The schools, teachers, administrators and students really rolled out the red-carpet for me. At Jefferson I was challenged creatively to engage each and every grade level they had (K-11). It was difficult but I would do it all over again, the same way because it pushed me to my creative edge having to jump between developmental stages of children so quickly. At La Colina, the ladies would not stop feeding me. Every time I admitted that I had not tasted something, it magically appeared for me to sample it. I started eating upon my arrival at La Colina and then I did not stop until late in the afternoon because one of the teachers felt it was her duty to take me to a local spot and feed me some more. At Britanico the kids made me feel like a Rock-Star.</p>
<p>I took more pictures with students at Britanico than any other school I have visited here in Colombia. To add to the euphoria of appreciation that they blanketed me with, I also had a chance to dance with one of the students on stage, in front of the entire school. The young woman showed no fear and neither did I. It was beautiful!</p>
<p>My most memorable experience thus far has been meeting two young men at Britanico who cornered me during my meal and said they wanted to know everything! They wanted to know how I controlled the audience, where did I learn to tell stories like that, who taught me to play the instrument, where did I learn all of the stage techniques, etc.</p>
<p>My conversation with the two young men was inspirational for me because they were looking beyond the entertainment value of what they had just experienced. These two young men actually saw the depth and profundity of the craft and desired to know me. I love when this happens because it does not happen often enough. I spent my entire meal conversing with these two young men and only ended the conversation because I had to leave for the airport. I will definitely remember these two young men.</p>
<p>I´ve got to get to the airport there is a cab waiting outside my hotel at the moment, waiting me to type these last few words (quickly).</p>
<p>Chau!</p>
<p>Oops, one last thing! I would be remiss if I did not mention the following. I must must must must with all my heart and in deep sincerity thank the English Department at Colegio Britanico and their fearless leader, Tom, for an amazing dinner last night. Tom you and your staff definitely went above and way beyond the call of duty to make me feel welcomed here in Cali. I am more than appreciative of your hospitality, the wonderful conversations, encountering quick Irish wit, being seated next to the beautiful Linda and engaging others on a very intimate, spiritual and deeper level of understanding.</p>
<p>Ok, just thought I would throw that in. Taxi is still waiting! Chau!</p>
<p>No&#8230; really! Chau!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0594_1.jpg" rel="lightbox[1610]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1611" title="IMG_0594_1" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0594_1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Today was a day of excess and indulging. I arrived really early at this morning’s school and was greeted by food and a drink called “Avena” (Oatmeal milk drink). The drink is quite refreshing but difficult to explain the taste and texture. Had I realized what an adventure down “Food Avenue” it was going to be I might have not eaten so much so early in the morning.</p>
<p>My first performance caused a bit of a scandal in the school as I asked one of the teachers, Marta, to marry me (in the context of the story of course). The scandal began when Marta returned to her classroom and her students began asking her if she were really going to marry me. I love how she handled it! She let the children know that today was going to be her last day and that she and I would be leaving for Africa immediately after school.</p>
<p>All day long children were running up to me begging me not to take their teacher. I had one little girl of about 8 years old who refused to believe in our little exercise in enchantment. The little girl, and this was so cute, the little girl came to me and challenged me to kiss her teacher, Marta on the lips in front of the whole school it our marriage was real.</p>
<p>How does one escape such a predicament? I explained to the young girl that I had too much respect for Marta to be kissing on her in front of the whole school. I further explained that it would be “highly” inappropriate. I was trying to plant some seeds and food for thought for when she hits the teen years.</p>
<p>Later, with the older children (16-18 years) I was approached by a young woman who demanded to know why I had learned Spanish. Her question seemed to be more of a statement as to “why anyone who didn’t have to learn to speak Spanish would learn.”</p>
<p>I let her know that North America borders a Spanish Speaking country and that below that country are millions upon millions of people who speak the Spanish language and that it only made since to me that learning the language would be beneficial to me. She responded with, “I Love your answer!”</p>
<p>After my first performance, there was food bought in for me. After my third performance, it was lunch time. When I completed the day one of the teachers took me to a local eatery to try a few small traditional dishes. Once we finished there we went to a grocery store where I ate one of the most decadent  mixtures ever concocted. It was called a “Salpicon” and it was a mixture of several fruits and ice at the bottom that caught the juices of the fruits. Each level of this drink/dish/slushy offered a new experience.</p>
<p>We made a list of all the things we ate today just to see what it would look like. Here’s the list: Avena, Chontaduro , Cholado, Champus, Aborrajado, Banuelo, Marranitas , Lulada, Pandebono…</p>
<p>The list is not complete because I was too ashamed to say what I ate during lunch. It was experimental. Let’s just say I won’t be eating it again.</p>
<p>The children and young adults of the school were so receptive and engaging that I almost forgot I was at a school. There is a farm on the campus! Yes a farm!</p>
<p>Ok, I know I’m rambling but I want to get some of this stuff out. Blogs don’t have to be perfect right?</p>
<p>Oh! Something I did not want to forget. This is an interesting side note about many schools here in Colombia. Many of the classrooms in the school only have 3 walls. Where there would be a fourth wall is open to nature. Imagine that! Year round your classroom is open to nature. I’ve asked before and I continue to get the same answer, which is, “It does not get cold here.” I was at one school when it began to rain. It was such a beautiful sight standing in 2<sup>nd</sup> grade classroom while it was raining and the children were just busy doing their work. It was just another typical day for them, rain pouring only a few feet away from their desks.</p>
<p>Oh! There was one incident during one of my performances, it was actually after, where I challenged a young woman (about 16 or 17) to Salsa with me. She did not hesitate! She got out of here chair from the audience, walked up to me and began following my lead. It was awesome!!!!!</p>
<p>I have found that most women here are willing to dance at the drop of a hat, literally. I’m sure there are some who will not but I have not crossed paths with them.</p>
<p>Well I should be giving more details about the performances and the food but I’m tired. I’m going to bed. I’ll let you all know how the weekend goes here in the beautiful, tropical Cali Colombia.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0288.jpg" rel="lightbox[1607]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1608" title="IMG_0288" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0288.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Yesterday I visited a school here in Santiago de Cali that is about 50 years old. My first session was with 16 and 17 year olds. Mornings are usually a rough start for performers at most schools and I’m no exception. The first group, early in the morning is often still feeling the effects of “sleepy-head.”  The juniors and seniors were great. They bought in early and stayed with me throughout the entire session. I’ve chosen to go a different route than I had planned initially when thinking of visiting Colombia.</p>
<p>Initially I had planned on simply entertaining with stories, a little music and giving students here in Colombia an overview of what I do. After encountering the first few upper grade classes a few weeks ago, I decided to alter my approach. I found the youth, not only engaging, but extremely perceptive as well. I chose to blend an informative presentation about the depth of storytelling with a few interactive, entertaining tales.</p>
<p>I know when my audience is grasping the meaning of what I am attempting to convey. It is one of the underused principles of antiphony (call/response). Artists typically use antiphony as a tool for engaging. That is only one level of the it, another involves measuring the responses of your listeners. There are a ton of measurement tools I employ when performing but I think I’m digressing into workshop mode here. I apologize.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was able to delve into some very abstract concepts such as subliminal influence and targeted marketing. The response of the teens has been overwhelming. Not only are they able to assimilate the information, but they are contributing to the conversation as well. I am actually having meaningful dialogue with teens (something a number of highly-influential academics had deemed impossible). I love doing the impossible.</p>
<p>Oh, an aside…. Do you know that every school I have visited has its meals prepared onsite? The cooks are actually cooking. I know this might sound trivial to most of you but if you’ve visited many schools in the U.S. then you know why I’m bringing this issue up.  I don’t want anyone to think that we don’t have schools in the U.S. that prepare wonderful meals, that is not what I’m saying. Let me give you an example. I sat down at a table of the one of the schools and the headmaster’s wife came over and asked me if I was enjoying the food. It turned out that she and the children of the school maintain an actually garden on the campus. This is where the vegetables on my plate came from. She was proud to tell me that “no” pesticides were used. I found out that this practice is common in a number of schools here in Colombia.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if our children had to maintain gardens on their campuses? Wow! Just a thought but what educational value could digging one’s hands into the soil, measuring sun/water consumption, etc.? Hmmmm… just a thought.</p>
<p>I know I’m all over the place here but I thought I should write something. I didn’t want to get anymore emails asking, “Hey what’s going on, why haven’t you written anything in 2 days?”</p>
<p>Well, I’ve got a school to get to in about an hour. Our host has invited us to dinner this evening and I am really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Oh! One more thing! I just remembered something. I keep having these amazing conversations with educators here. I should be blogging more about those interactions but there is so much going on that there are obviously going to be things I miss. Here’s an example: A week ago I met a colleague of Howard Gardner’s who sat in on my session with a group of teens and critiqued my presentation. It was awesome. Yesterday I conversed extensively with a teacher who has interests in Rudolph Steiner’s theories on education. Who knew? I come to Colombia and am inundated to wonderful, meaningful exchanges that feed me on so many levels.</p>
<p>I know, I know… all over the map I am but this is a blog not a dissertation. Right?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0205.jpg" rel="lightbox[1603]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1604" title="chicken feet" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0205.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a>Hey! Alright&#8230; I&#8217;m not actually in Bogota now, I flew to Cali last night but I like the title of the running blog so I&#8217;m keeping it. I&#8217;ll be back in Bogota in another week anyway.</p>
<p>I had to get this written down though. My tour manager Pablo and I arrived last night in Cali and went straight to our hotel. Pablo is so cool he asked if I were hungry or needed anything before we got settled. I had a ton of preparation to do before my performance the next morning so he got the front desk to order &#8220;delivered meals&#8221; for us. I wanted to keep it simple so soup and maybe some juice would work fine.</p>
<p>Pablo juggled phone calls, paper work, food ordering and doing all he could to make me feel comfortable. I respect and appreciate people who go above and beyond the call of duty and so I try not to add to their stress by making unnecessary demands on their time.</p>
<p>So&#8230; our food arrives via delivery to the room of our hotel. We sit down to share our first meal together and I open my container of soup. &#8220;Ahhhhh,&#8221; I think to myself as I swirl my spoon around in the piping hot, tasting-smelling broth, &#8220;there are dumplings in this soup. What a pleasant surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon further inspection, actually trying to get one of them onto small spoon, I discover that what I thought were dumplings were actually little feet.</p>
<p>FEET! FEET? Yes, FEET!</p>
<p>There were two feet in my soup. Now I&#8217;ve heard of discovering foreign objects in soup, you know, flys, creepy crawlers, kitchen utensils, etc.</p>
<p>But FEET!</p>
<p>Pablo&#8217;s soup did not contain any feet. Why did mine? Well&#8230; apparently, and I&#8217;m still exploring the culture here, but apparently I was the &#8220;Lucky&#8221; one. <strong>&#8220;Chicken Feet&#8221;</strong> in soup is considered a delicacy for some people here in Colombia. Not &#8220;all&#8221; Colombians&#8230; some. I&#8217;ve had several of my new  found friends here in Colombia already write me and let me know that they, in no uncertain terms, &#8220;DO NOT EAT FEET.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well my adventures in Cali have started off on the right foot (I know&#8230; horrible but I couldn&#8217;t resist).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m off this morning to another school. I&#8217;ll keep updating this blog because there are so many interesting things happening that it would be a shame not to.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bogota-blog-6.jpg" rel="lightbox[1598]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1600" title="La Dispensa de Yerba Buena por Ricardo Gomez Campuzano" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bogota-blog-6.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="362" /></a>I’m getting ready to board a flight to go to the City of Santiago de Cali, which is approximately 300 km south-west of Bogota. I’ll be touring schools in that city for a week before returning back to Bogota to finish up with a final week of schools there.</p>
<p>I’ve been in Colombia for a little over two weeks now and my love for the land is continuing to grow exponentially. I don’t want anyone to think that I lack a grasp on reality or that I’m unable to discern the social/political issues that plague “all” societies. I am more than capable but, you see, I spend the majority of my time with the average man and woman, not politicians or captains of industry. I think the perceptions you gain from visiting other lands has a lot to do with what you bring with you, your mindset.</p>
<p>There is a story I love to tell that involves two men traveling towards each other’s respective locations of origin. The two men never meet but, somewhere in an oasis in the desert each encounters a wise old man whom they question as to the type of people they will encounter in the land that they are traveling to. One travel is bitter and filled with angst and says that the people he left behind were ignorant, liars and thieves of the worst kind. The other traveler’s disposition is much brighter and he is believes the people he left behind were the kindest, gentlest souls. The old man tells them, individually as they encounter him at separate times, that they will discover the same type of personalities in the land that they are traveling to. A bystander happened to overhear each of the conversations of the old man and the travelers and inquires why he would dispense such contradictory advice. The old man explains that every man encounters, no matter where he travels, the substance of his own heart.</p>
<p>I would like to think that my encounters with the people of Colombia that I’ve met have something to do with my respect and appreciation for the cultures of others. I would like to think that.</p>
<p>One of the huge contrasts that I can draw between my work here in Colombia and my work back in the U.S. is that; when I complete a performance or workshop in the U.S., that is it, it is ended. The participants usually have their own lives to return to and their own busyness that keeps them occupied. Here in Bogota, when I finish at a school or workshop, the participants desire to extend the relationship to one of greater depth. I am getting invitations to dinner from children’s parents, offers to hang out, as well as offers to be driven around Bogota and the outlying areas so that I may see more of the land and people. People offering to cook traditional meals and cab drivers buying me lunch have been a few encounters that I will not soon forget. Can you imagine a New York cabbie offering to buy you lunch in welcoming you to New York?</p>
<p>Let me get back to the issue of reality and perception. Have I encountered idiots? Yes! They are ubiquitous in this world and no one society or culture has cornered the market on having them. Let me ask you a question. If I cross the paths of two idiots out of one hundred people then why would I spend time writing to you all about the idiots?</p>
<p>I’m finishing up a wonderful piece of fruit called a “Granadilla” as I type this. Just the vast array of fruits alone was worth the trip. Colombia should be famous for it’s’ fruit more than anything else. Although I am missing being back home, I am savoring every second of this experience. I know that I will miss the people who’ve embraced me with open hearts and open minds.</p>
<p>Well, let me get to my flight. I appreciate the messages and feedback that I’m getting from some of you. It helps me feel still connected to home.</p>
<p>Adios mis amigos!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Tarsicio_3.jpg" rel="lightbox[1584]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1590" title="Tarsicio_3" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Tarsicio_3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="304" /></a>As soon as I returned to my apartment here in Candelaria I had to sit down and write about my experience today. I had one of the most unbelievable experiences in my career today. I took a cab to a school called San Tarsicio here in Bogota early this morning and when I arrived there were children off-loading from a bus.</p>
<p>I heard cheers and yells of, “Es Baba, Baba esta aqui, Mire&#8230;es Baba! (It’s Baba, Baba is here, Look its Baba!) from all over the campus. It was unsettling at first because I couldn’t believe they were yelling for me. The children followed me to the office in Pied-Piper fashion and filled the small space to its capacity. There were children filling the office, standing outside of the doorway, in the windows pressing their faces against the glass. It was surreal. My mind was having issues trying to wrap itself around a clear understanding of what was going on.</p>
<p>My contact, a woman named Roxanna, entered the office not too long after me with the brightest most cheerful smile a person could possess. She grabbed me and hugged me like we were friends who had been separated by distance and time. I literally melted under the adoration, praise and affection of my surroundings, and… I HADN’T EVEN PERFORMED YET!</p>
<p>The children formed themselves in to a line from the office to outside of the office doors and down a long hallway in order to get autographs from me. I’m definitely not in Kansas, I’m in Colombia! I signed autographs, answered questions, shook hands and hugged, at least, 30 to 40 people before the bell rang and the children had to go to class.  The children had to be forced to go to class. It was jaw dropping to watch.</p>
<p>I hadn’t even performed yet!</p>
<p>I wasn’t prepared for what would happen when Roxanna escorted me to the auditorium. The entire auditorium was decorated with images of me, greetings and signs from children, posters with quotes from some of my writings and stories. I stood in the aisle of the auditorium and just shook my head. I, a storyteller, was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>I asked Roxanna how all of this came about and she explained how the staff, teachers and students had all visited my website, watched my videos on YouTube and did as much research on me as they could. Roxanna explained that the excitement was because of me and my music and stories (my head still unable to fathom the depth of what was happening to me).</p>
<p>I savored every second of the warmth this school was giving me. They made me want to give them the best I had to offer, and I sincerely hope they felt that I did.</p>
<p>I had four performances during the day. The first performance was for children ages 6, 7 and 8. That performance went really well as I attempted to navigate their language and apprehension skills with methods gained from working with “Dual-Immersion” schools in Southern California. The second session was with students who were 9, 10 and 11 years old.</p>
<p>Prior to the second session I was approached by two kindergarten teachers who explained that their children had not been made a part of the schedule due to funding.</p>
<p>Ya’ll know me right?</p>
<p>Well, I had a break at 11:30 am for about half an hour between sessions. I told the kindergarten teachers to return at 11:30 and bring their children and I would do something special for them.</p>
<p>Hey, it’s my break and I can do what I want with it! Right?</p>
<p>Anyway, the kindergarten teachers return with about 40 to 50 students (none of them spoke any English). I had them sit around me in a semi-circle where I could make eye contact with each and every one of them. I sat on the floor with them at their eye level and began talking to them “rhythmically” in Spanish. I taught the 4 and 5 year olds a song and played my Kora while we sang together. They were an eager and extremely attentive group of 4 and 5 year olds. I mixed a simple tale into the middle of our singing, chanting and call/response. I allowed one of them to close the tale out with his suggestion of its ending. It was a great success! Those children were hugging and thanking me as they exited the auditorium. That was such a magical moment for me that words will never do it justice. To look into the eyes of 40 to 50 kindergarteners and not feel a second of inattentiveness is miraculous.</p>
<p>Since it was an all boy’s school, I shared stories of development, decision making and manhood. With the older group I even delved into the use of storytelling by popular media to affect their choices (or what they had believed to be their choices before I finished with them).</p>
<p>At every corner I turned at San Tarsicio I was greeted with smiles and open arms. By the end of the day I felt energized, not tired from presenting. The staff and students at San Tarsicio definitely gave me more than I could possibly ever return to them.  One of the students even created a video to commemorate my trip to Colombia and their school.</p>
<p>If I am to truly show my gratitude and appreciation for the level of hospitality that they demonstrated then I will need to continue writing for the next couple of days non-stop. I hope that I’ve conveyed my appreciation effectively because these are children that I never wish to disappoint.</p>
<p>Thank you staff and students of San Tarsicio you are an absolutely amazing group of people!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/IMG_1846.jpg" rel="lightbox[1580]"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1581" title="IMG_1846" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/IMG_1846-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>I’m exhausted. I’ve been up since 4:30 this morning and did four back to back sessions of music and stories at an all girls school called Gimnasio Feminino. The most amazing part of the day was presenting to a gathering of more than 300 sophomores, juniors and seniors.</p>
<p>I was having so much fun that I forgot I was the one performing. I don’t know if I’ve ever been in the presence of such well-mannered, warm-hearted teens. I think I’ve been hugged more today than I have been my entire life. Although it wasn’t a part of the performance, at one point, a young girl named Tatiana got up and Salsa’d with me in front of the entire student body. It was awesome!</p>
<p>There was another young woman name Valentina who asked me, following the show, if I had ever eaten an “Empanada?” I might be spelling it wrong but hey. When I told her that I hadn’t, she raced out of the room with a friend of hers. 10 minutes later she came sprinting back into the room holding an “Empanada” high in the air and yelling, “Baba I have an empanada for you!” The poor child was out of breath and seemed near the point of collapsing. I sat her down in a seat next to me and she handed me the Empanada. “Please eat this, it is soooo good, you will love it!” she said to me.</p>
<p>There were a crowd of girls gathered around us, about 25-30. Flashes on cameras and camera phones went off as I tasted my very first Empanada. Valentina began explaining to me how food is such an integral part of Colombian culture and that she felt it her duty to have me taste the delicacy that is an Empanada.</p>
<p>I have to say it was delicious! I enjoyed every last bite of it but, my only regret, are the images of me gorging myself on it that are sure to resurface somewhere (maybe facebook).</p>
<p>I am thoroughly enjoying this experience and learning so much. I am finding it very easy to blend in with many of the cultural norms of Colombia.</p>
<p>As I am writing this there is loud thunder and rain pouring down violently. I love it! I really am loving this!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Bogota_02_1.jpg" rel="lightbox[1577]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1578" title="Baba with students in Bogota" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Bogota_02_1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a>I know, I know. I had promised to blog more often about this experience of touring schools in Colombia as a storyteller, but the rich and deep social exchanges here in Bogota are impediments to the isolation needed in order to write. The daily decisions are difficult: Dance in the streets and eat wonderful meals with new found friends or sit in my apartment and write a blog. Hmm….</p>
<p>Which would you choose?</p>
<p>Well I feel like I owe it to those of you who’ve supported me over the years to remain committed to the blog, but I know you’ll forgive me if I happen to get caught up in enjoying the distraction that is Colombian Culture.</p>
<p>I completed my first week of touring schools last week. I’m doing four shows a day, five days a week. It is amazing how receptive the students are and how gentle their demeanors tend to be. At one school earlier in the week the young girls surrounded my taxi and tried to stop me from leaving. I’ve been offered food, drink and small gifts if I would just stay a while longer at some of the schools. Actions like these by children and adults who are genuinely engaged are an affirmation beyond measure.</p>
<p>I went to another school the following day and the young men and women exhibited a level of maturity and understanding that seemed much older than their years. The coordinator of activities at the school stopped me following my performance to have a talk and wanted a promise that I would return to their school next year. She had witnessed both my performance with the young children (K-4) and then my session with the young adults (10<sup>th</sup> – 12<sup>th</sup> grade).  She provided me with extremely positive feedback regarding my ability to fluidly move between such divergent developmental levels.</p>
<p>Storytelling sessions with older, young adults (i.e. 16, 17 and 18 years of age) are not anything like what I do for the younger children. For the young adults the sessions are more like conversations where I drop in a small anecdote (story), parable or proverb here and there. There is a flow and rhythm to these conversations that I love.  I treat the students as adults, as equals. I let them know that I have as much to learn from them as they might think they can learn from me.</p>
<p>During one conversation a young woman of about 17 years of age expressed her disappointment on a recent vacation that she and her family had taken to the United States. Her English fluency was phenomenal and much better than the rest of her family so she ended up acting as the interpreter for everyone. As she spoke of the negative stereotypes she and her family suffered because they were from Colombia, her face saddened.  Her countenance was altered from that of a wide-eyed, smiling teen, enjoying my anecdotes and jokes to a more mature, despondent look. I listened to her story of harassment, discrimination and prejudice and felt my heart sicken.</p>
<p>A spontaneous, “I am so sorry for what you and your family suffered,” came from my mouth.</p>
<p>The young girl hugged me and said a thank you that I felt deep inside of myself.</p>
<p>I can’t help but to reflect on the ability of the loud voices of ignorance to drown out reason and compassion sometimes. I knew of the stereotypes associated with Colombia prior to coming here; in fact I had been warned by several friends and family members not to venture here. If I allowed ignorance to rule my decision-making I would not be where I am today; a success as I define it, not as others choose to define it for me.</p>
<p>That young woman and her friends may very well be the future leaders of nations such as Colombia some day.  How will United States citizens be perceived by future generations beyond our borders due to an export of ignorance and irrational fears?</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to inject politics into the wonderful experience that I am having but I guess there are many dimensions to storytelling. Aren’t there?</p>

While walking through the city of Bogota I kept encountering elderly women (maybe late 70&#8242;s or early 80&#8242;s) doing some amazing stuff. While in the national park I was in awe of an elderly women jumping rope with some young kids. When she finished she didn&#8217;t need to sit down. She strolled away as though she hadn&#8217;t even exerted herself.</p>
<p>Later in the day I passed an elderly woman playing soccer with, what could have been, either her grand children or great grand children. She sprinted up and down a street with a steeper slope than any I&#8217;ve seen in San Francisco and gave the boys a run for their money while laughing at them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to start drinking Colombia&#8217;s water today!</p>

<p>I just wanted to take a second and share an experience I had in a restaurant in the barrio of Candalaria. The restaurant is called &#8220;Pimienta y Cafe&#8221; (Pepper and Coffee). The owners name is Myriam and she is one of the sweetest women. We spent time talking after the most amazing meal of traditional Colombian dishes. There was one dish of mushrooms sauteed in white wine, garlic, a hint of pepper and some kind of sweet, creamy cheese that I&#8217;ve never heard of before. It was delicioso!</p>
<p>While we were talking her grandson, Juan Felipe, entered the room and grabbed his grandmother around the waste as though he were returning from an extended journey. After I pulled it together realizing that this woman was a grandmother (she looks like she could be in her mid to late 30&#8242;s), I conversed with Juan Felipe. He was so much fun. Myriam disappeared for a few minutes and returned with a slice of cheese cake prepared by her husband. I began to see that this trip was going to be one long violation of my gastro-intestinal fortitude.</p>
<p>Myriam doted on her husband, Francisco. He is a merchant marine who is constantly traveling the world. While traveling in Europe he took cooking courses and learned the art of French Pastry. It was his cheese cake that I was voraciously devouring. No cake is supposed to be that good! I don&#8217;t even eat cheese cake. Well, I guess I do now.</p>
<p>She brought her husband in to meet me and before I knew it, I had a new best friend. Francisco invited me onto the roof of the restaurant, which doubles as their home. From their rooftop is an breath taking view of the entire city of  Bogota. Francisco and I talked for quite some time and he even had his grandson Juan Felipe play piano for me.</p>
<p>I live such an enchanted existence and I never want to take it for granted. This is only my second day in Bogota and the magic seems incessant.</p>

<p>I was in a restaurant leaving the salad bar and returning to my table. I ended up behind a few other people who were walking up a narrow aisle towards some stairs so I had to patiently wait my chance behind them.</p>
<p>While waiting, patiently I might add, I was standing next to a family seated at a table dining. There were two women, a mother and grandmother if I had to guess and I would never attempt to discern who was which aloud. With maturity comes wisdom. Seated with the two women was a young boy about 5 or 6 years of age.</p>
<p>Anyway… I’m standing next to their table waiting my turn to ascend the steps when the elder of the two women points at me and says aloud to the little boy, “Look at that big muscular guy, he’s eating salad!”</p>
<p>Ladies you want to make a man blush, that’s how ya do it.</p>
<p>I looked over at the child and he had one of those “in-deep-reflective-thought” expressions on his face, as he curiously examined me from head to toe.</p>
<p>He quickly turned to the elder woman and said, “Ok I’ll try some!”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/choc.jpg" rel="lightbox[1536]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1537" title="choc" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/choc.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a>Yesterday I had the privilege of being permitted to share music and stories with several children at Children’s Hospital of Orange County (CHOC).</p>
<p>To say that CHOC is an incredible institution would be a massive understatement. This hospital far surpasses its stated mission to nurture, advance and protect the health and well being of children.</p>
<p>When people ask what it is that I do, I like telling them, “Words are my work, communication my craft and being of service, my life.” Visiting with the children of CHOC challenged me to live the spirit of my words.</p>
<p>I spent two hours at the hospital. During the first hour I was situated in a playroom. Whenever I enter a room my first thoughts are always to change it to fit my needs. Besides altering the ambiance of a given setting with music and tales, I also believe that artists should transform the appearance of their environment as much as possible. With the permission of the staff I began moving tables out of the way as they would have been barriers between the children and I.  I started placing chairs closer to where I would be sitting. One of the assistants was even so kind as to entertain my request for mats and blankets to put on the floor. I loved lying on the floor as a child and reading or listening to stories. Alright… truth be told, I still love doing this but don’t tell anybody ok?</p>
<p>Something beautiful that warmed my heart immediately were the outward, unabashed expressions of affection shared between the patients and their visiting brothers and sisters. This filled the playroom with an inspirational and emotional energy that fed my desire to give the best of myself.</p>
<p>I started out by explaining the importance of my being able to look into their eyes and their looking back into mine. I do this with children and adults everywhere when I go to tell tales. The intensity of emotion and maturity in the eyes of these children was so much more profound than I typically experience in my visits with children in classrooms and schools. There was a depth of experience in the eyes of these children that went beyond the years of their physical appearances.</p>
<p>One of the lessons that I’ve carried with me over these years as a wandering tale telling man has been that people desire to be seen for who they and not judged on appearances. It took a tremendous amount of focus to displace my innate parental desires to hug and hold each of these children and try to become their storyteller, but I managed.</p>
<p>I taught them to sing in the West African language of Bambara. I shared with them fantastic tales of courage and ingenuity. We laughed together and even shared our thoughts.</p>
<p>One child in a wheel chair was saddened and very apologetic when the machines attached to his portable i.v. Stand started beeping during the storytelling. I let him know that the beeping was nothing compared to the loud mooing of cows and bleating goats that sing out in Africa when I’m telling stories. I watched his discomfort dissipate as a huge smile grew across his face.</p>
<p>I spent an hour with the children in the playroom and then went to go visit the rooms of those who were unable to leave their beds. From one room to the next I encountered children of different ages. I was in the room of a very playful 7-year-old one-minute sharing stories of a cowardly lion and then in the room of a teenage girl 15 minutes later telling her tales of comedic love with a backdrop of Justin Beiber posters behind me.</p>
<p>My most memorable session was with a boy about 11 years old who was lying on his side in his bed looking at me through the railings. I went and got a chair and sat myself at his eye level only a few feet away and began playing my harp and sharing a very funny story with him. I know what 11-year-old boys like; I used to be one. He compensated me continually throughout the story with bright smiles that would appear and then disappear back into a face of sadness.  The reward came in the form of muffled, but unrestrained laughter that he couldn’t hold in at the stories conclusion.</p>
<p>At each bedside I promised the children that I would return the next day. Well today has arrived and I am preparing to leave for Children’s Hospital once again. My only hope is that I can give as much to the children today as they gave me yesterday.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" rel="lightbox[994]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-834" title="blog-face" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a>In 1979 I had major conflict with a teacher who turned my world upside down inside out. Although I played sports almost all of my academic life, I was also passionate about forensics, or what later became known as speech class (i.e. oratory, debate, etc.)</p>
<p>This was one of those pivotal moments in life where you can mark a change in yourself as a human being.</p>
<p>My overly competitive nature spilled over from my athletic training and into all other aspects of my life. When it came time to deliver oratory, debate or engage in persuasive speaking I was always attempting to out shine my classmates. I didn’t say my attitude at the time was healthy but, then again, healthy attitudes weren’t what kept you off of your back on the football field.</p>
<p>In 1979 the Equal Rights Amendment was a very hot button issue. Our speech class teacher let us know that we would be debating the ERA the following week and that we needed to come prepared. I was excited because it would be another opportunity for me to “wipe-the-proverbial-floor” with whomever I would be debating against. Once again, I was young, competitive and, yes, very arrogant.</p>
<p>Having been reared by a single mother I was very familiar with the issues the ERA was seeking to address and, because of my mother, I was also exceedingly passionate about this historic amendment. I labored over my preparations for this debate more than I had any other. I had witnessed my mother suffer, first hand, not only the disparity in rights and compensation but innumerable indignities as well attempting to make a life for us in male dominated work environments.</p>
<p>I showed up to class armed with a battalion of information and a passion unequaled by any of my classmates.</p>
<p>Our teacher sat us down and gave us the usual instructions. She then pointed at me and said, “You will be arguing “against” the ERA.”</p>
<p>“What!” I screamed and I must have yelled pretty loud because the room got deathly silent.</p>
<p>Up to that point she had always permitted us to choose the stance we would argue from and I had always chosen to argue from the point of view that I agreed with. This wasn’t fair! I wasn’t going to argue against the ERA, it wasn’t in my makeup to argue against it. My sincere pleas not to have to argue a side of an argument, that I was morally against, held no weight with her. She repeated her instructions and divided the class into teams. Of course she had me lead the “against the ERA” team.</p>
<p>She gave us time to formulate our arguments and assemble our facts. I have to say that this was one of the hardest things I have ever done in my life. Words and ideas that countered my own philosophy literally choked in my throat and made my heart ache. There were a few times when my team was discussing our possible counter points that I felt angry and wanted to storm out of the room. Athletics had taught me something about being a team player and I had to set my own issues aside because, after all, I was the captain of this team.</p>
<p>When it came time to debate I made sincere attempts at rising to the occasion but fell short. Our opponents were “wiping-the-floor” with us and, as team leader, I had to accept responsibility for our poor showing. I was at an age where losing hurt and hurt badly.<br />
It was painful to listen to the opposing team articulate sentiments and facts that resonated so deeply with me and then have to counter with dissonant ideations that damn near brought me to tears.</p>
<p>That day I left the classroom feeling like an absolute failure. I left feeling like I had betrayed myself morally. I was young, very young and these feelings were new and discomforting.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks our teacher led us down a path of self-discovery that I will never forget. The importance of being the type of human being that is capable of viewing an issue from multiple angles is a key to developing a healthy worldview. If I had not been forced to experience the pain of that debate I know that many of the opportunities that I have received in this life would have passed me up. Being forced to view life through the eyes of another was not easy for me in my youth and I now see it is almost impossible for many adults today.</p>
<p>When I reflect on this teacher, I think about how she helped to alter the way I see and think about the world we live in. What she gave me was not part of any “core curricula” or “standard” at the time. I know that this woman saw us more as developing human beings than as mere students.</p>
<p>I see the level of intolerance today as symptomatic of narrow-mindedness and childish arrogance possessed by those whose social and intellectual development remains stagnate. I’m not sure what type of an adult I would have been had I not had this woman in my life to challenge my assumptions but I know that I am better for having known her.</p>
<p>I shutter to think how many brilliant people like this are being threatened with pink slips and lay off notices today as we devalue the role of teachers and education. What type of adults will our children be tomorrow if they are not touched by adults like this today?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/healthy-hands.jpg" rel="lightbox[980]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-981" title="healthy-hands" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/healthy-hands.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>I got a call last week that one of my elders had been hospitalized. Word throughout the community was that he had suffered a stroke and survived, unable to move, trapped in his home for 2 days before finding the strength to crawl outside where he was discovered.</p>
<p>As if the tale of his miraculous survival wasn&#8217;t enough, I witnessed, first hand, his struggle to achieve a healthy equilibrium between mind and body in one of the most unhealthy places I&#8217;ve ever experienced. The hospital.</p>
<p>I was called and immediately knew that I had to go and see him. I wasn&#8217;t reared to believe that there is actually a choice in matters such as these. I packed my Kora and a few essentials and headed out for the hour and a half drive from Los Angeles up to Ventura.</p>
<p>Once I arrived to the hospital I gathered my things and tried to head straight to his room. There was a problem. Of course there was a problem. What would life be if we didn&#8217;t complicate the simple? For some reason, and I don&#8217;t know if this happens to any of you out there or not, but&#8230; for some reason whenever I enter an institution such as a hospital I end up with an armed security guard escort. This day was no different. It could be the bright, colorful African attire that attracts attention or possibly my Kora (ancient 21-string African gourd harp), I&#8217;m not sure, but 99.9% of the time I usually end up with an armed security escort after being required to answer a few questions.</p>
<p>When I finally made it to his room, our eyes immediately locked and we both smiled. I noticed his smile extended from both corners of his mouth. I had been told that the entire right side of his body had been paralyzed. His sisters were sitting around his bed and he introduced me to them. I took out my Kora, strapped it on and began playing and singing. I alternated my playing and singing with a little conversation. We reminisced on some of the drum lessons he had given me more than 12 years ago. We talked about others who were no longer with us and we laughed about shared experiences during our times performing together.</p>
<p>I noticed he was moving his right leg quite a bit and even wiggling his fingers. I grew up watching my grandmother care for the elderly. I struggled to recall having ever seen someone, who had suffered a stroke, do what he was doing with the side of his body that was supposedly paralyzed.<br />
While I played my harp and sang, I felt compelled to ask him about the stroke. He vehemently denied having had one and let me know that they were trying to convince him otherwise. He was adamant that he knew the state and condition of his own body.</p>
<p>I am not one to denigrate the medical profession, I know how valuable nurses and doctors can be but when a man is raising his right leg up in the air and stretching his hands and fingers might there be some validity to his claims?</p>
<p>I played for a few hours and conversed. As I was about to leave he motioned for me to move closer to his bed and he whispered in my ear, &#8220;I need you to come back tonight and play your Kora so that I can sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>The requests of our elders are not to be denied. I assured him that I would remain in the city and return early that evening to play for him.</p>
<p>This is a man who &#8220;never&#8221; asks anyone for anything so for him to request that I return was tantamount to the mountain coming to Mohammed.</p>
<p>After getting a little something to eat, I returned to the hospital. When I entered his room, we picked up where we had left off. I played, sang and told a few tales between our conversations. I knew that eventually I would need to get to a point where we were focusing on lulling him into sleep but that was hours away.</p>
<p>One of the issues I noticed that was going to be difficult to deal with was the rhythm of the hospital. Actually, I should say its lack of rhythm. There were people screaming in agony from distant rooms, loud, boisterous conversations in the halls, machines whirling and intercoms constantly going off with shrill voices making demands across the entire hospital. To add to the chaos, my elder was in a shared room with a man who seemed possessed by some sort of extreme discontent. The man was dropping and throwing things around in his room, knocking over water pitchers set out for him and constantly pushing beeping buttons and calling for nurses.</p>
<p>I have to admit that each of the nurses that responded to this man&#8217;s agitation did so in a calm, tranquil manner.</p>
<p>The disturbed man kept up his antics, even amplifying them, as the evening progressed. I adjusted my playing to more serene, gentle rhythms and increased the repetition as a means of soothing my listeners. The power of resonance to relieve the body of its stresses is well documented. In many other cultures throughout the world the bones of the body are not viewed simply as aspects of biology but as natural resonators of frequency. I chose a portion of the song that had humming in it and solicited my elder to join me in the wordless chant. As I played my harp we hummed in rhythm together.<br />
As it got later and later the external disturbances increased. We continued our murmured chants as I played my Kora. The distractions seemed to get to him. It felt odd reminding him of lessons he had taught me so many years ago about tuning out noise and centering the mind. He smiled at my hesitation in trying to navigate returning lessons he had given me back to him.</p>
<p>The noisy neighbor, hallway chaos and loud disturbances continued past visiting hours at 9 pm. I was supposed to have left by then but since no one on the staff was bothering me I continued playing and humming beside him. It seemed each time we achieved a state of total relaxation, some disturbance would disrupt his peace. How unhealthy can a hospital get?</p>
<p>We talked about many of the lessons I had received from him on focusing and pushing away extraneous noise from the mind. He let me know that sometimes students bring lessons back home to their teacher. Teachers must be reminded as well.</p>
<p>Each time he was awakened, we would converse a bit. I never stopped playing my harp while we talked. Once we had conversed for a few minutes we returned to our humming together.</p>
<p>I watched him settle into a very peaceful place within himself as the chaos continued. It felt good to reach a point where he seemed totally unaffected by the things occurring around him. He laid there in silence and I played for him as his humming trailed off. I lowered the tones of my Kora and humming incrementally over the period of an hour or so until they were barely audible. The noise around us was filled with insanity, and this was late into the evening but he remained unaffected. I thought he was in a deep state of meditation until I heard the unmistakable sounds of sleep. He was asleep and sleeping deeply. I felt good as I brought the barely audible humming and harp playing to a close.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until I stopped that my hands cramped up but I didn&#8217;t care. To hear him sleeping was a gift unlike any other.</p>

</strong>by Baba the Storyteller<strong></strong></p>
<p>I had an interesting storytelling gig last night, one that I will not soon forget. I was called to tell tales at a late-night, old school back yard party. Well…old school for some anyway. The music alternated between the gentle crooning of Frankie Beverly and Maze to the hard thumping beats of DMX with the Rough Riders.</p>
<p><em>“stop, drop, shut’em down open up shop…”</em></p>
<p>Sorry I got a little distracted. The Hennessey and Sutter Home (those are alcoholic beverages for you non-drinkers out there) was flowing as freely as was the conversation and food. It was a very relaxed, <em>you-are-family-when-you-walk-in-the-door</em> type setting. My host reserved one of the rooms in his home for me to gather myself and prepare for the performance. Venues usually set aside a spot for me so this wasn’t unusual. The difference here was that I kept getting a little side tracked in my preparations because the DJ started playing some Parliament Funkadelic. I don’t know about ya’ll but there is something about Parliament Funkadelic that just won’t allow me to stay in my seat. It didn’t help my situation any that the DJ had blended several Parliament hits all together into one long, very long, track. I forced myself to escape the <em>Knee Deep Aqua Boogie Motor Booty Affair</em> and refocus. It was difficult but I am a professional so I managed to pull it together. How else can you capture a boogie?</p>
<p>If I’ve lost my Justin Beiber or Engelbert Humperdinck demographic, please be patient and bare with me, I will establish a higher level of universal coherency in a second.</p>
<p>Although I was a stranger to everyone there, they made me feel at home. With the amount of food I was offered, had I accepted, I wouldn’t have had to grocery shop for a week. In the room set-aside for “me,” people were coming and going freely, making conversation and doing their parts to make me feel welcomed. My host, a man named Tony went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable. I was “the entertainment.”</p>
<p>By the time I went out to take my backyard stage, it was almost 10:00 pm. The audience was all adults with maybe a few teens mixed in. The scent of alcohol and cigarettes was everywhere and the crowd was hyped before I even sang a single note. There were extraneous conversations and laughter being shared all over during my opening set but I didn’t mind. I’ve got a zone, a place in my head that I go when I begin performing. It is difficult to describe but somehow, almost magically everyone present is focused within a few seconds and exactly where I need them to be.</p>
<p>Last night was no different. The side conversations and laughter abated within a minute or so of my beginning to play my harp and sing one of my opening songs.</p>
<p>I fused narrative with the sounds of my Kora and singing as well. When I have an audience focused like this, I like to take an opportunity to make as much eye contact as possible. This always serves me well later in the performance.</p>
<p>I was able to teach a simple call and response song in the Bambara language to the crowd and, surprisingly, the most inebriated ended up being the most gifted singers. Their enthusiasm and love of song possessed no barriers. I was loving every second of it! At some points during the performance, “I” felt like “I” was the one being entertained. There was a fulfilling level of reciprocity that existed between us.</p>
<p>Our call and response had the added benefit of bringing everyone back together when a few, inevitably, wandered off the beaten path of my storytelling. If I had shut my eyes, minus the content and setting of my performance of course, my imagination could have transported me back to my younger years in the choir at Marlboro Heights Missionary Baptist Church.</p>
<p>By the time I ended and closed with the final song, I received an ovation that had me grinning ear-to-ear. I couldn’t help wipe the huge, embarrassing grin from my face. I had come to nourish but was leaving a well-nourished soul myself.</p>
<p>My work never lends itself to monotony. I love what I do and I love those for whom I do it. I wouldn’t change a thing about the magical life I live. Yes, my friends, I can indeed dance in the water and not get wet. Storytelling goes with “everything!”</p>
<p>The End</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" rel="lightbox[960]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-834" title="blog-face" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a>It has been 55 years since one of this nation’s most prolific and profound thinkers, James Baldwin, first published his essay “Stranger in the Village”. Baldwin recounted his experiences visiting the remote Swiss village of Leukerbad and being the first Black man many of its inhabitants had ever encountered. Baldwin ingeniously employed the anecdote of his isolation in the tiny village as a platform from which to expound on his thoughts concerning racism, cultural identity, and the social conditions of the United States at the time.</p>
<p>In 2010, I was invited to a festival in the Country of Poland to perform as an artist, professional storyteller and musician. While my experiences in Poland were analogous to Baldwin’s extreme isolation in Switzerland, they ended up being much less discordant. Many of my encounters in Poland awoke dormant memories of words from his essay that I had not reflected on, nor read, in more than 20 years.</p>
<p>My invitation to attend the Festiwal Dzialan Kreatywnych came in the form of emails and a few phone calls from its organizer. He and I had worked together on a festival the previous year in the Warsaw suburb of Konstancin-Jeziorna. For the most part our discussions centered on the typical logistics, itinerary, and performance schedules. Unlike Baldwin’s early warnings from his host that he would be a “sight” for the village, not once did our discussions ever lead us in the direction of race or racism in Poland or what I might expect to encounter while there.</p>
<p>The festival for 2010 was held in the small fishing port and vacation town of Leba. It is a quiet, unassuming town bordering the shores of the Baltic Sea and has a modest population of approximately 4,000. Many of the locals refer to Leba as a village, and that, in many ways is the atmosphere it offers visitors. The streets are narrow and combine residential and commercial in an almost haphazard way. Walking is the preferred mode of transportation throughout the town and almost everything is accessible within a few minutes. It is definitely a Polish vacation spot with all of the trappings offered by any tourist destination in the world: rows and rows of small souvenir shops, fast food eateries around every corner and local artisans selling their wares on the stone-paved sidewalks and in the parks of the town.</p>
<p>Having lived in both New York and Los Angeles, I am always intoxicated by the feel, scent and taste of unpolluted air in other, less congested, areas of the world. The small town of Leba gifted me with an opportunity to inhale and exhale in a powerfully deep manner that I’ve learned never to take for granted.</p>
<p>The festival’s base of operation was the town’s local library, which had as quaint and modest a setting as the town it was surrounded by. There were only 5 computers with Internet access available for public use in the town, four in the library and one in the local bank. Although Leba had the appearance of an isolated village such as described by Baldwin in his essay, the intrusion of technology and mass media, although minimal, led me toward the illusion that my present-day experiences would be much more cosmopolitan than his.</p>
<p>During my stay in Leba I encountered three types of personalities: Those who engaged me socially and intellectually on equal footing; those who seemed to struggle with some form of angst in attempting to engage me and, finally, those whom it appeared had never encountered a Black man before seeing me.</p>
<p>The latter was more amusing than frustrating when considering the impositions of isolation I was experiencing. I hadn’t been in the town but a few hours when I was walking down one of the slender, stone paved sidewalks searching for a store from which to purchase water when I spotted a young boy attempting to walk and stare at me simultaneously. He had to have been about 9 years of age. He was walking hand in hand with a woman, possibly his mother, on the opposing side of the street, which is not saying much since four of his steps across the road could have put us on the same sidewalk. The child could not avert his stare from me and I read the disproportionate curiosity in his eyes to be that he was encountering something extraordinary to his reality. I felt sorry for the child as his fixation on me made him bump head first into an awaiting light pole which, of course, brought on a flood of tears and pain-laden wailing. The counter balance to this child’s intense fascination with me was that I had, only moments before, made eye contact with the woman holding his hand. She had been as congenial in her nod and smile towards me as she might have been with any neighbor she met passing on the street.</p>
<p>Throughout my stay I was in a constant state of reflection. The people, the town, the language and culture were all intriguing. It wasn’t long before I began noticing patterns in behavior of many of the people I encountered. It was interesting to note that those who seemed most unbalanced by my appearance in Leba were either the elderly or very young. The social filters of those two generations seemed to have not been learned or dissipated with age, if they ever existed.</p>
<p>There were times when my experiences can only be described as surreal. It wasn’t as if I were intentionally searching out these incidents in order to verify some sort of hypothesis. I was having ‘stranger in the village’ type encounters continuously simply by engaging in my daily activities.</p>
<p>Early in the festival I was sitting next to an eleven year old child and enjoying a short conversation in broken English, trying with all sincerity, but little success, to answer her questions about American Pop Culture and Justin Beiber when she spontaneously began rubbing my arm.</p>
<p>“Baba,” she asked in a tone reminiscent of my own daughters, “which one of your parents is white…your mom or your dad?”</p>
<p>I wanted to know what would prompt such a question and asked her what made her think that either of my parents was white. In a voice filled with childish innocence, she stated that I did not look like “a black”. This young girl had not experienced the abundance of hues coloring the Continent of Africa. Her reasoning for my lighter complexion was that I had to be of mixed parentage. For me, these types of encounters are “teaching moments,” opportunities to enlighten or be illuminated by another. I explained the diversity of populations in Africa. She was as enthusiastic a learner as I was a teacher. Awareness of my isolation in Leba was, momentarily, replaced by a feeling of contentedness, a sense that I was serving, even if on a minuscule level, part of my purpose as an artist for being there.</p>
<p>These gentle moments of respite were sometimes disrupted by other experiences not as tender but equally important. Although most people I met in Leba were exceedingly pleasant, there were, as could be expected, hiccups in decorum that drew me back into Baldwin’s tiny Swiss village and the feeling of being a stranger. During a very friendly conversation with an exceptionally amiable man of about 35 years of age or so, he, in as innocent a fashion as anyone could possibly imagine dropped the distinct two syllable utterance “Nigger” in the middle of a phrase as he was speaking to me. His facial expression, one of both joy and adoration, was totally in opposition to the horrendous word that fell from his lips. He continued speaking and smiling at me with an irrepressible glow in his eyes; delighted to be sharing space and time and, to a greater degree, holding himself in deference for what he continually reminded me was the wealth of wisdom he thought I possessed.</p>
<p>My initial response, the response that burned at the core of who I am, was to react violently and charge him with an unacceptable level of ignorance at having used such a reprehensible word in my presence. Once again, I recalled Baldwin’s essay and the internal war he waged with himself when faced with similar situations. I remained calm knowing that this man was absolutely oblivious of the history, meaning or negative energy that this word carried with it in the United States.</p>
<p>Accepting the reality of my situation permitted my heart rate to lower and my mind to gather itself more clearly. As I would a child, I walked him through the error of his choice of words. To say he was shocked would be a tremendous understatement. Although I felt at ease in the moment, I don’t think I was capable of hiding the disappointment that registered on my face. He was riddled with shame and near tears by the time we ended our conversation. He was apologizing incessantly and would not stop no matter how much I pleaded with him. He let me know that he had heard the word used many times on television and thought it to be a word used when two men were bonding or accepting of one another. His pleading that I not see him in such a light, or as the type of human being who would ever seek to offend me did not fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>A while later, after we had parted, I sat in a small corner cafe with a cup of tea, reflecting on what had just occurred. I couldn’t help but to recall my stay in Mali, West Africa when I encountered a young man who spoke limited English. This young man had chased after me down the street, proud to demonstrate his proficiency in English by yelling at me, “Baba what’s up my Nigger?” I was as much a stranger in Leba dealing with the offensive misstep of this Polish man as I was in the town of N’tomikorobougou, taken aback by the young Bambara man’s provocative choice of words. Both men responded in a similar manner and both were despondent when I explained, in depth, the meaning, history and substance of the word. The young Bambara man had learned his American style colloquialism through exported rap music videos, which so many of the youth in Africa love and mimic without question.</p>
<p>While in Leba I was continuously attempting to balance the stress of my isolation with a mindfulness of why I had come. I had arrived in Leba to share my narrative, stories, music and ideas. For the preservation of my sanity, I needed to keep my work at the forefront of my mind. Fortunately, the evenings, alone in my room, offered me opportunities to reflect and relax. Odd as it may seem, I found that level of solitude, alone in my room, to be invigorating. The night brought with it a calm that helped me deal with with some of the issues of isolation.</p>
<p>The mornings offered as much serenity as did the evenings. Each day in Leba at around 7 am, a local church bell chimed the hour and continued throughout the day until 9 at night. It was as pleasant for me to wake to these sounds, as it was to wake to the morning calls to prayer of muezzins from mosques in West Africa. One Sunday morning I woke to the booming voice of a woman tenor singing ‘Ave Maria,’ during an outdoor church service being held only yards away from my hotel window. I couldn’t help to recall the amazing voice of a Murid visiting our compound in The Gambia and singing, beautifully, the praises of Chiek Amadou Bamba.</p>
<p>At times, although the sights and sounds of Leba were inviting, there was always an uneasy, somewhat unpleasant level of consciousness of history that invaded my thoughts. The role of religion in the subjugation of my ancestors continually abducted my attempts to savor the picturesque Christian art and architecture of the small town, much as it did Baldwin in the village he visited. While walking past an amazing stone structure I recalled Baldwin’s essay. I realized, just as he had, that I was unable to completely savor the aesthetics of what was being offered to me as much as my European hosts. Baldwin elaborated on this dynamic when he mentioned, in his essay, that the beautiful architecture of the Cathedral at Chartres spoke something to the people of the village that it could not say to him.</p>
<p>I know that many readers will view these impromptu, involuntary reflections on past atrocities as dissonant invasions of my peace of mind. I prefer to place them in another context. This stream of consciousness is an ever-present reminder of those whose legacy I have inherited. It is the memory of men, women and children who survived the 3-month journey crossing the Atlantic in the filthy bowel of slave ships. My involuntary reflections assure that I never forget the more than 250 years of inhumane bondage deeply woven into the fabric of American history.</p>
<p>As a means of escaping the constant reminders of my isolation, one evening, in my hotel room, I decided to watch television. I had been in Leba for almost an entire week and had yet to turn it on. There was the usual programming: news, international sports, etc. While changing channels I was unexpectedly accosted by disturbing and destructive imagery on the screen. With the remote in my hand I found myself immobilized, unable to turn away from what I was witnessing. I was watching, on Polish television, a white man in black face rising from his bed in the morning. A white man in black face! Images of <em>Al Jolson</em> and the sounds <em>of Jump Jim Crow</em> fused with rapid running reels from <em>Birth of a Nation</em> flooded my mind. I could not pull myself away from watching. I was obligated to watch. Even though I did not understand a single word of Polish that was being spoken, I was the proverbial moth to a flame. It appeared the protagonist in this sitcom had awakened as a black man after having gone to bed white. Everyone else in the show seemed to think they were originally black except him and he was languishing in the throes of a deep depression. It was shades of Van Peebles <em>‘Watermelon Man’</em> but with an enormous playing up of stereotypical movements, gestures, eye bugging and drawls in the language, which were so easy to discern.</p>
<p>I wondered how many people in the small town of Leba were watching this obvious display of bigoted “<em>entertainment”</em><em>.</em> How many people were watching and enjoying this production that I would eventually trade hellos with on the street or perform for during my stay? 2010 and Europeans were watching a television show of a man sporting Black Face. This should not have come as any shock to me as I’ve been subjected to these same sorts of racial parodies in the United States since birth. The affront has come in the form of antiquated stereotypical characterizations in Hollywood films and, most recently, through perversions and distortions of cultural identity in many music videos.</p>
<p>To jump towards the word racism would be an over simplification and misuse of the term. I did not know the intent of the artists, producers or even the public watching the production. What I do know is that the sort of portrayal that I was witnessing on the screen perpetuates, and sustain, by-products of racism such as ignorance, denial and disingenuity. I have been accused of being “overly” sensitive when it comes to issues that deal with the faux science of race. I have sat side by side with friends and family and watched them shed tears in fits of laughter at such stereotypical distortions as I was subjecting myself to at that moment in my hotel room in Leba. There is an incongruity that has plagued me most of my adult life. Many in the United States label their ability to laugh at stereotypical distortions as “healthy senses of humor.” Few of these same people have ever balanced their “healthy senses of humor” with an equal weight of emotion given to the sadness or grief of this nation’s horrifying historical narrative. This imbalance in emotional equilibrium in family and friends is something that has always disturbed me.</p>
<p>Watching that television in my hotel room in Leba ignited a flame within me that Baldwin described in his essay as “the rage of the disesteemed.” This reactionary anger has been a constant and unwelcome guest intruding throughout my life. It is an anger that doesn’t permit its victim to ask how or why cultural ignorance and bigotry avoid extinction because he already knows. It is anger passed down through generations having witnessed the constant cosmetic altering of the top layers of racist social, political and economic structures. It is an anger at appearing but remaining as unseen today as Ellison’s “Invisible Man” of the past. It is anger at knowing you are a stranger in a land soaked with the blood of your ancestors as much as you are in a small village in Poland.</p>
<p>There is a proverb born out of Africa that I love which says, “An angry heart devours its owner.” I could allow the perverted parody on the television to distract me from my purpose for being in Leba, or I could choose to ascend its ignorance and reclaim my purpose. I had crossed continents to share my narrative, my music, my stories and commune in an exchange with others of like mind. To permit ignorance and racist puppetry to deter me would be akin to being defeated before ever setting a single foot on the battlefield.</p>
<p>I turned the television off, not as a form of avoidance behavior but as a means of re-channeling my psyche to serve my purpose. I had an audience waiting for me. There were people waiting to hear what I had to say.</p>
<p>There are those who might infer that the popularity of my storytelling performances in Leba had a lot to do with the fact that I was somewhat of an anomaly. After all, here I was in a culturally homogeneous town. Some might also say that people came out to see the “Black Man” talk and sing. I would not argue at all with these assumptions. There are precedents for these observations and, on their surface; they house a modicum of truth. It is a known fact that human beings tire quickly of novelty. If I had been simply a novelty, as a performer, to many of the townspeople, then my exchanges with them would have lacked any depth whatsoever. The loyal following of listeners who came every morning and returned at night erased any notion of novelty from my mind. My audiences engaged in discussions, asked questions and searched for profundity of meaning in the proverbs, stories and anecdotes I shared. We communed, not as a Black Entertainer with an all white Polish Audience but more so as thinking individuals who shared a common appreciation for the power of words, music and intellectual stimulation.</p>
<p>During my time in Leba there were those individuals, as well as families, that came to every single show and stayed long afterward. These people opened discussions and dialogued with me during and after every performance. Some of them even offered me tales of wisdom that they hoped I would take and share with other audiences during my travels. If I had continued to allow the sadism of the blackface sitcom to abduct my thoughts during my stay then my perception of those who frequented my performances would have been altered. I would have only been able to see relatives of the blackface actors sitting before me. I would have questioned their motives for being in my presence. In many ways I was being reminded of racism’s vicious proclivity to damage the psyches of both victim and assailant simultaneously.</p>
<p>Racism as a tool and extension of the pathological, perverted thought processes of so many Americans is a ravaging parasite that feeds on its host for self-preservation regardless of cultural identity or historical legacy. Noted historian Carter G. Woodson once reminded us “When you control a man’s thinking you do not have to worry about his actions.” Although the aberration existed in Baldwin’s era, I think there exists a seed of racism much more pronounced today. Grotesque ideations born of racism are espoused by many whose ancestors survived subjugation. As a disease of the mind, racism knows not color or ethnicity. Scaling the wall of denial and living in ignorance of the legacy of my ancestors is not, nor has it ever been, an option for me.</p>
<p>I found myself contrasting and comparing my experiences in Poland to those in the United States. While wearing African attire in Leba I was never approached, as I have been in the United States, by feeble-minded individuals who make such inane statements as, “My ancestors owned your ancestors at one time and we could have the same name.” While I encountered the blank stares and heightened curiosities of children in Leba, not once did I suffer the shrieking fear of a child frightened by my presence or the clutching of handbags as I am often subjected to at “home.”</p>
<p>We live in an age where people seek therapy and question almost every facet of their interpersonal relationships. People engage in group discussions on co-dependence, dysfunctional family dynamics and are even willing to explore the emotional well-being of their pets. The one issue that has the ability to paralyze intellect and give rise to insurmountable levels of denial is the pathology of racism. Getting people to explore their intrapersonal/interpersonal connections to the disease of racism has been an impediment to this nation’s growth since its inception. It was W. E. B. Du Bois who posited in the early 1920’s “… the problem of the 20th Century is the problem of the color line.” I would question if we’ve come much farther in the opening of the 21st Century. There is a discontent at having witnessed the surface of things altered over the centuries while knowing that what is beneath the surface remains the same.</p>
<p>While walking the streets of Leba with another professional storyteller whom I respect and admire, a Frenchman well versed in the literary history of African Americans, I mentioned my reflections on Baldwin’s essay, “Stranger in the Village.” He immediately asked, “You don’t feel like that do you?”</p>
<p>While there were many differences in Baldwin’s experiences in the remote Swiss village of Leukerbad and my isolation in the coastal Polish village of Leba, there were also many parallels too strong for me to ignore. It was the similarities that forced my recollection of Baldwin’s essay, an article that I had not reflected on, nor read, in decades.</p>
<p>My fellow storyteller was quick to remind me that, even to this day, there are small Swiss villages in the mountainous regions that have changed very little since Baldwin’s visit. He recounted a time when, as a stranger, he was looked upon with suspicion and mistrust. What my friend was describing to me as his experiences in a remote Swiss village were more xenophobic than racist in nature. The continuous rebuttals, by even the most well intentioned of people, are constant reminders of racism’s need to negate and, even trivialize, the uniqueness of my narrative.</p>
<p>While the physical subjugation may have ended a little more than a century ago, the pervasive and aggressive assault on the mind continues. The sad fact of the matter is that there are large numbers of people who are not even aware that a war is being waged. The issue that plagued Harriet Tubman in her era still haunts the hearts of the conscious today. She put it quite simply when she said, “I could have saved so many more if I could have convinced them they was slaves.”</p>
<p>I don’t view my recollections of Baldwin’s essay during my stay in Leba as mere happenstances of thought. There is a legacy that I, and many others, deem of vital importance. There is a memory that must be maintained if social, political and economic progress is to be attained by a greater number of the disenfranchised. Baldwin is often quoted as having stated, “Color is not a personal or human reality, it is a political reality.” I would add to Baldwin’s progressive insight that it is a social and economic reality as well; one that has the potential to be as destructive a force in the 21st Century as it has already shown itself to be in the past.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" rel="lightbox[957]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-834" title="blog-face" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a>I really wish I could give names and locations but once you read what I&#8217;m about to say, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll understand why I didn&#8217;t. I visited an elementary school recently (which shall remained unnamed) and was working with groups of 6th graders on getting them comfortable standing before people and speaking. My aim has never really been to create perfect orators or storytellers. I think it&#8217;s important that everyone acquires some level of comfort in speaking before others as a form of personal growth.</p>
<p>My approach is more interpersonal than academic and I&#8217;ve yet to have an entire class that didn&#8217;t accomplish my exercises, except until recently. So, I&#8217;m in this 6th grade class and I&#8217;ve got the energy right where I need it to be to accomplish 100% participation when I get to a young man who has his head down. He is refusing to make eye contact with me. Eye contact is an important part of my workshop and, without it, I&#8217;m partially powerless to communicate effectively. This is something that I also let the children know. Before you ask I will tell you; no the boy isn&#8217;t on the spectrum and not part of a culture that views eye contact from someone younger as disrespectful. That out of the way, now let me explain what happened.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like to single anyone out in front of the other students and so I took his desire not to make eye contact with me as a sort of plea to be left alone. When his turn came to go up in front of the class, he looked up and said rather abruptly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was a first for me. I&#8217;ve been doing this workshop for about 3 years and I&#8217;ve &#8220;always&#8221; managed to get 100% participation. I asked him if he&#8217;d like me to move on past him, allow someone else to go and then return to him. He said no. I released my &#8220;100% participation driven ego&#8221; and let him know that it was alright, that I wouldn&#8217;t force him to do anything that he felt uncomfortable doing. It was definitely a blow to my sense of accomplishment but there was something about this kid that I didn&#8217;t want to disturb. It was in his eyes when he did finally manage to look up. I actually felt a sadness for him.</p>
<p>As I start to move on to the next student, the teacher, who has been sitting quietly at the back of the class, jumps out of her chair and starts shouting. I was actually shocked at what came out of her mouth.</p>
<p>She began yelling at the young man and said, &#8220;I you aren&#8217;t too afraid to sell drugs to other kids on this campus then you shouldn&#8217;t be afraid to get up in front of this class for the few seconds that Baba is asking you to do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>After berating him for only a few seconds longer (which really felt like hours) she turned to me and said, &#8220;Ok Baba, sorry to interrupt, you can have the class back now.&#8221;</p>
<p>What?!?!</p>
<p>I mean really!</p>
<p>What?!?!</p>
<p>I stood there dumbfounded! How do you segue from that back into the tone and rhythm of normalcy that was our initial pacing? I hate to admit it but I stood there thinking, &#8220;Kids in elementary school have money to buy drugs?&#8221; Yeah, that was my first thought. You know how you can&#8217;t help but draw a reference to your own experience? When I was in elementary school, if we had any money at all, it went straight into keeping the dental profession employed though purchasing and eating as much candy as we could stuff into our mouths. Drugs?</p>
<p>I know I looked like some sort of mannequin standing at the front of that class. I can&#8217;t even tell you how I pulled it together. Actually I&#8217;m not sure I did. I left that class and went to my car. I sat in my car for a long while. A really long while. Have you ever been struck by a reality that you, intellectually, think you know? I mean I&#8217;m not naive or anything but there was something about this moment that tore at me.</p>
<p>Drugs and children selling drugs in elementary school and we are arguing over budgetary issues and firing teachers. If this is where we are today, where will we be tomorrow after we&#8217;ve debated and destroyed the one place our nation&#8217;s children should feel safe if not at home?</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;m ranting a bit here, but this incident hit me hard and I might as well still be sitting in my car in that schools parking lot deep in thought.</p>
<p>How do we deal this issues such as this?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" rel="lightbox[947]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-834" title="blog-face" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a>I&#8217;m not sure whether to play the old Carol Burnett goodbye song or the Mickey Mouse Club song. I&#8217;ll let you guys choose. It appears we have reached the end of this experimental-writing-creatively-in-Spanish journey. It also seems as though I may have survived with the exception of a few frazzled nerves and newly enhanced bags under my eyes.</p>
<p>We started this journey in March to see if I could make it through an online creative writing course based in Madrid. Rather than me give you a play by play on what it was like, I&#8217;m hoping a few of my classmates who speak/read English will chime in at some time to give you their impression of the frightened kid at the back of the class trying not to be noticed.</p>
<p>Before I started this exercise, I loved writing! Now? Well, I love it even more. One of the benefits of writing in a secondary or tertiary language is how much easier it feels to return to your primary language and write. I sat down the other day and finished the 1st draft of an entire chapter in one day. Do you know what a miracle that is for me? I actually have gained the confidence that I could complete a chapter a day if I just sit down and do it. Oh, realize this&#8230; when I say I&#8217;ve completed an entire chapter that is not actually a completed chapter. It&#8217;s a rough, really rough, draft. I usually go through 8 to 12 drafts before I feel comfortable presenting my work. The exception to this rule has been this class with it&#8217;s deadlines and parameters.</p>
<p>What am I going to do now that the class is over? Well, I&#8217;m not going to Disneyland but a nap sure sounds nice. Ooh, a nice long, quiet, uninterrupted nap sounds sooo nice.</p>
<p>Thank each and everyone of you who decided to stick this journey out with me and read every single thing I threw at you. You are all officially saints who have earned an extra pair of wings to do with what you will.</p>
<p>Below you&#8217;ll find links to the last story if you&#8217;d like to download and read it. One in English and one in Spanish.</p>
<p>Quiero dar las gracias a todos, ojala que cruzaremos caminos el el futuro.</p>
<p>Besos y Abrazos para toda la vida mi gente.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The speech was a resounding success. Hundreds of people in the dimly lit banquet hall stood up from their chairs and tables to applaud the senator’s impassioned plea for change. The ovation and loud cheers spilled out of the banquet area with the senator and his wife as the doors were opened for them and they exited through to the main lobby. Two aids flanked each side of the senator and his wife, competing for his attention as they made their way to the front entrance of the hotel. The rain was pouring down outside and the most ambitious of the two aids sprinted out into the evening’s downpour, without an umbrella, to hail a cab for the couple.</p>
<p>They waited inside, the senator shaking hands and accepting congratulations while his wife stood passively by, smiling and nodding in an agreeable, affirming manner whenever someone happened to look her way. A cab arrived and the aids made umbrellas magically appear out of nowhere as they escorted the couple across the hotel entrance’s red carpet and swiftly into the cab. She had been spared the insult of being harassed by the falling drops of water thanks to the extreme diligence of the senator’s aids. She entered the cab first, as dry as she had been when nearly falling asleep in the banquet room during her husband’s rousing speech.</p>
<p>“To the Alex Hotel!” ordered the senator.</p>
<p>The cab slowly pulled away from the curb, rolling through a deep pool of water that threatened to enter the car as it carefully merged into traffic.</p>
<p>“What did you think of my speech?”</p>
<p>“It was wonderful dear, possibly your best to date,” she responded.</p>
<p>She always answered that question with the exact same phrase and in the exact same tone whenever he asked. He never noticed. The senator’s cell phone began ringing.</p>
<p>“I have to take this!”</p>
<p>Every call was an urgent one that needed to be answered. She nodded her well-rehearsed affirming nod, and turn to stare out of the window of the cab into the city’s darkness.</p>
<p>“Tell that asshole if he doesn’t vote for the appropriations like he said he would I’ll make sure he regrets it!”</p>
<p>The senator’s voice faded into a mist of sounds partially drowned out by the rain pelting the roof of the car and partially by the music playing on the cab driver was playing.</p>
<p>“First time in New York ma’am?”</p>
<p>The cab driver was speaking to her. No one ever spoke to her. She regained the fraction of composure she had lost staring out into the night and answered him. He had a thick Cameroonian accent. She loved foreign accents, they reminded her of her years in college when she met much more interesting people than she was meeting as a senator’s wife.</p>
<p>“No, I grew up here. This used to be my home,” she answered, still thoughtlessly staring out of the window into a rapidly passing obscurity.</p>
<p>“Well my father used to always tell me that home is anywhere your heart is,” spoke the driver.</p>
<p>A sudden, intense blend of heightened anticipation and hopeful exhilaration wash over her entire body. There was something familiar about the cab driver’s voice. She quickly turned away from the window and looked into the cabs rearview mirror. Instinctively she drew her hand to her chest as her heart began an unmeasured, frenetic pulsing. Her breathing became very shallow as she recognized the pair of dark eyes looking back at her in the rearview mirror. The senator continued with his phone conversation.</p>
<p>“Call Congressman Bradley and tell him that this offer has a short shelf life.”</p>
<p>She was gripped by an inability to speak. She struggled to catch her breath.</p>
<p>“Do you believe that ma’am?” asked the cab driver.</p>
<p>In the haze of confusion whirling around in her head, she could barely manage to say a single word.</p>
<p>“What?” was her barely audible murmur, but the cab driver heard her.</p>
<p>“Do you believe that home is wherever the heart finds itself?”</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the identity of the pair of beautiful ebony hued eyes returning her gaze in the rearview mirror. His name was Marcel. They had met in college, shared a love of insatiable desire and then, later, after graduating, they parted ways in a manner that left many questions unanswered between them.</p>
<p>“I don’t care if the subcommittee is dragging its’ heals on this, we need a decision by next week!”</p>
<p>As Marcel attempted to navigate the tumult of the stormy night, turning corners, slowing and stopping at barely visible lights, his eyes faithfully returned to her at unpredictable intervals in the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t hear your answer ma’am,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she whispered, almost to herself, somewhat incoherently.</p>
<p>She struggled for something smart to say, something to alleviate the awkward stress of the moment. She desperately wanted to speak but no words would come from her mouth. She was lost in a confusion that was as surprisingly pleasant as it was discomforting.</p>
<p>“Some say that there is more said in silence than with words spoken aloud,” said the Marcel. “Do you think this is true?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” she quickly answered, loudly and without hesitation, brimming with an enthusiasm that startled her husband.</p>
<p>“Are you alright dear?” asked the senator as he cupped his hand over the receiver of his cell phone.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m fine.”</p>
<p>The senator had already returned to his call before she could complete her answer.</p>
<p>She could see that Marcel was smiling a wide smile. He always smiled. This was what had made her fall in love with him in college, his smile, his eyes. He held up an old cassette between his thumb and forefinger, showing it to her as he continued looking ahead, driving. Marcel put a cassette in the cassette deck of his cab and turned up the volume. He still used cassettes! She smiled from somewhere deep within. He had always been quirky that way. In college he still had an 8-track while everyone else had moved on to cassettes and now, here in the digital age here was playing a cassette while everyone else had moved on to iPods. Marcel began singing the song from the cassette he had chosen, an old Bob Marley standard, “No, woman, no cry.”</p>
<p>“Please!” shouted the senator, “I’m trying to conduct business back here!”</p>
<p>Marcel continued secret serenade, boldly ignoring the senator’s plea for quiet.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good friends we have, oh, good friends we have lost along the way, yeah!</span></p>
<p>She couldn’t control the involuntary smile rising up from within her. The deep resonance of Marcel’s voice made her body shudder in a very pleasant way she thought lost with age. She exhaled slightly as her body began to recall the passion of their shared moments.</p>
<p>Marcel sang out even louder, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">“Little darlin don’t shed no tear.”</span></p>
<p>Her heart pushed back at his singing in inebriated, uneven palpitations. She waited each second for him to return his eyes to her from the road in front of him. It was almost as if an eternity of time elapsed each time the road forced him to look away before he would eventually return her gaze in the rearview mirror.</p>
<p>Subconsciously, she began singing the song with him, but in a very low inaudible, respectful voice. Marcel grinned, as he was able to catch glimpses of her lips moving in sync with his in mirror.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No, woman, no cry;<br />
No, woman, no cry. Eh, yeah!<br />
A little darlin&#8217;, don&#8217;t shed no tears:<br />
No, woman, no cry. Eh!</span></p>
<p>Irritated by the driver’s display of impertinence, the senator forcefully interrupted the chorus once again but no one heard him. His wife’s eyes were transfixed on the rearview mirror awaiting Marcel’s gaze to return from the road. Lost in his own world, the senator was unable to see what was happening in his presence. He returned to his call.</p>
<p>“Just another crazy New York night Stan, tell Joshua to return that call tonight, don’t wait until tomorrow!”</p>
<p>The duo’s singing got louder as they approached the Alex hotel.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Everything&#8217;s gonna be all right-a!<br />
Everything&#8217;s gonna be all right!<br />
Everything&#8217;s gonna be all right, yeah!<br />
Everything&#8217;s gonna be all right!</span></p>
<p>As the cab pulled over to the submerged curb, other aids dashed from the hotel with umbrellas and opened the doors. Throngs of reporters, cameramen and writers were standing in the pouring rain outside of the hotel, waiting to elicit just a few words from the senator. The senator jumped out of the cab and stood up fully erect, reaching one of his hands back into the cab to help his wife exit. She didn’t emerge.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Everything&#8217;s gonna be all right! they sang</span></p>
<p>Now Marcel’s gaze wasn’t distracted any longer by his having to drive. She possessed his full attention. While Marcel sang, he made sure to punctuate each word that held special meaning with heavy annunciating.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">O little darlin…</span></p>
<p>A joy she had not felt in years was filling her to the brim as she began singing louder.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No, woman &#8211; no, woman &#8211; no, woman, no cry;</span></p>
<p>“Honey, we’re here!” shouted the senator.</p>
<p>His voice was angry, which startled her but she remained euphorically defiant. The song was finished. There was something in her that wanted, no needed, to finish singing this song. She ignored her husband and continued singing, loudly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No, woman, no cry;<br />
No, woman, no cry. Eh, yeah!<br />
A little darlin&#8217;, don&#8217;t shed no tears:<br />
No, woman, no cry. Eh!</span></p>
<p>He had never encountered this sort of behavior from his wife. The senator ducked his head down into the cab just as the song was finishing, grabbing his wife’s hand. She scooted across the seat from her side maintaining eye contact. Just as she was about to exit the car she reached back inside to retrieve one of the business cards stuck in the divider separating the driver from his passengers.</p>
<p>The senator’s aids slammed the cab door closed and escorted the couple through the mob of press. The cab slowly pulled away from the curb and then stopped. She turned and watched. The cab then finally pulled away, driving off into the evening’s downpour.</p>
<p>The End</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>El discurso del Senador fue un gran éxito. Cientos de personas en el salón de banquetes estaban de pie y aplaudían apasionada por la petición del Senador para traer los cambios á los negocios del gobierno. La ovación y los aplausos siguieron el Senador y su esposa por las puertas del salón hacia la entrada del hotel. Dos ayudantes andaban a ambos lados del Senador y su esposa. Los ayudantes competían por la atención del Senador. Afuera del hotel la lluvia caía tan fuerte. Uno de los ayudantes corrió, sin un paraguas, por la entrada del hotel para llamar un taxi para la pareja estimada.</p>
<p>El Senador y su esposa esperaron dentro del hotel. El Senador se dio la mano de todos y aceptaba las felicitaciones del publico mientras su esposa estaba de pie al lado de él, sonriendo y asintiendo con la cabeza cuando alguien la mirarían. El taxi llegó y los ayudantes presentaron paraguas como si por la magia. Entonces los ayudantes acompañaron a la pareja, bajo muchas paraguas, a través de la alfombra roja del hotel, hacia el taxi. Entregaron la esposa del Senador al asiento de taxi sin una gota de lluvia molestarla. Ella entró el taxi tan seco como el tiempo pasaba en la salón de banquetes, cuando ella casi se ha quedado dormido durante el discurso de su esposo.</p>
<p>¡Tomamos al Hotel Alex! &#8211; ordenó el Senador.-</p>
<p>El taxi condujo, lentamente, de la acera y por una charca profunda de agua antes de uniendo la circulación.</p>
<p>-¿Qué pensaste de mi discurso?-</p>
<p>-Fue maravilloso querido, posiblemente lo mejor has entregado hasta hoy- respondió su esposa.</p>
<p>Siempre el la preguntó esta pregunta y siempre ella respondió en la misma manera, con la misma frase y con el mismo tono de voz. Su esposo no nunca hizo caso de sus palabras o pensamientos. El teléfono móvil del Senador sonó.</p>
<p>-¡Tengo que contestarlo!- dijo el Senador.</p>
<p>Todas las llamadas fueron emergencias y él no nunca las ignoró. Ella asintió con la cabeza en la manera que había practicado muchas veces antes en su vida con él y, entonces, volvió la cabeza para mirar por la ventana del taxi al oscuridad de la ciudad y la lluvia de la noche.</p>
<p>¡Mierda! –gritó el Senador en su móvil- ¡Digas el hijo de puta que no voy a esperar para su decisión!</p>
<p>La voz del Senador se fue apagando en una neblina de sonidos, parcialmente ahogado por la lluvia cayendo en el techo del taxi y la música del taxista.</p>
<p>¿Es este su primera vez in Nueva York señora? –preguntó el taxista.-</p>
<p>Ella estaba sorprendida porque el taxista le hablaba. Nadie nunca le hablaba.  Recuperó su compostura que había perdido mirando fijamente por la ventana. El taxista tuvo un acento duro de Camerún que se recordó de sus años como un estudiante en la universidad cuando ella conoció mucha gente muy interesante, de hecho más interesante que la gente que estaba conociendo como una esposa de un Senador. Ella le contestó mientras mantuvo los ojos hacia la noche.</p>
<p>-No nací aquí. Esta ciudad fue mi hogar cuando era una niña.-</p>
<p>-Pues mi papá me decía que siempre el hogar estará donde su corazón encuentra el amor.- respondió el taxista.</p>
<p>De repente, una mezclada de anticipación intensa y esperanza llenado de alegría se baño todo el cuerpo. Había algo familiar en la voz del taxista. Rápidamente ella volvió los ojos hacia el taxista y lo miró en el retrovisor. Instintivamente, sin pensar, ella puso una mano al pecho como su corazón empezó un pulso frenético. Su respiración se hizo un poco profundas al reconocer el par de ojos oscuro mirando hacia atrás en el retrovisor. El Senador siguió con su conversación por su móvil.</p>
<p>-¡Llame el miembro de congreso Señor Bradley y le digas que esta oferta tiene una vida muy corta!-</p>
<p>Ella había perdido la capacidad a hablar y estaba luchando para recobra el aliento.</p>
<p>¿Cree que señora? –preguntó el taxista.-</p>
<p>Una bruma de confusión estaba girando alrededor de su cabeza y, por eso, no pudo hablar ni encontrar su voz.</p>
<p>¿Qué? –ella murmuró pero, todavía, el taxista la oyó.</p>
<p>¿Cree que el hogar estará donde su corazón encuentra el amor? –preguntó de nuevo el taxista.-</p>
<p>No cabía duda de que la identidad de los ojos ébano volver su mirada en el retrovisor. Su nombre era Marcel y ellos habían conocido hace muchos años cuando asistían la universidad. Durante estos años, como estudiantes, habían conocido y compartieron un amor insaciable y, luego, después de graduarse, se separaron de una manera que dejo muchas preguntas sin respuestas entre ellos.</p>
<p>¡No me importa si el subcomité está dando largas al asunto, necesitamos una decisión para la semana próxima!</p>
<p>Como Marcel navegó su taxi por la lluvia torrencial y la oscuridad, sus ojos volvió con fidelidad a intervalos impredecibles al retrovisor.</p>
<p>-Lo siento, no oí su respuesta señora- le dijo.</p>
<p>-Si- susurró ella casi incoherente.</p>
<p>Ella luchó por algo inteligente o interesante a decir pero nada vendría para ayudar aliviar la tensión del momento. Ella urgentemente quería a decir algo pero ningún palabra vendría de la boca. Se perdió en una confusión que fue tan agradable como lo era incómodo.</p>
<p>-He oído que mucha gente se dice que hay más significados en silencio que en millones de palabras se hablaron en voz alta. ¿Qué crees tu? – le preguntó Marcel.</p>
<p>-¡Si!- Ella respondió rápidamente y en una voz alta lleno de un entusiasmo que capturó la atención de su marido.</p>
<p>¿Estás bien cariño mío? – El Senador le preguntó, poniendo un mano sobre el receptor de su móvil.-</p>
<p>-Sí, estoy bien.- le contestó.</p>
<p>El senador ya había regresado a su llamada antes de que ella pudiera completar su respuesta.</p>
<p>Ella pudo ver que Marcel sonreía tan grande en el retrovisor. Ella recordó que el siempre sonreía. Su sonrisa y ojos fueron las cosas que se habían enamorado a él en la universidad. Marcel levantó un casete antiguo entre el pulgar y el índice para mostrárselo en secreto. Entonces él puso el casete un la pletina de su taxi y subió el volumen.</p>
<p>¡Todavía él esta utilizando casetes! –ella pensó a su mismo.-</p>
<p>Con esta pensamiento ella sonrió de algún lugar profundo dentro de su alma. Desde la primera vez ella lo conoció a Marcel, él había sido una manera distinta de todas las demás. En la universidad tocaba 8-pistas mientras todos los demás tocaban casetes y, ahora, en esta era digital, el tocaba casetes mientras todos tienen iPods. Marcel comenzó a cantar la canción de la casete. Fue una canción de Bob Marley llamado <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No, mujer, no llores.</span></p>
<p>¡Por favor! –gritó el Senador- ¡Estoy intentando de hablar de negocios aquí!</p>
<p>Marcel lo ignoró y continuó su serenata secreto.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good friends we have, oh, good friends we have lost along the way, yeah!</span></p>
<p>Ella no podía controlar la sonrisa se eleva desde dentro de ella. Mientras ella escuchaba Marcel cantando, la profunda resonancia de su voz la tocó. Mientras él cantó, ella empecía a sentir algo en el corazón que pensó que había perdido hace muchos años con su juventud. Ella exhaló un poco como su cuerpo comenzó a recordar la pasión de sus momentos compartidos.</p>
<p>Marcel cantó con más fuerte –<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Little darlin don’t shed no tear.-</span></p>
<p>El corazón saltó con cada palabra Marcel cantó. Las palpitaciones de su corazón era desigual ahora. Ella esperó cada segundo para la vuelva de sus ojos en el retrovisor desde la carretera. Parecía casi como si una eternidad de tiempo transcurrido durante los momentos que Marcel obligó a mirar el camino antes de volver, finalmente, su mirada en el retrovisor.</p>
<p>Inconscientemente, ella comenzó a cantar la canción con él, pero en una voz baja, casi inaudible. Marcel sonrió como pudo ver brevemente los labios moviendo en sincronía con la suya en el retrovisor.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No, woman, no cry;<br />
No, woman, no cry. Eh, yeah!<br />
A little darlin&#8217;, don&#8217;t shed no tears:<br />
No, woman, no cry. Eh!</span></p>
<p>El Senador se irritó por la impertinencia del taxista y interrumpió el coro una vez más con avisos pero nadie lo escuchó. Los ojos de su esposa estuvieron traspasados en el retrovisor, esperando para la vuelva de la mirada de Marcel. El Senador estaba totalmente ajena a lo que lo rodeaba y volvió a su móvil.</p>
<p>-Sólo otra noche loca en Nueva York Stan, le diga a Joshua a volver las llamadas esta noche, no espere hasta mañana.-</p>
<p>El dúo se hizo más fuerte cuando se acercaron el Hotel Alex.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Everything&#8217;s gonna be all right-a!<br />
Everything&#8217;s gonna be all right!<br />
Everything&#8217;s gonna be all right, yeah!<br />
Everything&#8217;s gonna be all right!</span></p>
<p>A medida que el taxi se acercó la acera sumergidas del hotel, nuevos ayudantes con paraguas abrieron las puertas para el Senador y su esposa. Multitudes de reporteros, camarógrafos y escritores habían esperado en la lluvia por la oportunidad a grabar unas de las palabras del Senador. El Senador saltó de la cabina del taxi, alcanzando una mano atrás para ayudar su esposa pero ella no salió.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Everything&#8217;s gonna be all right! they sang</span></p>
<p>Ahora que ellos habían estacionado, Marcel no tuvo las distracciones del camino a arrastrar su atención. Ahora él y ella mantenían los ojos en el retrovisor y cantando.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">O little darlin…</span></p>
<p>Una alegría que ella no había sentido en muchos años la secuestró.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No, woman &#8211; no, woman &#8211; no, woman, no cry;</span></p>
<p>¡Cariño, estamos aquí! -gritó el Senador.-</p>
<p>El Senador estaba enojado y esto la asustó a ella pero permaneció eufóricamente desafiante. La canción estaba terminando. Había algo en ella que quería a completar la canción. Ignoró a su esposo y continuó a cantar, pero ahora en una voz más alta.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No, woman, no cry;<br />
No, woman, no cry. Eh, yeah!<br />
A little darlin&#8217;, don&#8217;t shed no tears:<br />
No, woman, no cry. Eh!</span></p>
<p>El Senador no nunca había visto este tipo de comportamiento de su esposa. El agachó la cabeza en el taxi y la preguntó a ella a venir inmediatamente. La canción estaba terminando cuando él cogió la mando de su esposa. Ella estaba manteniendo la mirada de Marcel en el retrovisor mientras que se deslizó sobre el asiento del taxi. Antes de salir el taxi completamente, ella paró para recuperar una de las tarjetas de negocios en el separador entre el taxista y sus pasajeros. Rápidamente los ayudantes cerró la puerta del taxi y acompañaron la pareja a través de la turba de prensa. Marcel condujo el taxi de la acera un poco y se detuvo. Ella se volvió y observó. Finalmente, lentamente, Marcel se fue manejando, por el aguacero en la noche.</p>
<p>Fin</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emanuel carefully crept through the old door, trying to keep it from creaking as he entered the dark living room late at night, hours past his curfew. Incredibly, he had managed to get the door opened, and closed, without it emitting a single sound. Just as he began contemplating how he would navigate the noisy wooden floorboards, he heard a soft, gentle voice.</p>
<p>“Emanuel turn the lights on please.”</p>
<p>“Grandma?”</p>
<p>“Turn on the lights Emanuel.”</p>
<p>“Grandma why are you sitting here in the dark?”</p>
<p>Draped in an overcoat, the old woman sat quietly in a long flannel nightgown and house slippers, her, somewhat emaciated, wrinkled hands gently folded over the top of her purse resting on her lap. As Emanuel turned the lights on in the living room, she began swaying back and forth in her rocking chair, putting pressure on the aged wooden floorboards which caused them to sing out in a rhythmic agony: creak, creak, creak…</p>
<p>“Grandma…”</p>
<p>“Emanuel, curfew done passed a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“Grandma, we need to talk about this curfew stuff!”</p>
<p>“Naw, naw, naw boy…  ain’t nuthin needs discussin. You s’posed to have your behind in this house and in your bed by the hour I done told you. Ain’t nuthin needs discussin other than that!”</p>
<p>“Grandma I’m a grown man now and “men” don’t have curfews!”</p>
<p>“Boy… 15 ain’t grown! Trust your granny, I done had my share of grown men over the years and I’m here to tell ya, 15 ain’t shit. Now go on over there and sit your “thinkin-ya-grown” ass down and listen to what I got to tell you.”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Emanuel you know for far too long we ain’t had nobody but you and me?”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am.”</p>
<p>“And when you was a baby shittin yourself, I was the one wiping that nasty ass, wasn’t I?”</p>
<p>“Uh… yes ma’am?”</p>
<p>“Well Emanuel, when you don’t falla the rules of this here house, you startin to shit again… but this time you shittin on me.”</p>
<p>“Grandma!”</p>
<p>“Hush now boy! Just hush and let a old woman testify.”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Now you “know” I love you don’t ya?”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am.”</p>
<p>“And you “know” I’d do just about anything for you don’t ya?</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am.”</p>
<p>“And it’s because I love you that I’ma give you a choice you need to make tonight Emanuel.”</p>
<p>“Grandma please, I’m tired!”</p>
<p>“Boy I done taught you better than that! Don’t you raise your voice at me! Don’t you interrupt grown folks when they talkin!”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am.”</p>
<p>“For the past year now you been peacocking round here talkin bout you’se a man and breakin all ma rules and so I went out and got a lil somethin for you.</p>
<p>The creaking of the rocking chair stops as grandma opens her purse.</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ grandma what are you doing with a gun?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you take the lord’s name in vain boy! Sit yourself back down in that chair and I’m gonn tell you what it’s for. Are you listening?”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am.”</p>
<p>“I been thinking that If you willing to walk over an old woman like me who ain’t did nuthin but love you for your whole life then lord only knows what you gonna be willin to do to folks out in the world. Emanuel I love you too much to let you make a complete mess of your life.”</p>
<p>“Grandma, you scaring me.”</p>
<p>“Oh then that’s good grandbaby, real good cuz I was startin to think you had lost the good sense that god gave ya.”</p>
<p>“Grandma I’m listening, please stop pointing the gun at me. If you wanted to get my attention then you got it!”</p>
<p>“Shut up and sit still! As long as you sit still and listen to what your granny got to say, you ain’t got nuthin to be worry’n about.”</p>
<p>“Grandma your hands are shakin, you’re really scaring me.”</p>
<p>“Them hands shaking is just old age talking to me. You got a decision to make grandbaby, and if you make the right one you gonna get a chance for old age to talk to you to.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you want me to say is what I’m gonna say grandma, you just tell me what it is that you want me to say but please stop pointing that gun at me!”</p>
<p>“Ah I guess you ain’t a man no more huh? Look at you sittin there wettin yourself like when you was a baby. Boy you better straighten your back up in that chair and listen to what your granny got to tell you!”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Emanuel, you got a choice to make and I’m just the lord’s messenger here to help you make the right one is all. You can decide to follow the rules of this here house or… you can choose to make your walk through the Pearly Gates tonight. Now, stop all that shaking and snifflin and be the man you been struttin round here talkin about. Make your damn choice boy!”</p>
<p>“I… I… I… I choose to follow the rules of your house grandma.”</p>
<p>“Lord Jesus, lord Jesus… I prayed the lord would guide you to the right choice. That was some wise decision makin Emanuel and I’m proud of you for having the courage to make the “right” choice.” I’m gonna put this thing away now.</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Don’t go getting too comfortable just yet. A house ain’t a home unless its’ got rules and me and my purse gonna be here sittin, waitin on you the next time time you choose to break curfew.”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am.”</p>
<p>“I know you been out alley-cat’n and probably didn’t eat so I made you some of your favorite chilly and cornbread. It’s on the stove in the kitchen. Go ahead and have you some and then get to bed.  I’ve got to go lay these tired old bones down for what’s left of this night.  I love you grandbaby.”</p>
<p>“I love you too grandma.”</p>
<p>The end</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Después de una noche lleno de fiestas, bebidas y muchos amigos, Manuel entró por la puerta sigilosamente y la cerró. La sala fue oscura y él había violado el toque de queda. El empezó a pensar en como navigar el piso hecho de madera cuando escuchó una voz suave y dulce que le hablaba.</p>
<p>-Manuel enciendas la luz por favor.-</p>
<p>-¿Abuelita?-</p>
<p>-Enciendas la luz Manuel.-</p>
<p>-¿Abuelita por que estás sentando sola en la oscuridad?-</p>
<p>Envuelto en un abrigo, la anciana estaba sentando tranquilamente en su mecedora. Debajo del abrigo, iba vestido en un largo camisón de franela y zapatillas. Sus manos, delgada y arrugado, cruzaron sobre un bolso en su regazo. Mientras su nieto estaba enciendo la luz, la abuela comenzó a balancearse adelante y atrás en su mecedora. El movimiento de su mecedora puso mucha presión en el piso de madera y, con cada movimiento adelante y atrás la madera del piso lloraba en rítmica: cric, cric, cric…</p>
<p>-Abuelita…-</p>
<p>-Manuel tu has violado el toque de queda de nuevo y por muchas horas esta noche.-</p>
<p>-¡Si, si, si Abuelita… pero tenemos que hablar de sus reglas y este toque de queda!-</p>
<p>-¡No, no, no mi nieto… no ha de charlar de nada. Tu tienes un toque de queda y lo has violado. ¡Eso es todo!-</p>
<p>-¡Abuelita, tienes que escucharme, soy un hombre y los hombres no tienen toques de queda y eso es todo¡-</p>
<p>-Nieto, soy una abuela pero también una mujer. He tenido muchos hombres en mi vida y puedo decirte, por seguro, que todavía tu no eres un hombre. Solamente tienes 15 años. Ahora siéntate y me escuchas a lo que tengo que decirte.-</p>
<p>-Si Abuelita.-</p>
<p>-A lo largo de nuestras vidas Manuel, solamente hemos tenido uno al otro. ¿Verdad?-</p>
<p>-Si Abuelita.-</p>
<p>- Y cuando tu era un bebe yo limpiaba la mierda de tu culo. ¿Verdad?-</p>
<p>-Ah… si Abuelita.-</p>
<p>-Ahora Manuel tu no eres un bebe pero siento como tu estás cargándote a tu mismo de nuevo por no seguir las reglas de mi casa.-</p>
<p>-¡Abuelita!-</p>
<p>-¡Cállate niño! Mantengas el silencio y me permitas a hablar sin interrumpirme.-</p>
<p>-Si Abuelita.-</p>
<p>-¿Mi nieto tu conoces que te quiero mucho si?</p>
<p>-Si Abuelita.-</p>
<p>-Y por eso voy a darte la oportunidad a tomar una decisión esta noche.-</p>
<p>-¡Abuelita estoy cansado! ¿Podemos charlar más tarde?-</p>
<p>-¡No… tu vas a hablar conmigo con respeto y no levantes la voz en mi presencia!-</p>
<p>-Si Abuelita.-</p>
<p>-¡Desde el año pasado tu caminaba a través de mis casa como un pavo real y estoy cansado… estoy tan cansado! Piensas que tu eres un hombre y, por eso, sientes como tu puedas violar todas de las reglas de mi casa.-</p>
<p>El ruido de la mecedora termina y la abuelita abre su bolso.</p>
<p>-¡Jesús, María y José… Abuelita porque tienes una pistola!-</p>
<p>-¡Siéntate niño… siéntate y voy a decirte porque tengo esta pistola! ¿Estás escuchándome ahora?</p>
<p>-¡Si, por supuesto Abuelita, estoy escuchando!-</p>
<p>-Yo pensaba en algo muy importante Manuel. Si tu molestaras y no dará el respeto a una anciana como yo, una mujer que te quiero mucho, entonces molestaras y no dará respeto a alguien en este mundo.-</p>
<p>-Abuelita tengo miedo. Tu me pegas un susto de muerte a mi.-</p>
<p>-Bien, muy bien porque comenzaba a pensar que tu había perdido la capacidad a entrar en razón.-</p>
<p>-¡Abuelita, estoy escuchando… por favor no me apuntas con la pistola!-</p>
<p>-¡Cállate y siéntate! Si tu quedas en la silla y no muevas no tendremos ningún problema.-</p>
<p>-¡Pero Abuelita tus manos están temblando! ¡Me asustas Abuelita!-</p>
<p>-Son manos de una anciana y ellos siempre tiemblan. Tu tienes que elegir entre dos cosas y si tu eliges correcto entonces vivirá a ser un anciano.-</p>
<p>-Dime lo que quieres que yo digo Abuelita. Diré cualquier cosa que tu me digas pero por favor no me apuntas con la pistola.-</p>
<p>-¿Qué paso Manuel… nada mas tu eres un hombre? ¿Me escuchas ahora si?</p>
<p>-Si, si, si… Abuelita.-</p>
<p>-Manuel tengo dos preguntas para ti. Puedes contestar afirmativo un o al otra. Si tu elijes incorrecto, entonces tu vas a recibir un abraso de nuestro salvador Jesús Cristo esta noche. Su tu elijes correcto, entonces puedes vivir. ¿Me entiendes niño?</p>
<p>-Si Abuelita.-</p>
<p>-Bueno Manuel. Aquí están mis dos preguntas: ¿Prefieres quedar con el aire en su cuerpo por seguir las reglas de mi casa o prefieres a morir esta noche?</p>
<p>-Entiendo Abuelita, entiendo bien y elijo a seguir las reglas de tu casa.-</p>
<p>-¡Ah Dios mío… he rezado por muchas horas que tu elegirías correcto! En ese momento tengo mucho orgullo en ti y ahora voy a poner esta pistola en el bolso.-</p>
<p>-Gracias Abuelita, muchas gracias.-</p>
<p>-Todavía tu no descanses niño porque siempre mantendré mi bolso cerca. ¿Me entiendes?-</p>
<p>-Si Abuelita.-</p>
<p>-Bueno. Yo sé que tu tengas hambre así que cociné algo para ti. Esta en la cocina en la estufa. Comas tu y entonces te acuestes. Yo tengo que acostarme ahora. Estoy agotado. Te quiero mucho Manuel.-</p>
<p>-También te quiero mucho Abuelita.-</p>
<p>Fin</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" rel="lightbox[927]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-834" title="blog-face" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a>Can you believe that we started this 3 month journey in March and it is almost June? Absolutely amazing! I believe the first question was would I survive an all Spanish Speaking/Writing creative writing course based in Madrid? I&#8217;m not quite sure yet. You would have to ask some of my classmates to really measure my success or failure. One thing I do know for sure is that forming an intimate relationship with the creative writer within is akin to trying to form a balanced level of intimacy in a relationship with the Freudian &#8220;Id.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not complaining&#8230; no not me. I mean I love the results but must I suffer over every word, syllable and contextual meaning. I know what you&#8217;re saying. You&#8217;re saying, &#8220;but Baba that is your choice!&#8221;</p>
<p>Notice the &#8220;exclamation point?&#8221; I put that there because I can hear most of you screaming.</p>
<p>Ok, at first glance it may appear that I&#8217;ve got complete control over this creative process, but I have found that not to be quite true. Being woken up at 3 or 4 am by epiphanies or awesome revelations about your characters is not really my idea of &#8220;living la vida loca.&#8221; I mean, maybe it is for some people but I would prefer to be one of those cool dudes like Cyrano for whom words have no mystery. But, alas, I&#8217;m me.</p>
<p>Anyway, I know you&#8217;re probably saying, &#8220;then why the hell do you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Allow me to share a little secret with you that many writers refuse to let the public know. I will probably have my &#8220;Stratford-on-Avon&#8221; card pulled for sharing this with you guys but you must know the filthy, nasty, dirty truth about writers and writing. Here it is:</p>
<p>Writing is a drug and &#8220;all&#8221; writers are junkies.</p>
<p>There&#8230; I said it and I ain&#8217;t ashamed! I even used to the word &#8220;ain&#8217;t&#8221; to upset my 9th grade language arts teacher so you know I&#8217;m serious.</p>
<p>Yes, writing is definitely a drug and if you approach any writer and ask them they will all have to tell you the truth. Poll any/all writers and you will see that 100% of them will not deny the addictive nature of writing.</p>
<p>Ooops&#8230; I&#8217;m ranting.</p>
<p>About the assignment. The assignment due tomorrow (Madrid time) was equally as challenging as the previous ones. Since I always &#8220;nutshell&#8221; it for you, it won&#8217;t be any different now. In this assignment we had to create a scene that needed to be played out in real time. That means we had to provide the scene, introduce characters, reach our conflict and close with a resolution in &#8220;real time.&#8221; Think &#8220;sit-com&#8221; with substance for you television junkies out there.</p>
<p>I chose to pay homage to a piece I read when I was really really young. I was actually to young to be reading this book but that made it even more of a treat. The author I payed homage to in my short story is Claude Brown and his book <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manchild in the Promised Land</span>. It was easy giving my piece a title in English, I call it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Manchild in the Land of Promise.</span> The problem arises when you try to translate concepts such as a &#8220;manchild&#8221; into other languages. I think I suffered more trying to figure out how to convey the idea in Spanish than I did actually writing the piece.</p>
<p>Enough of this, alright already! Here you go. Below are two links if you&#8217;d like to download the stories and read them at your leisure. For those of you who would prefer to just read them online, you&#8217;ll find the full text of each version below in preceding blogs (yes one in Spanish and one in English).</p>
<p>As always, write me and let me know what you think. Whether in Spanish or English feel free to make corrections. I&#8217;m here to crow, not be coddled (well&#8230; ok, coddling is good sometimes.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Manchild in the Land of Promise</p>
<p>Aldeo sat pensively across the tiny kitchen table, trying to identify the unfamiliar anxious smile deforming his mother’s lips. For much of his childhood Aldeo had served as a surrogate adult ear for her in between parades of transitory relationships. The kitchen table was their ritual meeting place, where years of talk over milk, coffee, and tea had left a collage of stains on the laminate surface, each its’ own signature of a past discussion.</p>
<p>As had become her custom before such discussions, Truda prepared the teapot; but this time her hands trembled as she tried to set it down on the stove’s fire, creating a grating, rustling sound as the two metal surfaces met.</p>
<p>“Mama you have to tell me what is troubling you!” Aldeo demanded.</p>
<p>He had become accustomed to taking control of their conversations when the need arose. Truda had become dependent on her son’s advanced maturity through the years. At 7 years of age Aldeo had learned to steal bread so they could eat; at 12 he was forcing men, whose sexual advances she had decided to decline, from their home late at night with an aluminum baseball bat and at 17 he was comfortably ensconced in his own concept of manhood.</p>
<p>Truda sat at the table and began fumbling with an old worn-out shoebox in front of her.</p>
<p>“What I have to say to you is not easy Aldeo.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, in her nervousness, she nearly tore an edge off of the top of the tattered box.</p>
<p>“Mamma,” he said in a childlike singsong pattern betraying his maturity, “you never have to be afraid when talking with me.”</p>
<p>He reached for his mother’s hand across the table and she offered it, resting palm down on the table as he tried to comfort her with his touch.</p>
<p>He sat up straight and tall encouraging her, “tell me what it is that you are afraid of mamma, I will protect you.”</p>
<p>There was an unmistakable pain in her eyes as she began to speak, an unrecognizable torment planted itself somewhere deep within her.</p>
<p>“What I have to tell you is about your father.”</p>
<p>Aldeo winced uncontrollably, suddenly experiencing disquieting tremors as his body involuntarily contracted within itself. This was the one topic that pushed a dark anger in Aldeo to the surface. His father had abandoned he and his mother when Aldeo was only six years old. The ghost of his father’s image driving away still seared emotionally just as it did when he watched it happening as a child. That was the last time he saw or heard from his father. By invoking his father’s name, Truda knew that she was cutting deeply into tender lesions that had never completely healed for her son.</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare talk to me about that BASTARD!” he roared at his mother pounding his fist on the table.</p>
<p>Aldeo experienced an immediate, deep sense of regret at his words and actions as his mother withdrew in fear.</p>
<p>It was only during discussions about his estranged father that his mother allowed him to curse in her presence. Truda had exercised great tolerance, over the years, for the unrestrained volatility exhibited by her son at the mere mention of his father’s name.</p>
<p>“Aldeo,” she pleaded, “you must listen; you have to hear what I have to say!”</p>
<p>As she continued to speak she began nervously pulling at the decaying edges of the old shoebox once again.</p>
<p>Aldeo sensed the anxiety in his mothers fumbling with the box and lowered his tone to a more respectful level.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry mamma,” he murmured in deference in that childish, singsong timbre that he knew brought his mother comfort, “I didn’t mean to upset you.”</p>
<p>Tears began to form in Truda’s eyes as she continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Aldeo,” she paused to sniffle and rub her nose, “people must be forgiven sometimes for what they do, for the choices they make in life. Your father…”</p>
<p>Aldeo cut his mother’s voice off midsentence, “but mama he chose to leave us, I will never forgive him for that! We have lived in the streets, gone without food because of him…”</p>
<p>Truda listened to her son but more anxiously and nervously then ever she tugged and picked at the frayed, worn box in front of her.</p>
<p>“You cannot ask me to forgive him. In my eyes he is not a man.”</p>
<p>Truda slowly slid the exceedingly creased cardboard shoebox across the table towards her son. In her dread filled state of anxiety, she had torn off an edge of the lid.</p>
<p>“This is yours,” she mumbled as she stroked her son’s hand reaching for the box.</p>
<p>Truda’s eyes began to swell and then a flood of tears let loose as she desperately choked back the gripping temptation to cry out loud.</p>
<p>The shoebox was old, battered and extremely creased after having suffered under the hands of many previous inspections over the years. Aldeo had never seen it before.</p>
<p>The whistling of the teapot interrupted the thick tension in the air as Truda leaped from her chair and ran over to take if off of its’ burner. She quickly returned. There would be no tea prepared today.</p>
<p>Aldeo took the cover off of the shoebox. Inside was an old polaroid picture on top of a menagerie of unrelated objects: yellowing folded pieces of paper, a pair of glasses, unused shoulder patches of military insignia and an old, beaten-up, dog-eared paperback book whose pages were turning brown at the edges.</p>
<p>Aldeo looked up from the box at this mother, “I don’t understand mamma, this is not my stuff. Why are you giving me someone else’s junk?”</p>
<p>Truda could barely speak through the torrent of tears streaming down her cheeks but in a barely audible, broken voice but she managed. She mustered up the courage to tell Aldeo that the picture in the box was a picture of his “real” father.</p>
<p>The words “real father” sucked the air from Aldeo’s body, forcing him into an unfamiliar dark place in his head where he suffered a reverberating, painful silence.</p>
<p>He slowly lifted the picture out of the box. The man in the picture was in a military uniform and wearing the very same glasses buried in the bottom of the box. Aldeo stared long, silently and without a single thought in his head as his mother began talking in a shaky, cracked voice, “That is your “real” father…”</p>
<p>As Truda continued speaking, her voice became muffled sounds Aldeo could only perceive, as if his head were submerged beneath the waters of a deep lake. Abruptly and, without warning, the quiet, unfamiliar, dark place in Aldeo’s head was invaded violently by a rapid, spastic and sporadic succession of images, words and moments simultaneously rewinding and fast-forwarding through the last 17 years of his life.</p>
<p>Somewhere between the unrestricted reeling of images and words running through his mind, there surfaced a thought. He realized that he had been possessed by a seething hatred over all of these years for a man who was not his “real” father. The phantom that had driven away from him 11 years ago had been an illusion, a mirage. This thought and many others like shook the earth beneath Aldeo’s feet.</p>
<p>Truda was now crying uncontrollably, repeating incessantly, “Forgive me Aldeo; please forgive me…”</p>
<p>In his mind, thoughts competed with sounds, each alternating forcefully back and forth between one another. Beneath the glasses was a large, folded piece of fragile paper discolored by age. Aldeo unfolded the piece of paper carefully. He now realized that everything in the box had something to do with some aspect of his life. He unfolded the paper and saw that it was a birth certificate containing his first name and his mother’s maiden name. Truda’s name was on the line that read “mother.” The line that read, “father” was blank. The word bastard joined the barrage of unruly thoughts unsettling his mind, having a new context, taking on new meaning.</p>
<p>“Forgive me Aldeo, I love you son, please forgive me…”</p>
<p>His mother’s voice rose and then faded off into the distance as a never-before experienced fiery pain lodged deep in the pit of his stomach, refusing to surface; it churned a stew of hate, hurt and anger that refused to settle but could not rise. His equilibrium was lost, the room and table shifted in opposite directions as he sat across from his mother’s tear-filled, downcast eyes pleading for forgiveness. He could see her lips moving but he could not hear any sounds.</p>
<p>Aldeo’s hands began to tremble as he jerked away from his mother’s outreaching embrace. He breathed in and out an acidic combination of disdain, disgust and disappointment for his mother as warm tears began to form in the burning corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>Truda continued the mantra silent to his ears, “Forgive me Aldeo, I love you my son, please…”</p>
<p>The end</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hombrecito en la Tierra de las Promesas</p>
<p>Aldeo sentó pensativamente al lado opuesto de su madre en la mesa de la pequeña cocina. Trataba de identificar la sonrisa ansioso deformando los labios de su madre. Desde su juventud Aldeo la había servido a su madre como un adulto sustituto con consejos sabio entre sus relaciones con un desfile de hombres diferente. En la mesa de la cocina la madre y su hijo hablaba sobre cosas importantes. Ellos charlaban mientras que bebían leche, café o té. Las manchas de leche, café y té en la superficie de la mesa eran signos de charlas del pasado.</p>
<p>Truda encantaba preparar el té antes de cada charla, un costumbre para ella, pero este día las manos temblaba mientras intentaba poner la tetera en la estufa, creando un sonido disonante cuando los superficies tocaron cada uno.</p>
<p>-¡Mamá ten que decirme lo que te preocupa!-</p>
<p>A lo largo de los años Aldeo había aprendido a tomar el control de sus conversaciones cuando apareció la necesidad y, también, Truda se había acostumbrado a relacionarse a su hijo como un adulto. Cuando Aldeo tuvo 7 años, robaba pan para proporcionar comida a casa; a 12 años de edad luchaba con hombres cuyos avances sexuales su madre había rechazado y ahora tuvo 17 años sentía muy cómodo a llamarse a su mismo un hombre verdadero.</p>
<p>Truda sentó y empezó a tocar, nerviosamente, con una vieja caja para zapatos delante de ella encima de la mesa.</p>
<p>-Lo que tengo que decirte no es fácil mi hijo.-</p>
<p>Mientras hablaba ansiosamente, casi rompió afuera un parte de la caja hecha jirones.</p>
<p>-Mamá- dijo Aldeo con una voz infantil-.  -nunca tengas que tener miedo al hablar conmigo.-</p>
<p>Cogió al otra lado de la mesa y le ofreció a su madre una mano. Cuando ella la recibió, él trataba de consolarla con su toque. Aldeo se puso derecho en la silla para parecer mas alta y empezó hablar a su madre.</p>
<p>-Dime por que tienes carita de pena mamá, dime y te protegeré… te prometo.-</p>
<p>En los ojos de su madre Aldeo veía, por la primera vez, un terror irreconocible cuando comenzó a hablar.</p>
<p>-Lo que tengo que decirte es sobre tu papa.-</p>
<p>Aldeo se estremeció incontrolable por un segundo. De repente sentía temblores por todo el cuerpo. La tema de su padre fue la sola tema que se enojó. Su papa los había abandonado a el y su madre cuando Aldeo tenía 6 años. El fantasma de su papa saliendo la casa por la ultima vez todavía se duele como el momento ocurrió. Su papa salió de la casa hace 11 años y Aldeo no nunca vio ni habló con él desde aquello tiempo. Truda supo que inyectar el nombre de su papa en una conversación cortaría los lesiones emocionales tan profundo de su hijo que no nunca había curado completamente desde su juventud, pero ella tuvo que hablar.</p>
<p>-¡No me hablas de ese hijo de puta!- rugió Aldeo, aporreando un puño en la pequeña mesa.</p>
<p>Inmediatamente él sintió un profundo arrepentimiento por sus palabras y acciones miraba a su madre se retiró en  el miedo. Fue solo durante las charlas acerca de su padre que su madre le permitió a maldecir en su presencia. A lo largo de los años Truda había demostrado un gran tolerancia para la volatilidad de su hijo cuando ellos hablarían de la tema de su padre.</p>
<p>-¡Aldeo!- declaró Truda. -¡Tienes que escuchar lo que tengo que decirte!-</p>
<p>Como ella seguía hablar nerviosamente, a la misma vez empezó a tirar a los bordes de la vieja caja para zapatos de nuevo.</p>
<p>Aldeo notó la ansiedad de su madre mientras ella continuó a tirar, con ansia, a los bordes de la caja. El bajó su voz a un nivel más respetuoso.</p>
<p>-Me disculpas mamá.- murmuró Aldeo en deferencia. –No intenté tenerte miedo, lo siento mamá.-</p>
<p>Trudo siguió hablar mientras lágrimas comenzaron a formarse en los ojos.</p>
<p>-Aldeo.- se detuvo a lloriquear y frotar la nariz. –En este mundo la gente debe ser perdonando a veces por cosas que ha hecho en el pasado. Tu padre…-</p>
<p>Aldeo interrumpió la voz de su madre a la mitad de la frase.</p>
<p>-¡Pero mamá él eligió a dejarnos, no nunca lo perdonará por eso! A causa de él, hemos vivido en las calles, a causa de él hemos sufrido días sin comido…-</p>
<p>Truda escuchaba a su hijo, pero más ansioso y nervioso tiró a los bordes de la caja delante de ella encima la mesa.</p>
<p>-Mamá no puede pedirme a perdonarlo. En mis ojos él no es un hombre verdadero.-</p>
<p>Lentamente, Truda deslizó la caja anciana para zapatos hacía su hijo. En su estado de ansiedad, ella arranco un pedazo de la caja.</p>
<p>-Este es para ti.- susurró ella mientras acariciaba la mano de su hijo alcanzando para la caja.</p>
<p>Los ojos de Truda comenzaron a hincharse y entonces un mar de lágrimas caían rápidamente. Ella desesperadamente trataba de contener la tentación a llora en voz alta. La caja para zapatos era tan viejo, maltratadas y muy arrugada. Fue obvio que la caja había sufrido muchos inspecciones a través de los años pero Aldeo no nunca la había visto antes de hoy.</p>
<p>El silbido de la tetera interrumpió la tensión en el aire. Trudo saltó por su silla y corrió a mover la tetera del fuego. Al instante volvió a la mesa. Hoy no habría preparado nada de té. Aldeo quitó la tapa de la vieja caja para zapatos. Dentro de la caja fue un foto anticuada encima de una colección de objetos sin relacionados: trozos de papal doblado poniendo amarillo, un par de anteojos, insignias militar para un uniforme de un soldado, y un añejo libro pequeño y manoseado cuyas páginas se vuelven marrones en los bordes.</p>
<p>Aldo levantó sus ojos de la caja hacía su madre. –No entiendo mamá, estos no son mis cosas. ¿Por qué me da la basura de otra persona?-</p>
<p>Truda apenas podía hablar por el torrente de lágrimas corriendo baja de sus mejillas. En un voz roto y  llena de pena ella habló.</p>
<p>-Aldeo la foto en la caja es un foto de su padre “verdadero”.-</p>
<p>Las palabras “padre verdadero” chuparon el aire del cuerpo de Aldeo, forzándolo estar situado en un sitio desconocido y oscuro en su mente. En su cabezo Aldeo empezó sufrir un silencio doloroso.</p>
<p>Lentamente levantó la foto de la caja. El hombre en la foto llevaba un uniforme militar y, en su cara, fue las mismas gafas enterrado en el fondo de la caja. Aldeo sentó mirando a la foto, en silencio sin un pensamiento en su cabeza mientras la voz de su madre continuó hablar temblorosa.</p>
<p>-Ese hombre en el foto es su padre…-</p>
<p>Mientras Truda continuó hablar, los oídos de su hijo se quedaron sordo. El podía percibir sola sonidos pequeños como si su cabeza estaba sumergido bajo de las aguas de un lago tan profundo.  De repente, sin advertencia, el silencio en el sitio oscuro de su cabeza fue invadido, violentamente, por una sucesión de imágenes, sonidos y eventos de los últimos 17 años de su vida.</p>
<p>Mientras muchos pensamientos y imágenes corrieron por su cabeza, Aldeo capturó uno. Se dio cuenta que había odiado un hombre que no era una relación a el por muchos años. El fantasma que había salido de la casa hace 11 años fue una ilusión, un espejismo. Este pensamiento y otros movieron la tierra bajo sus pies.</p>
<p>Truda estaba llorando incontrolablemente y repitiendo sin parar: -Me disculpas mi hijo, por favor, me disculpas…-</p>
<p>En su mente muchos pensamientos competían con sonidos e imágenes alternado con fuerza ida y vuelta. En la caja, debajo de las gafas fue un papel doblado, frágiles y marcados por la edad. Aldeo desdobló el papel con cuidado. Ahora se dio cuento que la caja contuvo cosas pertinente a su vida. Después se desdobló el papel, vio que fue un certificado de nacimiento.  Aldeo lo leyó. En la línea reservada para el nombre de la madre vio “Truda” y su apellido de soltera. La línea reservada para el padre fue en blanco.</p>
<p>-Me disculpas, te quiero más que mi vida, por favor, me disculpas…-</p>
<p>La voz de su madre se levantó y se cayó entre silencio y sonidos casi imperceptibles.  Aldo sentía, por la primera vez de su vida, un dolor ardiente depositado profundamente en el estómago. El dolor fue un tóxico mezcla de odio, furia y congoja que se negó tranquilizarse. Aldeo había perdido su orientación en el mundo, alguien lo había robado de su equilibrio. La mesa y la cocina empecían a mover en direcciones opuestos de cada uno. Se sentó del otro lado de su madre. Le caían las lagrimas de ambos Aldeo y su madre ahora. Ella te suplicaba sumamente. Aunque él podía ver los labios moviendo, todavía estaba sufriendo en silencio sin la capacidad oír nada.</p>
<p>Las manos de Aldeo comenzaron a temblar. Cuando su madre le alcanzó, rehuyó con un reflejo violente. Aldeo estaba respirando una combinación ácido de desprecio, el asco y traición para su madre como lagrimas formaban en los rabillos de sus ojos.</p>
<p>Truda continuó su mantra rogando perdón a los oídos sordos de su hijo. -Me disculpas mi hijo… por favor, me disculpas…-</p>
<p>Fin</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" rel="lightbox[922]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-834" title="blog-face" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a>So what should a person do when they can&#8217;t sleep. Hmmmm&#8230;.. maybe finish their creative writing assignment. I&#8217;m a bit miffed with myself because last week I finished the assignment early and then forgot to turn it in. My name appeared on a list with a few other classmates who failed to turn in their assignments as well. Do you know how that feels to have actually done the work and then forget to hand it in? Nobody to blame but myself. I had maintained a perfect record of working my gluttious maximus off and turning assignments in on time up to that point. I guess I&#8217;ll take it as a lesson in realizing that perfection is not the goal (in anything, including life).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m supposed to be sleeping right now. I&#8217;ve got a performance at a middle school in another 6 hours. For some reason the urge to write this evening was overpowering so I got out of bed, came into the office and started doing what I do. Can you hear Big Daddy Kane&#8217;s &#8220;I Work&#8221; playing in the background. If you don&#8217;t know don&#8217;t sweat it. If you do know then you &#8220;feel&#8221; me.</p>
<p>This weeks assignment basically seemed as if we were supposed to create a treatment. For those who aren&#8217;t familiar with the Hollywood lingo out there in the land of LU-LU, a treatment is an outline of a movie (not a script) but an outline used for pitching your ideas. I might be off, I&#8217;m not an &#8220;Industry&#8221; insider guy so anybody feel free to correct me. I played the scene out that I wrote a few times in my head before actually putting pen to paper. It was a cool exercise and I enjoyed it quite a bit.</p>
<p>Below are copies of the story I wrote, one in English the other in Spanish. Some of you seem to be forgetting that this class is really a &#8220;Spanish Creative Writing class.&#8221; I only provide an English translation because, well&#8230; most of &#8220;my&#8221; people don&#8217;t read Spanish. Since so many of you have requested that I continue doing this &#8220;extra&#8221; work by providing you with an English translation, I would appreciate a little feedback from you when you read it. You don&#8217;t have to say anything elaborate of scholarly just a few words on your impression of the work.</p>
<p>As always, any native Spanish Speakers/Readers out there should feel free to correct my corrupted Castillian as you see fit.</p>
<p>If you would rather download the story there are a couple of pdf. links below. Enjoy mis compañeros, adios.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dancer<br />
by Baba the Storyteller</p>
<p>Her fingers delicately traced invisible patterns in the air as she slowly turned in uninhibited, gentle circles. Poised on the toes of a single foot, she traced the outline of her leg with the other from the ankle, continuing up until she was fully extended. She bent at the waist allowing her outstretched arms to mimic the movements of a graceful wingspan. Breaking away from the dance she walked across the practice room floor to begin other exercises. Her stride and bearing were as enchanting as the complex choreography she rehearsed.</p>
<p>Double, triple images of her reflected in the surrounding mirrors, positioning her in my mind, not as a woman, but rather an angelic apparition that I would venerate for a lifetime, if permitted. She extended her right leg up to the wooden bar attached to one of the walled mirrors and began stretching. As she leaned into herself and then away slowly, one arm greeted the ceiling while the other pointed away into a mysterious distance. The fingers of each hand beckoned to the unknown their desire to share the rhythms playing out in her head.</p>
<p>I, an unrefined soul in filthy overalls, stood transfixed with the handle of a mop in one hand and a bucket of filthy water in the other. I could only dream of a woman such as her even daring to touch the hem of the tattered fabric of my life.</p>
<p>An inaudible voice grew louder. The incessant repeating of a word rose from some muted depth to an audible sound before I finally heard it loudly, and clearly.</p>
<p>“Grandpa, Grandpa…what’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>My granddaughter had made her way to her throne, my lap and was trying to proudly show me the pages she had colored in her book. Her voice began to fade once again as I stared into the kitchen.</p>
<p>There she was, just as graceful and fluid in movement as she had been 40 years ago. The arthritic fingers that reached for the cupboard mimicked the delicate drawing in the air of unseen patterns decades ago. As she stood on her toes to reach the higher shelves cabinet, I could see that the graceful elegance of her youth had not faded been a victim of the years. When she walked across the kitchen, it was obvious that time had been incapable of crippling the dancer that existed within her. No longer were there mirrors in every corner of the room reflecting her image. They had now been replaced by the radiance of the sun silhouetting her in a warm frame of light.</p>
<p>She stood looking out the kitchen window. I, an unrefined soul in filthy overalls, sat there transfixed with our granddaughter in my lap trying to show me her colorings. 40 years ago she entered my life. I still savor each second that I am permitted another day to watch her dance as she does through life.</p>
<p>The End</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>La Bailaora<br />
por Baba</p>
<p>Los dedos trazaban diseños invisibles en el aire mientras ella bailaba lentamente en círculos desinhibidos. Se balanceaba sobre los dedos de un solo pie y con movimientos suaves del otro pie ella trazó el contorno de la pierna. Continuó levantar la pierna hasta que la extendió completamente. Se inclinó a la cintura y permitió los brazos extender suavemente para imitar los movimientos de un pájaro grande con una envergadura tan linda.</p>
<p>Ella paró su baile y atravesó el piso de la sala para comenzar la práctica de otros ejercicios. Su zancada contuvo la misma energía y belleza como la coreografía que ella había ensayado.</p>
<p>Uno, dos y tres imágenes de ella reflejaban en los espejos situado por todos partes en el cuarto. En mi mente ella no nunca existía como una mujer nada más. Ahora ella me parecía como una aparición angelical que yo veneraría por toda mi vida si me permitió.</p>
<p>Ella extendió una pierna sobre una barra de madera adosado al pared y comenzó a estirarse. Mientras se inclinó el torso hacia adelante y luego hacia atrás, ella saludó el techo con las manos. Los dedos de cada mano parecían a llamar una persona desconocido a venir y compartir su alegría.</p>
<p>Yo estaba de pie paralizado, un alma inculto, en ropa sucia con fregona en la mano derecha y un cubo de agua mugrienta en la mano izquierda. Sólo podía soñar de una mujer como ella tocando el borde de la tela de mi vida hecho jirones.</p>
<p>Una voz inaudible se hizo más fuerte. La incesante repetición de una palabra se levantó de un sitio de silencio completa. Finalmente la escuché.</p>
<p>-Abuelito, abuelito &#8230; ¿qué te pasa abuelito?-</p>
<p>Mi nieta había subido su trono, mi regazo, y ahora trataba de mostrarme un dibujo que había creado. De nuevo su voz comenzó a debilitarse mientras yo miraba hacia la cocina.</p>
<p>Allí, en la cocina, estaba mi bailaora. Ella tuvo la misma elegante de movimientos que poseyó hace 40 años. Los dedos, artríticos ahora, alcanzó al armario en la misma manera que trazaban diseños invisibles en el aire hace décadas. Mientras estaba de puntillas para llegar los estantes más altos yo pude ver que los años no se habían robado de su graciosa. Cuando caminaba por la cocina, era obvio que el tiempo no había tenido la capacidad a paralizar la bailaora que vivía dentro de ella. No hay nunca más espejos por todas partes para reflejar su imagen. Los espejos han sido sustituido por los brillantes reyes del sol que ayudan formar su silueta delante de la ventana en la cocina.</p>
<p>Yo soy un alma inculto. Trabajé toda mi vida en ropa sucia y, ahora, me sentí aquí paralizado con nuestra nieta en mi regazo. Hace 40 años esa bailaora entró en mi vida. Saboreo cada segundo que tengo aire en el cuerpo porque me ha sido permitido más tiempo para mirarla bailar una vez más.</p>
<p>fin</p>

I&#8217;ve heard back from 3 different sources that the company that painted the mural is called &#8220;Flying Colors&#8221; and is located in Northern California. Anybody up there in Northern California happen to know anyone who works for &#8220;Flying Colors&#8221; graphic design company?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be heartbreaking to locate the artist and discovery that I wasn&#8217;t the muse for the section of the wall titled &#8220;Imagine.&#8221; We&#8217;re closer than before. I&#8217;ll let you all know what I come up with but until then, you be the judge. I&#8217;ve placed my images next to the mural for a little &#8220;side-by-side&#8221; comparison.</p>
<p>Come on guys, who else could it be? I mean really!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" rel="lightbox[902]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-834" title="blog-face" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a>Ok I know some of you were wondering why haven&#8217;t I submitted the most recent story that I wrote for the next assignment. Well the truth of the matter is that I, literally, hate what I wrote. If it weren&#8217;t an assignment I would ball it up and throw it in the trash! This process gets to be really aggravating, frustrating, at times. Last week we were focusing on &#8220;Minimalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>I love minimalist art (i.e. sculpting, painting, mixed-media, design, etc.) but, for some reason, when it comes to literature, I can&#8217;t stand it as a literary style. I&#8217;m just being honest, or maybe closed minded (you choose).</p>
<p>I promised that I would be as transparent as possible through this process so I am attaching what I wrote below. There is an English version as well as Spanish version.</p>
<p>Since the actual class is based in Madrid and is conducted in Spanish I&#8217;ve begun to focus more on being as creative as possible with the Spanish versions. Following the advice of  my professor &#8220;Jesús el Terrible;&#8221; I&#8217;ve begun writing my assignments out in Spanish first. I&#8217;m trying to re-wire my brain to process poetically in Spanish primarily as opposed to translating everything. Headaches are part and parcel of the deal. So if you read in both languages you&#8217;ll notice that the English and Spanish versions read nothing alike. Well, maybe close but definitely distinct from one another.</p>
<p>As always I look forward to your input as I suffer through this dissonant process.</p>
<p>Dooni dooni kononi be nyaga da.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Isabella yearned for her daughter Ana to understand the difference between wants and needs.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to understand Ana that the world does not evolve around you and your teenage life!”</p>
<p>“Mom! All of this drama because I needed money to buy a new CD?”</p>
<p>“No Ana, there you go again. You “want” that new cd. You don’t “need” it.”</p>
<p>Ana began walking around agitated circles in the kitchen as her mother sat calmly.</p>
<p>“Mom, I’m not stupid! Ok I want the cd but what I need is a new dress for next weeks dance.”</p>
<p>No Ana, you don’t “need” a new dress. You “want” a new dress.”</p>
<p>“But Mom everyone has already seen me in all of my other dresses!”</p>
<p>“Ana there are people in the world who really need things like food, shelter and medicine. It is not good to think of a dress is an equivalent need. Ana you “want” a dress, you don’t “need” a dress.”</p>
<p>“Ahhhhhhh! Mom you don’t understand! You just don’t get it!</p>
<p>“No Ana, you are the one not understanding. Knowing the difference between wants and needs is very important to becoming a mature adult.”</p>
<p>“Well I heard you tell dad the other day that you needed him to spend less time at the office and more time at home.”</p>
<p>“Yes Ana I did say that.”</p>
<p>“Well mom I think you “want” dad to spend less time at the office and more time at home. You don’t “need” dad here at home more!”</p>
<p>“Ana I “need” your father to spend more time here at home with our family and less time at the office.”</p>
<p>“No you don’t Mom! We have food; we have shelter and medicine if we need it! So according to you everything else is a “want.”</p>
<p>“You will understand when you are older Ana, but for right now you just have to understand that saying you “need” everything is not good.”</p>
<p>“I don’t say I “need” everything!”</p>
<p>“That’s not the point Ana.”</p>
<p>“Mom you’re not making any points your just tell me that your “needs” are more important than my “needs”.”</p>
<p>“Ana go to your room and we will discuss this later!”</p>
<p>Ana storms out of the kitchen, down the hall, through the living room and up the stairs. As she is ascending the stairs, she passes her father who is on his way down. They stop, embrace at the midway point of the stairs.</p>
<p>“Good morning Daddy.”</p>
<p>“Good morning baby.”</p>
<p>He kisses her on the forehead.</p>
<p>“I love you Daddy.”</p>
<p>“I love you to baby.”</p>
<p>He hugs his daughter a little tighter.</p>
<p>“Daddy?”</p>
<p>“Yes baby.”</p>
<p>“I really need a new dress for next weeks dance.”</p>
<p>“Oh ok baby.”</p>
<p>Her father reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a wallet, handing her a wad of cash.</p>
<p>“Enjoy your shopping baby.”</p>
<p>“I will daddy.”</p>
<p>Ana bounds down the steps and runs out of the front door to head to the mall just as her father enters the kitchen.</p>
<p>The End</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Isabel anhelaba que su hija fuera entender la diferencia entre deseos y necesidades.</p>
<p>-¡Ana tienes que comprender que tu no eres el centro del mundo!-</p>
<p>-¡Mamá! ¿Me castigas porque necesito un CD de Alejandro Sanz?-</p>
<p>-No Ana estás exagerando de nuevo. &#8220;Deseas&#8221; el nuevo CD no lo &#8220;necesitas.”-</p>
<p>Ana comenzó a caminar en círculos pequeños, agitadas, en la cocina mientras su madre quedó con calma.</p>
<p>-¡Mamá no soy tonto! Entiendo que el CD no es algo que necesito. De hecho Mamá lo que necesito es un vestido nuevo para la fiesta que viene la semana próxima.-</p>
<p>-No Ana tu no &#8220;necesitas&#8221; un vestido nuevo. Tu &#8220;deseas&#8221; un vestido nuevo. -</p>
<p>-¡Pero Mamá todo el mundo ya me ha visto en todos mis otros vestidos!-</p>
<p>-Ana hay gente en el mundo que realmente necesitan cosas como comida, refugio y medicinas. No es bueno pensar en un vestido como una necesidad equivalente. Ana &#8220;deseas&#8221; un vestido nuevo, no lo &#8220;necesitas&#8221;.-</p>
<p>-¡Ai Mamá no entiendes nada! ¡Eres vieja y no entiendes las maneras modernas!-</p>
<p>-Ana yo creo que tu no entiendes. Saber la diferencia entre deseos y necesidades es muy importante para convertirte en un adulto. -</p>
<p>-Mamá te he oído decir a papá que necesitas que el pase menos tiempo en la oficina y más tiempo en casa. –</p>
<p>-Sí Ana le ha dicho eso. –</p>
<p>-Pues mamá yo pienso que &#8220;deseas&#8221; papá a pasar menos tiempo en la oficina y más tiempo en casa. No “necesitas” que papá pasar más tiempo en casa.-</p>
<p>-No Ana necesito que tu padre pasar más tiempo aquí en casa con nuestra familia y menos tiempo en la oficina.-</p>
<p>-¡No, no mamá tenemos comida y una casa! ¡Podemos obtener medicina si la necesitamos! Así según tu manera de pensar mamá todas las otras cosas son solo deseos.-</p>
<p>-Vas a entender cuando seas mayor Ana. Ahora solo tienes que entender es que decir que necesitas todas las cosas no es bueno.-</p>
<p>-¡Ai mamá no siempre digo que necesito cosas!-</p>
<p>-Ana estás entiendo el propósito de nuestra conversación.-</p>
<p>-¡Mamá tu no estás hablándome con claridad! ¡Solo oigo que me dices que tu tienes “necesidades” y yo tengo “deseos”!-</p>
<p>-¡Bastante! ¡Ana vayas a tu habitación y nos hablaremos de eso más tarde!-</p>
<p>Ana irrumpió de la cocina, por el pasillo y a través de la sala. Subía las escaleras a la misma vez que su padre las descendía. Ellos se detuvieron y se abrazaron en el punto medio de las escaleras.</p>
<p>-Buenos días papá.-</p>
<p>-Buenos días princesa.-</p>
<p>Él le dio una besa en la frente.</p>
<p>-Te quiero mucho papá.-</p>
<p>-Te quiero mucho también princesa.-</p>
<p>El papá la abrazó a su hija con un poco más vigor cariñoso.</p>
<p>-¿Papá?-</p>
<p>-Sí princesa.-</p>
<p>-Necesito un vestido nuevo para la fiesta la semana que viene.-</p>
<p>-¡Por supuesto princesa!-</p>
<p>Su padre alcanzó en el bolsillo de su chaqueta y sacó una billetera. El padre le dio a su hija un montón de dinero en efectivo.</p>
<p>-Disfrutes tu misma mientras ir de compras mi princesa.-</p>
<p>-¡Absolutamente papá!-</p>
<p>Ana saltó por las escaleras y salió rápidamente por la entrada a la casa. En la misma segunda que ella estaba cerrando la puerta de la casa, su padre estaba abriendo la puerta de la cocina.</p>

A friend told me about this mural painted on the side of one of the walls at the Victoria Gardens Cultural Center, inside near the theater. When I finally got around to going out and checking it out I was honestly in awe.  I didn&#8217;t even know the painting existed nor do I know what painted it. You guys be the judge, is this me or some other griot who happens to be wearing &#8220;my&#8221; clothes?</p>
<p>Also, if anyone out there knows the person who painted it could you please contact me and give me their information? I&#8217;d love to meet this artist just to know if I served as &#8220;inspiration.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll make this even more interesting. Whomever gets me this artist&#8217;s contact info first, I will mail a free CD. How&#8217;s that for motivation? LOL!!!</p>
<p>Anyway does it look like me or not? Give me your input.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok, because it is occurring so regularly now I am forced to write this short note to my blog readers. I just got another one of those emails and so I will answer you all. No, the characters that I am writing about are not &#8220;me.&#8221; I have to tell you that I have never run through a cemetery naked being chased by police and I have never, as an adult, raised my hand to ask another adult for permission to go to the bathroom. I hope this little note settles that little question that keeps popping up.</p>

This last assignment was about creating a character and building upon the traits and characteristics of the character without brazingly throwing them up in the readers face. How to describe your character by using his/her descriptions to move the action of the story along. I really summarize the heck out of the class instructions but I feel like the majority of ya&#8217;ll get me. The two stories are attached below and title: &#8220;Incarcerated?&#8221; (the English version) and &#8220;¿Encarcelado?&#8221; (the Spanish version). Yes I know, I know&#8230; why write what language each version! Right? Well if you got some of the emails I get you would play to the lowest common denominator as well.</p>
<p>Anyway, let me know what ya&#8217;ll think. If you are reading the Spanish version and just want to correct my grammar, spelling, etc. for good measure, please go ahead. I am not faint hearted.</p>
<p>Well, off to the next assignment. Yes&#8230;already.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Incarcerated?</p>
<p>I was trembling. My body shivered uncontrollably, nerves disquieted by things I had little or no control over. I sat stewing in a rage of irrepressible anger, the walls closing in on me. I had never in my life experienced claustrophobia but this sudden affliction of terror blended with agitation that had taken hold of me were its’ unmistakable symptoms. I labored to breath; sweat forming on my forehead. My mouth had dried out to an unfamiliar and troubling point of discomfort. I felt as though I was losing control.</p>
<p>All of these disquieting emotions erupted from within me I sat caged within the confines of my office cubicle reading management’s most recent memo</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Due to an incessant abuse of lavatory break privileges, all requests for relief from one’s workstation must be channeled through supervisors without exception. &#8221;<br />
</em></p>
<p>I read it once, twice and then a third time to make sure I understood what I was reading. Management was telling me that I, a grown man and father of three, had to ask another person’s permission to go the bathroom!</p>
<p>My hands were shaking as I clutched the piece of paper, contemplating the indignity. I was experiencing a violent flood of emotions of which anger was the most prominent. The ringing of the phone on the tiny desk before me interrupted my incendiary thoughts. I only had 7 seconds to answer the phone according to company policy. The tangled, spiraling chord tethered to my ear from the automated phone assured that the policy would be strictly adhered to. I transformed instantaneously and answered in the appropriate, gentle tone that the company had trained us to use.</p>
<p>“How may I help you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“My children don’t visit me any longer…” the caller spoke continuing her tepid tirade in an incoherent skip from one topic of her family to another.</p>
<p>This was a “time-killing” call. That’s what the company labeled these types of calls. Calls from the elderly abandoned in nursing homes or left to their own devices by family was common. I had 15 seconds to get her off of the line according to company policy or suffer a reprimand from one of the supervisor’s monitoring the call. I followed the script given to us during training and ended with, “thank you for calling ma’am and I hope we are able to meet your needs sometime in the future,” before disconnecting the call. I have no doubt that she called back. They all do.</p>
<p>In my nervousness to answer the call I had dropped the memo. I retrieved it from the floor and re-read it.</p>
<p>Once again my heart began its’ agitated palpitations and the feeling of breathlessness returned. How humiliating to be a grown man and have to ask another adult for permission to go to the bathroom! Over the years the company had implemented one policy after another, whose only purpose seemed to be to feed on our souls.</p>
<p>I pounded my fist on the desk and propelled my little chair on wheels forward slamming my knees into the jumble of computer and metal recording equipment hanging underneath. The searing pain raced from my right knee throughout the rest of my body. I winced grabbing my knee. Once a month I unconsciously punished myself this way, trying to fit into a cubicle created for someone half my size.</p>
<p>This was the final straw and I would protest this as I had done many things in my youth. When I had been a young man I was fearless, yelling in the face of any and all injustices I encountered. I would not stand for this assault on my dignity!</p>
<p>I could feel the anxiety lessening and that old familiar rebellious fire in my belly rising to the surface. That fire was what I knew I was made of. That fire produced a fearlessness within me that was needed if I were to challenge the inhumane policies of this corporate Goliath.</p>
<p>As I looked up from the nurturing of my right knee the images of my family in small frames greeted me. My wife and three children, all smiles and shining brightly in images from a day at the beach. My heart melted.</p>
<p>One beautiful woman and three adoring children were all the ones responsible for taming the rebellious beast of my youth. I smiled.</p>
<p>“I love being a father,” I thought to myself, “whatever sacrifices were required to care for my family I would make.”</p>
<p>Family. They were my reason for getting up each morning and coming to this place. They were the ones who gave meaning to my daily ritual of subservience.</p>
<p>Slowly, I began raising my hand. The higher my hand went in the air, the lower to the ground my dignity crawled.</p>
<p>I had to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>The end</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>¿Encarcelado?</p>
<p>Yo estaba temblando. Me estremecía.  Me agitaba sobre cosas que no había ningún control. Me sentaba dentro de mi mismo hirviendo con pensamientos enojados. Me sentía como los muros volvieron cerca del cuerpo. Nunca en mi vida me había sentido la claustrofobia, pero ahora esta aflicción de terror mezclado con la agitación me había agarrado. Trataba de respirar y el sudor se formaban en el piel. La boca se había secado a un punto que la me molestaba. Me sentí como si me faltaba el control.</p>
<p>Todas estas emociones inquietantes estalló dentro de mí me. Me sentaba como si situé enjaulado dentro de mi cubículo. Estaba leyendo una nota nuestros gerentes.</p>
<p><em>-Debido a un abuso incesante de privilegios, todos las solicitudes para descansar de visitar el cuarto de baño y estar afuera de su estación de trabajo debe ser canalizada a través de los supervisores, sin excepción –</em></p>
<p>Lo leí una vez, dos veces y luego una tercera vez para asegurarme de que yo entendía lo que estaba leyendo. ¡Los gerentes me decían que yo, un hombre adulto y padre de tres hijos, tuvo que pedir el permiso a otra persona para ir al baño!</p>
<p>Las manos temblaban mientras yo agarraba el pedazo de papel, contemplando la indignidad. Que estaba sintiendo una violenta inundación de emociones. El timbre del teléfono encima de mi pequeña mesa de trabajo interrumpió mis pensamientos incendiarios. Sólo tenía 7 segundos para contestar el teléfono según un política de la compañía. La cuerda enmarañada y espiral atado al oído desde el teléfono aseguró que yo seguiría la política estrictamente. Me transformé a mi mismo instantáneamente y contesté con el tono suave que la compañía nos había entrenado para usar.</p>
<p>¿En qué puedo ayudarle? &#8221; Le pregunté con una voz dulce.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mis hijos no me visitan&#8230;&#8221; la anciana por el teléfono continuaba hablar palabras incoherentes sobre su familia.</p>
<p>Esta tipo de interacción fue conocido como un &#8220;asesino de tiempo&#8221; por la compañía. Las llamadas de los ancianos abandonados en asilos o extranjeros era común. Tenía 15 segundos para sacarla de la línea según la política de la empresa o sufrir una reprimenda de uno los supervisores. Seguí el guión que ellos nos habían dado a los gerentes durante el entrenamiento. Terminó la llamada con las palabras, -Gracias por llamar señora y espero que sean capaces de satisfacer sus necesidades en el futuro.- antes de desconectarla. No tuve ninguna duda de que ella volvería a llamar. Todos lo hacen.</p>
<p>Por que mi nerviosismo para contestar la llamada rápidamente yo caí la nota de la compañía. Lo encontré en el suelo y volví a leerlo.</p>
<p>Una vez más, el corazón empezó las palpitaciones agitado y la sensación de ahogar devuelto. ¡Qué humillación para un hombre adulto y tenía que pedir a otro adulto permiso para ir al baño! A lo largo de los años la compañía había sido comiendo pedazos de nuestros almas con políticas como esa.</p>
<p>¡Golpeé el puño sobre el escritorio! Con fuerza me propulsé a mi mismo a mi sillita de ruedas hacia delante. Golpeé las rodillas en el revoltijo de equipo y aparatos de control de metal colgando debajo la mesa. El intenso dolor corrió de la rodilla derecha por el resto del cuerpo. Hice una mueca agarrando la rodilla. Una vez al mes sin conciencia me castigué a mi mismo de esta manera, intentando de encajar en un cubículo creado para alguien media de mis tamaños.</p>
<p>Este tuvo terminar inmediatamente y protestaría esta política de la compañía como había protestado muchas cosas cuando yo era joven. Cuando yo era un hombre joven, no tenía ningún temor a gritar en la cara de injusticia. ¡Yo no permitiría este asalto a mi dignidad!</p>
<p>Podía sentir la disminución de la ansiedad. Este viejo fuego de rebelión estaba creciendo en la vientre. Ese fuego era lo que yo sabía que estaba hecho. Este fuego tuvo la habilidad de producir una ferocidad dentro de mí que necesitaría si yo quise a desafiar las políticas inhumanas de este Goliat.</p>
<p>Mientras levantaba la cabeza hacia arriba de pensar en el dolor de la rodilla derecha,  me saludaron por imágenes de mi familia enmarcados. Mi esposa y tres hijos, todos sonriendo brillante y intensamente en las fotos de un día en la playa. Las fotos conmoví.</p>
<p>Una bella mujer y tres hijos adorables fueron responsables de domar la bestia de rebelión de mi juventud. Sonreí.</p>
<p>-Me encanta ser un padre- yo pensé, -Cualquier sacrificios eran necesarios para servir a mi familia yo haría.-</p>
<p>Familia. Ellos fueron mi razón para levantarme cada mañana y salir a nuestro hogar para trabajar. Ellos me ayudaron sobrevivir mi ritual diario de sumisión.</p>
<p>Poco a poco comencé a levantar la mano arriba.</p>
<p>Tuve que ir al baño.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" rel="lightbox[885]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-834" title="blog-face" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a>I&#8217;ve made it to the halfway point! I&#8217;m pushing forward on this and doing all right. I just got a note from our professor encouraging me, letting me know that I&#8217;m doing well, especially coming to the course from another language.</p>
<p>I remember I said that I would attach the newly written stories to the post but I&#8217;m going to have to back off maybe just for this one story. I went way out of my comfort zone on this story and there is a lot of, how shall I put this, &#8220;colorful&#8221; language and adult topics. I&#8217;m sensitive to what I put out because a lot of kids frequent my site.</p>
<p>I titled this new story &#8220;Grave Error&#8221; and it&#8217;s a little twisted. Like I said, &#8220;out of my zone of comfort.&#8221; If any of you would like to read it then just send me an email to Baba(at)babathestoryteller.com and I&#8217;ll forward you it as a Word file.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try to tone it down on the next assignment so that it can be posted to the blog. For those of you who do take the time to read it, please send me a little feedback. Also, let me know if you want the English version or the Spanish version.</p>
<p>It is a strange thing to have to admit but, as difficult and torturous as this process of writing creatively in a foreign language is, I&#8217;m actually enjoying it. Yes, I know I complain from time to time but I am human after all. Right?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" rel="lightbox[874]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-834" title="blog-face" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a>This assignment almost wrecked me. You would think that by the 5th assignment I would get into some kind of groove or something but noooo. I&#8217;m not sure what is wrong with me. I&#8217;ve always been the type that, if something got easier for me, then I would attempt it again, but do it standing on my head. Is there a personality type for that? Hmmm&#8230; can you say &#8220;lacking in higher levels of intelligence?&#8221; Ok enough ranting. Attached are the stories that I wrote for the current assignment. I was able to get it to flow alright in English but the Spanish version is a total re-write. I could not, in spite of hours of torment, get the two stories to have the same rhythm. I had to put the English version aside because I will edit  and re-edit, read and re-read until the cows come home.</p>
<p>I am proud to say one thing though. I have outgrown a few of my old Spanish dictionaries. That is a good feeling. I&#8217;ve purchased a new one called &#8220;Real Academia Española&#8221; and it has a really nice hardcover. Now I&#8217;m in search of an equivalent reference book containing Spanish synonyms and antonyms. Ooops&#8230; geek alert! I caught myself! Sorry ya&#8217;ll. I have to remember that people who get excited about reference manuals and materials are in the minority.</p>
<p>You guys can read the attached stories and let me know what you think. Be nice because I labored over these like you wouldn&#8217;t believe, even though it may not seem like it.</p>

Alright I have been writing for almost 9 straight hours! Who does this? In the current assignment we&#8217;re supposed to engage the senses of the reader. The reader should be able to see, touch, taste and smell from the narrative.  That&#8217;s an oversimplification of the professor&#8217;s instructions but I&#8217;m sure most of you get the point.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;m writing, I keep going off on tangents. It seems easy enough but my mind keeps doing battle with competing thoughts. A one point an overwhelming, almost rabid desire to hunt down some chocolate chip cookies hijacked my thought processes.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t ask. Yes I did and it was not a pretty sight.</p>
<p>To those of you who have written me words of encouragement, thank you sooooo much! Sistah Fair you are truly a gift from the ancestors. Charles I think we are starting for form a fraternal writing bond that might be long lasting. What do you think?</p>
<p>Anyway, I needed a second to vent and this is usually where I do it. It&#8217;s funny when you think about it. I have spent more than 9 hours today writing and then, in order to vent, I go on my blog and write some more. Insane huh?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m almost finished with this assignment. As soon as I finish I will post it as an attachment to the next blog &#8220;Initiatory Process VII.&#8221; Oh yeah, I&#8217;ll post an English and Spanish version as usual.</p>
<p>Two more months of the class. I&#8217;ve completed each assignment thus far. Will I make it all the way through? We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p>Con cada ejercicio puedo ver que mi vocabulario español esta creciendo.  Aunque he sido hablar español desde 20 años esta bien retar yo mismo de  nuevo. Poco a poco se va lejos! ¿Verdad?</p>

I had more trouble than usual trying to figure out how to address my reader in 2nd person. One thing that I&#8217;m noticing though is that my Spanish vocabulary is improving by leaps and bounds. I&#8217;m being forced to spend a great deal of time in conversing with the other students in the on-line forum and their Spanish is absolutely flawless.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been speaking Spanish for over 20 years and this is really challenging for me. Although I&#8217;m getting agitated through the process, I&#8217;m loving the results. So typical huh?</p>
<p>Attached are two pdf&#8217;s of the story that I created. One is in English and the other is in Spanish. The title of the story is &#8220;Becoming a Champion.&#8221; I think I did alright but it is definitely not my best work. Part of this process is putting yourself out there so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing. Feels a bit unsettling.</p>
<p>English readers let me know what you think about the story and Spanish readers let me know what you think as well. If any of the Spanish readers feel like editing or correcting any of my errors then don&#8217;t hesitate. I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing all of your critiques.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to go have a tall cool class of water, stare up into the sky and do nothing for a little bit. I&#8217;ve earned it.</p>

Who writes in 2nd person anymore? This next assignment we&#8217;re supposed to create a narrative in 2nd person. I &#8220;hate&#8221; writing in 2nd person and to write creatively in Spanish is even more onerous to me. I don&#8217;t use the word hate too often but when I do I really mean it.</p>
<p>Ok, breath&#8230; think. Don&#8217;t let this get to me. I can do this.</p>
<p>Deep long inhale,  hold it and now a slow long breath out.</p>
<p>Alright. I&#8217;m cool now. The whole point of an initiatory process is acceptance. Poco a poco se va lejos. ¿Verdad? Little by little one goes far. Right?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to have to mull this over for a little while to figure out what it is that I will write about. The last time I read something in 2nd person was &#8220;Fight Club&#8221; and that was bizarre experience.</p>
<p>Wow&#8230; I call myself a storyteller and I started out wining like a little&#8230; hmmm, like a little what? Oh well, forget it, move on because that&#8217;s what a champion would do. Did Ali bow out in Manila? No he didn&#8217;t and I&#8217;m sure that was a hell of a lot harder than contemplating writing your story in 2nd person.</p>
<p>Alright. I&#8217;m purged. I can move on now. I&#8217;m going to take a little time to think and then, without any hesitation and I&#8217;m going to sit my but down and write. After I&#8217;ve exhausted myself writing I&#8217;ll write some more.</p>
<p>See ya&#8217;ll soon swith whatever I come up with.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" rel="lightbox[843]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-834" title="blog-face" src="http://babathestoryteller.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/blog-face.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="175" /></a>Denial seems so much easier than acceptance. I can feel this level of denial surging up through me when reading the critiques of the professor. Intellectually, I know it is there but psychologically it still wants a dominant role. I have to admit my errors.</p>
<p>In my first assignment I was a bit lazy. I wrote one draft, didn&#8217;t check the grammar or pacing of the story. I was just happy to have it finished. I sent it off and washed my hands of it. That was until I got the critique back from the professor who basically told me that my use of the Castillian language in writing was &#8220;tan pobre (oh so poor)&#8221;. Do you know what it feels like to a storyteller to be told that his use of &#8220;any&#8221; language is &#8220;poor.&#8221; I was devastated but knew that the error had been all mine. When I write in English I, painstakingly, take my time to examine each little nuance of every word, placement of adjectives, adverbs etc. Why hadn&#8217;t I done this when writing in Spanish?</p>
<p>The answer is simple but not flattering. I was scared. Fear was a factor in writing my first assignment and when I got to the end of writing it, I just wanted it to go away, leave me alone.</p>
<p>For the second assignment we were required to examine a singular moment in time and illustrate it as best we could by using the sights, sounds, smells of the incident to pull the reader in. I chose to write on what happened with my family and I during the 92 Riots here in LA.</p>
<p>I am pleased to say that the professor gave me a glowing review of the second exercise. He basically said that I must have worked like a madman in order to make such improvement. Do you see me smiling?</p>
<p>I actually did work like someone possessed. I couldn&#8217;t see myself doing less than I was capable of (fear or no fear). I have been speaking Spanish for more than 20 years but I realize, now more than ever, that speaking and writing creatively are two very different disciplines. I, literally, spent an entire day checking and re-checking my sentence structure, grammar, word usage, etc.</p>
<p>Knowledge and wisdom are not the same. I feel like I possessed a great deal of knowledge when it came to writing in Spanish but, through this initiatory process; I feel like I may gain a little of wisdom if I keep pushing on.</p>
<p><textarea style="display: none;">If anyone wants to read it, just email me or get me a message and I&#8217;ll send it to you. </textarea></p>
