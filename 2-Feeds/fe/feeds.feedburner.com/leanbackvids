It's day 4 of the 6th annual <a href="http://www.bandwidth.com/">Bandwidth.com</a> ski trip and four of us (Dave, Henry, Joe, and Dan) make a second attempt to go heli skiing.  The first attempt got cancelled because of high winds but on this day
we score bluebird skies and some of the best powder of the season.  We couldn't have asked for more for our first heli skiing experience!]]></description>

It's always a perfect scenario when a night's storm gives way to a powder filled, bluebird morning.  We decided to return to the peak of Whistler Mountain to seek out our share of the untouched.  Our search led us to an off trail gulley where we pushed through lactic acid build-up, baby trees and sinkholes, and had some truly memorable runs.]]></description>

This video contains footage from our second and third days in Whistler.  There were a few inches of new snow each day, but visibility was generally poor across both mountains.  The first day we took laps in Blackcomb’s two terrain parks.  On the second day, we tried to hide the warning signs from our friend Rob and took Whistler’s peak chair to the wind blown summit.  Stay tuned for Part II of this video for a sunny powder day.]]></description>

After receiving 14.5 feet of snow in the month of January, the weather in the Cascade Mountains switched to wind and rain - causing us to miss the Baker Banked Slalom this year.  Instead, we had high hopes of returning to Crystal Mountain's South Backcountry.  Sadly, the wind returned and caused many of the upper chairs to close that week but the sunny views of Mt.

Aspen may be a haven for the rich and famous, but the week of the X Games brings in a whole new crowd.  After driving from Denver, we headed straight to Snowmass for some fun in the sun.  There was a full supply of PBR to keep the party alive, and we made sure to hit up the industry parties.  The first night was the Mountain Dew MDX party, which required a cold gondola ride up on Aspen Mountain.  The second night was Powder Magazine's 6th Annual Video and Reader Poll Awards where we got to rub elbows with some of the best skiers and filmers in the world.  Finally on the last day in Aspen, we made it over to the X Games to watch the ski slopestyle turned big air contest.  All in all it was a good trip, although we're not sure we've fully recovered yet.]]></description>

A trip to Denver to visit family always includes a day at Vail.  Once you get there, and swallowed the $82 lift fare, you're free to track up the 5289 available acres.  On this day, the Sun was generous and it basked the back bowels with it's "thermonuclear love".  What a sight for these Northwestern eyes.]]></description>

We apologize for the delay in video releases, but Mother Nature has been pounding the Cascade Mountains with wind and rain for weeks.  The good news is that the wait is over and we were rewarded with an epic powder day.  With over 2 feet of new snow in 48 hours, Crystal Mountain offers terrain that rivals any resort in the world.  We got fresh lines all day long by making laps around the upper mountain, and it was snowing so much that our tracks were filling in every hour.  The best run was by far Exterminator, a double-black diamond back to the frontside that is accessible via a small hike up from Iceberg's Ridge.  Stay tuned for upcoming videos from Vail/Breckenridge, SIA.06 SnowSports Trade Show in Vegas, Winter X Games in Aspen and The Legendary Mt. Baker Banked Slalom.]]></description>

As season pass holders, we had to make the trip up to <a href="http://ridertech.com/map/?lat=47.745&#038;lon=-121.091&#038;zoom=4">Stevens Pass</a> for opening day even though they only opened two lifts (Hogsback and Skyline).  Actually three lifts were running, but the Daisy chair doesn't count.  It seems odd that Stevens didn't open up more lifts for opening day, yet they announced others would be open for Day 2.  Too bad it was 40 degrees and raining the next day.   With the past week's snowfall, there were plenty of fresh tracks to be made if you got there early and more hidden in the infamous secret spots.]]></description>

With over 5,000 rideable acres, Vail offers something for everyone.  The 2004-05 season was horrible for the Pacific Northwest, but we arrived in Colorado a few days after a big snow dump and were greeted with warm sunshine in Vail.  After touring the frontside, we hit up the infamous Back Bowls for the remainder of the afternoon.

Mountain biking is very popular here in Washington, although we're out of shape and tend to prefer going downhill. Located just minutes outside Seattle there is a small network of trails in and around Saint Edward State Park. The single track trails vary in difficulty and skilled riders have built up technical obstacles if you get bored. This is a quick video from a lunchbreak session.]]></description>
