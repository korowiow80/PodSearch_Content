He is an architect and energy consultant with the The Stardust Center for Affordable Homes and the Family, a project initiated by Arizona State University which seeks to promote housing that is affordable, dignified and environmentally and culturally responsive.  Ernesto has been integral in the design, build and monitoring of the two homes created by the Stardust Center, the Nageezi House and the Guadalupe House.   Both of these homes demonstrate the importance of a whole systems approach to the design of conscientious housing.   Today, we are going to look at  two systems that are especially important in these homes -- the air handling system and the social system.  Air handling is how clean, healthy air moves through the home, providing ventilation, heating and cooling.  The social system considers how a home allows for social interaction both within it and outside of it as it connects to the surrounding community.   Both air and social interaction are essential, both are life-giving and when they are part of the design of the home, they allow for the inhabitants to be healthier, happier and more connected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8ZLNC9FyM_g/R30GDqCNIEI/AAAAAAAAAH8/Sh3oMFdt-I8/s1600-h/Guadalupe+House.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8ZLNC9FyM_g/R30GDqCNIEI/AAAAAAAAAH8/Sh3oMFdt-I8/s400/Guadalupe+House.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5151280208674627650" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To learn more about The Stardust Center for Affordable Homes and the Family and the Nageezi and Guadalupe homes, check out the following links.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.asu.edu/stardust/"&gt;http://www.asu.edu/stardust/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gallupindependent.com/2005/august/080905home.html"&gt;http://www.gallupindependent.com/2005/august/080905home.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://researchmag.asu.edu/2007/04/building_dreams.html"&gt;http://researchmag.asu.edu/2007/04/building_dreams.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two songs used in today's program are both about air --  our connection to the air we breathe and our connection to the people around us who share the same air.

Sustainability is such a buzz word these days particularly as the idea of green design becomes more desirable and more profitable, whether its for the right or wrong reasons.  There are many definitions of what it means to be sustainable; many involve our  consumption and the waste we create, at the beginning, middle and end of a product's or service's life cycle. Our close, and often problematic relationship with the waste we produce is not a new one. However it has grown to be a bigger issue as the amount of waste we produce has grown exponentially. Our modus operandi to date has been to look to technology to try to solve our waste problems.  And while technology has offered some help, it has served as a band-aid solution for a much larger, more complex issue.  At the root of it is our deep connection to things, to the objects we buy and keep around us and then tire of and throw out for the newer, better versions that come along.  Today I have the pleasure to speak with Gay Hawkins, the author of a book entitled, The Ethics of Waste: How We Relate to Rubbish, which looks at our fascinating and complex relationship to the waste we produce. Gay Hawkins teaches in the School of Media and Communications at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. Her unique perspective offers us an opportunity to better understand our consumption and accumulation and opens the door for smarter, more conscientious, long term solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To learn more about Gay Hawkins and her book The Ethics of Waste: How We Relate to rubbish and her other work, check out the following links:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://empa.arts.unsw.edu.au/staff/staff.php?first=Gay&amp;last=Hawkins"&gt;empa.arts.unsw.edu.au/staff/staff.php?first=Gay&amp;amp;last=Hawkins&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.api-network.com/cgi-bin/reviews/jrbview.cgi?n=0868409391"&gt;www.api-network.com/cgi-bin/reviews/jrbview.cgi?n=0868409391&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au/AHR/archive/Issue-April-2004/hawkins.html"&gt;www.lib.latrobe.edu.au/AHR/archive/Issue-April-2004/hawkins.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Culture-Waste-Gay-Hawkins/dp/0742519821"&gt;www.amazon.com/Culture-Waste-Gay-Hawkins/dp/0742519821&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two songs used in today's program both have the word waste in their titles.

Food and identity are intricately linked.  The saying, "You are what you eat.", reverberates now more than ever as the food we eat is produced and transported from farther away and made from ingredients that are synthesized and almost impossible to pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent article in &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/span&gt; highlights our increasing disconnection to our food system explaining that what you eat has everything to do with how much money you have, particularly when it's cheaper to buy a package of Twinkies than a bunch of carrots.  This article also looks at the power of U.S. government subsidies to determine what we and our children are eating - from our choices at the supermarket to those in the school cafeteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who decide to grow their own food are taking back the ability to make the right decisions for themselves - what fruits and vegetables to plant and how to organically grow them.  For almost 14 years, the South Central Farmers were doing just that.  This 14 acre farm located in South Central Los Angeles provided 350 families with the ability to grow their own produce allowing them to significantly subsidize their family food budget and offering them a meaningful connection to the land that is often impossible to have in an inner city environment.  This urban oasis stood out -- satellite views of LA showed two large rectangles of green surrounding by isolated industrial warehouses and dense urban poverty.  It was a hub of community involvement spurring several other initiatives around health, the environment and economic justice issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8ZLNC9FyM_g/RndkClqKGHI/AAAAAAAAAHE/uSO5vNcicTo/s1600-h/800px-South_Central_Farm_4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8ZLNC9FyM_g/RndkClqKGHI/AAAAAAAAAHE/uSO5vNcicTo/s400/800px-South_Central_Farm_4.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5077637100514973810" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the farm now lies fallow.  This month marks the one year anniversary of the farmers final eviction from the land.  After years of protests, fund raising efforts and the involvement of several high profile celebrities and activists, including Joan Baez, Darryl Hannah and Leonardo Dicaprio, the land was given back to the developer who had left it derelict years before the City of L.A. had made it available to the farmers.  Police force and bulldozers were used to rid the land of both the farmers and their creations.  Protestors were arrested and the 14 biologically diverse acres of trees and plants were razed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here to talk more the South Central Farmers and their continuing struggle to make urban farming an option for the people of South Central L.A. is Tezozomoc.

Food and identity are intricately linked. The saying, "You are what you eat.", reverberates now more than ever as the food we eat is produced and transported from farther away and made from ingredients that are synthesized and almost impossible to pronounce. A recent article in The New York Times highlights our increasing disconnection to our food system explaining that what you eat has everything to do with how much money you have, particularly when it's cheaper to buy a package of Twinkies than a bunch of carrots. This article also looks at the power of U.S. government subsidies to determine what we and our children are eating - from our choices at the supermarket to those in the school cafeteria. Those who decide to grow their own food are taking back the ability to make the right decisions for themselves - what fruits and vegetables to plant and how to organically grow them. For almost 14 years, the South Central Farmers were doing just that. This 14 acre farm located in South Central Los Angeles provided 350 families with the ability to grow their own produce allowing them to significantly subsidize their family food budget and offering them a meaningful connection to the land that is often impossible to have in an inner city environment. This urban oasis stood out -- satellite views of LA showed two large rectangles of green surrounding by isolated industrial warehouses and dense urban poverty. It was a hub of community involvement spurring several other initiatives around health, the environment and economic justice issues. Unfortunately, the farm now lies fallow. This month marks the one year anniversary of the farmers final eviction from the land. After years of protests, fund raising efforts and the involvement of several high profile celebrities and activists, including Joan Baez, Darryl Hannah and Leonardo Dicaprio, the land was given back to the developer who had left it derelict years before the City of L.A. had made it available to the farmers. Police force and bulldozers were used to rid the land of both the farmers and their creations. Protestors were arrested and the 14 biologically diverse acres of trees and plants were razed. Here to talk more the South Central Farmers and their continuing struggle to make urban farming an option for the people of South Central L.A. is Tezozomoc. He is the elected leader of the original South Central Farmers and the manager of one of the ongoing cooperatives that emerged from the farm's activities.

The idea of placing solar panels on the roof once seemed out of reach for most homeowners but advancements in this technology are making it more efficient, more affordable and an increasingly attractive option for offsetting energy costs and selling homegrown power back to the grid.  From rooftop panels, to sunlight absorbing house paint to flexible panels that can be worn on clothing and backpacks, tremendous resources are being spent to develop efficient means of harnessing the sun’s rays. Leaving us to wonder: Can solar power be the answer to our energy needs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here to provide more insight about the future of solar energy is Cecile Warner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cecile Warner is a Project Manager at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL).  She is recognized for her outstanding and sustained work towards the advancement of solar photovoltaic technology.  She received the Women in Solar Energy Award from the American Solar Energy Society for her contributions, particularly her public outreach efforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cecile has led the Laboratory in developing and managing the highly acclaimed U.S. Solar Decathlon. This a competition where teams of college and university students compete to design the most attractive, effective, and efficient solar powered house. She was also project director of Sunrayce 93, a university competition of solar cars.

For most of us in North America, accessing water is as easy as turning on the tap. We think little of how the water gets to us and seldom worry about not having the water we need for drinking, cooking, bathing and our other daily activities.  It often feels as if we have an endless supply,  but in many parts of the world the reality is very different.

Each week we will discuss the issues and solutions surrounding housing from the local and global perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theme for each episode of World House Radio draws from the systems used by the Institute without Boundaries program to direct its research and design activities. The systems of construction, energy, food, water, waste, air handling, space usage, identity, social interaction, communication, finance and mobility are integral to the design and formation of affordable and sustainable housing solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World House Radio is a project of the Institute without Boundaries.
