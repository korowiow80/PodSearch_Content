IN this podcast I discuss the Sag Full Moon shining its enthusiastic vibe of faith through divine inspiration into the depths of one of your Houses.  Where are you being asked to be inspired and walk with vision?  Also, this potent and rare Venus transit across the face of the Sun asks us to question where we are in our relationships and general fulfillment in life.  Look back at your relationship patterns from 2004, 1996 and 1988 and try to comprehend your unique pattern.  Ask yourself if the pattern id destructive or constructive.  Make adjustments where required and practice forgiveness.  Jupiter in Gemini asks us to pick our Muse over the next year, or, in keeping with the Gemini symboizes, pick two Muses and expand your talent with them.  Of the Nine Muses, I choose Urania and Epic Poetry!

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As earthquakes shake the world and massive hurricanes pound the shores, the heavens speak in riddles, displaying the archetypal qualities of time!  Venus is Trine Jupiter, Love is in creative expression with the urge for exploration..and a new season is upon us!  Mercury has gone direct and we are in the flow of major productivity again!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Pluto is working its way into the Grand Trine from Capricorn continuing its demise of the way things have been done around here.
&lt;br /&gt;We live our lives.  We try to fit in with our peers and enjoy the times.  Are you creating your bliss in functional form that others can partake of?  Each moment is full to the brim with love and passion and dirt ready to bear seeds forth.  The power of fertility is all around and yet our cultured minds keep us locked into the future and the past.  We have a hard time just being.  Please BE!

Venus is Trine Jupiter, Love is in creative expression with the urge for exploration..and a new season is upon us! Mercury has gone direct and we are in the flow of major productivity again! Pluto is working its way into the Grand Trine from Capricorn continuing its demise of the way things have been done around here. We live our lives. We try to fit in with our peers and enjoy the times. Are you creating your bliss in functional form that others can partake of? Each moment is full to the brim with love and passion and dirt ready to bear seeds forth. The power of fertility is all around and yet our cultured minds keep us locked into the future and the past.

So exciting change is just around the corner even after this intense eclipse season that has already been a great tide of transformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the world and its obvious decline, people are still alive and kicking and doing their part to make the world glow.  If you step into your gifts and do what you love with passion, what legends will be written about your life in the end?  We are all on a journey together in this world, and times of great adversity require heroic people to emerge.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So tune out the dark news designed to keep you in misery and controlled, and focus on the things and people you love.  In the end the dust that sweeps across the terrain will be our form of conveyance....and the question for our eternal spirits will be...did I do my part, no matter how small and insignificant you think it is, to make the world glow with the gift of your becoming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the podcast!

We discuss the important ramifications of this powerful New Moon in Cancer which forms a Grand Cross with the Cardinal T-Cross that has been rocking the world since 2008!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eric will be joining the discussion every New Moon and occasional Full Moons, so I'm excited to have him back on the team!  I love his Cancerian psychological evolutionary style, as it really adds the feeling dimension to the play-by-play planet-by-planet analysis!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This next few weeks we have a number of planets heading into new signs like Mercury into Leo dramatizing the mind and Venus into Cancer opening the heart to sensitive compassion, the perfect season of creative romance and blissfully imaginative love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy the show, and look forward to your comments.  If you would like to ask a question about your chart we'd love to answer.

That's the crux of an illuminating Full Moon in the sign of the Magical Child, the clown of the zodiac!

I was riding my bike through Canada then getting ready to head south over the Cascades into Seattle to meet my kid and it was in my 8th House of change. How is is influencing you? This is the time that the SUn and its noble courtiers Mercury and Venus enter the Sign of Pisces, a symbol of unity consciousness. But this year Mars, the First Knight is entering Pisces with the Sun as Venus lags back in serious Capricorn. Also, with Jupiter square Pluto, time to challenge your faith to go deeper. How can you express faith and deepened your belief systems based on your ability to doubt and then find truth despite your doubt. That gives you more faith than everything! Look for an article soon about the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction traversing into the Air signs...what a deep breath of fresh air! Here's a Valentine Poem I wrote on Valentine's day, in case you don't have time to listen to the show: Valentine Blossoms In the distance, the almond orchard is blossoming and the wind and rain buffet against the window on this day devoted to love.. What is love that my heart should long for another? What is this vessel lost on a dark sea, longing to debark upon the shores of love... Who are we that we allow imagery, and calendars and history generate, twist, and drive our desire? but the exchange of passion, and chocolate, and flowers goes on... A wise man once told me that love had nothing to do with another, but rather, everything to do with how well you treat yourself and allow your authentic being to shine forth... The love we seek has always been waiting at the inner oasis. When we discover its treasure, every interaction is fulfilling... every smile, and touch and gaze delicious... I’ve tasted enough of love to recognize its maze of mischief, but we enjoy endangering ourselves with illusions... I sigh deeply, signing divorce papers again this week - another dead-end in the maze of love - There’s no room left in this pierced heart for love devoid of eternity... flashing imagery and brilliant hopes are no match for the utter welcome of divine love from this day forth... The trees swaying in the orchard know how to live...growing there, centered in themselves, rooted in their cycles - budding, flowering, bearing their fruit and then withering...without a speck or remorse... I could never be bound to the sole cause of anyone’s happiness again, chocolate and cherries turn to dust in my mouth... the currency of “spending” time and “paying” attention has cost my dreams dearly The Emperor was wrong to outlaw marriage for young warriors... praise be to Valentine for his silent rebellion of the heart and the note scrawled from prison to his beloved Before they took his head, he made a friend and healed the daughter’s blindness and the Emperor lost his throne within the year... If only we could befriend our own hearts and mend our vision, then maybe the empire of our fears would be overthrown at last?

The Cosmic Weather is back for it's first New Moon podcast in a long time!  And it is a dynamic one indeed.  This is the time of the year in the northern hemisphere where we get to tell stories around the fire and synthesize our yearly actions into wisdom and meaning.  As always the New Moon is about planting a Seed Intention based on where it falls in your natal chart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've also got Mercury going Retrograde on December 10th and conjuncting both Mars and Pluto in the process!  This is the time to make your Christmas list of things you want to fix, repair, replace, edit, interpret, and heal.  That way you won't get blindsided by the shift in mental energy from a place of active streaming to passive introversion.  I'm particularly excited as I'm working hard on my astrological masterpiece that you've probably heard me refer to over the last ten years as the Tao of Astrology.

And this simple, serene Taurus New Moon which promises every year to usher in the Spring in the northern hemisphere (and of course its polar opposite Autumn in the southern hemisphere) is also happening at the same point in the Zodiac where Jupiter met Saturn under the ominous Y2K non-event of the Year 2000.  It was May 28th when these two cultural titans met to launch the last 20 year period of the old faltering Industrial Revolution marked by their conjoinment in the earth signs for about 172 years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN the year 2020, they will meet at 0 degrees Aquarius and usher in a new error of global enlightenment and technological innovation.  I've been saying for ten years that 2010 will be the turning point of our era as the new inventions propel us toward the amazement of the future.  So here we are, the summer of 2010, and the planets that aligned in Virgo (Saturn, Uranus, Pluto, and Jupiter) to bring us Woodstock in '69 are back at it again.  Will it be a summer of love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't think so with the T-Cross configuration that glues the energy together, sowing much conflict and separation.  But either way, we'll be moving into a new decade with superior technology, superior communication networks, and volcanoes and earthquakes erupting around us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the show folks.

Enjoy the fiery expression!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Eric and I launched new web visions today under this pioneering Aries lunation.  Eric launched his new website in companionship with his amazing partner Sagit after they relocated to my former town Asheville, NC!  The new site is called http://www.soulvisionconsulting.com  I often call the 12th House the House of Soul Vision, so that's really spankin' cool!  The site has a beautiful elemental theme based on Eric's upcoming new astrology book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my continuing effort to release most of my cumbersome possessions and inspire people through my travels, I launched http://www.travelingmagi.com, Adventures of a Celestial Characterologist.  Being a student of character and its evolution through time and inspired by the cosmos, I often refer to my job as a celestial characterologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, hope you are able to gain a lot from my new Traveling Magi Blog and Eric's work with Sagit at Soul Vision Consulting.

The universe is alive and kicking with new energy for new directions with all this regeneration going on.  Old lives are fading while new ones are picking up steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Eric relocating to Asheville to essentially take my place but in his own unique elemental way, I have decided not to settle anywhere at all.  I'm embarking on a new adventure of long-term global travel, inspired by the books Vagabonding by Rolf Potts and the Four Hour Workweek by Tim Ferris.  I've returned to my roots in Boulder to hit a deep cosmic reset button before I go off in a new direction of bringing astrology and enlightenment to the world as a true traveling Magi.  I wonder who will be coming along for the journey of transformation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Venus and Mercury shifting into Taurus, we'll all start to feel a little more grounded in the process of change, able to let go of old worn paths and possessions to move into liberating new lifestyles.

It's going to be an exciting two weeks ahead following the New Moon in Pisces this weekend!  Get ready for your whole life to be transformed and accelerated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, I've been reading "The Four Hour Work Week" by Timothy Ferris at the same time as "Vagabonding" by Rolf Potts and what a revolution of consciousness to be had.  I highly recommend you acquire these two books and read them at the same time!  OMG!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the Universe is hitting the reset button in my heart, my body, my whole life.  I'm so excited I can't even contain it as I prepare to fly back to NC on Monday to begin dismantling my old life.  This from a recent post of mine on Facebook explains it all:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Having dispelled the illusions of my most recent dream of love, I've returned as a global citizen, blissful in the face of the glorious uncertainty before me, having conquered my fears by simply defining them...Life is Euphoric!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the show!

It's going to be an exciting two weeks ahead following the New Moon in Pisces this weekend! Get ready for your whole life to be transformed and accelerated. Lately, I've been reading "The Four Hour Work Week" by Timothy Ferris at the same time as "Vagabonding" by Rolf Potts and what a revolution of consciousness to be had. I highly recommend you acquire these two books and read them at the same time! OMG! I feel like the Universe is hitting the reset button in my heart, my body, my whole life.
