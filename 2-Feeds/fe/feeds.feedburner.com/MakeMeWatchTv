			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello, readers. I&#8217;m still hoping to bring Make Me Watch TV back in some form or another. There is a lot of bad TV out there that needs a smack in the eye. Let&#8217;s hope some terrible show comes along and acts a catalyst to get this website running again.</p>
<p>Until then, I have a new project up an running! It&#8217;s the <strong><a href="http://blankitcomics.com" alt="Blank It webcomic">Blank It webcomic</a></strong>. Hopefully, if you like my writing here, you&#8217;ll like my writing there.</p>
<p>So while the dust still settles here, check out the freshly dusted comedy at <strong><a href="http://blankitcomics.com" alt="Blank It webcomic">Blank It</a></strong>. And I&#8217;ll try and do something about the conditions here.</p>
<p>And to everyone leaving comments, you are totally wrong about <em>One Tree Hill</em>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How could you possibly choose <em>Bones</em> over a show called <em>Your Mama Don&#8217;t Dance</em>? I mean, sure, they could have taken a note from their poor grammar and switched the “you” with a “yo.” Would that have made it more appealing to your voting sensibilities? Dammit, I hate <em>Bones</em>.</p>
<p>With my prejudice squarely in place, let us continue. Bones has a problem with her current project. The skull has been tampered with through plastic surgery. How, oh how, will she be able to tell who it is now? I predict she’ll figure it out in 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Bones is LA. Right now, they are showing us the hard bodies out by a pool. These will be contrasted with Bones who is still wearing all her clothes. Why the hell are they even talking by the pool? That was a stretch directors and/or writers.</p>
<p>For being a scientist, Bones isn’t very scientific. Her false analogies and emotionally-charged rants against plastic surgery are not those of a scientific mind. Comparisons to foot-binding and calling it barbaric? Again, good job writers. Directors, you’re safe here.</p>
<p>They think mystery skull is a call girl. I mean, escort. Sorry, hooker. A hooker.</p>
<p>There is a sub-plot about coming up with the history of an ancient skeleton. While this is more interesting, it bores me. Why is this show still on?</p>
<p>The fake technology this show uses bugs me. They make no attempts to keep this show grounded in reality, even though all the evidence they use is a basic as you can get. Plain old bones. I blame the…creators?</p>
<p>Bones is on a show with Penny Marshall. Bones wrote a book, and Penny Marshall is directing it. Oh lordy, she talked about her brother, Gary. If they are apart, they can’t help but talk about each other.</p>
<p>Also, Bones talked coldly and scientifically about a space-time paradox. So is she acting supposed to be acting like a scientist or not?</p>
<p>Bones and FBI guy keep going to different plastic surgeons, which gives Bones more of a chance to rant for no reason. I’m glad I get to watch an hour of someone’s, so far, baseless opinion.</p>
<p>The found some special tools a specific plastic surgeon used. Then Bones used them on clay to figure out what their marks would look like on bone. Like a saw to make a specific puncture wound. You shouldn’t look so frustrated by that, Bones. It was pretty obvious to me that it wouldn’t be the right one.</p>
<p>So the real murderer was another escort. Sigh. I didn’t think I’d go way from this show hating it more. Everyone involved should be ashamed.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lost</em>! Let’s start.</p>
<p>We start with a flash-forward from Juliet. Psych! It’s a flash-back from when Juliet arrived on the island. Man, you should have seen your face. J.J. Abrams got you so bad!</p>
<p>Back in the present, the boat people disappear into the woods so Juliet goes out to look for her. Juliet finds her therapist in the woods, who isn’t a weird ghost. She warns that the boat people are going to release gas on the island to kill everyone.</p>
<p>Also, there are whispers everywhere in the woods. Doesn’t Walt usually accompany those whispers? Or, you know, death?</p>
<p>In the past, Juliet treats the therapist’s husband for a chemical burn. Who, on a messed up island, isn’t going to make a little meth?</p>
<p>The Tempest is the Dharma station that powers the island. It will also release poison gas to the whole island. The power is really just a bonus alongside killing everyone.</p>
<p>Kate was stupid, and the boat people smacked her over the head. Kate should change her name to Liability.</p>
<p>Juliet has been sleeping with the therapist’s husband. Which is a no-no, because it seems she was brought to the island to save babies and Ben. Not to save Ben. For Ben. Like a mail order bride.</p>
<p>Therapist’s husband was one of the Others who infiltrated the tale end folks. Which means he is good and dead. Or at least dead. “Good” was an assumption on my part. Apart from the affair, I don’t have anything else to judge his character by. Maybe he fixed cleft pallets in his off time.</p>
<p>Ben and Locke are really bonding. Not sarcastically. Ben is showing Locke the man who wants to find and exploit the island. Locke wouldn’t want that. Let’s see if the dynamics change again.</p>
<p>After some tense moments, it turns out the boat people hired by the evil man were trying to stop the evil gas from going and killing. The gas isn’t really evil, I suppose. Gas is gas. Unless it silent.</p>
<p>The last show is Ben walking around. He must have told Locke something good. That was an alright episode of <em>Lost</em>. I wasn’t thrilled, but I wasn’t spectacularly let down.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Without my knowledge or assistance, <em>Men in Trees</em> has continued to exist. In fact, it has a following of rabid fans. Who knew? Let’s watch and see if Whatsername and Whosits still have a confusing relationship filled with sexual tension.</p>
<p> Whosits, by name of Jack, assumedly drown at sea lat week. Whatsername, name of Marin, will find ways to cope. Since she probably still likes him. I haven’t watched the show in a long time, but I assume that’s the case.</p>
<p>Also, Marin has a half-naked man in her kitchen. The top half-naked. This is broadcast television, after all. She is trying to keep him healthy. He looks about 20 years younger than her. I’m going to assume he’s her uncle.</p>
<p>Some folks named Sara and Eric are main characters. I don’t know their deal, aside from Sara liking to sleep in and Eric liking to pray. It probably goes a little deeper than that. Oh, Sara works at a diner and Eric is a Bible study group. Well, one character deepened. A little.</p>
<p>Oh no, bar characters. I don’t have the mental capacity to keep track of all of these people. I’m sticking two the main four. Which is easy. Because one of them might not be an issue any longer.</p>
<p>Jack was tracking whales when his ship went down, which reminds me of <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDDcpt6dGco">Voyage of the Mimi</a></em>. That was a barely educational show I was force to watch in middle school. Hey, maybe that’s where this forced TV watching stems from.</p>
<p>Coast Guard found a piece of life raft, so they’re calling off the search for Jack. By the way, the piece didn’t have Jack on it. That’s a crucial bit of information. The nameless (to me) characters in the bar look sad.</p>
<p>Everyone in town is coping in a different way. Watching old movies, listening to old records, putting old people in homes. To each their own.</p>
<p>Hold on, one of the nameless hordes had been struck by lightening. They say once you’re struck by lightening, your odds of getting struck again go up. Which is nonsense. Sure, people who get struck by lightening tend to do things that get them struck by lightening. So their odds are above average. But getting struck doesn’t raise your odds.</p>
<p>Marin is doing a lot of looking inwards. And outwards. Reminders of Whosits everywhere. Outward. And inward. But it’s hard to show inward without outward. And it’s hard to show your emotions outwardly without the inward part. It’s a circle of emotion.</p>
<p>There’s a in-no-way-veiled metaphor about sonatas in effect. Each story has three parts, like a sonata. There you go. The nonexistent veil has been lifted. Which means it hasn’t been lifted.</p>
<p>Eric has a parishioner with troubles crashing his home, which doesn’t make Sara happy. This plot point is boring and will not be brought up, by me, again.</p>
<p>Not even one episode goes by and Jack is back. I’m hoping it’s Marin’s imagination and we’re going to have to deal with some deeper issues. We’ll see, after this commercial break.</p>
<p>Jack got picked up by a Russian freighter, or he didn’t if this is Marin’s insanity. I will now pretend that Jack is a ghost, from now on. A gruff and grumbly ghost.</p>
<p>Everyone else can see the ghost too. I will pretend that they are humoring Marin.</p>
<p>Half-naked man needs new kidneys, and he’s lying about it to his niece, Marin. Will uncles never learn?</p>
<p>Marin is making it with a ghost now. In a truck. I don’t understand how he can walk through walls but still touch physical objects. Pfft, ghosts.</p>
<p>So there you have it, rabid fans. No in depth analysis. No attention to detail. No pulled punches. It wasn’t a terrible show, but I can’t see myself watching week after week. You know, on purpose.</p>
<p>Oh, and Marin is moving in with a ghost.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the voting is tied, Aric gets to choose. Time for some outrageous <em>Big Brother</em> action.</p>
<p>It’s no use describing the character in the house to you. Just understand that they’re all hate each other, and they’re all very shallow. Like a house full of emotionally vacant hornets. Again with my hornet analogies. Okay, a house full of emotionally vacant shoes.</p>
<p>The teams in the <em>Big Brother</em> house are supposedly perfect matches. So far, there have been zero love connections. Even though the…oh, what’s the classy way to say this…sluts really want to make a “connection.” Sluts are classy now, right?</p>
<p>There are couples “on the block” to be kicked out of the house. Today, they can save themselves by winning a veto. They call it the “golden power” of veto. Yes yes, “golden shower” is the easy joke here. Very good, I’m proud of you.</p>
<p>For the veto competition, they dress up like cupids attached to a pulley system an yell at each other. Did I say yelling? I meant yelling in high pitched hysterics.</p>
<p>Hold on. “Her brain works in an honest way,” was said in regards to someone solving a puzzle. That would only make less sense if it was said about someone in a swimming competition.</p>
<p>The main slut-VS-I’m-just-not-into-you team came off the block. Which is kind of lame, because the team left “on the block” stirs up a lot of trouble. And why would I watch this if it weren’t for all the trouble being caused? I don’t want to watch a lot of nice people make nice.</p>
<p>Slut was searching for I’m Just Not Into You like the Terminator. She is nuts. Oddly enough, I’m Just Not Into You was making out with someone else. Ahhh, this show is great. The people are all nuts.</p>
<p>Slut and I’m Just Not Into You did hook up earlier in the game. Which is why Slut is being led on. I’m Just Not Into You call her his “boy.” IJNIY is so condescending towards Slut. And he keeps putting her down. But she keeps saying he’s her soulmate. That’s amazing. It’s like giving facts to a Creationist.</p>
<p>Now there is a siren threatening to change everything in the house. If it goes off, everyone needs to gather into the living room for a drastic announcement. It will probably go off during tomorrow’s episode and change everything in the game. With only a handful of couples left in the house, they need some twist to extend the game for another two months.</p>
<p>That’s about it for the day. See you tomorrow for, what looks like, <em>Men in Trees</em>. Where did all these <em>Men in Trees</em> fans come from?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow. You guys didn’t vote for <em>Billy Graham</em> like I thought you would. Instead, we are stuck, again, with <em>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</em>. Fox is promoting this as a two hour season finale. Then why does it have two episode names, Fox? You can’t fool me. I’m watching only one terrible hour of television, not two. Nice try.</p>
<p>We open on a snow globe held by a futuristic robot dressed as an FBI agent. He quickly dispatched a high school principal. Well, heck. This is what was missing last episode. And by “this,” I mean “anything interesting whatsoever, especially having to do with robots.”</p>
<p>Did you know that Edward Furlong, to original John Connor, turned into a terrible actor? It’s true! Check him out in <em>Intermedio</em>. You will also see, in <em>Intermedio</em>, an actor named Paul Cram. He is auditioning for the same commercial as me on Wednesday. So, really, it is just like I was in a movie with Edward Furlong. Right?</p>
<p>River, or whatever the female robot’s name is, kept an evil robot brain from the future. It looks like a flashing light that you put on your bike while riding at night. Futuristic! The “brain” came from a robot that was married. It was undercover, like a sleeper cell. I suppose that means my wife is a robot. Dammit. It was nice knowing you all.</p>
<p>The robot was married to a city planner, or something. Robots love plans.</p>
<p>John Connor sure is emo. Do you think he cries while listening to <em>Bright Eyes</em>? Also, the fake FBI robot sure likes shoving people against walls. It’s a bonus if it kills them. Not everything is a bonus.</p>
<p>Vick, the evil robot brain and also an asshole who fights dogs, not a bad story element. We’re watching his memories while the Connor Crew…sorry…Konner Krew tries to solve the mystery that is Vick. It’s not a bad story telling device.</p>
<p>Oh boy, the FBI robot and the River robot are headed for a showdown. But that probably won’t happen until the next episode. Dang. Drat. Tarnation.</p>
<p>The show contains a massive amount of sitting around, talking, and wearing black. Where are we, the 1950s bohemian hedonist movment?</p>
<p>While trying to spread a virus in city hall to shut down what the Vick brain was trying so hard to set up, Sarah Connor and future dude also wearing black failed. Then they were chased down secret tunnels by cops who were easily subdued. That was almost action. The drums tried to tell me yes, but I say no.</p>
<p>Vick’s brain used John Connor’s Blackberry to try and call out his location. Too bad there wasn’t another one of those Blackberry outages at that time.</p>
<p>Now River-bot’s brain is out and accessing a traffic light to save the world. This destroyed some program and caused a lot of traffic congestion. Even on the freeway, where there are no traffic lights. Good one, TV show editors.</p>
<p>This <em>Terminator</em> hour was better than last week’s <em>Terminator</em>. It still wasn’t great. And that’s enough of “television’s most driven series.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m 28 years old, married, and I work 40 hours a week. But here I am, being forced to watch <em>The Price Is Right Million Dollar Spectacular</em> in primetime. This Make Me Watch TV thing was a terrible idea.</p>
<p>Man, Bob Barker really let himself go. Oh, that’s Drew Carey.</p>
<p>I miss the older style <em>Price is Right</em> microphone. Well, maybe “miss” is the wrong word. But the head of this new one is menacing. Ahh, <a href="http://www.retrothing.com/2006/09/sony_superscope.html">here</a> is the old one.</p>
<p>Sorry, sorry. The tuxedoed gentleman on stage already started a game and here I am jabbering away about microphones.</p>
<p>Which of these items is the half off price? Why, the <em>I Love Lucy</em> doll, of course. $20 was far too little for a piece of plastic with red hair. Speaking of dolls and red hair, Raggedy Ann freaks me out. Just thought you should know.</p>
<p>The first contestant? A loser! They are at least as low as you can feel for being bad at guessing between two random numbers. That’s pretty low.</p>
<p>Someone guessed 1700, followed by a 1701, then a 1702. Game show contestants are big fat jerks.</p>
<p>Observation? Contestants touch game show hosts a lot. I don’t think I could handle that.</p>
<p>Lucky $even? You know we watch to see Plinko. This contestant won a car, with a side of shrieking. I’d love to drive a car on stage. It would be nice and surreal.</p>
<p>To the credit of <em>The Price Is Right</em>, they keep things moving. There is none of the dark and dramatic pausing of modern game shows. Those pauses need to go.</p>
<p>Another loser. Time to spin that big wheel. I must say, I miss tacky game show sets. And old sound effects. And <em>Hanging with Mr. Cooper</em>. That last phrase was a lie.</p>
<p>I don’t think I ever knew exactly how this show worked as a kid. Perhaps I was attracted to the bright colors. Like a moth to the Technicolor flame.</p>
<p>I’d update you on the plot, but there isn’t any.</p>
<p>There is a game called Grocery Game. Hold on a second…this show is one big advertisement! An advertisement for chili con queso sauce and cars. Remember to use those items in tandem.</p>
<p>A very old lady just got on stage. And what could she win? Jet skis! This show is awesome. And she just won them. Those will go to good use. IN HER GRAVE!</p>
<p>I think Drew Cary just swore. A contestant said hi to their friends, family, and beautiful kids. Pretty sure it was a remark about his wife, or perhaps feces. Can’t pretend to know what word was cut out.</p>
<p>By the way, we’re on to the Showcase Showdown. The announcer just said “bling.” That means rappers can no longer use the word. Once it is heard on <em>The Price is Right</em>, it is dead. Culturally speaking, that is.</p>
<p>No million dollar winner this round, but the guy in the showcase showdown was off by $54,000 dollars. He must be buying his jewelry and RVs at the wrong place.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Lost</em> is one of my favorite shows. I would have watched it anyway. So here this here is a bonus. Here come the spoilers.</p>
<p>To get off of the island, you need to go on a very specific trajectory. Even if it means flying directly into a thunderhead. Which Sayid and Desmond just did. When things went south, Desmond’s mind flashed into the future. Or the past. Then back. Then he didn’t know who Sayid was.</p>
<p>This flying helicopter (oh yeah, they were on a helicopter) left the island a day ago. But really they’re only 20 minutes out. Time is really messed up on the island. Or better than ever.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there is an actual boat the helicopter got to it. It seems like a time wall fried Desmond’s brain, which happens to everyone now and again. He is on the boat saying he doesn’t know Sayid. And now he’s in a military campy. He’s jumping through time more than Billy Pilgrim.</p>
<p>Now Desmond is in a sick bay with someone suffering the same way he has. You see, some people get a little messed up when coming from and going to the island. I blame Einstein. Or Stephen Hawking. Desmond thinks it’s 1996.</p>
<p>Some mathy guy on the island figured Desmond is going into the past on his flashes. He gave him orders to get on a train and find him. In the past. Also, the doctor in the sick bay flipped an alarm and it took about 10 minutes for anyone to respond on the small boat. I mean, I’m lazy. But that’s really lazy.</p>
<p>Mathy guy seems a little Charlie Manson in the past. In the past, as an Oxford professor, he is trying to send rats through time to run races. Or run away from <em>Rat Race</em>. Either is a noble pursuit.</p>
<p>Penny, Hanso, the Black Rock. We’re getting a lot of mythology in our episode today. I forgot about most of these things. Except for Penny. Desmond won’t shut up about her.</p>
<p>Desmond needs a constant in his lives if he doesn’t want to have a brain aneurysm. He is broken up with Penny in the past, but needs her number so he can call her in the future. That’ll fix his brain up proper. Penny knows about the island and she has been searching for Desmond. Then they had a sweet and darling conversation before the phone batteries went dead.</p>
<p>A pretty good episode by my account. A lot of information about time and mysteries on the island. Hooray for <em>Lost</em>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oddly enough, <em>Big Brother</em> and <em>American Idol</em> are on at the same time on Tuesday and Wednesday. Yet <em>Big Brother</em> won the votes last night and <em>American Idol</em> won tonight. Don’t ask me why. I have no answers.</p>
<p>It’s ladies night on <em>AI</em> (that’s <em>American Idol</em>, but much quicker to spell). I’ve been on top of my <em>AI</em> watching, and it’s pretty much sucked. The auditions weren’t fantastic. Hollywood week wasn’t devastating enough. And now the finalists are all losers. At least we only have five hours a week with the losers. Wait, five hours? Screw that.</p>
<p>Carly is up first, and she’s singing <em>Heart</em>. I don’t think you can do better or worse than <em>Heart</em> when singing <em>Heart</em>. It’s not like the vocals are fantastic to begin with, and they aren’t going to get any better when anyone else sings it.</p>
<p>You can download the worst performance of the night on iTunes immediately after the show. In case you like to flush you money down the internet hole</p>
<p>Syesha is an “actress” and can cry like a baby. Which is good for a certain kind of fetishist. She sings a song called <em>Mr. Jones</em>. Assumedly. It isn’t the <em>Counting Crows</em>. Luckily.</p>
<p>Brooke is a beauty school drop out, a badge that is worn on her head every day. She decides to hide behind a guitar for half the song, and squeak a terrible performance out of her doughy face. Not doughy as in fat, but doughy as in white and unremarkable. Tee heeeee. The judges like it though, so what the heck do I know?</p>
<p>Ramiele knows how to Polynesian dance. You might remember another idol who did that. His name was Sanjaya. Oh man, I’m so bored by this show. Maybe if I press on my eyes really hard it will be like I’m watching another show.</p>
<p>Kristy Lee Cook, who can only be addressed by all three names, is a farm girl and tomboy. Entertainment Weekly thinks she’s going to win. I think they just like a pretty face. Which is fine, but this is a singing competition. And she doesn’t have the vocal goods. At least her hair isn’t that of a beauty school dropout.</p>
<p>We’re halfway through the girls tonight, but 41 minutes into the show. When the time comes, I will amass an army and wage a war against filler.</p>
<p>Amanda Overmyer is called original, which is odd because she is just a Janice Joplin copy cat. And now she’s doing a terrible rendition of a <em>Kansas</em> song. Maybe America will send her ass packing tomorrow. Wow, this was worse than karaoke. Luckily, the judges agree. And Simon trashed her stupid hair.</p>
<p>Alaina doesn’t like her food touching. There is no reason I need to know this. And you aren’t watching <em>Toys</em>. I’m hopelessly devoted to this boring and pitchy song. Or, wait, what’s the opposite of “hopelessly devote?” Maybe angrily stabbing.<br />
By the way, Randy Jackson’s watch is huge!</p>
<p>Alexandrea sings some <em>Chicago</em>. And when I wrote “sing,” I was being generous. Very generous. Simon is being much more brutal. Fatality!</p>
<p>Wow, more <em>Heart</em>. I’ll try to understand, try to understand, try try try to understand this song choice. Better luck next time, Kady. If there is a next time.</p>
<p>Then Asia’h wrapped up the night. I didn’t watch, because my cat wasn’t peeing in his litter box. Seriously, cat? The plastic next the litter box? Just move over an inch! But Simon clued me in to how she was. Terrible.</p>
<p>Man, <em>AI</em> is grating on me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you haven&#8217;t been watching this season of <em>Big Brother</em>, you do not like entertainment. Yes yes, I know. That&#8217;s a sweeping generalization. But really, what are you doing? Listen, they trapped all these horrible people in one house and the constantly fight! It&#8217;s like watching hornets trapped in a jar of broken dreams.</p>
<p>The shows starts off where Sunday&#8217;s nomination ceremony took off. Annoying Amanda and complacent Alex are up on the block along with whoseit and whatsit. Did you know that Amanda is from Fridley, MN? That means I can drive down the street and punch her in the face when she gets back. Not that I would, but I&#8217;m close enough to.</p>
<p>Sheila feels shafted by Allison, which is ironic considering they both faked being lesbians. Whiny Sheila feels abandoned now that Allison is safe from going home. Hold on, Allison needs an adjective. Whiny is taken. So is annoying. Come on, thesaurus. What do you have for me? Caustic? Naw. We&#8217;ll go with irritating.</p>
<p>Alex and whatsit are confronting pink haired James, who isn&#8217;t taking any guff. Not that any of them would use the word &#8220;guff.&#8221; Unless they were 80. Which they are not. Which leads us into the veto competition where the houseguests fight to remove their head from the block. It&#8217;s a confusing game which is no fun to watch. And the people who didn&#8217;t need to veto won. Good work.</p>
<p>Things came to a head with Sheila and Allison later, when voices were raised. I actually watched this action live on the internet, and they was about a half hour longer with a lot of talk about yeast infections. Thanks, TV, for saving me from hearing about Sheila&#8217;s yeast infection again.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s when the bodily waste hit the <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2008/02/26/tilting-at-windmills/">windmill</a>. First, Allison ran to the diary room after having an allergic reaction to some unknown allergen. Her tongue was swelling, from what we heard, and they needed to use an EpiPen. And then, at the same time, Amanda fainted from a lack of sugar and started seizing.</p>
<p>Medical units were swooped in. Amanda was taken out on a stretcher! Everyone ends up alright and comes back to the house, but everyone is now really nice to Amanda who they hated not more than one day ago. Drama drama drama!</p>
<p>All in all, a great episode of <em>Big Brother</em>. And with less female problems than the live feeds. And that&#8217;s just fine with me.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boy, it’s been a while. How are you doing? You look great. Niceties aside, let’s get on with the TV.</p>
<p>For my return to the world of television, you have chosen <em>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</em>. Just so you know how fickle I am, my Tivo recorded the first episode of this show but not the second. So I threw my hands in the air and said “screw it” and deleted the first episode.</p>
<p>So I was done with the show without seeing it. But here we are, watching it. Well, you might not be watching it. Not that there is anything on in the wasteland that is Monday night television. Let’s go!</p>
<p>As a reminder to everyone, everything here is written on the fly. Complete thoughts are such a bother, don’t you think? So as the show plays, I write.</p>
<p>“Previously” tells me there is a chess playing robots that can kill everybody. Or will, in the future. This show is about fighting the future, like every other show out there. Especially <em>Golden Girls</em>.</p>
<p>There is a girl cop bending metal with her hands. Until further notification, I will assume she is a robot. Oh, but she shut down the power grid to a city. That’s a specifically human trait. So, she’s a human. Wait, she punched a door in. Robot. Hold on, digging through files. Human.</p>
<p>So we have a robot digging through files, surprisingly slowly for a future robot, and this Sarah Condor (or something like that) taking care of her son and brother.</p>
<p>The FBI has the hand of a future robot. I have a hard time believing they’ll know what to do with it. Unless it has to do with illegal wire tapping. Then they’re all over it. That’s probably more the CIA’s deal.</p>
<p>A FBI agent who lied about having the future robot hand, from now on referred to as the FDR, is watching tapes of Sara Concord in a mental institution ranting about the future and death. And where did he file the FDR? In his own freezer, of course. Don’t mistake it for a pot pie or it will kill you.</p>
<p>Ceira Konner broke into the FBI agent’s house to find info about FDR. What she finds is his files on her. Hold on, the friendly robot is doing ballet. The instructor just told her she is acting mechanical. Oh, the irony.</p>
<p>This is a lot of writing for only 17 minutes of show. I’m putting way too much effort into this.</p>
<p>Talk talk talk talk talk. I’m about ready for some action here. Maybe something to do with “fighting” and “future.” There are a lot of guns, but they aren’t being fired. There are a lot of robots, but they aren’t fighting. There are a lot of fists, but they aren’t punching.</p>
<p>John Connor is watching Sarah’s (I got tired of spelling her name wrong) mental institution tape. Can’t see any good coming from that. It’s nice to know that, even though the future is at stake, John still has to go to school. Knowledge is power, but then what use are all those guns?</p>
<p>Nosey FBI agent is talking to Sarah’s old psychologist in his woodland home. There are no raccoons doing his dishes. That would be charming. And disease-tastic! Hey, guess who drugged the FBI agent? What’s up, doc?</p>
<p>Robot kicked some fool. That’s all.</p>
<p>The doc thinks the FBI agent is a robot from the future. To test this theory, there was a little leg stabbage. And there was blood. Doc thinks Sarah’s psych ward ramblings line up with the book of Revelations. Now he’s recapping Sarah’s escape from <em>Terminator 2</em>. Been there, doc. Get on with it.</p>
<p>Now John and the guy I assumed was Sarah’s brother are having a heart to heart. He’s just some guy from the future. Or an uncle. I don’t really care. But boy does he hate robots.</p>
<p>Guys are getting out of pitch black car, towards there apartment where the robot is. But she got the info she wanted, so she walked right on by as they killed the Russian chess family. That’s not action! But the doc is burning the FBI agent. That is, sort of, action. Then Sarah punched the doc and took the robot arm. That’s more action-ish. And that’s all we got.</p>
<p>I could go for some more serious talking right about now. Hey, we’re in luck! Blah blah blah feelings blah blah. Why is so many relationships developing when killer robots are involved? You hear me, <em>Transformers</em>?</p>
<p>The FBI agent who the doc tried to kill put the doc in the psych ward he originally worked in. I’m not impressed with this full circle. Also, FDR got all burnt up.</p>
<p>Dear <em>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</em>, I am not a fan. Your truly, Aric McKeown.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Writers Guild of America voted yesterday to end their strike, which is fantastic news. This means the writers will be getting their fair cut of the new media profits, instead of zero cuts from new media. And while the strike has ended, your scripted shows will not be back with new episodes until late March or early April.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t enjoy what we have. Make Me Watch TV is back, as promised, watching all the horrible reality and game shows that you want! Voting will begin again on Monday the 18th.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s continue to enjoy and not enjoy TV together. <em>Big Bang Theory</em> is out of episodes, right? Sweet.</p>

<p>These shenanigans by the AMPTP have gone on far too long. With <em>The Office</em> now in reruns because the writers can&#8217;t get a fair shake, my heart isn&#8217;t into this TV watching business. I certainly can&#8217;t support the forced watching reality show filler and forced reruns.</p>
<p>Make Me Watch TV will come back once the AMPTP comes to their senses and gives the WGA what they deserve for creating the entertainment that we love.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We pick up where we left off last time. Sydney and pal accidentally blew up a gang of CIA fellas. And inhalers. Now Syd is going to show us what emotions sort of look like if you squint really hard.</p>
<p>Syd’s father, who works for the CIA and is spying on SD-6, was investigated by the FBI for possibly stealing secrets. The FBI agents was named Bentley, like the car. His new name will be VW Bus. Also, he died in a car crash with Syd’s mom. The VW Bus isn’t a very safe vehicle.</p>
<p>Bah. More emotions. Maybe once we get to the next scene…oh. More emotions.</p>
<p>Whoops. Hello, used DVD. You seem to have stopped. Ahhhh, there we go.</p>
<p>SD-6 is going after a group called FTL. They do not deliver flowers. But they do hide codes in birthday cards. SD-6 will be going after the special decoders.</p>
<p>Emotions.</p>
<p>Time for some Syd disguises. She is wearing a dark wig and a piece of carpet. I wonder how much that dress costs per foot.</p>
<p>It’s a good thing guards never look up. Syd would have been dead long ago then. Really, though, what is up that’s ever worth looking at? Stars? Yeah. Been there, done that.</p>
<p>There is some sub-plot about singing and another one about Will investigating the murder of Syd’s fiancé.</p>
<p>Emotions.</p>
<p>The greeting cards were decoded by DNA. Time to dig up a body! After finding it, of course. Through disguises.</p>
<p>When you leave an apartment in a state of disrepair, who leaves the fridge door open? That seems a little much.</p>
<p>Emotions.</p>
<p>Syd is in a foreign mental institution. Sure, it’s dirty and dank. But it’s universally covered! It looks like the guards are on to her. Come one, electroshock!</p>
<p>Cliffhanger! You folks better vote for Alias again next week!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have never heard anything bad about the Women’s Murder Club. However, I have heard only one good thing. Who is right, nothing or one thing? Or me? Let’s see!</p>
<p>A building just went up and exploded. Then there was a fake commercial for Double Cross, a book by James Patterson. The face commercial was pretty funny. But let’s get serious here. Someone is in jail for something.</p>
<p>Uh oh, I think there are clues and references from pervious episodes all up in here. Concentrate, Aric! You’re working at a disadvantage here.</p>
<p>Jamie, son of a death row murderer, escaped this exploding building. Either someone tried to kill him or he caused the explosion to cover his allegedly murderous tracks.</p>
<p>Do you know what doesn’t help your case? Running from the cops. Do you know what really doesn’t help your case? Murder.</p>
<p>So Paul, death row resident, was seen by the murdered Ben Cooper leaving another murdered person’s apartment. And Paul’s son, Jamie, is accused of murdering Ben Cooper.</p>
<p>They’re trying to solve to cases. Also, there are a bunch of women trying to solve these cases.</p>
<p>Halfway through, I have deemed this show stupid. Will it get stupider or better in the next 30 minutes?</p>
<p>And one of these women might be pregnant. You know what I don’t want to deal with? Murder and women’s problems.</p>
<p>And why do people drag people into bathrooms for private conversations? Need to talk in secret? Let’s go into a room with several other mini rooms in it that are far from soundproof and a good place for people to hide!</p>
<p>It looks like they have whitey on the run! I hate whitey so much! Actually, he is the district attorney who is something something with somebody and also might something to somebody something.</p>
<p>Guess who isn’t pregnant? Me!</p>
<p>You know what doesn’t stop executions? Protesters.</p>
<p>Guess who is the murderer! The former roommate! Tsk tsk, blaming whitey.</p>
<p>Execution stopped. Mysteries solved. Mouth stretched into a yawn. I could have used a larger helping of women’s issues. Just kidding. Women are stupid.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven’t watched 30 Rock in a while. I’m not sure why I gave up on it. Laziness, I suppose. Maybe it got yuck on it from My Name Is Earl.</p>
<p>The show started off with everyone smelling maple syrup in different sections of New York. And then, Liz was really excited about the delivery of her prescription shampoo. Your laughs have been fantastic!</p>
<p>The show is pretty quotable. Dare I say classic Simpsons quotable? To prove she wasn’t racist, Liz recalled the time she asked a black guy if he had seen Sideways. Ahhh, us white guys are so lame.</p>
<p>30 Rock is like three wonderful intertwining sketches that don’t overstay their welcome. We have Liz who thinks she lives next to a terrorist. Jack who slept with a Democrat. And Kenneth is trying to earn money to replace pants. All plots done well on their own. All great when put together.</p>
<p>Okay, 30 Rock. My opinions about you, the ones with no particular basis, were incorrect. My feelings, like Liz’s feelings about her neighbors, were wrong. How can we make this right, 30 Rock? What if I wrote nice things about you? Deal.</p>
