The audio portion can be found here as Podcast #4. The student maps, syllabus, and other materials have been linked at piqueroblog.blogspot.com . The series assumes you have access to a computer that has Version 7 or Version 8 installed, either the product or the trial version. The trial is only good for 30 days. In this fourth episode I continue the example of Igor's Balloon Factory. The example discusses using Mind Manager to help organize your thoughts for a Paper or Report. I use writing a business plan as the target paper. A key point is that there are two maps involved. One is audience analysis and paper objectives. The second is the paper content and organization. We work some more with topic formatting, using boundaries and color. We explore Growth of Subtopics, which drastically alters the look of the map. And we work a bit with Callout topics. I am interested in your opinions.
