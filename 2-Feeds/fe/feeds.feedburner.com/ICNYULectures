If you are the webmaster, your account may have gotten this error for one or more of the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>Your account has used more than its share of the cpu in the past 60 second sliding window.
<li>Your account has too many concurrent processes running simultanously.
<li>Your account has consumed too much memory.
<li>Your site was recently very busy trying to run inefficient scripts.
</ul>
The solution would be to optimize your applications to use less CPU.<br>
Adding appropriate indeces to your SQL tables can often help reduce CPU.<br>
Using static .html documents instead of painful .php scripts will practically eliminate CPU usage.<br>
