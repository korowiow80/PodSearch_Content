We are on the cusp of changes that will forever alter the way of life of billions of people across the planet. The whole world has been caught up in a cosmic battle over good, evil and the hearts and souls of mankind.


Many Christians are unwilling to listen to the dire warnings of the watchmen that God has stationed on the walls to warn those who are "inside the city". I am urging all Christians to give this podcast a fair hearing. I understand that it is much more comfortable living in this world when your perception of it is that it is still farily "safe". The fact is that our leaders are involved in selling this country out to a global conspiracy to set up a one world government called the New World Order.... believe it, or not.

The mentality of today's world is much more prepared to accept this reality than the world was even just a few short years ago. The word "conspiracy" denotes that it is "a hidden plan". It has now gotten to the point where they don't even have to hide it anymore. What was once "conspiracy" has slowly turned into reality.

These are strange days indeed. Listen in as Prof. Walter Veith shines a light on The New World Order and exposes it's hidden agenda. Part 1 of a 2 part series.

		</p><p>This has been a crazy week. I&#8217;ve struggled with some fundamental questions that God has brought to the forefront as we face this great spiritual battle going on between Good and Evil. I want to share some things that God has revealed to me. God tells us that He is a &#8220;Father to the father-less&#8221; and I have learned this first-hand this week. He mentors those who draw close to Him. He answers all questions if we just ask Him. How wonderful our God is!!<br />
<span id="more-82"></span></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what it feels like when God is drawing near to you? Have you ever wondered how you would discern a demonic attack of oppression from the Holy Spirit&#8217;s refining fire?</p>
<p>This is a question that we don&#8217;t often think about, but does bear giving attention to&#8230; especially since there is all kinds of spiritual activity going on in our day.</p>
<p>You MUST know the difference between Godly sorrow and worldly sorrow. There IS a distinct difference, you know!</p>
<p>Tune in and see why that &#8220;oppression&#8221; you might be feeling may be your greatest opportunity for refinement!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s discuss at:<br />

I've struggled with some fundamental questions that God has brought to the forefront as we face this great spiritual battle going on between Good and Evil. I want to share some things that God has revealed to me. God tells us that He is a "Father to the father-less" and I have learned this first-hand this week. He mentors those who draw close to Him. He answers all questions if we just ask Him. How wonderful our God is!!


Have you ever wondered what it feels like when God is drawing near to you? Have you ever wondered how you would discern a demonic attack of oppression from the Holy Spirit's refining fire?

This is a question that we don't often think about, but does bear giving attention to... especially since there is all kinds of spiritual activity going on in our day.

You MUST know the difference between Godly sorrow and worldly sorrow. There IS a distinct difference, you know!

Tune in and see why that "oppression" you might be feeling may be your greatest opportunity for refinement!

Those who shepherd the flock have not prepared God's people for what is to come. They have whitewashed the Word of the Lord and lulled the people to sleep with false visions of peace.

The wall of our defense is in ruins. We must repair the breaks in the wall so that it will stand firm in the battle at the Day of the Lord.

There's work to do and little time left. Prepare ye the Way of the LORD!

We need to say awake and be vigilant in these dark days. It's all too easy to close our eyes to the reality of what is actually going on. The flesh wants to go back to the illusion because it's more comfortable there. We need to stay in the Word and stay focused on the task at hand.

What is that task? The Bible says "wickedness burns "LIKE" a fire".... that it consumes those who are caught up in it. Our task is firefighting and damage control. We need to pull as many out of the fire as we can by exhorting all men everywhere to repent and turn to Christ. Preach the Gospel. Teach the Word. Be fruitful in season and out of season.

Language is a powerful tool that God gave us to communicate Truth to others. Satan, however, uses it to distort the Truth and manipulate others into confusion and altered perceptions of reality.

This podcast is part 1 of a series that will expose the dark origins of witchcraft. We discuss how language can be used to "bewitch" and "confuse" people by seducing them into another perception of what Truth really is.

The first step to coming out of Babylon, is seeing how Babylon has enslaved you through the "Language of Deception".

The enemy uses guilt and shame to keep you bogged down in spiritual slavery. Christ set us free from guilt and shame in order for us to be free enough to "go and sin no more".

The Gospel is "Good News"! With the "accuser" trying to prosecute us at every turn, we need to understand grace and know that we will also be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</itunes:summary><itunes:author>Amos Ridley</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><media:content url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TruthStream_Oasis/~5/qrPJWMJeahk/truthstream_2008-06-15T04_49_34-07_00.mp3" fileSize="39996899" type="audio/mpeg" /><itunes:keywords>Christian,end,times,bible,prophecy,spirituality,Christ,God,nwo,conspiracy,last,days,illuminati,antichrist,tribulation,rapture,bilderbergers,trilateral,revelation,deception,holy,spirit</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://www.truthstreamoasis.com/2008/12/30/justified-by-faith-galatians-1-and-2/</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TruthStream_Oasis/~5/qrPJWMJeahk/truthstream_2008-06-15T04_49_34-07_00.mp3" length="39996899" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://media.blubrry.com/truthstreamoasis/www.truthstreamoasis.com/wp-content/uploads/media/truthstream_2008-06-15T04_49_34-07_00.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>(TSO-43) Justified by Faith: Galatians 3</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TruthStream_Oasis/~3/AdvidsqWgss/</link><category>Podcasts</category><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">epiphos@hotmail.com (Amos Ridley)</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 19:04:42 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.truthstreamoasis.com/?p=342</guid><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 15px; width:240px;">

We need to have a sensitive conscience towards the Lord, but in the right way and about the right things. Satan works to defile our conscience in order to destroy the freedom that we have in Christ.

Learn the difference between false and true righteousness and how Christ can set you free in order that you may serve Him with a clear conscience.

He whom the Son sets free, is free indeed!</itunes:summary><itunes:author>Amos Ridley</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><media:content url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TruthStream_Oasis/~5/1pMGZmgllq4/truthstream_2009-03-02T02_44_47-08_00.mp3" fileSize="57953169" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origLink>http://www.truthstreamoasis.com/2009/03/02/its-a-matter-of-conscience/</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TruthStream_Oasis/~5/1pMGZmgllq4/truthstream_2009-03-02T02_44_47-08_00.mp3" length="57953169" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://media.blubrry.com/truthstreamoasis/www.truthstreamoasis.com/wp-content/uploads/media/truthstream_2009-03-02T02_44_47-08_00.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>(TSO-49) Justified by Faith: Galatians 5</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TruthStream_Oasis/~3/eaj9_rEaOt4/</link><category>Podcasts</category><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">epiphos@hotmail.com (Amos Ridley)</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2009 22:26:27 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.truthstreamoasis.com/?p=436</guid><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 15px; width:240px;">

<p>It&#8217;s not what you think. This is not about some new heresy, but about the truth behind the word &#8220;Lucifer&#8221; and the intent of the passages in Isaiah 14, Ezekiel 28 and many others.
