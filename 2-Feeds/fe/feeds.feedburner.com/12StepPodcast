It's been a while again, no real excuses other then the fact of not making a great transition back between school and work, but as the job hunt continues and I've learned to work my program better in the midst of the chaos that occurs in normal life and I'm hoping to get a better, more sober lifestyle down instead of simply living more as a dry drunk.  So this week we have part 2 of a talk from past in the podcast, (Steps 3 and 4 by Mark and Dave) which I think gave me more insight on how to work step 4 in my own life and how best to do step 4 when I work with others.  So I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I have!

This week David C. speaks about his experience of the 12 Step program and gives some valuable insights as to what working the program has meant to him and some challenging thoughts as to what each of our programs should be.  He is British which adds some diversity to the past few episodes and also gives both a different perspective of the 12 Step program and at the same time, the same one that many of us hold.

Thanks to all who emailed me about my grandfathers death, it is good to know the support of a fellowship, both at my home group and also even with those I have never met before.  So I would encourage you all to continue to spread support among one another and those you interact with in your own home groups.  On that general topic of support, this weeks mp3 is on Sponsorship.  I realized I have never posted anything on the topic and thought it to be important as I forget that not everyone thinks that's an important thing to do.  But as Dave P and Polly P talk about, sponsorship is essential to our sobriety and our continued sobriety.

This last week I didn't manage to get a file posted as my Grandfather passed away, and so this last week I've been trying to remember to care for myself.  But today I listed to Tom N.'s story which was really great as he shared about his experience with the 12 steps, and reminds me, and I hope us, that we can be in the program and be sober and still suffer from our addictions.  For this program is truly about a spiritual experience with God, not simply doing some work to get sober.  We cannot get true sobriety until we connect with God, but so often that is missed.  So I hope you will find this encouraging and will help you to seek out God.

This week we have Dennis R. talking at a Carry this Message time about the 6th through 9th steps.  He speaks about his own imperfection and struggles which I think can help us to identify what we need to walk through so that we can walk in sobriety one day at a time.  He isn't shy about identifying his own weakness which helped me to understand better my own.  But best of all he says something I think we maybe have heard before but all need to hear again, "You can't think your way into right living, you have to live your way into right thinking."

Sorry for no posts the last couple of weeks, but in the state I reside, there was a power outage along with the fact that I got married a little over a week ago, so I've been a bit busy and life just took over for a couple of weeks.  But since there aren't any more life changing events hopefully happening in the next few weeks, and the power will stay on, we should be back on track.  I am only posting a short reflection tonight by Joe and Charlie on the 5th Step, but I hope either tomorrow or the next day to post at least one more mp3 to catch up on material and to get some for those of you who may have been wanting more :).  So I hope you enjoy this short audio from Joe and Charlie!

I reside in Washington State and we lost power which made it a bit hard to post on the 14th, however simultaneously I was trying to finish up any details for my wedding that was on the 16th (which was made even more fun by the power outages).  Of course then last week I was on my honeymoon but I hope to post before Thursday and then also on Thursday if everything gets finished as it should and then the posts will be back on the normal schedule.

I have to apologize for this week coming out a little bit later, I usually make sure I have the podcast posted by 11:30pm on Thursday (PST), but as there have been a few major life events going on for me I didn't plan ahead enough to get it posted till this morning :).  This week's mp3 is classic audio from Joe and Charlie walking through the doctor's opinion section of the AA Big Book.  They talk about how our addictions are an allergy,  something that we have a physical reaction to.  But this is a good basis for us understanding our own addictions either for the first time or being reminded of the basis of our addictions.

Funily enough, today when I a posting this there is 260 subscribers who checked the podcast yesterday, which would mean there has been around 10 people a week who have found out about this podcast for the past 26 weeks!  However the message has spread even farther then that as there are over 500 downloads each week of this podcast!  So thanks so much after half a year for all of the support, as you help me to stay in 12 step material and to keep carrying the message to others.  Also, I had been asked this last week if I am planning on stopping the podcast at any point, and the answer is I plan to continue this for as long as God is not leading me to something else, and I don't see that happening anytime in the future :).  This weeks mp3 is speaker Keith L. who talks about relationships and addicts.  Keith talks about how our we as addicts tend to view our relationships with others and how we have treated others and continue to treat them. It's a great listen for anyone at any point they find themselves in their sobriety!

I hope that the podcast is okay for everyone as this last week I had one day where the stats were waaaay down on subscribers, so I wanted to say if there are issues with the podcast, let me know at 12steppodcast@gmail.com.  And I have to apologize for being a bit late on posting the podcasts lately, as I've been keeping very busy so I haven't always got to posting until the evening.  So now that I've rationalized away my responsibility ;) thanks for listening this week, and I hope you'll enjoy Chuck C. talking about the 12 Steps.  He walks through the different steps, reminding us that the program isn't complicated, it just needs to be worked.  Instead of making excuses or trying to make things complicated, we need to simply see the steps for what they are, and follow them as a plan of action instead of a plan of intentions.
