			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Matthew 14:33) When you look at how the Disciples responded to Jesus over the course of there time with him, you&#8217;ll see that it sure seemed to take forever for them to finally get who Jesus was. They witnessed so many amazing things yet, it wasn&#8217;t until the end of their time with Jesus that they finally began to understand that he really was the Son of God. Even still there were some that doubted it all after Jesus died, and it wasn&#8217;t until Jesus appeared to them that they finally got the faith in order.</p>
<p>Do we go through life with the same failure to really understand, and live, knowing who Christ is? I think it&#8217;s almost better for us to have trails in our life so that we can see plainly our daily need for him in our lives. It&#8217;s an amazing thing to have someone that loves us even when we fail at understand him. That definitely isn&#8217;t how the world works. Thank God for that, really. We need to be reminded each day that Jesus wasn&#8217;t just some great teacher that we can learn from, he was the example for our lives and the only way to have a relationship with God. That is amazing, and we shouldn&#8217;t forget it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know why but this morning I feel pretty great about everything in my life right now. I think for some time now I&#8217;ve been simply missing a lot of what I left behind in MN. I was amazed yesterday with everything that God has brought into my life over this past year. He has brought me to a place where I feel a lot of joy and excitement for where I&#8217;m at. This is good and bad at the same time.</p>
<p>What has also hit me this morning is that all along I haven&#8217;t been doing a very good job of simply choosing my attitude, choosing to live in the joy that God gives. The joy I have today is great, and there is no reason that I shouldn&#8217;t be able to continue living in that joy even when things seem rocky. Actually, my devotions today even talked about how Christ tested his disciples, and the question comes as to how I&#8217;m going to respond to his test, or tests, when it comes my way. Am I going to hold onto Christ and choose his joy or let the tests and the hard times bring me down?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(John 1)&#8230;As Christians we are not just followers of Jesus we&#8217;re called to be disciples. That also doesn&#8217;t mean that our roles as disciples are going to all be the same. Looking at Jesus core 12 disciples they were a varying bunch. Some were more leaders than others. One thing is for certain however, we are all called as disciples to make disciples. We&#8217;re called to simply bring people to Jesus. You look as Philip and Andrew and that&#8217;s exactly what they did.</p>
<p>Why is it that as new Christians it seems to easy to share about our new found faith with others, but as we mature in our faith we shrink back and find it hard to share with others? Not all Christ followers are that way of course. I&#8217;m not afraid to tell people that I&#8217;m a Christ follower, but I&#8217;m also not running around with an intent on telling people either.</p>
<p>Jesus made it very clear when he was here, either follow me or go your own way. However, we do see that Jesus didn&#8217;t feel the need to go around say &#8220;hey everyone, I&#8217;m Jesus the Son of God, come listen to what I have to say&#8221;. However, he did preach to thousands of people. He did go out in public and share God&#8217;s truth. One of the keys to Jesus&#8217; ministry was the fact that he cared about people not everything else. I think that is where today&#8217;s Christians can miss the mark. We tend to get too focused on our programs and lose sight of the daily connecting with people. People, the relationships we invest in, those are what matter most, especially when given the opportunity to share what God has done in our lives.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Ephesians 5:23-27)&#8230;Christ loved the church so much that he died for it. How could we even think that church is not important. Church is not about some place your go on Sundays, it&#8217;s about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"  target="_blank">community</a>. The community that Christ modeled was built around sharing lives together, holding each other accountable, and being totally real and authentic.</p>
<p>This type of community is something I had an opportunity to be immersed in this past week at <a href="http://www.ntscamp.com/"  target="_blank">NTS Camp</a>. It&#8217;s so amazing to live among a group of people that live real, and aren&#8217;t afraid to show their faults. It&#8217;s not about saying that our faults are ok, but purely the fact that none of us is perfect and allowing everyone to be open enough to seek the help of each other to overcome those faults. That&#8217;s what Christ intended for the church. We cannot be Christ followers alone. We need the help of fellow Christ followers to help us on this journey.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Nehemiah 2:1-3)&#8230;We find Nehemiah waiting patiently for God&#8217;s perfect timing. Do we do that? Over the last year and a half I&#8217;ve seen God&#8217;s perfect timing play out in my own life. The changes that God brought into my life happened rather quickly, but at the same time I had many moments that I needed to rely on Him. The scariest thing had to be moving without a job. I trusted that God had a job all ready for me. And He did.</p>
<p>The next thing that I had to trust God for was how He was going to work out my relationship with Vanessa. I didn&#8217;t know 100% where God was going to lead us. Over the course of 6 or so months He lead us to deciding to get married. Now that we&#8217;re married we still need to trust Him each day to guide us in our marriage, but also guide our lives to be what He intends.</p>
<p>None of us knows the plans God has for us, but we do have the promise of His plans. That&#8217;s where are faith comes in, trusting God will reveal His plans to us when we are ready.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Matthew 5:13)&#8230;We are called to be &#8220;salty&#8221; in this world. Far to often we see that the church, and Christians, have decided that they are simply going to keep to themselves and not be apart of the culture we live in. We wonder why things have gotten so out of hand in society, well if believers aren&#8217;t there to make Godly decisions within society then it&#8217;s sinfulness that&#8217;s making the decisions and driving the world.</p>
<p>How are we as Christians living in our secular work places? I try to do the best I can at my job, however I&#8217;m not always good about making sure that I stand out as different from the rest.  I need to work on being the guy that stands out, I need to bring salt into my workplace and even other places outside the church.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Jeremiah 29:27-28)&#8230;In the United States, we are led to believe that we can just borrow to get anything that we want. This is not how God has commanded us to live as Christians. And when the world around us lives that way it becomes even harder to resist that temptation and not come up with some excuse for doing so. Christians should be the last people to be in financial hardship. All that we have comes from God and He calls us to be good stewards of it. We are disobedient to His calling when we mishandle what He&#8217;s given to us. God wants our tithe of course, but He is just as concerned with how we use and manage the rest of what He has given to us. We can really change this world especially if we&#8217;re financially secure.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(1 Peter 5:8-9)&#8230;This world is a broken place, and things seem to get worse every day. The big question is where are all the Christians among this deterioration of society. Unfortunately they are both falling into it and hiding from it. Christians today are afraid to stand up against the downfall of the world around them. They think they ought to hide and just hang out in there churches. They think that people should be flocking to them at the church. That is totally wrong, it&#8217;s a lie that Satan is feeding. If the world is to be transformed then we need to be going out into the world to change it.</p>
<p>As Christians we are suppose to be living by Christ&#8217;s example, and he didn&#8217;t sit at the synagogue waiting for the people to come, no he went out into the people. He transformed peoples lives because he met them where they were at. We have this so messed up today. We need to be gathering together only to prepare us to transform the world around us outside of the church. God even commanded us to &#8220;go into all the world&#8221; (Mark 16:15), I think too many of us miss the mark here.</p>
<p>The biggest thing that we need to remember is that not all of us are called to be evangelists, but we are witnesses for Christ in our lives. We don&#8217;t have to be evangelizing in order to change the world, we just need to do what we are called to do as followers of Christ. Satan will do everything in His power to stand against us, but we have God on our side so we can stand against anything.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>(Nehemiah 9:16-25)&#8230;There are so many things that we should be thankful to God for. I know that He has blessed me in more ways than I can probably even count. Again, that is one of the things that we sometimes miss out on when we come to Him in prayer. We can too easily go to God in prayer only with our requests, and only when we want something changed. God is loving and wants to hear our prayers, but He also deserves to hear our thanks for everything that He does in our lives. Fortunately for us, God shows us grace and will forgive us for reverting to that way of prayer. And that&#8217;s something to always be thankful for, His unending forgiveness!</p>
