Â©2012 Joe Goode, www.valordesign.com" height="300" width="285" align="left" /&gt;Nicodemus was a Pharisee and a member of the Jewish council. He came to Jesus one night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that God has sent you as a teacher. No one can perform the miracles you perform unless God is with him." Jesus replied to Nicodemus, "I can guarantee this truth: No one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above." Nicodemus asked him, "How can anyone be born when he's an old man? He can't go back inside his mother a second time to be born, can he?" Jesus answered Nicodemus, "I can guarantee this truth: No one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit. Flesh and blood give birth to flesh and blood, but the Spirit gives birth to things that are spiritual. Don't be surprised when I tell you that all of you must be born from above. The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you don't know where the wind comes from or where it's going. That's the way it is with everyone born of the Spirit." (John 3:1-8, GWV)&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

The LORD brought me out by his Spirit and put me down in the middle of a valley. The valley was filled with bones. He led me all around them. I saw that there were very many bones at the bottom of the valley, and they were very dry. Then he asked me, "Son of man, can these bones live?" I answered, "Only you know, Almighty LORD." Then he said to me, "Prophesy to these bones. Tell them, 'Dry bones, listen to the word of the LORD. This is what the Almighty LORD says to these bones: I will cause breath to enter you, and you will live. I will put ligaments on you, place muscles on you, and cover you with skin. I will put breath in you, and you will live. Then you will know that I am the LORD.'" So I prophesied as I was commanded. While I was prophesying, suddenly there was a rattling noise, and the bones came together, one bone attaching itself to another. As I looked, I saw that ligaments were on them, muscles were on them, and skin covered them. Yet, there was no breath in them. Then the LORD said to me, "Prophesy to the breath! Prophesy, son of man. Tell the breath, 'This is what the Almighty LORD says: Come from the four winds, Breath, and breathe on these people who were killed so that they will live.'" So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath entered them. Then they came to life and stood on their feet. There were enough of them to form a very large army. The LORD also said to me, "Son of man, all the people of Israel are like these bones. The people say, 'Our bones are dry, and our hope has vanished. We are completely destroyed.' So prophesy. Tell them, 'This is what the Almighty LORD says: My people, I will open your graves and take you out of them. I will bring you to Israel. Then, my people, you will know that I am the LORD, because I will open your graves and bring you out of your graves. I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live. I will place you in your own land. Then you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken, and I have done it, declares the LORD.'" (Ezekiel 37:1-14, GWV)&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Holy Father, keep them safe by the power of your name, the name that you gave me, so that their unity may be like ours. While I was with them, I kept them safe by the power of your name, the name that you gave me. I watched over them, and none of them, except one person, became lost. So Scripture came true. "But now, Father, I'm coming back to you. I say these things while I'm still in the world so that they will have the same joy that I have. I have given them your message. But the world has hated them because they don't belong to the world any more than I belong to the world. I'm not asking you to take them out of the world but to protect them from the evil one. They don't belong to the world any more than I belong to the world. "Use the truth to make them holy. Your words are truth. I have sent them into the world the same way you sent me into the world.

The younger son said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the property.' So the father divided his property between his two sons. "After a few days, the younger son gathered his possessions and left for a country far away from home. There he wasted everything he had on a wild lifestyle. He had nothing left when a severe famine spread throughout that country. He had nothing to live on. So he got a job from someone in that country and was sent to feed pigs in the fields. No one in the country would give him any food, and he was so hungry that he would have eaten what the pigs were eating. "Finally, he came to his senses. He said, 'How many of my father's hired men have more food than they can eat, while I'm starving to death here? I'll go at once to my father, and I'll say to him, "Father, I've sinned against heaven and you. I don't deserve to be called your son anymore. Make me one of your hired men."' "So he went at once to his father. While he was still at a distance, his father saw him and felt sorry for him. He ran to his son, put his arms around him, and kissed him. Then his son said to him, 'Father, I've sinned against heaven and you. I don't deserve to be called your son anymore.' "The father said to his servants, 'Hurry! Bring out the best robe, and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf, kill it, and let's celebrate with a feast. My son was dead and has come back to life. He was lost but has been found.' Then they began to celebrate. "His older son was in the field. As he was coming back to the house, he heard music and dancing. He called to one of the servants and asked what was happening. "The servant told him, 'Your brother has come home. So your father has killed the fattened calf to celebrate your brother's safe return.' "Then the older son became angry and wouldn't go into the house. His father came out and begged him to come in. But he answered his father, 'All these years I've worked like a slave for you. I've never disobeyed one of your commands. Yet, you've never given me so much as a little goat for a celebration with my friends. But this son of yours spent your money on prostitutes, and when he came home, you killed the fattened calf for him.' "His father said to him, 'My child, you're always with me. Everything I have is yours. But we have something to celebrate, something to be happy about. This brother of yours was dead but has come back to life. He was lost but has been found.'" (Luke 15:11-32, GWV)&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <itunes:summary>Then Jesus said, "A man had two sons. The younger son said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the property.' So the father divided his property between his two sons. "After a few days, the younger son gathered his possessions and left for a country far away from home. There he wasted everything he had on a wild lifestyle. He had nothing left when a severe famine spread throughout that country. He had nothing to live on. So he got a job from someone in that country and was sent to feed pigs in the fields. No one in the country would give him any food, and he was so hungry that he would have eaten what the pigs were eating. "Finally, he came to his senses.

But the Pharisees and the scribes complained, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them." Jesus spoke to them using this illustration: "Suppose a man has 100 sheep and loses one of them. Doesn't he leave the 99 sheep grazing in the pasture and look for the lost sheep until he finds it? When he finds it, he's happy. He puts that sheep on his shoulders and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says to them, 'Let's celebrate! I've found my lost sheep!'

On Sunday they were going to the tomb very early when the sun had just come up. They said to one another, âWho will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?â When they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away. It was a very large stone. As they went into the tomb, they saw a young man. He was dressed in a white robe and sat on the right side. They were panic-stricken. The young man said to them, âDonât panic! Youâre looking for Jesus from Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been brought back to life. Heâs not here. Look at the place where they laid him. Go and tell his disciples and Peter that heâs going ahead of them to Galilee. There they will see him, just as he told them.â They went out of the tomb and ran away. Shock and trembling had overwhelmed them. They didnât say a thing to anyone, because they were afraid. (Mark 16:1-8, GWV)&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

At three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?" When some of the people standing there heard him say that, they said, "Listen! He's calling Elijah." Someone ran and soaked a sponge in vinegar. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus a drink. The man said, "Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down." Then Jesus cried out in a loud voice and died. (Mark 15:33-37, GWV)&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <itunes:summary>At noon darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. At three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lemma sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?" When some of the people standing there heard him say that, they said, "Listen! He's calling Elijah." Someone ran and soaked a sponge in vinegar. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus a drink. The man said, "Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down." Then Jesus cried out in a loud voice and died. (Mark 15:33-37, GWV)</itunes:summary>

He said to his disciples, "Stay here while I pray." He took Peter, James, and John with him and began to feel distressed and anguished. He said to them, "My anguish is so great that I feel as if I'm dying. Wait here, and stay awake." After walking a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if it were possible he might not have to suffer what was ahead of him. He said, "Abba! Father! You can do anything. Take this cup of suffering away from me. But let your will be done rather than mine." He went back and found them asleep. He said to Peter, "Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn't you stay awake for one hour? Stay awake, and pray that you won't be tempted. You want to do what's right, but you're weak." He went away again and prayed the same prayer as before. He found them asleep because they couldn't keep their eyes open. They didn't even know what they should say to him. He came back a third time and said to them, "You might as well sleep now. It's all over. The time has come for the Son of Man to be handed over to sinners. Get up! Let's go! The one who is betraying me is near." Just then, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve apostles, arrived. A crowd carrying swords and clubs was with him. They were from the chief priests, scribes, and leaders of the people. Now, the traitor had given them a signal. He said, "The one I kiss is the man you want. Arrest him, and guard him closely as you take him away." Then Judas quickly stepped up to Jesus and said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him. Some men took hold of Jesus and arrested him. One of those standing there pulled out his sword and cut off the ear of the chief priest's servant. Jesus asked them, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a criminal? I used to teach in the temple courtyard every day. But you didn't arrest me then. But what the Scriptures say must come true." Then all the disciples abandoned him and ran away.

Jesus loved his own who were in the world, and he loved them to the end. While supper was taking place, the devil had already put the idea of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot. The Father had put everything in Jesus' control. Jesus knew that. He also knew that he had come from God and was going back to God. So he got up from the table, removed his outer clothes, took a towel, and tied it around his waist. Then he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and dry them with the towel that he had tied around his waist. When Jesus came to Simon Peter, Peter asked him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?" Jesus answered Peter, "You don't know now what I'm doing. You will understand later." Peter told Jesus, "You will never wash my feet." Jesus replied to Peter, "If I don't wash you, you don't belong to me." Simon Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, don't wash only my feet. Wash my hands and my head too!" Jesus told Peter, "People who have washed are completely clean. They need to have only their feet washed. All of you, except for one, are clean." (Jesus knew who was going to betray him. That's why he said, "All of you, except for one, are clean.") After Jesus had washed their feet and put on his outer clothes, he took his place at the table again. Then he asked his disciples, "Do you understand what I've done for you? You call me teacher and Lord, and you're right because that's what I am. So if I, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you must wash each other's feet. I've given you an example that you should follow. I can guarantee this truth: Slaves are not superior to their owners, and messengers are not superior to the people who send them. If you understand all of this, you are blessed whenever you follow my example. "I'm not talking about all of you. I know the people I've chosen to be apostles. However, I've made my choice so that Scripture will come true. It says, 'The one who eats my bread has turned against me.' I'm telling you now before it happens. Then, when it happens, you will believe that I am the one. "I can guarantee this truth: Whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me." (John 13:1-20, GWV)&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>The Dagger: Basic Training: Testing the Blade (Baptism)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://shepherdoftheridge.org/sites/default/files/by_Pastor%20Dale/Tempering_colors_in_steel.jpg" alt="Tempering colors in steel" height="116" width="300" align="right" />Romans 6:3-7</p> <p> Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. </p> <p> For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin.</p> <p>This is the Word of our Lord. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen.</p> <h1>I. Putting to the test</h1> <p>Weapon blades, like swords and daggers, go through a process called "testing the blade" before being ready for use. The weaponsmith puts the blade in a forge, applying extreme heat to it and leaving it in that heat for an extended period of time, a half hour in modern specialized furnaces, longer in ancient forges. Then, the glowing metal gets pulled from the heat and plunged into water or oil. The process gets repeated again and again, and each time, when properly applied, the blade gets harder, making it less likely to break in battle and better able to retain the sharpness of the blade.</p> <p>What does the water do? It changes the temperature of the blade back to room temperature. That's it. There's nothing special about the water--what's special is the way it's being used. If you apply water to a piece of paper, it won't strengthen it. If you leave that same blade in the same water for long enough, it will rust. But when applied properly, simple water can harden steel. </p> <p>So it is with Baptism. Without this simple, plain old water, we're not fit for spiritual battle. But with the proper application of water, we gain strength and remain sharp in the midst of life's battles.</p> <h1>II. When life heats up</h1> <p>In Scripture, God tests people like Abraham, Job, and Paul. He is not tempting them to sin, as God tempts nobody, but testing them like a blade, so that, through extreme circumstances, they grow stronger. Scripture repeatedly uses fire as a symbol of purification and strengthening, from Sodom &amp; Gomorrah to the end of time, when God will consume this corrupt world with fire.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we all know what it's like to feel the heat in our lives. Deadlines loom. Illness lingers and seems like it'll never go away. Relationships face all kinds of strain and sometimes even get broken. When the fires of life's stresses burn all around you, so you can't see past them, it's hard to see the hope past the flames. But just as God protected Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego from literal flames by being in there with them, so He did and does the same for us.</p> <p>God knows what it's like to feel this world's heat, because He endured it and worse on the cross. He faced the consuming fire of God's wrath over our sin so that we could escape that fire. Just as He came to the men in the furnace to protect them, He came among us as the God-man, Jesus Christ. Isaiah says, "He certainly has taken upon himself our suffering and carried our sorrows, but we thought that God had wounded him, beat him, and punished him. He was wounded for our rebellious acts. He was crushed for our sins. He was punished so that we could have peace, and we received healing from his wounds." (Isaiah 53:4, 5, GWV) When we go through the fires of this life, God knows what it's like, and He loves us enough not only to protect us while we're in the middle of the flames, but eventually to quench the flames altogether.</p> <h1>III. Strengthened by water: all about alignment</h1> <p>So how does applying flame and water strengthen a metal blade? Metal has a crystalline structure that gives it strength, and shocking the structure tightens the crystals, the way a sponge shrinks as it dries. As we endure flaming trials, God quenches the heat with the assurance of His presence through it, and just the knowledge and assurance of Baptism gives us comfort and strength to endure all kinds of trials. As the crystals of a blade line up with each other, so the Holy Spirit, through the water of Holy Baptism, moves our hearts to line up with God's.</p> <p>While Baptism is a one-time event in a Christian's life, its benefits are life-long, like a vaccine, but just as some vaccines need booster shots, so God encourages boosting the benefits of Baptism with regular doses of God's Word. And it's important to point out that being Baptized and reading the Bible are a <i>lot</i> more enjoyable than getting a shot, although it can be painful, too, since God's Word is a two-edged sword that not only gives us the comfort of the Gospel of God's love in Jesus, but the Law that pierces sinful pride to the heart by showing us how out-of-alignment we have taken ourselves. Ancient weaponsmiths would sometimes, instead of using water, cool their heated swords using the living bodies of prisoners or slaves. While this was a horrendous act, God pierces us through with His Sword of the Spirit, the Bible, to kill our sinful idolatrous and loveless hearts so He can raise us up as His new creation.</p> <p>Unlike a steel blade, we have no strength in ourselves. Sin has weakened us to make us unable to stand in the face of temptation, but in Baptism, that old nature gets buried with the weakened body of Christ, only to be raised with the glory of the resurrection, now as those freed from the guilt of sin to live in the love of Jesus, and on the last day at the final physical resurrection to live forever with Him.</p> <p>And because we've been set free from sin and death, we're free to live like we're no longer dead in our sin, free to live as the living children of God. Martin Luther said, "When you wash your face in the morning, remember your Baptism." He meant that yesterday's sins are washed away, so today, you are free from those and don't need to repeat them. It's a fresh start, free to live in God's kingdom as His child. We daily drown the "Old Adam," the sinful nature we inherited, and take on the "New Adam," Jesus Christ and the goodness He has given to us. </p> <p>God has tested us and will continue to keep the heat on, but in doing so, He is preparing us so He can use us in battle against the devil. But as the battle wages on, we can rest assured that the victory has already been won, not by a sword, but three nails and a crown of thorns. And the decisive blow came not with a blade, but a rock, not thrown, but rolled away. May God keep you in the faith of your Baptism resurrection until you experience the final resurrection on the last day, in Jesus' Name, Amen.</p> <p>Now the peace of God, which passes all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>]]></description>

      <itunes:summary>Romans 6:3-7
 
 Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. 
 
 For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin.
 
This is the Word of our Lord. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen.
 
I. Putting to the test
 
Weapon blades, like swords and daggers, go through a process called "testing the blade" before being ready for use. The weaponsmith puts the blade in a forge, applying extreme heat to it and leaving it in that heat for an extended period of time, a half hour in modern specialized furnaces, longer in ancient forges. Then, the glowing metal gets pulled from the heat and plunged into water or oil. The process gets repeated again and again, and each time, when properly applied, the blade gets harder, making it less likely to break in battle and better able to retain the sharpness of the blade.
 
What does the water do? It changes the temperature of the blade back to room temperature. That's it. There's nothing special about the water--what's special is the way it's being used. If you apply water to a piece of paper, it won't strengthen it. If you leave that same blade in the same water for long enough, it will rust. But when applied properly, simple water can harden steel. 
 
So it is with Baptism. Without this simple, plain old water, we're not fit for spiritual battle. But with the proper application of water, we gain strength and remain sharp in the midst of life's battles.
 
II. When life heats up
 
In Scripture, God tests people like Abraham, Job, and Paul. He is not tempting them to sin, as God tempts nobody, but testing them like a blade, so that, through extreme circumstances, they grow stronger. Scripture repeatedly uses fire as a symbol of purification and strengthening, from Sodom &amp; Gomorrah to the end of time, when God will consume this corrupt world with fire.
 
Meanwhile, we all know what it's like to feel the heat in our lives. Deadlines loom. Illness lingers and seems like it'll never go away. Relationships face all kinds of strain and sometimes even get broken. When the fires of life's stresses burn all around you, so you can't see past them, it's hard to see the hope past the flames. But just as God protected Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego from literal flames by being in there with them, so He did and does the same for us.
 
God knows what it's like to feel this world's heat, because He endured it and worse on the cross. He faced the consuming fire of God's wrath over our sin so that we could escape that fire. Just as He came to the men in the furnace to protect them, He came among us as the God-man, Jesus Christ. Isaiah says, "He certainly has taken upon himself our suffering and carried our sorrows, but we thought that God had wounded him, beat him, and punished him. He was wounded for our rebellious acts. He was crushed for our sins. He was punished so that we could have peace, and we received healing from his wounds." (Isaiah 53:4, 5, GWV) When we go through the fires of this life, God knows what it's like, and He loves us enough not only to protect us while we're in the middle of the flames, but eventually to quench the flames altogether....</itunes:summary>

      <title>The Dagger: Basic Training: Defensive Techniques (Lord's Prayer)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://shepherdoftheridge.org/sites/default/files/by_Pastor%20Dale/Prayer%20by%20TSHansen.jpg" alt="Prayer by TSHansen" height="240" width="300" align="left" />(No Audio) Grace, 
mercy, and peace be to you from God our Father and from our Lord and Savior 
Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Amen.</p> 
 
<p>Text: <b>Matthew 6:</b></p> 
 
<p>&nbsp;Pray then like this:</p> 
 
<p>&nbsp;"Our Father in heaven,</p> 
 
<p>hallowed be your name.</p> 
 
<p>&nbsp;Your kingdom come,</p> 
 
<p>your will be done,</p> 
 
<p>on earth as it is in heaven.</p> 
 
<p>&nbsp;Give us this day our 
daily bread,</p> 
 
<p>&nbsp;and forgive us our 
debts,</p> 
 
<p>as we also have forgiven our 
debtors.</p> 
 
<p>&nbsp;And lead us not into 
temptation,</p> 
 
<p>but deliver us from evil.</p> 
 
<p>This 
is the Word of our Lord. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy 
Spirit, Amen.</p> 
 
<p>In 
a battle, a lot of the skill involved comes from muscle memory. As a soldier, 
you strike without much thinking about what you're doing. It's more a 
combination of reflexes and practice, the same way an experienced driver 
automatically hits the brakes when seeing brake lights ahead (or when seeing a 
police car!).</p> 
 
<p>There's 
a point to muscle memory. You don't want to have to devise a strategy or 
consider your best options when the business end of a broadsword is heading 
toward your face. You must act quickly, decisively, and accurately. If you 
don't, your opponent will have a good idea how sharp his sword really is.</p> 
 
<p>Sadly, 
prayer can often become the same muscle memory except with our jaw muscles and tongue, especially the Lord's Prayer. It's the 
most profound prayer ever spoken. It's so well worded that a large percentage 
of our core teachings are based on it. But when you just recite it without 
pondering the meaning, you completely miss the point. Jesus said, "Beware of 
the scribesâ¦who rob widows by taking their houses and then say long prayers to 
make themselves look good. The scribes will receive the most severe 
punishment." (Mark 12:40) Long or repeated prayers don't impress God any more 
than you'd be more likely to give children dessert if they said, "Dear exalted 
mother daughter of her mother before her and matriarch of this household, giver of 
maternal blessings and sweeter than the fruit of the vine and orchard, although 
the supper thou so bountifully providest remaineth on my plate, for my own 
stomach cannot abide thy Brussels Sprouts, and thus shall remain forever and 
ever, we beseech thee, according to thy mercy, to bestow from thy bounty a 
portion of the cake which thou didst form with thine own hands. Amen." OK, even 
<i>that</i> prayer would at least be from the heart&#8212;or the stomach, as 
the case may be&#8212;but the length wouldn't likely sway your decision if they've 
been picking at the food for an hour and whining about it the whole time, and 
the child repeating it regularly would just get annoying, not convincing.</p> 
 
<p>"So 
then," I hear you wonder, "since it's been a year or many years since covering 
this in Confirmation Class, what does this mean, and how then should we pray?"</p> 
 
<p>The 
prayer begins by hallowing God's name "Hallow" means to make something holy, but since God's name is holy, this 
petition is a prayer that He keep us from dragging His name through the mud. It 
means living a life of sacrificial love to show others the sacrificial love of 
Jesus. As disciples of Jesus Christ, we're called to love God with all our 
heart, mind, soul, and strength, but while we tend to focus on the "all your 
mind" or "all your soul" (that is, our emotions), loving Him with all our 
strength, which means using our bodies to benefit others at <i>every</i>opportunity, 
not just when it's not too inconvenient. We pay lip service to God but don't 
live sacrificially for others.</p> 
 
<p>What 
happens when we don't hallow God's name with our lives? As Scripture says, 
"God's name is cursed among the nations because of you." (Romans 2:24) Because 
our lives don't show the sacrificial love of Jesus, they don't believe that 
such a love can exist, and we make God look bad by misrepresenting Him. So no 
matter how eloquently or persuasively we tell others about the love of Jesus, 
we won't be heard. All they can hear is the hypocrisy, because that's what they 
see.</p> 
 
<p>But 
when do do hallow God's name in our lives and relationships, we bring God's kingdom 
among us and cause His will to be done What is God's will? That all people be saved, so that not only do we believe, 
but that others come to believe as we tell and show them the love of Jesus. The 
kingdom of God is where God and people connect, and that happens where the 
Gospel is heard.</p> 
 
<p>We 
strive to keep God's will not for <i>our</i> benefit, but for the benefit of 
others. The kingdom is already among us, but in this prayer, we pray that God 
will use us to connect others with Him as well.</p> 
 
<p>But 
you can't pick and choose which part of this prayer you want to pray. You can't 
say, "God, I want others to come to know you, but don't ask me to live 
sacrificially or hallow Your name in my life." We can't pray, "Father, let Your 
kingdom come to me that I be saved, but don't expect me to seek Your will if it 
means changing my life or habits."</p> 
 
<p>Will 
His kingdom still come? Yes. But not among us and not in our community. It'll 
come somewhere else where His name <i>is</i> hallowed so that those who <i>do</i> 
come into His kingdom will grow in faith and seek God's will so the kingdom will 
continue to come among them.</p> 
 
<p>But 
when we open our eyes to the reality of His kingdom and His grace, it opens our 
eyes to His blessings as 
God uses us to be a blessing to others, and we better recognize His generous 
hand of blessing in our lives. The more we see the abundance of His blessings, 
the more we trust in Him to continue to provide, which frees us to live 
generously, trusting in God instead of thinking His blessings will run out if 
we give them to others.</p> 
 
<p>God 
promises to provide for us: "Bring one-tenth of your income into the storehouse 
so that there may be food in my house. Test me in this way," says the LORD of 
Armies. "See if I won't open the windows of heaven for you and flood you with 
blessings." (Malachi 3:10) But we'd rather cling to what we have instead of 
investing in the kingdom of God. Yes, in this economy, investing is a scary 
word, but while investing in the stock market can be risky, there's no risk in 
investing in the kingdom of God. God gives us this day our daily bread so we 
can give it away. The God we serve is the same God Who fed an entire nation in 
the desert for 40 years. He's the same God! So why don't we believe He can do 
that now and hoard our blessings?</p> 
 
<p>But 
that leads to the rest of the prayer. Forgive us as we forgive others, and 
deliver us from evil. 
Because we haven't trusted God with all that we have and are. We've hoarded not 
just our money, but our whole lives. Like the rich people that Jesus watched 
putting large sums of money into the offering from their surplus, we do the 
same with our lives. We'll give from our time surplus, if we have any. If we're 
particularly comfortable, we can give up a little bit, the scraps from the 
table of our lives, but we're unwilling to give away the comfort and 
convenience and just sustain ourselves on the scraps ourselves. We won't do 
that which causes us to lose our security.</p> 
 
<p>We 
look at the world and (rightly) see sin. But we fail to see the world as 
individuals who were paid for with the blood of Christ. We label them by their 
obvious sin and fail to forgive them. We look at the sin of those in our lives 
and hold onto their sin so we can use it against them later. But Jesus came to 
release us from that. He forgave us when He, more than anyone, had every right 
to hold onto that sin and use it against us. But instead of holding onto that 
sin to use against us, He held onto it so that God would catch Him red-handed 
and charge Him guilty instead of us . 
"God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become 
the righteousness of God." (2 Corinthians 5:21) God hates sin. Jesus became sin 
on our behalf. So for our sake, God hated His Son as He embodied our sin. And 
in turn, we receive His righteousness: His perfection, His holiness. On the 
cross, <i>God gave us His hallowed name</i> by cursing the name of Jesus. When 
we hold onto others' sins or withold the love of Christ, we're cursing those 
whom God has chosen to bless. And so we turn to God and plead with Him to 
deliver us not only from the evil influences in the world, but from the evil 
within us.</p> 
 
<p>And 
whether you end with the doxology: kingdom power &amp; glory foreverâ¦and 
everâ¦or not, the prayer ends with the Hebrew word for truth: Amen. 
This word, Amen, doesn't mean, "Thank-you, please pull around to the first 
window." It means, "Yes, that's absolute truth." It's a word of conviction and 
assurance that God has indeed heard our prayer and will act on it. Now, that's 
dangerous, because if we pray for God to change our hearts and turn us from 
shallow living back to His sacrificial way of living and thinking, we need to 
be ready for that to happen, because if we pray that prayer but don't realize 
what we're praying, one of two things will happen: either God will be offended 
by our prayer like that of the scribes, or He'll actually listen in spite of us 
and transform us, which, if we're not expecting it, will be extremely painful. Instead, 
ask and trust that the giver of all good gifts will give that gift of a life that 
receives love and mercy so much that it overflows out of you into the people 
that God will bring into your life.</p> 
 
<p>Now, 
I'm going to pray the Lord's Prayer. The words are on the screen and in your 
handout. Now that you've heard what that prayer really means, if you really 
mean it, I invite you to pray it with me, and pray it with conviction and 
really mean it. If you don't mean it, don't say it. It'll be an offense to God. 
But if you truly want God's name to be hallowed in your life, please pray with 
me:</p>

Text: Matthew 6:
   Pray then like this:
   "Our Father in heaven,
  hallowed be your name.
   Your kingdom come,
  your will be done,
  on earth as it is in heaven.
   Give us this day our daily bread,
   and forgive us our debts,
  as we also have forgiven our debtors.
   And lead us not into temptation,
  but deliver us from evil.
  This is the Word of our Lord. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen.
  
In a battle, a lot of the skill involved comes from muscle memory. As a soldier, you strike without much thinking about what you're doing. It's more a combination of reflexes and practice, the same way an experienced driver automatically hits the brakes when seeing brake lights ahead (or when seeing a police car !).
  
There's a point to muscle memory. You don't want to have to devise a strategy or consider your best options when the business end of a broadsword is heading toward your face. You must act quickly, decisively, and accurately. If you don't, your opponent will have a good idea how sharp his sword really is.
  
Sadly, prayer can often become the same muscle memory , except with our jaw muscles and tongue, especially the Lord's Prayer. It's the most profound prayer ever spoken. It's so well worded that a large percentage of our core teachings are based on it. But when you just recite it without pondering the meaning, you completely miss the point. Jesus said, "Beware of the scribesâ¦who rob widows by taking their houses and then say long prayers to make themselves look good. The scribes will receive the most severe punishment." (Mark 12:40) Long or repeated prayers don't impress God any more than you'd be more likely to give children dessert if they said, "Dear exalted mother , daughter of her mother before her and matriarch of this household, giver of maternal blessings and sweeter than the fruit of the vine and orchard, although the supper thou so bountifully providest remaineth on my plate, for my own stomach cannot abide thy Brussels Sprouts, and thus shall remain forever and ever, we beseech thee, according to thy mercy, to bestow from thy bounty a portion of the cake which thou didst form with thine own hands. Amen." OK, even that prayer would at least be from the heartâor the stomach, as the case may beâbut the length wouldn't likely sway your decision if they've been picking at the food for an hour and whining about it the whole time, and the child repeating it regularly would just get annoying, not convincing.
  
"So then," I hear you wonder, "since it's been a year or many years since covering this in Confirmation Class, what does this mean, and how then should we pray?"
  
The prayer begins by hallowing God's name . "Hallow" means to make something holy, but since God's name is holy, this petition is a prayer that He keep us from dragging His name through the mud. It means living a life of sacrificial love to show others the sacrificial love of Jesus. As disciples of Jesus Christ, we're called to love God with all our heart, mind, soul, and strength, but while we tend to focus on the "all your mind" or "all your soul" (that is, our emotions), loving Him with all our strength, which means using our bodies to benefit others at every opportunity, not just when it's not too inconvenient. We pay lip service to God but don't live sacrificially for othersâ¦. (Continuedâ¦)</itunes:summary>

If anyone asks you what you are doing, say that the Lord needs it. That person will send it here at once." The disciples found the young donkey in the street. It was tied to the door of a house. As they were untying it, some men standing there asked them, "Why are you untying that donkey?" The disciples answered them as Jesus had told them. So the men let them go. They brought the donkey to Jesus, put their coats on it, and he sat on it. Many spread their coats on the road. Others cut leafy branches in the fields and spread them on the road.

Never commit adultery. Never steal. Never give false testimony. Never cheat. Honor your father and mother." The man replied, "Teacher, I've obeyed all these commandments since I was a boy." Jesus looked at him and loved him. He told him, "You're still missing one thing. Sell everything you have. Give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then follow me!" When the man heard that, he looked unhappy and went away sad, because he owned a lot of property. Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it will be for rich people to enter the kingdom of God!" The disciples were stunned by his words. But Jesus said to them again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God." This amazed his disciples more than ever. They asked each other, "Who, then, can be saved?" Jesus looked at them and said, "It's impossible for people to save themselves, but it's not impossible for God to save them. Everything is possible for God." Then Peter spoke up, "We've given up everything to follow you." Jesus said, "I can guarantee this truth: Anyone who gave up his home, brothers, sisters, mother, father, children, or fields because of me and the Good News will certainly receive a hundred times as much here in this life. They will certainly receive homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields, along with persecutions. But in the world to come they will receive eternal life. But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first." (Mark 10:17-31, GWV)&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

So Philip went. An Ethiopian man who had come to Jerusalem to worship was on his way home. The man was a eunuch, a high-ranking official in charge of all the treasures of Queen Candace of Ethiopia. As the official rode along in his carriage, he was reading the prophet Isaiah out loud. The Spirit said to Philip, "Go to that carriage, and stay close to it." Philip ran to the carriage and could hear the official reading the prophet Isaiah out loud. Philip asked him, "Do you understand what you're reading?" The official answered, "How can I understand unless someone guides me?" So he invited Philip to sit with him in his carriage. This was the part of the Scriptures that the official was reading: "He was led like a lamb to the slaughter. He was like a sheep that is silent when its wool is cut off. He didn't open his mouth. When he humbled himself, he was not judged fairly. Who from his generation will talk about his life on earth being cut short?" The official said to Philip, "I would like to know who the prophet is talking about. Is he talking about himself or someone else?" Then Philip spoke. Starting with that passage, Philip told the official the Good News about Jesus. As they were going along the road, they came to some water. The official said to Philip, "Look, there's some water. What can keep me from being baptized?"  The official ordered the carriage to stop. He and Philip stepped into the water, and Philip baptized him. When they had stepped out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away. The official joyfully continued on his way and didn't see Philip again. Philip found himself in the city of Azotus. He traveled through all the cities and spread the Good News until he came to the city of Caesarea. (Acts 8:26-40, GWV)&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Dinner was prepared for Jesus in Bethany. Martha served the dinner, and Lazarus was one of the people eating with Jesus. Mary took a bottle of very expensive perfume made from pure nard and poured it on Jesus' feet. Then she dried his feet with her hair. The fragrance of the perfume filled the house. One of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was going to betray him, asked, "Why wasn't this perfume sold for a high price and the money given to the poor?" (Judas didn't say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief. He was in charge of the moneybag and carried the contributions.) Jesus said to Judas, "Leave her alone! She has done this to prepare me for the day I will be placed in a tomb. You will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me with you." A large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was in Bethany. So they went there not only to see Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom Jesus had brought back to life. The chief priests planned to kill Lazarus too. Lazarus was the reason why many people were leaving the Jews and believing in Jesus. (John 12:1-11, GWV)&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

They addressed King Nebuchadnezzar, "Your Majesty, may you live forever! Your Majesty, you gave an order that everyone who hears the sound of rams' horns, flutes, lyres, harps, and three-stringed harps playing at the same time with all other kinds of instruments should bow down and worship the gold statue. Your order said that whoever doesn't bow down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace. There are certain Jews whom you appointed to govern the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. These men didn't obey your order, Your Majesty. They don't honor your gods or worship the statue that you set up." Then, in a fit of rage and anger, Nebuchadnezzar summoned Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Immediately, they were brought to the king. Nebuchadnezzar asked them, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you don't honor my gods or worship the gold statue that I set up? When you hear the sound of the rams' horns, flutes, lyres, harps, and three-stringed harps playing at the same time with all other kinds of instruments, will you bow down and worship the gold statue I made? If you don't worship it, you will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace. What god can save you from my power then?" Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered King Nebuchadnezzar, "We don't need to answer your last question. If our God, whom we honor, can save us from a blazing furnace and from your power, he will, Your Majesty. But if he doesn't, you should know, Your Majesty, we'll never honor your gods or worship the gold statue that you set up." Nebuchadnezzar was so filled with anger toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face turned red. He ordered that the furnace should be heated seven times hotter than normal. He told some soldiers from his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego so that they could be thrown into the blazing furnace. Then the three men were thrown into the blazing furnace. They were wearing their clothes, hats, and other clothing. The king's order was so urgent and the furnace was so extremely hot that the men who carried Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were killed by the flames from the fire. So these three men--Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego--fell into the blazing furnace. They were still tied up. Then Nebuchadnezzar was startled. He sprang to his feet. He asked his advisers, "Didn't we throw three men into the fire?" "That's true, Your Majesty," they answered. The king replied, "But look, I see four men. They're untied, walking in the middle of the fire, and unharmed. The fourth one looks like a son of the gods." Then Nebuchadnezzar went to the door of the blazing furnace and said, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego--servants of the Most High God--come out here." Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire. The king's satraps, governors, mayors, and advisers gathered around the three men. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies. The hair on their heads wasn't singed, their clothes weren't burned, and they didn't smell of smoke. Nebuchadnezzar said, "Praise the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He sent his angel and saved his servants, who trusted him. They disobeyed the king and risked their lives so that they would not have to honor or worship any god except their own God. So I order that people from every province, nation, or language who say anything slanderous about the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be torn limb from limb. Their houses will be turned into piles of rubble. No other god can rescue like this." Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to higher positions in the province of Babylon.

In those days a prophecy from the LORD was rare; visions were infrequent. One night Eli was lying down in his room. His eyesight had begun to fail so that he couldn't see well. The lamp in God's temple hadn't gone out yet, and Samuel was asleep in the temple of the LORD where the ark of God was kept. Then the LORD called Samuel. "Here I am," Samuel responded. He ran to Eli and said, "Here I am. You called me." "I didn't call you," Eli replied. "Go back to bed." So Samuel went back and lay down. The LORD called Samuel again. Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, "Here I am. You called me." "I didn't call you, son," he responded. "Go back to bed." Samuel had no experience with the LORD, because the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him. The LORD called Samuel a third time. Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, "Here I am. You called me." Then Eli realized that the LORD was calling the boy. "Go, lie down," Eli told Samuel. "When he calls you, say, 'Speak, LORD. I'm listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his room. The LORD came and stood there. He called as he had called the other times: "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel replied, "Speak. I'm listening." (1 Samuel 3:1-10, GWV)&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

When you have found him, report to me so that I may go and worship him too." After they had heard the king, they started out. The star they had seen rising led them until it stopped over the place where the child was. They were overwhelmed with joy to see the star. When they entered the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary. So they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. God warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod. So they left for their country by another road.

Say to the nations, "The LORD rules as king!" The earth stands firm; it cannot be moved. He will judge people fairly. Let the heavens rejoice and the earth be glad. Let the sea and everything in it roar like thunder. Let the fields and everything in them rejoice. Then all the trees in the forest will sing joyfully in the LORD'S presence because he is coming.

Jesus' mother was there. Jesus and his disciples had been invited too. When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, "They're out of wine." Jesus said to her, "Why did you come to me? My time has not yet come." His mother told the servers, "Do whatever he tells you." Six stone water jars were there. They were used for Jewish purification rituals. Each jar held 18 to 27 gallons. Jesus told the servers, "Fill the jars with water." The servers filled the jars to the brim. Jesus said to them, "Pour some, and take it to the person in charge." The servers did as they were told. The person in charge tasted the water that had become wine. He didn't know where it had come from, although the servers who had poured the water knew. The person in charge called the groom and said to him, "Everyone serves the best wine first. When people are drunk, the host serves cheap wine. But you have saved the best wine for now." Cana in Galilee was the place where Jesus began to perform miracles. He made his glory public there, and his disciples believed in him. (John 2:1-11, GWV)&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

On the night he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took bread and spoke a prayer of thanksgiving. He broke the bread and said, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this to remember me." When supper was over, he did the same with the cup. He said, "This cup is the new promise made with my blood. Every time you drink from it, do it to remember me." Every time you eat this bread and drink from this cup, you tell about the Lord's death until he comes. (1 Corinthians 11:23-26, GWV)&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

She entered Zechariahâs home and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard the greeting, she felt the baby kick. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. She said in a loud voice, âYou are the most blessed of all women, and blessed is the child that you will have. I feel blessed that the mother of my Lord is visiting me. As soon as I heard your greeting, I felt the baby jump for joy. You are blessed for believing that the Lord would keep his promise to you.â Mary said, âMy soul praises the Lordâs greatness! My spirit finds its joy in God, my Savior, because he has looked favorably on me, his humble servant. âFrom now on, all people will call me blessed because the Almighty has done great things to me. His name is holy. For those who fear him, his mercy lasts throughout every generation. âHe displayed his mighty power. He scattered those who think too highly of themselves. He pulled strong rulers from their thrones. He honored humble people. He fed hungry people with good food. He sent rich people away with nothing. âHe remembered to help his servant Israel forever. This is the promise he made to our ancestors, to Abraham and his descendants.â Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back home.

He wanted to know whether or not you would wholeheartedly obey his commands. So he made you suffer from hunger and then fed you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had seen before. He did this to teach you that a person cannot live on bread alone but on every word that the LORD speaks. Your clothes didn't wear out, and your feet didn't swell these past 40 years.

He loves us so much that we are actually called God's dear children. And that's what we are. For this reason the world doesn't recognize us, and it didn't recognize him either. Dear friends, now we are God's children. What we will be isn't completely clear yet. We do know that when Christ appears we will be like him because we will see him as he is.

      <itunes:summary>Consider this: The Father has given us his love. He loves us so much that we are actually called God's dear children. And that's what we are. For this reason the world doesn't recognize us, and it didn't recognize him either. Dear friends, now we are God's children. What we will be isn't completely clear yet. We do know that when Christ appears we will be like him because we will see him as he is. So all people who have this confidence in Christ keep themselves pure, as Christ is pure.

If anyone else thinks that he can trust in something physical, I can claim even more. I was circumcised on the eighth day. I'm a descendant of Israel. I'm from the tribe of Benjamin. I'm a pure-blooded Hebrew. When it comes to living up to standards, I was a Pharisee. When it comes to being enthusiastic, I was a persecutor of the church. When it comes to winning God's approval by keeping Jewish laws, I was perfect. These things that I once considered valuable, I now consider worthless for Christ. It's far more than that! I consider everything else worthless because I'm much better off knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. It's because of him that I think of everything as worthless. I threw it all away in order to gain Christ and to have a relationship with him. This means that I didn't receive God's approval by obeying his laws. The opposite is true! I have God's approval through faith in Christ. This is the approval that comes from God and is based on faith that knows Christ. Faith knows the power that his coming back to life gives and what it means to share his suffering. In this way I'm becoming like him in his death, with the confidence that I'll come back to life from the dead. It's not that I've already reached the goal or have already completed the course. But I run to win that which Jesus Christ has already won for me. Brothers and sisters, I can't consider myself a winner yet.

      <itunes:summary>"although I could have confidence in my physical qualifications. If anyone else thinks that he can trust in something physical, I can claim even more. I was circumcised on the eighth day. I'm a descendant of Israel. I'm from the tribe of Benjamin. I'm a pure-blooded Hebrew. When it comes to living up to standards, I was a Pharisee. When it comes to being enthusiastic, I was a persecutor of the church. When it comes to winning God's approval by keeping Jewish laws, I was perfect. These things that I once considered valuable, I now consider worthless for Christ. It's far more than that! I consider everything else worthless because I'm much better off knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. It's because of him that I think of everything as worthless. I threw it all away in order to gain Christ and to have a relationship with him. This means that I didn't receive God's approval by obeying his laws. The opposite is true! I have God's approval through faith in Christ. This is the approval that comes from God and is based on faith that knows Christ. Faith knows the power that his coming back to life gives and what it means to share his suffering. In this way I'm becoming like him in his death, with the confidence that I'll come back to life from the dead. It's not that I've already reached the goal or have already completed the course. But I run to win that which Jesus Christ has already won for me. Brothers and sisters, I can't consider myself a winner yet. This is what I do: I don't look back, I lengthen my stride, and I run straight toward the goal to win the prize that God's heavenly call offers in Christ Jesus."

If God is for us, who can be against us? God didn't spare his own Son but handed him over to death for all of us. So he will also give us everything along with him. Who will accuse those whom God has chosen? God has approved of them. Who will condemn them? Christ has died, and more importantly, he was brought back to life. Christ has the highest position in heaven. Christ also intercedes for us. What will separate us from the love Christ has for us? Can trouble, distress, persecution, hunger, nakedness, danger, or violent death separate us from his love? As Scripture says: "We are being killed all day long because of you. We are thought of as sheep to be slaughtered." The one who loves us gives us an overwhelming victory in all these difficulties.

There he would have to suffer a lot because of the leaders, chief priests, and scribes. He would be killed, but on the third day he would be brought back to life. Peter took him aside and objected to this. He said, "Heaven forbid, Lord! This must never happen to you!" But Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get out of my way, Satan! You are tempting me to sin.

      <itunes:summary>"From that time on Jesus began to inform his disciples that he had to go to Jerusalem. There he would have to suffer a lot because of the leaders, chief priests, and scribes. He would be killed, but on the third day he would be brought back to life. Peter took him aside and objected to this. He said, "Heaven forbid, Lord! This must never happen to you!" But Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get out of my way, Satan! You are tempting me to sin. You aren't thinking the way God thinks but the way humans think." Then Jesus said to his disciples, "Those who want to come with me must say no to the things they want, pick up their crosses, and follow me. Those who want to save their lives will lose them. But those who lose their lives for me will find them. What good will it do for people to win the whole world and lose their lives? Or what will a person give in exchange for life?"

This kind of worship is appropriate for you. Don't become like the people of this world. Instead, change the way you think. Then you will always be able to determine what God really wants--what is good, pleasing, and perfect. Because of the kindness that God has shown me, I ask you not to think of yourselves more highly than you should. Instead, your thoughts should lead you to use good judgment based on what God has given each of you as believers. Our bodies have many parts, but these parts don't all do the same thing. In the same way, even though we are many individuals, Christ makes us one body and individuals who are connected to each other. God in his kindness gave each of us different gifts. If your gift is speaking God's word, make sure what you say agrees with the Christian faith. If your gift is serving, then devote yourself to serving. If it is teaching, devote yourself to teaching. If it is encouraging others, devote yourself to giving encouragement. If it is sharing, be generous. If it is leadership, lead enthusiastically. If it is helping people in need, help them cheerfully." Romans 12:1-8, GWV&lt;/p&gt;

When a man discovered it, he buried it again. He was so delighted with it that he went away, sold everything he had, and bought that field. "Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant who was searching for fine pearls. When he found a valuable pearl, he went away, sold everything he had, and bought it. "Also, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea. It gathered all kinds of fish. When it was full, they pulled it to the shore. Then they sat down, gathered the good fish into containers, and threw the bad ones away. The same thing will happen at the end of time. The angels will go out and separate the evil people from people who have God's approval. Then the angels will throw the evil people into a blazing furnace. They will cry and be in extreme pain there. "Have you understood all of this?" "Yes," they answered. So Jesus said to them, "That is why every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven is like a home owner. He brings new and old things out of his treasure chest."&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

If there is anyone like me, let him say so. Let him tell me what happened when I established my people long ago. Then let him predict what will happen to them. Don't be terrified or afraid. Didn't I make this known to you long ago? You are my witnesses. Is there any God except me? There is no other rock; I know of none.</itunes:summary>

If you live by your corrupt nature, you are going to die. But if you use your spiritual nature to put to death the evil activities of the body, you will live. Certainly, all who are guided by God's Spirit are God's children. You haven't received the spirit of slaves that leads you into fear again. Instead, you have received the spirit of God's adopted children by which we call out, "Abba! Father!" The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children. If we are his children, we are also God's heirs. If we share in Christ's suffering in order to share his glory, we are heirs together with him.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

He said, "Leave at once for the important city, Nineveh. Announce to the people that I can no longer overlook the wicked things they have done." Jonah immediately tried to run away from the LORD by going to Tarshish. He went to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. He paid for the trip and went on board. He wanted to go to Tarshish to get away from the LORD. The LORD sent a violent wind over the sea. The storm was so powerful that the ship was in danger of breaking up. The sailors were afraid, and they cried to their gods for help. They began to throw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship's load. Now, Jonah had gone below deck and was lying there sound asleep. The captain of the ship went to him and asked, "How can you sleep? Get up, and pray to your God. Maybe he will notice us, and we won't die." Then the sailors said to each other, "Let's throw dice to find out who is responsible for bringing this disaster on us." So they threw dice, and the dice indicated that Jonah was responsible. They asked him, "Tell us, why has this disaster happened to us? What do you do for a living? Where do you come from? What country are you from? What nationality are you?" Jonah answered them, "I'm a Hebrew. I worship the LORD, the God of heaven. He is the God who made the sea and the land." Then the men were terrified. They knew that he was running away from the LORD, because he had told them. They asked Jonah, "Why have you done this?" The storm was getting worse. So they asked Jonah, "What should we do with you to calm the sea?" He told them, "Throw me overboard. Then the sea will become calm. I know that I'm responsible for this violent storm." Instead, the men tried to row harder to get the ship back to shore, but they couldn't do it. The storm was getting worse. So they cried to the LORD for help: "Please, LORD, don't let us die for taking this man's life. Don't hold us responsible for the death of an innocent man, because you, LORD, do whatever you want." Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the sea became calm. The men were terrified of the LORD. They offered sacrifices and made vows to the LORD. The LORD sent a big fish to swallow Jonah. Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights. From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the LORD his God. Jonah prayed: "I called to the LORD in my distress, and he answered me. From the depths of my watery grave I cried for help, and you heard my cry. You threw me into the deep, into the depths of the sea, and water surrounded me. All the whitecaps on your waves have swept over me. "Then I thought, 'I have been banished from your sight. Will I ever see your holy temple again?' "Water surrounded me, threatening my life. The deep sea covered me completely. Seaweed was wrapped around my head. I sank to the foot of the mountains. I sank to the bottom, where bars held me forever. But you brought me back from the pit, O LORD, my God. "As my life was slipping away, I remembered the LORD. My prayer came to you in your holy temple. Those who hold on to worthless idols abandon their loyalty to you. But I will sacrifice to you with songs of thanksgiving. I will keep my vow. Victory belongs to the LORD!" Then the LORD spoke to the fish, and it spit Jonah out onto the shore.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

So they asked Jonah, "What should we do with you to calm the sea?" He told them, "Throw me overboard. Then the sea will become calm. I know that I'm responsible for this violent storm." Instead, the men tried to row harder to get the ship back to shore, but they couldn't do it. The storm was getting worse. So they cried to the LORD for help: "Please, LORD, don't let us die for taking this man's life. Don't hold us responsible for the death of an innocent man, because you, LORD, do whatever you want." Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the sea became calm. The men were terrified of the LORD. They offered sacrifices and made vows to the LORD. The LORD sent a big fish to swallow Jonah. Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights. From inside the fish Jonah prayed to the LORD his God. Jonah prayed: "I called to the LORD in my distress, and he answered me. From the depths of my watery grave I cried for help, and you heard my cry. You threw me into the deep, into the depths of the sea, and water surrounded me. All the whitecaps on your waves have swept over me. "Then I thought, 'I have been banished from your sight. Will I ever see your holy temple again?' "Water surrounded me, threatening my life. The deep sea covered me completely. Seaweed was wrapped around my head. I sank to the foot of the mountains. I sank to the bottom, where bars held me forever. But you brought me back from the pit, O LORD, my God. "As my life was slipping away, I remembered the LORD. My prayer came to you in your holy temple. Those who hold on to worthless idols abandon their loyalty to you. But I will sacrifice to you with songs of thanksgiving. I will keep my vow. Victory belongs to the LORD!" Then the LORD spoke to the fish, and it spit Jonah out onto the shore.</itunes:summary>

Daniel was one of these officials. The satraps were to report to these three officials so that the king wouldn't be cheated. This man, Daniel, distinguished himself among the other officials and satraps because there was an extraordinary spirit in him. The king thought about putting him in charge of the whole kingdom. So the other officials and satraps tried to find something to accuse Daniel of in his duties for the kingdom. But they couldn't find anything wrong because he was trustworthy. No error or fault could be found. These men said, "We won't find anything to accuse this man, Daniel, unless we find it in his religious practices." So these officials and satraps went to the king as a group. They said to him, "May King Darius live forever! All the officials, governors, satraps, advisers, and mayors agree that the king should make a statute and enforce a decree. The decree should state that for the next 30 days whoever asks for anything from any god or person except you, Your Majesty, will be thrown into a lions' den. Your Majesty, issue this decree, and sign it. According to the law of the Medes and Persians no one could change it or repeal it." So Darius signed the written decree. When Daniel learned that the document had been signed, he went to his house. An upper room in his house had windows that opened in the direction of Jerusalem. Three times each day he got down on his knees and prayed to his God. He had always praised God this way.
(Daniel 6:13-17) They replied, "Your Majesty, Daniel, one of the captives from Judah, refuses to obey your order or the decree that you signed. He prays three times each day." The king was very displeased when he heard this. He tried every way he could think of to save Daniel. Until sundown he did everything he could to rescue him. Then Daniel's accusers gathered in front of the king. They said to him, "Remember, Your Majesty, the Medes and Persians have a law that no decree or statute the king makes can be changed." So the king gave the order, and Daniel was brought to him and thrown into the lions' den. The king told Daniel, "May your God, whom you always worship, save you!" A stone was brought and placed over the opening of the den. The king put his seal on the stone, using his ring and the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel's situation could not be changed.
(Daniel 6:19-22) At dawn, as soon as it was light, the king got up and quickly went to the lions' den. As he came near the den where Daniel was, the king called to Daniel with anguish in his voice, "Daniel, servant of the living God! Was God, whom you always worship, able to save you from the lions?" Daniel said to the king, "Your Majesty, may you live forever! My God sent his angel and shut the lions' mouths so that they couldn't hurt me. He did this because he considered me innocent. Your Majesty, I haven't committed any crime."
(Daniel 6:25-27) Then King Darius wrote to the people of every province, nation, and language all over the world: I wish you peace and prosperity. I decree that in every part of my kingdom people should tremble with terror in front of Daniel's God, the living God who continues forever. His kingdom will never be destroyed. His power lasts to the end of time. He saves, rescues, and does miraculous signs and amazing things in heaven and on earth. He saved Daniel from the lions.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

When Balaam got up in the morning, he saddled his donkey and left with the Moabite princes. God became angry that he was going. So the Messenger of the LORD stood in the road to stop him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, accompanied by his two servants. When the donkey saw the Messenger of the LORD standing in the road with his sword drawn, the donkey turned off the road into a field. Balaam hit the donkey to get it back on the road. Where the road went through the vineyards, it was narrow, with stone walls on both sides. Now the Messenger of the LORD stood there. When the donkey saw the Messenger of the LORD, it moved over and pinned Balaam's foot against the wall. So Balaam hit the donkey again. Then the Messenger of the LORD moved ahead and stood in a narrower place where there was no room to turn to the right or the left. When the donkey saw the Messenger of the LORD, it lay down under Balaam. Balaam became so angry he hit the donkey with his stick. Then the LORD made the donkey speak, and it asked Balaam, "What have I done to make you hit me three times?" Balaam answered, "You've made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I'd kill you right now." The donkey said to Balaam, "I'm your own donkey. You've always ridden me. Have I ever done this to you before?" "No," he answered. Then the LORD let Balaam see the Messenger of the LORD who was standing in the road with his sword drawn. So Balaam knelt, bowing with his face touching the ground. The Messenger of the LORD asked him, "Why have you hit your donkey three times like this? I've come here to stop you because the trip you're taking is evil. The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If it had not turned away from me, I would certainly have killed you by now but spared the donkey." Balaam said to the Messenger of the LORD, "I've sinned. I didn't know you were standing there in the road to stop me. If you still think this trip is evil, I'll go back." The Messenger of the LORD said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but say only what I tell you." So Balaam went with Balak's princes.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

He asked the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must never eat the fruit of any tree in the garden'?" The woman answered the snake, "We're allowed to eat the fruit from any tree in the garden except the tree in the middle of the garden. God said, 'You must never eat it or touch it. If you do, you will die!'" "You certainly won't die!" the snake told the woman. "God knows that when you eat it your eyes will be opened. You'll be like God, knowing good and evil." The woman saw that the tree had fruit that was good to eat, nice to look at, and desirable for making someone wise. So she took some of the fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. Then their eyes were opened, and they both realized that they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together and made clothes for themselves. In the cool of the evening, the man and his wife heard the LORD God walking around in the garden. So they hid from the LORD God among the trees in the garden. The LORD God called to the man and asked him, "Where are you?" He answered, "I heard you in the garden. I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid." God asked, "Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat fruit from the tree I commanded you not to eat from?" The man answered, "That woman, the one you gave me, gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it." Then the LORD God asked the woman, "What have you done?" "The snake deceived me, and I ate," the woman answered. So the LORD God said to the snake, "Because you have done this, You are cursed more than all the wild or domestic animals. You will crawl on your belly. You will be the lowest of animals as long as you live. I will make you and the woman hostile toward each other. I will make your descendants and her descendant hostile toward each other. He will crush your head, and you will bruise his heel." He said to the woman, "I will increase your pain and your labor when you give birth to children. Yet, you will long for your husband, and he will rule you." Then he said to the man, "You listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree, although I commanded you, 'You must never eat its fruit.' The ground is cursed because of you. Through hard work you will eat food that comes from it every day of your life. The ground will grow thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat wild plants. By the sweat of your brow, you will produce food to eat until you return to the ground, because you were taken from it. You are dust, and you will return to dust." Adam named his wife Eve [Life] because she became the mother of every living person. The LORD God made clothes from animal skins for the man and his wife and dressed them. Then the LORD God said, "The man has become like one of us, since he knows good and evil. He must not reach out and take the fruit from the tree of life and eat. Then he would live forever." So the LORD God sent the man out of the Garden of Eden to farm the ground from which the man had been formed. After he sent the man out, God placed angels and a flaming sword that turned in all directions east of the Garden of Eden. He placed them there to guard the way to the tree of life.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

A feeling of fear came over everyone as many amazing things and miraculous signs happened through the apostles. All the believers kept meeting together, and they shared everything with each other. From time to time, they sold their property and other possessions and distributed the money to anyone who needed it. The believers had a single purpose and went to the temple every day. They were joyful and humble as they ate at each other's homes and shared their food. At the same time, they praised God and had the good will of all the people. Every day the Lord saved people, and they were added to the group.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

When they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away. It was a very large stone. As they went into the tomb, they saw a young man. He was dressed in a white robe and sat on the right side. They were panic-stricken. The young man said to them, "Don't panic! You're looking for Jesus from Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been brought back to life. He's not here. Look at the place where they laid him. Go and tell his disciples and Peter that he's going ahead of them to Galilee.

This is what happened. Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, Zebedee's sons, and two other disciples of Jesus were together. Simon Peter said to the others, "I'm going fishing." They told him, "We're going with you." They went out in a boat but didn't catch a thing that night. As the sun was rising, Jesus stood on the shore. The disciples didn't realize that it was Jesus. Jesus asked them, "Friends, haven't you caught any fish?" They answered him, "No, we haven't." He told them, "Throw the net out on the right side of the boat, and you'll catch some." So they threw the net out and were unable to pull it in because so many fish were in it. The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It's the Lord." When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put back on the clothes that he had taken off and jumped into the sea. The other disciples came with the boat and dragged the net full of fish. They weren't far from the shore, only about 100 yards. When they went ashore, they saw a fire with a fish lying on the coals, and they saw a loaf of bread. Jesus told them, "Bring some of the fish you've just caught." Simon Peter got into the boat and pulled the net ashore. Though the net was filled with 153 large fish, it was not torn. Jesus told them, "Come, have breakfast." None of the disciples dared to ask him who he was. They knew he was the Lord. Jesus took the bread, gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had come back to life.&lt;/p&gt;

Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, Zebedee's sons, and two other disciples of Jesus were together. Simon Peter said to the others, "I'm going fishing." They told him, "We're going with you." They went out in a boat but didn't catch a thing that night. As the sun was rising, Jesus stood on the shore. The disciples didn't realize that it was Jesus. Jesus asked them, "Friends, haven't you caught any fish?" They answered him, "No, we haven't." He told them, "Throw the net out on the right side of the boat, and you'll catch some." So they threw the net out and were unable to pull it in because so many fish were in it. The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It's the Lord." When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put back on the clothes that he had taken off and jumped into the sea. The other disciples came with the boat and dragged the net full of fish. They weren't far from the shore, only about 100 yards. When they went ashore, they saw a fire with a fish lying on the coals, and they saw a loaf of bread. Jesus told them, "Bring some of the fish you've just caught." Simon Peter got into the boat and pulled the net ashore. Though the net was filled with 153 large fish, it was not torn. Jesus told them, "Come, have breakfast." None of the disciples dared to ask him who he was. They knew he was the Lord. Jesus took the bread, gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had come back to life.

After sending the people away, he went up a mountain to pray by himself. When evening came, he was there alone. The boat, now hundreds of yards from shore, was being thrown around by the waves because it was going against the wind. Between three and six o'clock in the morning, he came to them. He was walking on the sea. When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified. They said, "It's a ghost!" and began to scream because they were afraid. Immediately, Jesus said, "Calm down! It's me. Don't be afraid!" Peter answered, "Lord, if it is you, order me to come to you on the water." Jesus said, "Come!" So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus. But when he noticed how strong the wind was, he became afraid and started to sink. He shouted, "Lord, save me!" Immediately, Jesus reached out, caught hold of him, and said, "You have so little faith! Why did you doubt?" When they got into the boat, the wind stopped blowing. The men in the boat bowed down in front of Jesus and said, "You are truly the Son of God."&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

As Jesus stepped out of the boat, a man came out of the tombs and met him. The man was controlled by an evil spirit and lived among the tombs. No one could restrain him any longer, not even with a chain. He had often been chained hand and foot. However, he snapped the chains off his hands and broke the chains from his feet. No one could control him. Night and day he was among the tombs and on the mountainsides screaming and cutting himself with stones. The man saw Jesus at a distance. So he ran to Jesus, bowed down in front of him, and shouted, "Why are you bothering me now, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me." He shouted this because Jesus said, "You evil spirit, come out of the man." Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He told Jesus, "My name is Legion [Six Thousand], because there are many of us." He begged Jesus not to send them out of the territory. A large herd of pigs was feeding on a mountainside nearby. The demons begged him, "Send us into the pigs! Let us enter them!" Jesus let them do this. The evil spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea and drowned. Those who took care of the pigs ran away. In the city and countryside they reported everything that had happened. So the people came to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons. The man was sitting there dressed and in his right mind. The people were frightened. Those who saw this told what had happened to the demon-possessed man and the pigs. Then the people began to beg Jesus to leave their territory. As Jesus stepped into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged him, "Let me stay with you." But Jesus would not allow it. Instead, he told the man, "Go home to your family, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been to you." So the man left. He began to tell how much Jesus had done for him in the Ten Cities. Everyone was amazed.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

The people crowded around him as they listened to God's word. Jesus saw two boats on the shore. The fishermen had stepped out of them and were washing their nets. So Jesus got into the boat that belonged to Simon and asked him to push off a little from the shore. Then Jesus sat down and taught the crowd from the boat. When he finished speaking, he told Simon, "Take the boat into deep water, and lower your nets to catch some fish." Simon answered, "Teacher, we worked hard all night and caught nothing. But if you say so, I'll lower the nets." After the men had done this, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to tear. So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. Their partners came and filled both boats until the boats nearly sank. When Simon Peter saw this, he knelt in front of Jesus and said, "Leave me, Lord! I'm a sinful person!" Simon and everyone who was with him was amazed to see the large number of fish they had caught. James and John, who were Zebedee's sons and Simon's partners, were also amazed. Jesus told Simon, "Don't be afraid. From now on you will catch people instead of fish." Simon and his partners brought the boats to shore, left everything, and followed Jesus.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Simon and everyone who was with him was amazed to see the large number of fish they had caught. James and John, who were Zebedee's sons and Simon's partners, were also amazed. Jesus told Simon, "Don't be afraid. From now on you will catch people instead of fish." Simon and his partners brought the boats to shore, left everything, and followed Jesus.</itunes:summary>

He went to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. He paid for the trip and went on board. He wanted to go to Tarshish to get away from the LORD. The LORD sent a violent wind over the sea. The storm was so powerful that the ship was in danger of breaking up. The sailors were afraid, and they cried to their gods for help. They began to throw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship's load. Now, Jonah had gone below deck and was lying there sound asleep. The captain of the ship went to him and asked, "How can you sleep? Get up, and pray to your God. Maybe he will notice us, and we won't die." Then the sailors said to each other, "Let's throw dice to find out who is responsible for bringing this disaster on us." So they threw dice, and the dice indicated that Jonah was responsible. They asked him, "Tell us, why has this disaster happened to us? What do you do for a living? Where do you come from? What country are you from? What nationality are you?" Jonah answered them, "I'm a Hebrew. I worship the LORD, the God of heaven. He is the God who made the sea and the land." Then the men were terrified. They knew that he was running away from the LORD, because he had told them. They asked Jonah, "Why have you done this?" The storm was getting worse. So they asked Jonah, "What should we do with you to calm the sea?" He told them, "Throw me overboard. Then the sea will become calm. I know that I'm responsible for this violent storm." Instead, the men tried to row harder to get the ship back to shore, but they couldn't do it. The storm was getting worse. So they cried to the LORD for help: "Please, LORD, don't let us die for taking this man's life. Don't hold us responsible for the death of an innocent man, because you, LORD, do whatever you want." Then they took Jonah and threw him overboard, and the sea became calm. The men were terrified of the LORD. They offered sacrifices and made vows to the LORD.&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Jesus said to them, "Why do you cowards have so little faith?" Then he got up, gave an order to the wind and the sea, and the sea became very calm.

      <itunes:summary>(Psalms 2:6-12) "I have installed my own king on Zion, my holy mountain." I will announce the LORD'S decree. He said to me: "You are my Son. Today I have become your Father. Ask me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance and the ends of the earth as your own possession. You will break them with an iron scepter. You will smash them to pieces like pottery." Now, you kings, act wisely. Be warned, you rulers of the earth! Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, or he will become angry and you will die on your way because his anger will burst into flames. Blessed is everyone who takes refuge in him.</itunes:summary>

But your hearts might turn away, and you might not listen. You might be tempted to bow down to other gods and worship them. If you do, I tell you today that you will certainly be destroyed.

I call on heaven and earth as witnesses today that I have offered you life or death, blessings or curses. Choose life so that you and your descendants will live.
