			<description>Mean In Green: The Oakland Athletics Podcast
Final record: 93-69, Won the AL West by 4 games
Currently leading the ALDS 2-0 over the Twins

Due to the recording schedule and my desire to get this episode posted quickly, you may notice that the recording is a bit rougher (mistakes, gaps, etc.) than normal. Once this playoff madness ends, hopefully with the A's acquiring some new hardware, things should settle down a bit and return to normal.

This week:
# ALDS Game 2 recap
# The big play and the big loss
# Die national broadcasters, die!
# More...

Episode 9, Week  16
93 down, 69 to go
Record: 48-45, Leading the AL West by 1/2 game, 1 game losing "streak"

First, I have to apologize profusely for the poor audio quality and for the hack-job I did on editing this week's episode. You'll find that some things I normally edit out were left in, which makes for a pretty rough episode. There were a lot of new variables introduced this week that I hadn't accounted for, which threw a wrench into the works. I'm working on improving this in future shows. Also, this show has been broken into two separate episodes because of its total length of over 2 hours. It's all definitely worth listening to, though we'll be going back to normal, bite-sized episodes on the next one. Now, onto the show notes:  

I've got co-hosts! This week we'll be discussing:
Part 1
# The A's midseason grades

Part 2
# Is Zito gone?
# Frank Thomas' baserunning
# The state of the Coliseum
# Which teams in the A.L. West will be improving after the All-Star Break?
