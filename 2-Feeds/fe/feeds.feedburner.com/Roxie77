I am the Mole!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And although I am not entirely alone (there are a bunch of great guys in this years AC group line-up, see below) I do find myself at this second sitting (alone) in a  Arizona Hotel Suite (albeit an AmeriSuite) getting ready for yet another Big Rock Show Alice Cooper Tour, typing away at 6:06 am, and missing the family which has recently been upgraded from "couple &amp; baby" to "Roxie Super Cult" with the addition of one Natashia Grace, born on May 9th, 2005. Welcome to the world Natashia!!.....now papa's gotta spilt for the next 7 months....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now before you start getting all "concerned" and feeling sorry for the guy that has to leave his newly expanded family and be away for the better part of the next year, STOP right there!  Cause like I said many times before....this is one of the best jobs I could ever ask for. There are not many out there that get to see the world the way I get to see it, meet the amazing people that inhabit it (a.k.a. YOU!), or be able to afford to take the time off in between tours. I always said that if I ever bitch about having the life I've been able to live, then punch me! (Well, don't really punch me, I'm too vain for that you know!).....Besides, when I think about all the brave men and women that are serving in the Armed Forces that have no choice but to be away from their families for MUCH longer time periods and under MUCH worse conditions, it puts everything into perspective. Oh yeah, that and the fact that they have to dodge f#*%king bullets......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So don't feel so bad for me, rather just take a second to think a hopeful thought for the guys and gals stationed somewhere they don't really wanna be (let's be honest, at this point even the biggest of war-mongers didn't still think we'd be considered "occupiers"), and hope that they can come home soon.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.......like I've stated before, these blogs are like my therapy, so basically you can consider yourself a psychological voyeur.....happy?  Well I feel much better now, and ready to talk about the business at hand. "So much time and so little to do".....strike that and reverse it (thank you Willy Wonka for helping me invent my own language!).....just what IS going on in the world of Camp Roxie?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that are on the fast track and just want 7 facts (didn't have 77 of them)...here ya go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Moved to Sweden with the family&lt;br /&gt;2. Had a baby girl&lt;br /&gt;3. Finished a new Alice Cooper record called "Dirty Diamonds" coming out this summer&lt;br /&gt;4. Gonna be touring with AC until Dec.&lt;br /&gt;5. Have a new line of Roxie77 merch that will be available at the shows and on the Roxie77 website&lt;br /&gt;6. Starting a "Pod-Cast" called "Roxie's Big Rock Show"&lt;br /&gt;7. Will do my best to have a new R77 cd completed by early-mid '06&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those of you that can't get enough of my garrulous banter, here is the long form:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The move to Sweden........well, the most asked question so far has been "How is Svvvwwweeeedeen?" and all I can easily answer the question by saying...."I don't know......"&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I don't think I'll be able to give Sweden a fair judgment until we live through one or two of the crazy "dark periods" which basically happens from Nov-Feb. I was lucky enough to travel back and forth to the States so I've only really spent a little over 2 1/2 months there so far......I will tell you this though, it's one of the most beautiful cities in the world and in my heart I know we did the right thing by making the move.....we'll get back to this question in about 2 years and see then, shall we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Little Natashia Grace is just amazing....if you would like to go see any pictures of her, you can go to the myspace website and search on ryan roxie, or just click on the link at the bottom of this email. Lennon has been waaaaayyy more then cool to her and he even blesses her when she sneezes......"Mama, Papa, Lennon, NaTASHIA......friends!"....that is one of Lennon's favorite quotes, and it breaks our hearts every-time he says it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. We finished writing  and recording the new Alice Cooper CD entitled "Dirty Diamonds".......If "the Eyes" was a return to more of the "garage" sound,  think of "Diamonds" as the "tool shed"!.... It actually has a larger spectrum of music on it as far as styles go. You can hear the influences of all the Alice characters and voices on this record. It's heavy, light, pop, and rock n' roll all at the same time. Very few artists are allowed to make records these days that have as many styles as this one has on it. Alice is in a unique position to to that. Mostly thanks to all you "Sick Things" out there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And judging from some of the fan forum reviews, the response has been very good so far. Heyyyy.....just HOW did you get that copy!??! ..... Well, if you downloaded it for free, next time you see me, just slide me 1 dollar and give me "the look" and we'll both know and move on with our lives.....! And you think I'm joking...? ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The dates for the new Alice Cooper Dirty Diamonds Tour are forever!....get it?...So one way or another I'm sure we will be playing either your local stadium or civic center in the coming year. And don't think for a second that we are not going to surprise you with this years set list. All I can say is break out the kleenex, and your bic lighters, it's acoustic ballad time baby!!....The new stage set is right out of a Paris graveyard complete with a purple velvet coffin.....and.......Leeeeyyyy Guuuuuiioootttiiinnne!!! You'll also experience "the Piece".....Piece of Mind? Piece of Crap?.....no......simply...The Piece......Killer Dude, Killer....ooops, have I given away another clue perhaps.....??!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This years line up features DamonJohnson.com  on guitar, ChuckGarric.com on bass, your humble host on guitar roxie77.com......and just like an unexpected herpes outbreak....it's the RETURN of Eric-Singer.com on drums!! ...And, oh yeah....the guy with the funny eye make-up that keeps us all employed on lead vocals. Please feel free to check out all the guys individual websites.....Alice even has his own website, although he looks a little like a baby deer when he stares into my Macintosh screen....Infact check out the alicecooper.com website for a list of dates. I think we might also have them posted at the roxie77 website under the "special offer" link which offers yet another year of guitar/bass lessons with the good people over at IMG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. When you say Roxie77 swag, can you say...."Coin Purse!?!?!" yeah yeah yeah.....ya don't have to be an 80 year old man to enjoy the wonders and amazement of your very own R77 coin purse. Plus we have an all new  "Pan-Am" logo style R77 halter shirt available for all the ladies and cross-dressers out there....AND back by popular demand, the return of the R77 Wonka Shirt.....All that along with plenty of shrink-wrapped copies of Roxie77's debut cd: Peace, Love &amp; Armageddon.....check out the website or email me to see the styles and prices. And if you know that you are coming to the big rock show and know that you want some Roxie swag, drop me an email and we'll arrange a drop-off/pick-up point (just like an Argentinean kidnapping/ ransom money scenario!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. "Coming to you somewhere between Stockholm and Sweden, It's ROXIE'S BIG ROCK SHOW.....'cause wherever you are is the place to be...."   Yeah I stole the quote from Damon, sue me (actually, please don't sue me Warner Brothers, you'll probably win!)......In case you haven't heard about the next big new thing, just ask the 12 year old kid that lives next door. You know, the same kid that turned you on to text messaging and using the word "bounce" instead of just  "leaving". After he explains that the next big thing(s) are Jessica Simpsons breasts in the "new" Dukes of Hazzard movie (although you'll always be a sucker for 'ol school Catherine Bach as Daisy), he'll probably tell ya Pod-Casting baby, Pod Casting.....think of it as TiVo for your iPod. (If you have to ask yourself what an iPod is, then just skip this section....(you'll figure it out as soon as you realize that programming a VCR is futile!).....Pod Casting will allow you to download a biweekly (let's hope) "big rock show" starring your humble host. I'll be pulling favors from all the cast of characters I've been able to meet over the years, and bring you their stories as well as their music. I will also of course play music from the 104 bands that I have been a part of over the years as well....Stay tuned to the roxie77.com web site or the myspace.com website for the launch date info. One thing for sure, of all the pod-casts that are out there today, Roxie's Big Rock Show will be one of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. How the hell can I introduce a new line of swag without even a new line of music written??....(Silk-screening baby, that's how!).....but that being said, I have been and will continue to be writing songs for the next R77 record which I plan on recording as soon as the "Dirty Diamonds last Forever"  '05Tour is wrapped up....Do something memorable at one of the shows and maybe it will show up on the next R77 album in the form of a song....BUT!!! and I DO mean BUT: Think  "Madonna &amp; Brittany"  not  "John Hinkly Jr.".....thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that about wraps it up for this pre-tour rant.....off to the world down-under to hang out with The Divinyls and eat tons of Vegimite off of Natalie Imbruglia's shoulders.........here we come Australia.....don't hate us because of our exchange-rate....love us for our bland accents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to ALL  the rest of you good souls out there that have stood by the 'ol Moles prose, thank you, and I hope to hear from you by dropping by the website, or MySpace, or seeing ya out there with your "mole" banners that always put a smile on my face! You ALL have been soooo supportive in participating in this circus. And it's my personal goal to get the word out this year that "It's not what you are on the inside, it's what you look like on the outside!" Strike that, reverse it!.....thanks  a lot Willy Wonka..(again..)!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See you good people soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the noise......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roxie  a.k.a.  The Mole.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Points of Interest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to All Spam-fighting software out there, you will notice that there are very few (if any) hyperlinks in this email.....that means that in order to track the links down you will have to do the 'ol school copy-paste thing with the names and add your own www.   sooooo...... the links for me would be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;roxie77.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;myspace.com/ryanroxie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;roxie77.blogspot.com/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some super crazed R77'ers have started a chat group over at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;groups.yahoo.com/group/Ryan_Roxie_77/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;check it all out and if this blog entertained you, turn on a friend!.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck in  your search and hope to hear from ya soon.....!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our world, our time, and our place....we can pay tribute to the&lt;br /&gt;past, and speculate about the future, but the only thing for sure is RIGHT&lt;br /&gt;NOW....so make the most of it. Yesterday is history, tomorrow is uncertain,&lt;br /&gt;today you shine.....If you're going to heaven, congratulations...if you're&lt;br /&gt;going straight to hell, you might as well enjoy the ride....R77&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5467712-111888435249535240?l=roxie77.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>PERFECT</title><link>http://roxie77.blogspot.com/2005_04_01_archive.html#111257078075099887</link><author>roxie@roxie77.com (Ryan Roxie)</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2005 16:26:20 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5467712.post-111257078075099887</guid><description>PERFECT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of us are perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all have scars, lines, stretch marks, moles, &amp; birthmarks that stare us back in the mirror daily to remind us of how imperfect we actually are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our teeth are too big, too small, or some that are missing… We have too much or too little hair in all the wrong places. Our feet stink, our breath is bad, and our underarms smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our bodies sag and bloat in certain areas so much so that we shove plastic bags in ourselves to correct it, or insert hoses into our bodies to vacuum the imperfectness out. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of us with straight hair, wish it had body. Those of us who are curly…...buy flat irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use dye, make-up, and perfumes to change, cover-up, and disguise what we really are like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of us can only see far away, some only see close up. Some of us can’t see at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We inject ourselves with ink in a painful process called tattooing to celebrate our unique individuality. Yet, more often then not, our expression of  “uniqueness” is picked from a wall or stolen from this week’s favorite MTV/ESPN/Cooking Channel Pop Star….(or maybe it was just a drunken weekend down in Cabo San Lucas.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love the opposite sex. We love the same sex. We love sex period! Some of us even love sex with animals……(excluding the Giraffe….that which I have not yet seen… yet…)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of us eat too much. Some of us eat too little. Some of us eat so much that we make ourselves throw-up and end up dying of starvation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We pierce, we peel, we pluck, and we paint ourselves for what??? To be loved and accepted by someone who is plucked and painted to our specifications? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I’m just “scratching the surface” (get it?)…..these are the things that we feel are imperfect on the OUTSIDE of our bodies….!!  What about the insides? Our minds, our souls, ourSELVES? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m gonna stop right there, cause the minute I start talking about what goes on in peoples heads is the minute I start writing my own self-help book…..and I figured that self-help books were supposed to be for one’s SELF!!  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put the SELF Help industry out of business by everyone going and writing their OWN SELF-help book. What works for John Doe ain’t necessarily gonna work for Jen X. Spend some time to figure out what it is that makes you a positive influence in this world instead of letting someone (or something) spoon feed you their agenda. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I guess that’s my point….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do whatever you want to with yourselves and your bodies….&lt;br /&gt;Doll yourself up. Smell like a rose. Electrolyses every follicle of hair off your pimply ass…..but don’t do it cause the T.V. said to “just do it”. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be an individual on your own terms, not a statistical demographic from a nationwide ad campaign.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love what you do to yourself. Don’t do things to yourself in hopes of others loving you any more or any less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of how you think you look, there is someone who desperately wishes they could have what you feel needs to be altered or changed. Don’t feel guilty about it; just realize it once in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if I were to write a self-help book….it would be about a sentence long:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHAPTER ONE: &lt;br /&gt;“Take the time to figure out your own SELF. No matter how dumb we act from time to time, we are ALL smart enough to figure ourselves out…besides is there anyone else that you have spent more time with in your life other then yourself? Answer: no one”  THE END&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edward James Almos and Bryan Adams were screen and pop star idols despite their scarred faces.  Cindy Crawford makes millions because of a brown, hairy (just guessing) birthmark prominently displayed right above her lip. Christy Canyon will go down in porn star history not for her acting ability, but for her huge saggy tits. Madonna, J-Lo, and Prince are all megalomaniac bitchy short people….who cares?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are all perfect.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;…..except for those of you having sex with giraffes…..go get some fuckin’ help……&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JJ King&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: If you enjoyed this, send it to friend and turn ‘em on to this link……    Roxie77 Blog Spot     http://roxie77.blogspot.com/&lt;br /&gt;Rome wasn’t built  in a day, and this blog site sure ain’t the Vatican……cheers!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5467712-111257078075099887?l=roxie77.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Mole Special Report: L.A. vs. Stockholm....Eternal Sunshine or Never ending Winter?....hmmmm</title><link>http://roxie77.blogspot.com/2005_02_01_archive.html#110913957615985491</link><author>roxie@roxie77.com (Ryan Roxie)</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2005 22:19:36 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5467712.post-110913957615985491</guid><description>This just in!!!:  For those of you that have been receiving my emails from my Dizney77 AOL account, you can now reach me 24-7 at:  roxie@roxie77.com    Thanks for making the switch! And now back to your regularly scheduled program....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greetings to The R77 Street Teamers and AC Camp Worldwide,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the Mole!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Life has a way of changing Life the way you planned it...."   Isn't that a quote from Forest Gump or the last fortune cookie you opened up? Nahh.......it's a line taken from a new Roxie77 song and couldn't be more apropos to what's going on in my world at the moment....and possible yours too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sit here writing to you all from Orlando, Florida....days before me and the family embark on one of  the most unconventional "experiments" in my life. Yes, "The Move" that I spoke of in the last installment of the Mole Reports is about ready to take place, and I couldn't be more terrifyingly excited about the outcome. But maybe it's not so much about the final result as it is more about enjoying the moments that lead up to the outcome, let me explain.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the last time we've met on the 'ol computer screen the top 5 things that have taken place in my small rectangle of a world. We have:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Witnessed one of the most devastating natural disasters in recorded history with the  Indian Ocean Tsunami tragedy. Blink, and a quarter-million peoples lives are lost and countless others forever changed. One of the best suggestions that I have heard is to mark your calendars one year or even two years from now because that's when the people of these affected countries are really gonna need our financial help. There are many good organizations doing great things to help the situation and if you search them out on the Internet and are able to contribute even just  a little, the right organization doing the right thing will find you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Lost lord knows how many more men and women fighting in a war that was once based on W.M.D's and now seemingly more about someone else's democracy. I'm not gonna sit here and spew my political views, you know me better then that. But I can only hope that the troops now serving overseas can come back to their own lives in the U.S. as soon as possible. There is this misconception that if you are not backing this war in Iraq, you are not backing the troops. Simply not true. In-fact, it's the contrary. I know how brave, courageous, and dedicated our troops our to this country (a hell of a lot  braver then my generation that was lucky enough never to have been sent to war) because I've talked to them and heard their stories. I can only hope you can do the same and seek out a solider and hear their take. Their words paint a different landscape (both better and worse) of what's really going on there rather then what we are spoon fed daily through the media. And I'm not suggesting a cut and run policy, rather a realistic time line to send our armed forces home that will show the world that our country doesn't want to be the "occupiers" we have been labeled....whoops, there I go spewing my political views.... sorry, damn, move on.... to lighter things.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Seen the New England Patriots legitimately become the "dynasty" team they rightfully deserve to be called.....For those of you outside the U.S., I'm talkin' football.....the one NOT played with the round ball kind of football....And for all the face painting chowder head R77'ers up in the North East still walking around shirtless and drunk in sub-degree weather, just remember who you have to thank for starting your cute little "dynasty"....That's right, the beloved Oakland Raiders and a little 'ol play a couple of years back  called the "tuck rule snowball miracle"...... but I'm not bitter....I'm not bitter.......yes, I'm BITTER!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Started to record the new Alice Cooper record!! Yes, and as usual, you can count on the Mole to bring you the inside scoop on the making of Alice's 408th record (has there really been that many?)..... So, ya liked the "band" concept of the Eyes?? Sure ya did, we'll this new record is taking the band sound to a new level (high or low depends on your musical tastes I guess)..... I'm really excited about the songs on this one because I  feel they represent the whole spectrum of all the different styles Alice has shown through his career. There are songs on this one that recall the early psychedelic side, the straight ahead theatrical classic AC rock demigod sound, and even some that even dance around with (or sound I say mosh) the newer, heavier, dare I say it eightiesh  facet of the man you have come to love as the Coop.....Only thing missing?.... No songs about golf....not just yet, I should say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. "__________________" Fill in the blank to what's been going on in your world as well, cause what's going on in your life is just as important as the Moles, because the Mole cares, he really cares.....(and you thought the Mole never brown-nosed! Ha! How do ya think we got such a big emailing list?!?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that's happening on the front side of 2005, isn't the later half of the year gonna be boring and mundane.......what the heck ya mean?! what the heck ya mean?!....Come summertime, it's time to tour, tour, tour.......and don't think that I haven't been keeping an eye out on some new countries and cities that we haven't played yet (can you say Iceland?? Bjork, Bjork...here we come!...and there she goes...).....as well as all the "usual suspect" places that never disappoint......So keep an Eye out for the AC summer camp tour as it rolls on into your head-space and plays music from the future....!! Soooo Pauly Shore just now...who??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all of you " R77 street teamers" out there that have ordered the Roxie 77 debut CD" Peace, Love &amp; Armageddon" on the www.roxie77.com website or where ever else fine music is sold, we thank you from the bottom of our empty pockets...! ha! Seriously, you guys have been such a great source of inspiration that we might have to start recording another album as soon as this next AC tour wraps up....As soon as I can figure out the rehearsal schedule (the guys live in L.A., I'll be living in Sweden....maybe we'll have to call rehearsals in N.Y.C!!).....Because of your kind adoration of the 'ol R77 at the past Coop shows (i.e.. all the "wonka shirts" and Mole signs), there are some promoters out there that would like to see Roxie77 come around and play a mini big rock show....as soon as we get stuffed finalized, you KNOW I'll be typing away begging and graveling for your street team support....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So away we go......Thank you L.A. for being a constant reminder that anything is possible in this life.....where else can a middle class kid who comes from the suburbs, meet the girl of his dreams who comes from half way around the world, then lands a job playing guitar for one of his rock n' roll idols, which then affords him the  opportunity to move to Europe and raise his family the best way he can .....?? Only in Los Angeles, baby....I might have cursed you once or twice (depending on just how much attitude or traffic you threw my way) but guess what? You treated me right L.A.....and I will forever be grateful to you....You turned "the boy into the man" but because of the good times and "second chances" you've given me, I've still remained the boy to much of the extent....Ahhhh....gettin' all sappy are ya?...Don't say it, Don't say it!....Damn, I'm gonna say it....Damn you Randy Newman!!!   "I Love L.A!!!............ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I think I'm gonna love Stockholm too....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until we meet again, on the road or in the wonderful world of cyberspace....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace, Love and The SI Swimsuit Issue.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- the Mole a.k.a. Roxie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Remember: For those of you that have been receiving my emails from my Dizney77 AOL account, you can now reach me 24-7 at:  roxie@roxie77.com    Thanks for making the switch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.roxie77.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;get to meet the rest of the guys at&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; www.chuckgarric.com, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; www.tommyclufetos.com, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; www.sextus.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.damonjohnson.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.teddyzigzag,com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or get to know the main man at&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;www.alicecooper.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PSS&lt;br /&gt;If you wanna read up on the past Mole posts feel free to go here:    Roxie77 Blog Spot         http://roxie77.blogspot.com/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PSSS&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to pass this on to anyone else in the free universe (free for now that is!!)....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace, Love, and Armageddon..... the new CD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our world, our time, and our place....we can pay tribute to the&lt;br /&gt;past, and speculate about the future, but the only thing for sure is RIGHT&lt;br /&gt;NOW....so make the most of it.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I am the Mole!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;In the immortal words of George Harrison, "All things must pass"......and after being on a crowed tour bus and/or stuffy dressing room with the same guys (and one girl) for the past year I have amended the quote to: "All things must pass gas....." 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And so it is, the end of The Eyes of Alice Cooper Tour 2004....never more, never more.....never more....at least until next year!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I gotta tell ya, this was one of  the most rewarding tours I had ever been on....and most of the credit goes to you, the ones reading this post....'cause you are the die-hards, you are the faithful, you are the ones!  You are the ones that give us the chance to play our songs, promote our own music and cd's, and live out our big rock show fantasies. So before this starts sounding like a sappy, cheesy, Ashley Simpson lip-sync lip service ass-kiss-fest, let's just leave it at saying "Thanks for coming out to the shows and giving us the much appreciated support!"  Now, let's talk about the Real World (nooooo, not the MTV show!!.....) 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Damn! It feels weird to be part of the "real" world again.....yeah that's right buddy, the real world where one has to actually pay for their own stuff!....a world where green fees &amp; golf carts are not comped. A world where there is no lifetime supply of Chocolate or Coronas. A world where when you go to a restaurant you actually see your OWN hand picking up the check instead of someone else's (anyone else's pleeeeeze!)  A world where your evenings don't end in the morning, and your mornings don't  begin in the afternoon, and your afternoon don't even really exist then at all do they?(I think I even managed to confuse myself this time!)  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;What kind of world is this this "real" world?.....madness I tell you! Take me back to the "fake" world of the Big Rock Show Tour where everything really is like an After School Special, and people do actually live happily ever after...........But no, it's time to come back. Just like it was time to stop making those Rocky sequels, or time to stop releasing R.E.M. albums....it was time to come back to the light, come back home!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And that is where you find me friends....Home. Home, that's a funny word, 'cause when your humble narrator is on tour, "Home" is whatever town I'm in any given night. That's why when I write to you all, I really have this sense that I know a tiny bit about your world (even though I probably don't have a clue!).....but as fate, luck, or destiny might have it, the next "Mole Report" I write might be coming to you from an entirely new Home!.....let me explain:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;As many of you might know, or none of you have ever heard....I'm married to an amazing Swedish girl and we are lucky enough to have a super cool little guy........Now, I don't talk about it much (do real Moles get married and have kids?...hmmm, I'll have to watch more Animal Planet), but I don't talk about it so much 'cause I don't want to let the "mole out of the bag" so to speak....! If all you American,or Canadian, or Japanese, or every other nationality of men where to find out how cool the Scandinavian women  and culture are, you'd all be suiting up in your bright orange vests, jumping in your pick-up trucks and  be going Swede-hunting before I had a chance to actually start my own master race colony there! ha!  So here is the plan....or  the Simple Plan for those of you keeping score at home.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;After many, many  years of talking about "the Move", we have escalated the operation to planning "the Move"......now this is not to say that "the Move" will actually happen...but let me tell you, the difference of one's own mental state from "talking" to "planning" is huge!  The opportunity is there.....so only time will tell. In 6 months I shall be communicating to you from a very warm or cold climate depending on fate and/or a good real estate agent!....
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So why tell you all about something that may or may not happen..??? STUFF....!!! That's why, STUFF!!! I've got too much stuff, and when I say stuff, I mean I got waaaaayy to many T-shirts and bottle-openers....so don't be surprised if the Mole announces a huge closet clearing in the near future.....what good is my 110 volt crimping iron gonna do me in a 220 volt country! So stay tuned, you might soon be the owner of a barely used wet-suit, or better yet, a brand new 10lb bag of Johnny Kat litter! The good news is, if I do decide to have the Great Closet Clean-Out of Roxie 77, all profits will go to my favorite charity, The Art of Elysium www.theartofelysium.org  That's right, they are still doing amazing and fulfilling work bringing music and hope to many at the Children's Hospital in Hollywood Ca. They have big plans to expand their entire operation soon so check out their website and see what these good people are doing to help others that really need it!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So what's up in the creative world of R77 and The AC Group you might ask? Well.........unless you are suffering from severe short-term memory loss, or simply have my Mole reports Spam-guarded, you already know that the official release of the Roxie 77 debut CD "Peace, Love &amp; Armageddon" is here and available at the Roxie 77 website. And yes, don't think it doesn't fit beautifully underneath both a Christmas Tree AND a Yamakah...hint, hint, Ha! The title of the R77 cd even sounds like a Holiday Season album....aside from the whole Armageddon thing of course....and what about all this talk about the new AC album...??? Well......
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure that many of you have heard the rumblings of a new Alice record in the works....well you are correct sir! But if you think you have the direction of this next record all figured out, then.....fill us in!! I don't think that even us (the band) will know exactly what type of path this next album will take until it's already shrink-wrapped, but I can tell you this: We are going to do our best to maximize the sheer Raw Power of the sleazy rock n' roll Alice, but ALSO explore and expand on the Theatrical &amp; Dramatic side of Alice....So look for an album that crosses "nervous" with "nightmare" and comes up with something totally all its own, but still totally Alice.....there, now that I've just written the press release, let's move on... ha!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So after 83 shows, 30 rounds of golf (oh yeah, Alice got me and the rest of the band hooked finally on that little white ball....better that then hooked on that little white rock!) 5 different band line-ups, and about 70,000 frequent flyer miles (why can't  tour bus miles count as well, I'd have earned enough Greyhound Tickets to visit each and every one of you twice??!!) what did I learn,or should I say what did I see from the Eye's of Alice Cooper? 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I saw that no matter what the critics and pessimists think,  the Torch of Rock is burning bright through out the world! You, the people, no matter what the Multi-national Corporations try to spoon feed you... you WANT your rock n' roll, you NEED your rock n' roll, and you GOTTA HAVE your Wal-Mart Super Stores! (hmmmm...guess the multi-nationals got us on that one!)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I also learned that one shouldn't always Blame Canada....infact, one should embrace Canada.......amazing landscapes, people, and money exchange! We toured there for so long this time that I feel I might of picked up the accent and really started to understand what the country is aboooot...eeeeehhhhh??!!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And finally,I Iearned that no matter how many miles you might travel away from it, Home is right there where ever you are.....Home is on the tour bus with 9 other people: laughing, yelling, mocking &amp; praising with a common goal in mind: get to the next show! Home is playing a place that you've never been before and looking out to see so many great and supportive fans appreciating the fact that we have brought the rock show to THEIR home......and ultimately, Home is being away for half the year doing something you love dearly, but also having to leave something that you love even more, and the first word out of the little guys mouth when he see's you is, "papa!"
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;It's good to be Home........have a great Holiday Season and we'll see ya in 2005
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Peace, Love and Desperate Housewives.....

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I am the Mole!  And I swear to God, if we had just hired a camera crew to travel with us on this past 2nd leg of the Eyes of Alice Cooper Tour 2004 we would most definitely have had the #1 rated reality T.V. show in America (and possibly the world!) So much drama and bizarre events have taken place in these past months that I would have titled the show: The "lives" of Alice Cooper.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But being that there wasn't even a video camera (that WE know of) within 50 ft. of the following episodes, you will just have to trust the 'ol Moles shaky recounting of these listed events as the gospel truth. Not withstanding the Moles insatiable desire for writers embellishment, the following situations definitely, maybe,really, possibly occurred  exactly how they are described below:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Top 5 things to come out of the Bizzaro World of the Alice Cooper Camp, but not making the CNN ticker.....except for the snake incident:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;1. The Ebola "Eye" Virus hits the tour: what started looking like a simple case of someone using the opening bands eye liner and protracting a simple eye irritation turns out to almost blind the entire band and crew! Eric Dover and Cali were the two that the eye fungus hit first and hardest......causing them to perform shows with large "Jackie-O" type glasses and even some shows Mr. Dover performing with an Eye-patch (and those of you who saw those shows thought that Eric was just trying to revive a Prince Purple Rain-era outfit.....well, maybe he was!)  The Captain Morgan look was fun, the real threat  of spreading the crippling eye fungus disease was not....luckily (except for Cali or Dover) it didn't spread beyond the two (and all their friends back home that merely looked at them!)  So once again.....the AC camp dodges a bullet and doesn't have to change the name of the tour to "The bleeding virus fungus laden Eye's of Alice Cooper Tour 2004".....how would that fit on a marquee anyway!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;2.  One Week.....Three Busses:  when you are on the road, the tour bus is your home....well guess what, we moved houses 3 times in 1 week!  We are not entirely sure that management changed busses and drivers in search of the perfect ride or in search of the perfect right fielder for the AC softball team currently known as the Nightmares.....what we DO  know is that following a heroic win where our former driver was awarded the MVP of the game, a change was made. And immediately following the change the Nightmares lost their next game.....could this be worse then the Cubbie Curse?.....only time will tell!  Also, regarding fun little bus anecdotes, on a recent bus drive from Market C to Market F we were forced to pull over to the side of the road while just 500 yds. ahead of us, we witnessed a traveling "meth-lab" truck burn to the ground....trust me, I couldn't make this up if I tried!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;3. The Return of Teddy Zig-Zag: As if changing busses wasn't hard enough....changing band members too?? With over 2 1/2 weeks left with the 2nd Leg, who could the Alice Cooper camp rely on to finish up the dates? The immediate thought was to find another guitarist, but wait......isn't there someone ALREADY in the organization that hasn't made an appearance on The EYE's tour yet, but HAS performed on the album....you got it, the answer is soooooo simple: Teddy Zig-Zag!!  Coming in with just 48 hrs. of time to prepare himself for the big rock show, Zig-Zag showed amazing grace and courage getting thrown into the ring of fire......congrats Teddy....."heeeeeee's baaaaaaaack! The Man Behind the Spanish Wrestlers Mask!"   For those of you that came to the 2 transition shows with just 1 guitar, or as I like to refer to them as the "Led Cooper" or "Alice Van Halen" line-up, you witnessed a little AC history......the first time that the big rock show was performed with a 4-piece line up.....kudos to the Alice Cooper road crew of technicians and sound/lighting designers that really stepped up and helped turn a potentially sucky situation into a nice shot of adrenaline right into the butt of the band! (ambiguously gay comment.....I know)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;4. The Rise &amp; Fall &amp; Rise of the AC Nightmares:  As many of you know, or may not know, the Alice Cooper Organization has put together a softball team comprising of Band, Crew and Management with sublime and horrific results.....the amalgamation of these three ingredients have created a synergy that can only be compared to popcorn, raisenettes, and a bad 80's movie.....actually, the team has had some really exciting and well played games and its over all record now stands at 4 wins--1loss......but man was that loss ugly!.....for more play by play on each of the games go check out:
&lt;br /&gt;Like we said before, the Nightmares will take on any Radio Station, Convalescent Home, or Hooters Restaurant that feel they have the (soft) balls to take us on!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;5. Snake bites off more then she can chew:  the world infamous boa that graces Alice's shoulders night after night during "Sick Things" apparently wanted just a little bit more to eat after her weekly fill of filthy rodent....don't we all?  But an electric heating pad? The sight of an electric cord coming out of a snakes mouth is scary enough.....the fact that the cord was still plugged in is even more surreal!  The Luck of Alice Cooper must be passed onto his snake, because just like a bizarre after school special, the Snake went into Emergency surgery,survived, and is recovering nicely in a nice Snake hospice. The Snake shall hopefully live happily ever after.......filthy rodents and electric blankets beware!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Soooooo.....there ya go, a little update to keep ya'll in the loop of what's REALLY going on in the Life and Crimes of the Alice Cooper Camp.....and for those of you that know the Mole as the official spokes-animal of Roxie 77, then you must be getting pretty excited about the Official release of the R77 debut CD: Peace, Love &amp; Armageddon.....it's just upon us, and in a matter of days or weeks (not years I promise!) we will be posting up info on exactly when, where, how &amp; why to pick up the new disc either through the Internet, or through your favorite Mom &amp; Pop multi-national corporate record shop......so c'mon by the site and help celebrate Armageddon.....it's finally here!!!...ironic, no?!?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And as we get ready for this Third and final leg of the 2004 Eye's of Alice Cooper big rock show, remember:  We see you out there at the shows! We appreciate your enthusiasm, support and amazing energy you give us. Don't be afraid to say hello and have us sign your breasts (unless you have a hairy chest, in that case the sharpie is ruined!).....and by all means, let the Mole know when you are going to come out to a show.....'cause even though he does live underground, he's always willing to come up for air......Breath, Breath, Breath!!!!!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Peace, Love, and the upcoming NFL 2004 Regular Season!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy the noise....

&lt;br /&gt;www.roxie77.com
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Peace, Love, and Armageddon..... the new CD!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is our world, our time, and our place....we can pay tribute to the
&lt;br /&gt;past, and speculate about the future, but the only thing for sure is RIGHT
&lt;br /&gt;NOW....so make the most of it. Yesterday is history, tomorrow is uncertain,
&lt;br /&gt;today you shine.....If you're going to heaven, congratulations...if you're
&lt;br /&gt;going straight to hell, you might as well enjoy the ride....R77

&lt;br /&gt;Welcome Damon Johnson to this leg of the Alice Cooper Big Rock Show.....!!!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5467712-109581963192329101?l=roxie77.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Mole Returns: The 2nd leg of The Eyes of Alice Cooper 2004</title><link>http://roxie77.blogspot.com/2004_07_01_archive.html#109035338437985430</link><author>roxie@roxie77.com (Ryan Roxie)</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2004 12:56:24 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5467712.post-109035338437985430</guid><description>Greetings to the good people in the world of AC and R77-
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I am the Mole! and like the Beatle's song goes, we're "Back in the US, Back in the US, Back in the USofA....!" 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But before we close the book out on the European Leg #1 of this years tour, I just want to give a deep and heartfelt thanks to all the European audiences that came out and supported the Cooper band at all the shows and festivals. You guys made this years tour one of the most memorable and enjoyable runs of Europe in years. YOU were the ones that stood out in the rain and lightning storms braving the elements just to get into a venue that was 101 degrees and felt like you were watching the band play the Sun. YOU were the ones that made the signs, bought the T-shirts, only to have it destroyed by festival mud or Calico blood!  And YOU were the ones that stuck around after the shows to wish us luck and support in our own projects such as Roxie 77, Sextus, and the Druts. For all these reasons, the Mole loves Europe, and for even more reasons, the Mole might be an honorary  European in the coming years.....one never knows, does one?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So that leads us to Round 2 of the Alice Cooper heavy weight tour 2004, and today the Mole finds himself looking outside a hotel window overlooking the Detroit/Windsor...US/Canadian borders....You gotta love Canada....with the $$ exchange, one feels just a "little" bit richer...(30% richer to be exact!).....
&lt;br /&gt;So far we have had some really cool "family reunion" style crowds.... and it seems that some of you out there would choose a handful of Alice Cooper road shows rather then packin' up the kids and going to visit the Carlsbad Caverns! (where are those Caverns, anyway?? Anyone wanna take a guess?) We thank you for making the Alice Cooper Big Rock Show your summer getaway......even if it wasn't your first choice!..... 
&lt;br /&gt;So yes, we have been enjoying seeing a few familiar faces on any given string of shows....it means alot that you travel with us, just save up enough for the eventual cab ride home......
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Other big news that might just slip through the cracks if you didn't have the Mole here to mop up the decks of gossip......We now have an official Alice Cooper Softball team comprising of The big guy himself, AC band mates, crew, and even upper-middle management......talk about a team effort! The only thing we don't officially have is a name...any suggestions?.....feel free to email the Mole at the address below.... We are ready and set to play any Radio station, convalescent home, or Hooters restaurant that feels they got a shot at playing the big guns of AC....
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And in Huge Roxie77 news.....the Official Release of the debut  Cd: Peace,Love &amp; Armageddon is set for it's Internet release in August. There will be special "on tour" incentives and limited-time offers that will become available through out the Summer and Fall AC tour. There will even be a special limited run Roxie77 "wonka-shirt"  available to those that come out to the big rock shows.....just drop in on the site from time to find out what the skinny is.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So where does that leave you?? What do ya mean we're not playing your home-town?? What do ya mean ya can't convince your sister-in-law to loan you bus fare out to The Soboba Casino in San Jacinto...(yes folks, this is an actually show!)....?? and What do ya mean you're still waiting outside the Mall of Americas in search of that ever-elusive autograph to don your torn/faded copy of Billion Dollar Babies??......   With the Mole here, you're never too far away from where the real AC action.....and let me tell you, with some of these Poker pots that we have had going in the back of the bus, there is real 25 cent action going down!....If you wanna read up on the past Mole posts feel free to go here:    Roxie77 Blog Spot         http://roxie77.blogspot.com/
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And if you ARE coming to any of the future 1001 Alice shows that will be played in the next months, please let the Mole know that you are out there......not a single "Mole" sign have I read...even though my eyes are not that well (being a Mole and all!)....think of yourself belonging to a secret society of sorts....one that is not so dissimilar to that of The Skull &amp; Bones......we shall be known as The Eye's &amp; Moles....and we shall wait in eager anticipation until Alexandra Robbins writes about us as well!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This is the Mole going back underground......see you in the trenches of Rock n' Roll!!!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Peace, Love, &amp; Secret Societies-

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; I am the Mole! And how can one describe this year's Alice Cooper tour with just one word? Well...ya can't, and that's why I'll be typing in my garrulous reports here and there throughout this years Cooper tour to reflect, enlighten, and inform you, my adoring (and sometimes not-so adoring) molars, (or molletes, or moley moley moley molies as Austin Powers would put it! Obviously, Gold Member is one of the bus films on this leg.....do ya think?!)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Today finds us in a beautiful little part of the vortex we like to call Germany. Land of the Snitzel-fests and The Scorpions...or shall we say, "thaaaaa Scooooopppiiiiiaaaaaahhnnssss!!"  Infact, just last night Claus Meine was spotted by the Mole sneaking a peek at the Cooper show from a stage left wing even though there is a "no-humans on stage" policy that is strictly enforced when the show starts. But you gotta admit, Germans are a crafty people....
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; But that was sooooo today.....let's talk about YESterday, or better yet, a few Yesterdays from before.....some of the highlights so far:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Dublin, Ireland: The band was invited to Dublin's #2 (not my first choice) tourist attraction....the Guinness Beer Brewery &amp; Factory. (The #1 attraction being The Edge's nit-cap manufacturing outlet ofcourse..) As a result, the band is now loving the light and refreshing taste of Guinness and have all gained 80 pounds each....
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Also, Dublin saw the band dress in pin-stripe suits (in a tribute to the AC Greatest Hits Album cover) for the second half of the show for the first (and sadly, probably the only) time!  The over all verdict was that it looked a little too Vegas.....but if someone tells me that, I'm thinkin' Yeah!!!! Vegas baby....me and Celene Dion and a couple of White Tigers!....but those are just my vices....or are they yours too?!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; And oh yeah....did we mention that JET is our favorite new band.......and our new BEST friends for life!!!!......we'll maybe not that crazy grade school, but we do consider the band a bunch of great mates and wish them all the success they deserve....
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Bologna, Italy: The first of many Rock festivals which we are booked on that could easily be renamed the "Iron-Maiden/Metallica faded T-shirt trading expo"  or the "Who's-who in this years (and last years, and the year before) crop of Death Metal bands"  Even "No More Mr. Nice Guy" went over surprisingly well with this sect.....gotta be the eye make-up I suppose....God bless the Godfather of Shock Rock.....such respect, such respect!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Greece:  We'll, I've been saying for years, "the Greeks love Alice Cooper" and even though I had no scientific proof or data to back this claim up, I was proven correct when the band rocked two shows in Northern Greece and Athens......for those of you keeping score at home, these will be the shows that Bed of Nails reared it's _______ (you fill in the blank accordingly) head. The Greeks not only love Alice Cooper, they apparently love Alice Cooper singing Desmond Child songs!...The crowds we're about as rambunctious and wild as those of S. America complete with their own brand of pyro (two huge safety flares lit off during Poison in the Athens crowd...unbelievable!)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Holland:  We are back to the Big, Big, BIG Rock Show  with a festival of a million and one headliners.....although The Coop and Judas Priest were the two to share the title that night......and here's one: When Judas Priest were on stage, AC's very own Chuck Garric was watching the show from the monitor board when a sudden urge to grab just one more budweiser from catering overtook him.....in his haste, he tripped over a power cord and unplugged Rob Halfords TelePrompter! Luckily Rob knew the words to "breaking the Law" so certain tragedy was averted for the time being....but watch out Priest, "trippy-feet" Garric is out there, and he'll be looking for you next rock festival!...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Other headliners in Holland included: Moterhead, the Scorpions, Y&amp;T, blue oyster cult, Paul Rogers, UFO and many many more.....a real treat for a guy like me that basically grew up in a faded black concert T-shirt!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; All of this which brings us back to my tiny hotel room in Germany listening to piped in Euro-trash pop music huffing and puffing it's way out of my TV set......if I hear that Corr's song just one more time!! Arrrgh!! I'm starting to love it! Daaaaaamn Yooooooou Coooooooorrrr'sss!!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; That's about it for now....but don't worry, there will be more stay up to date with all the latest and greatest AC and Roxie77 news and information at

Rumors, Speculation, and Flat Out Lies....anything but the Truth!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Greetings to Roxie 77 &amp; AC faithful worldwide, I am the Mole~!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;"It's been long time.....since the 'Novocain' wore off"......it's time for another shot!  See?, just combined both worlds (and songs) and pretty much brought ya'll up to speed with the state of our unions....
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;It's spring/summer (it's always something/summer here in L.A.) in the year 2004 and the road is calling our name yet again.....or is it that damn telemarketer I just hung up on again? Hmmmm.... 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Yes, your true American idol/my boss, AC, has decided to dust off the snake (no sexual puns intended, the snake really does get filthy), call the oversized balloon company (again, no innuendoes), slap on the Leathers (well I guess I've dug myself a hole) and take the "Eye's of Alice Cooper" tour out on the road for a rock n' roll road trip that will take us to places we've never played, and places that are about as familiar to us as our mama's womb.....God, that was creepy!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Sooooooo......Who's in? Check the dates at www.alicecooper.com
&lt;br /&gt;and let me know which show your coming to and what songs you want to hear, because this tour we decided to cater each show to YOUR every whim.....What? Who do you think we are?? (Special Forces in an armored car?) That last sentence would definitely fall into the Flat Out Lies section of this email title. But seriously, as we all know, the final set list is ultimately decided by the man with the funny eye make-up....still, the mole would love to hear what your "fantasy rock-show" favorites would be...who knows, maybe we WILL play the entire side 2 of DaDa.....yeah right!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;It's hard to believe that I am now the senior-veteren of all the "Guys of Alice Cooper" on this current tour. What started out as a 1-time "greatest hits" tour back in '96 has given me a lifetime of memories and I figure that it's all of you that have allowed me to remain employed for much longer then even my overoptimistic mind figured....to quote Celione Dion-"I just wanted to thank you, really thank you, for letting me play for you...merci...merci!" Oh my god, I just quoted Celion Dion!!!! I must be losing my f@#%ing mind!  So before I start plagiarizing Michael Bolton let me tell you who is in this years line up:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Alice Cooper- as Alice Cooper
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Chuck Garric- aka Chuck #2 according to some....actually, just one.  Check out Chucks world at www.chuckgarric.com
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Eric Dover-The X factor, and one of my favorite guitarists I've ever played with. If you aren't getting enough Sextus, you should at www.sextus.com
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Ryan Roxie- enough about me, let's talk about me!.....me, me, me, me,.....allright, allright, calm down....It's not Iike I've tried to brainwash you or anything, but just in case it hasn't worked.....come to me....come to me at www.roxie77.com
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;And Ladies &amp; Gentleman.....or should I just say Ladies.......the "new guy" on the drums:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Tommy Clufetos....or Tommy C (the "C" stands for Kick Ass)! He's young, strong, and good-looking and above all....he has the Eye of the Tiger......better that then the Ass of a Baboon.....for more info on Tommys Eyes and Ass check him out at  www.tommyclufetos.com
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So that should keep ya busy for about 15 minutes....thus giving us ours.... Man, the mole is on fire today!!!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;How does this Cooper Tour affect your insatiable need for the R77 you might ask yourself? Then  again, you might NOT ask yourself that and so I'll ask it for you! Well.......there are some really cool, and really big (well semi-big....maybe med. large.....definitely bigger then mini) things going on over at camp Roxie 77 and I figure if you can't come to the Rock.....the Rock will come to you! (not the actor....did I say actor? I meant wrestler....he's both now??! How did that happen?)
&lt;br /&gt;What I mean to say is, the OFFICIAL release of R77's Peace, Love &amp; Armageddon will be available for you by the time I get to shake your hand backstage or in some seedy parking lot. Stay on top of the the Roxie 77 website for upcoming info explaining how to purchase, win, or steal your copy of the Official CD....and once again, for those of you that bought the Limited Edition version, we salute you.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Are ya ready for another Cooper Tour? I know we are....Chuck Garric and myself have once again teamed up with IMG (Internet Musicians Group) to offer the Guitar/Bass Lessons program that we did the last tour. It was a huge success, so if you are interested click on IMG's official link for more info: http://www.designbydroid.com/img/img.html
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So that's about it for now.....and oh yeah, did I mention.....a new Alice Album in the works!!??!! It's looking like a return to the sleazy, swanky &amp; slimy Alice Cooper even more so then even "The Eyes" was. More of a "road record" then any I've ever made with him, you guys are gonna have a direct effect on the riffs, subject matter and energy of the new tunes....so when we come to your local amphitheater or hof brau make sure we hear ya!!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Until we meet again...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Peace, Love &amp; The Eyes of Alice Cooper 2004!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The Mole 
&lt;br /&gt;aka Roxie

April 7th</title><link>http://roxie77.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_archive.html#108123455391563989</link><author>roxie@roxie77.com (Ryan Roxie)</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2004 23:58:36 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5467712.post-108123455391563989</guid><description>Every once in a while there comes a Wednesday night that means more then just the Chapelle/Jon Stewart Daily show marathon,and this coming Wed. April 7th 2004 could be just the type of night we are talkin' about!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The good people over that the House of Blues &lt;http://www.hob.com/tickets/eventdetail.asp?eventid=24854&gt;  have invited Roxie 77 to play with some of our No. Cal heroes, Y &amp; T. The night will be filled with Black Tigers, Lipstick &amp; Leather, and plenty of Alcohol....and those are just some of THEIR tunes....
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;A lot has happened since the last time Roxie 77 got kicked out of the 'ol HOB.....ya see, we finished our debut CD entitled PEACE, LOVE &amp; ARMAGEDDON and will be playing all the R77 hits and teenage folk anthems come Wed. night..(what did that megalomaniac ass just type?!?)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;We know it's pretty short notice, but let's be honest, JET is already sold out and you can be rest assured you will not be hearing Brown Sugar or Suffragette City for the 1001th time at a Roxie 77 show....or will you?!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So that's our pitch....... sign the fax and call up a baby-sitter. Or better yet come out and try to make a baby at the beautiful House of Blues on the Sunset Strip, Wed. April 7th with your friends, Roxie 77. And remember, we love you.....we really love you
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Peace, Love, and Matt Sorum,
&lt;br /&gt;

The Limited Edition Signed &amp; Numbered version of Roxie 77's "Peace, Love &amp; Armageddon" sold beyond our wildest dreams &amp; expectations (which really means, we sold more then 10!). You all have shown us &amp; more notably the record weasels  (and we do mean "weasels" with the most endearing of tones) out there that there is a market for guitar driven music! This could lead to bigger &amp; better things in the near future....
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;We have SOLD-OUT the entire run of CD's we had made up for this special release in what could only be
&lt;br /&gt;called a "record pace" -HA! (all puns intended). This is not to say that you won't be able to pick up the CD either here at Roxie77.com or at your favorite Mom &amp; Pop record store (they still have record stores?) in the very near future.....If you didn't get in on the ground floor fear not. We are setting out to produce &amp; manufacture a full-on CD package to be sold on-line, out of my garage, street corners or out of Droid's '67 Chevy's trunk! Or, you can ask Roxie for a copy when you see him on the road with the Coop or Thursday nights @ The GIG. There will be a special incentive for those of you that have already bought the Limited version details on that are in the works now (we can't tell ya everything all at once now can we?).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So for more information be sure to check your virtual mailboxes for the next instalment of the ROXIE77 newsletter or what we like to call "How to make S'mores- the Gran Marnier way!". If you have friends that you want to pass this along to be our guest. You can also send them this link http://server.com/WebApps/mail-list-subscribe.cgi?list=66989 &amp; they can sign-up to receive their own copy delivered fresh out of the can. You can also send any questions or comments to cdorders@roxie77.com we love to hear from you.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So, that's all for now &amp; as always, we wanna thank you, yes you the person staring into your computer screen...YOU are the one that gives us the reason to keep the dream of the Big Rock Show alive. YOU are the one that give us the affirmations and support that really do make us feel like we are on the right track. And especially ... it's YOU that took the time to read this post when you could have easily pressed delete and gone on to surf the net for Internet porn all the while masturbating furiously....for that...we Thank YOU!!!!!

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;What's gonna happen? Who's gonna shine? Who's gonna be wrapped up in saga (not the band Saga, although tonight we ARE on the loose!)  It's late...it's always late when I write these cathartic, therapeutic and ultimately enjoyable prose ... and before I start coming off a little too pretentious, let me start telling you how things REALLY are ...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I'm in my underwear actually, two Corona's in, listening to my iPod (yep, I lost the battle with technology, it kicked my ass, and now I'm gonna try and do everything to NOT be the parent that can't program the VCR!) I've got a mix tape playing that I made a few years ago, and I still love every song on it!....that's quite a feat, but I made sure that I put only the songs that really made me slide from side to side and want to dance (even though, being a white guy from the suburbs, I can't and ultimately realize I'll never really be able to dance)  Bands like: Happy Mondays, Fun Lovin' Criminals, Air, Charlatans U.K......no matter how white, black, brown or purple you are, you'll be swayin' like Beyonce' and Riki Martin rolling on E in no time!...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So what's the deal? Well, I want the world to dance ... and by dance I don't mean some corny Paula Abdul choreographed music video...I'm talking about moving that body (skinny, fat, perfect, fucked ... don't matter!) by feeling the music that makes you feel stoned without being stoned....makes ya happy just cause it comes on your stereo during shuffle mode ... makes ya horny, 'cause that's what certain songs do ... and get this ... it doesn't even have to be something that I've played on! I want people to be able to smile, think, and get lost in the bands' and their own reality ALL at the same time if that's even possible.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;But how does all this nonsense get you free dinner? Simple ... get the &lt;strong&gt;Roxie 77 CD&lt;/strong&gt; into the hands of &lt;strong&gt;Nick Hornby&lt;/strong&gt;, and I buy YOU a well-balanced meal that will represent the 4-basic food groups. (Unless, you're Vegan, then I'll buy ya a block of Tofu...) Who the hell is &lt;strong&gt;Nick Hornby&lt;/strong&gt; your asking yourself? For those of you that might not know, &lt;strong&gt;Nick Hornby&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the best Authors of our times. He writes the type of stuff that do the equivalent of what I was talking about earlier in the email about smiling, thinkin', and getting lost in someone else's reality...but he does it with words instead of music. It just so happens that his new book, Songbook, makes &lt;strong&gt;Mr. Hornby&lt;/strong&gt; not only my favorite writer, but now my favorite music critic (no, a musician having a favorite music critic is NOT an oxymoron!)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So what if Nick Hornby simply hates &lt;strong&gt;Roxie 77&lt;/strong&gt;? Won't all my dreams be crushed? And worse even, no free dinner? NOPE, the good news is that either way, whether he trashes or treasures &lt;strong&gt;Roxie 77&lt;/strong&gt;, you, the good person that got the music into his head gets the grub! So go on and accept the challenge and hopefully I'll be getting an e-mail from Mr. Hornby informing me that, "the good people over at &lt;strong&gt;Roxie 77&lt;/strong&gt; have been incessant in their quest to have me take a listen to the music. Oh, and yes, I'll be using it in my new movie, but please, please just stop harassing me"... Can't you almost taste the chicken tikka marsala now???
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;good luck,
&lt;br /&gt;this blog entry will self-destruct in 5 seconds....

&lt;br /&gt;	
&lt;br /&gt;It's that time of year to sit back, spend time with our families &amp; reflect on the events of the past year. Or....it's that time to sit back, shun the world as we know it, and eat as much sugar and red meat (good timing by the way...thanks mad cow!) as humanly possible... Or it's just time to work your little butt off to try and mail as many &lt;strong&gt;Roxie77&lt;/strong&gt; CD's out before the close of 2003 and stress, stress, stress!! Not to say that either of the previous to things have ANY thing to do with me, but..... it's gonna be a kick ass 2004! (and I would like to bring back the expression &lt;strong&gt;"kick-ass"&lt;/strong&gt; in "04...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;I just want to thank all of you that have been so supportive on the site and at the shows, and through the cards and letters and everything! I will do what ever it takes to get this thing to the next level, and I just want to let you know how much I appreciate you guys being the very first ones to give the thumbs up and be in on the ground floor of something that is just starting to build itself up! A very heart-felt thanks from our family to yours...
&lt;br /&gt;	
&lt;br /&gt;So from all of us here to all of you, I think the verses below say it better then I ever could. And by some weird coincidence a guy named &lt;strong&gt;Lennon&lt;/strong&gt; wrote it! Ha....enjoy, and enjoy the coming year!

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The response to the &lt;strong&gt;"Limited Edition Signed &amp; Numbered Roxie77 CD: Peace, Love &amp; Armageddon"&lt;/strong&gt; has been overwhelming! So much so that all we have been doing here is answering e-mail after e-mail asking to be one of the few. So we have decided to extend the final number to accommodate all these requests. The total number will now be &lt;strong&gt;177&lt;/strong&gt;, so ya see it's still a very small number of you that will be part of Roxie history.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Just to clarify the ones who did get in before the original number &lt;strong&gt;(77)&lt;/strong&gt; was reached will have the lower numbers (it's only fair you did act fast!).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So if you have been on the fence, thought they were all gone, can't find (or afford) that Burnt Orange 'Vette that your brother wants or have a friend that would like a copy now's the time.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Thx for all the support &amp; we hope you enjoy the music that Roxie holds so near &amp; dear to his heart.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like the beginning of a James Bond flick you thought you might have missed on TNT's 007 week.....But not to worry, it's just how I spent that last couple of weeks with the family after "The Eyes" have temporarily shut, but rumored to be opening yet again for a tour beginning next year....But that is yet another adventure. For now, here is my report on our own little communist friends that ALSO reside in North America!
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;I've got to admit that my knowledge of Cuba and the Cuban people had been limited to repeated viewings of The Godfather Pt. 2, Scarface, and I Love Lucy reruns...But after spending time there, I come away with a new found respect for the people and the island (yes, I admit, I wasn't even sure it was an island 10 days ago!)..... I'm not sure if I'm ready to suit up in Army Green fatigues and sit along side the legends of Fidel and Che, but I am growing a beard and brought back some Cuban Cigars and plan on giving them a try with the guys while we plan the a new revolution of the Cat Club......we'll see what happens after the cigars.....
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;The Cubans dance amazingly, yet are not allowed in the same clubs as the tourists....sort of like Footloose (and you thought Patrick Swazey and Cuba had nothing in common!) The Cuban people are surprisingly optimistic even though they have basically been "sent up to their room without dinner by their parents" for over 40 years....You really DO feel like you've stepped into a bit of a time warp....Cubans drive no car that was built before 1959, but that's okay, because they have all the coolest 50's American Classics! Ironic? Yes!....Plus, the fashion, colors, weather and basic good nature of the people make you feel like you are on the set of a Michael Jackson music video (not a Michael Jackson private video....bummer.....)
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;Soooooo....that's a little of how I've been staying busy during the break in The Eyes of Alice Cooper tour...but not to say that's it's just been global traveling, eating, and experimenting with facial hair......no...... that is just been about all there is to say.....Dammit! Say something!.....
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, we've been busy bustin' our asses to get the Roxie77 CD completed and ready by the beginning of early 2004. The dream of watching the Hilton/Olsen sister 4-way and having Roxie77 out by Dec.25th  is just a little bit more then I think any of us could handle, so trust me.....we'll get the Roxie77 out to you ASAP and you'll have to keep combing the Internet for the Hilton/Olsen Photoshop miracle.
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;Also, in other AC news, major congrats going out to the Godfather of Glam for getting his well deserved Hollywood Star in December....you know that's a photo op I can't miss......And by the way, I really hope to see some of  you out there at the Christmas Pudding that Cheryl Cooper and Alice put on with the Solid rock foundation in Arizona this coming Dec. 19th I believe it is......
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;And what about you local yokels, or anyone one visiting lovely La-La Land sometime in the next month....feeling lonely? Well, come and get just a bit more lonelier at the Cat Club on any given Thursday where the Usual Suspects are playing the Usual Set List but having an Unusually good time (Usually at your expense!)......
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;So I've filled up my quota of using the word "Usual"....and basically tapped my late night brain out and must now go watch a Jenna Jameson "self-help" video to take a step back and reflect on what the hell I just wrote!...
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, have the best Holiday Season and thanks for all the emails and kind words and over all support in a time when even though my football team sucks and it would take more then a Beautiful Mind to figure out how to mathematically get into the playoffs, I'm happy as hell to watch the game with Lennon, win or lose, 'cause life's good....and sometimes it takes going to another place to experience their world and what they have and don't have to really appreciate everything you've got right here at home!....
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;Peace, Love, and The Olsen Twins,
&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;Roxie...
