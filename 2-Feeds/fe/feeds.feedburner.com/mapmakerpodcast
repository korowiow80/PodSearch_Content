&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Initially I was worrying, &amp;#39;are they trying to tell me I’m not
hacking it here and giving me easier work to do?&amp;#39; But as it turned out, it wasn’t that my work was
changing at all. What was happening was that my &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;experience &lt;/strong&gt;of work was
changing.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chris Edgar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &amp;quot;Calibri&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sans-serif&amp;quot;;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As author of the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0615304966/curtrosengren-20" target="_blank"&gt;Inner Productivity&lt;/a&gt; Chris Edgar, sees it, the trouble with most productivity systems is that
they don&amp;#39;t take into account that actual humans - with all of their
fears, distractions, and emotional reactions - are the ones that have
to implement them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his former career as an attorney, Chris Edgar found the stress and anxiety of his work piling up and spilling over into the rest of his life. Initially he was just looking for ways to help him de-stress and stop waking up in the middle of the night stressing about some spelling error on page 23 of the document he had just handed in that day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, though, he realized that the techniques that he was exploring, like mindfulness and visualization, were having a significant impact on the quality of his work day. The more he worked with them, the more he realized that there was a very real benefit there that anyone could tap into.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edgar left his law practice to focus full time on using what he learned in his own journey to help other people find the focus and sense of ease it takes to make the most of their efforts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His book, Inner Productivity, is packed with the insights he has gained both through his own experience and in his work with clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this podcast, Edgars outlines some of the ideas and techniques from the book. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen to this podcast and learn:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How techniques like meditation and mindfulness changed his work experience completely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why any productivity system is only as good as the focus of the person implementing it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why a &amp;quot;fight or flee&amp;quot; reaction to procrastination only makes matters worse, and what to do about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How accepting your inner experience is the cornerstone for productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The three core elements of Inner Productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to start listening to what your body has to tell you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As Chris Edgar sees
it, there’s one significant flaw in the majority of productivity approaches out
there. They have to be implemented by humans. So rather than a perfectly tuned
machine cranking out maximum results, we get sidetracked by procrastination, or
any shiny bauble that ISN’T what we’re supposed to be focusing on. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edgar’s book, Inner
Productivity, addresses that oversight. He answers the question, “How do you
find that internal focus that helps you make the most of your efforts.” &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It all started with the
stress and anxiety he experienced in his former career as an attorney. When
that stress spilled over into the rest of his life, Edgar started exploring
ways to counter it. Little did he know that he was planting the seeds for a new
career. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;For several years I worked as a litigator with a large law
firm. And you probably won’t be surprised to hear that I had some stressful
situations, and some anxiety-provoking situations while I was there. And I had
a pretty high tolerance for stress in the workplace, but the problem I was
having was that I was starting to take that stress home with me. So if I was
sitting on the couch hoping to relax with a magazine or something like that, I
would have this nagging voice in the back of my mind, worrying about if there
had been a typo on page 23 of some document I had handed in that day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And so I started looking for ways I could relax in my rare
off hours, and what I ended up turning to were what’s often called mindfulness
practices, or spiritual practices. Things like meditation, yoga, qi gong or tai
chi. And I started a pretty regular routine of meditation and yoga, and what I
started to notice was not only was this building up a sense of centeredness
when I was trying to relax at home, its effects were starting to seep over into
my work. I was taking that sense of calm and that centeredness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And it seemed very strange at first. I wondered whether the
higher ups were trying to tell me something. Everyone seemed so calm all of a
sudden, and things were getting done more easily, and I seemed to be getting
out of the office earlier. So initially I was worrying, are they trying to tell
me I’m not hacking it here and giving me easier work to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;But as it turned out, it wasn’t that my work was changing at
all. What was happening was that my experience of work was changing. And so
over time what I started to discover – initially when I took up these practices
I believed they were things I could only do on my own time. I figured I can’t
exactly get down on the floor with my yoga mat and run through a couple asanas
whenever I feel stressed in the office. That’s probably not something that’s
going to fly with my superiors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;But as it turns out what I started to see was that there are
forms of breathing and movement and visualization that I could do in real time
as I was sitting there at my desk. I didn’t need to get up and go to a class or
watch some video or burn some incense or anything like that. I could just sit
there and all I needed to do these exercises was my own mind and body. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And so after a few more years I started to realize that I
was more interested in these techniques, in adapting spiritual practices like
meditation and yoga into my work than I was in the work itself that I was
doing. So I was becoming more interested in this than in drafting legal briefs
and reviewing documents and doing the other kinds of things that were the
mainstays of my job as a lawyerk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And so what I eventually decided one fateful morning was
that I was going to go out and I was going to teach these techniques to people,
these ways I had found to adapt these mindfulness practices into my work. And I
realized there was a large audience of professionals like doctors and lawyers
and accountants and so on, who really hadn’t had much exposure to these kinds
of practices, even people who were out here in the Bay area. Or maybe they come
to them with some degree of prejudice. You know, this is only for woo-woo new
agey types. I don’t need this. I’m an upstanding professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So what I realized was that a lot of these people could
benefit from a reduction of stress and the focus and the peace that these
practices can bring you. Having done what I’d done, I had access to an audience
I could really help by teaching these things. And so that’s what I’ve been
doing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As he used those
ideas first to transform his own work and then help his clients find that focus
and productivity, Edgar started to formulate an approach that anyone could use.
He outlines that approach in his book, Inner Productivity. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The book is called Inner Productivity, and the book is about
bringing practices like mindfulness meditation and yoga and qi gong and so
forth into your work in a way that helps you achieve a state of focus and peace
as you work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;When we think of productivity my sense is that we usually
think of techniques for rearranging our working environment. We think of
color-coding our folders reorganizing our e-mail inbox, or holding shorter
meetings and so on. There’s a lot of great techniques out there for doing that.
And what I’ve noticed is that there really isn’t a lot out there that deals
with what’s probably the biggest obstacle that we face in getting our work done
which is ourselves. Our own minds and bodies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;If our minds are wandering off into the past, fretting over
the break-up of some relationship that happened ten years ago, or they’re
projecting into the future worrying about how big the bonus is going to be this
year, I hope I get a promotion and so on, then no many how many of these cool
techniques we’re using for our work environment, we’re still going to be
distracted. We’re still going to be unmotivated. So that’s really where this
book comes in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;You can have the best productivity
system in the world, but if your procrastination kicks in, the system is
rendered ineffective. Edgar shared his perspective on procrastination, why it
happens, and what to do about it. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In my experience what happens is we’re sitting there chugging
along in our work and we’re feeling productive and getting things done, and we
start to have some kind of experience. We start to have some kinds of thoughts
and feelings that feel uncomfortable or scary to us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So maybe we’ll be sitting there chugging along – and this
will be a very familiar example to a lot of people, I think – we’ll start
having this burning curiosity about what’s in our e-mail inbox, for instance.
And if we leave that long enough it actually starts to intensify into a tension
in our bodies. If you look at it closely it’s actually your muscles tightening
up, maybe your shoulders or your chest or something like that tensing up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And because we don’t want to experience that tension, what
we do is we either fight or we flee. We have what I call a fight or flight
reaction. So we try to fight against this sensation by beating ourselves up
basically by saying, oh come on, I can’t believe you’re being so lazy and
wondering about your e-mail again and why can’t you get this thing done and so
on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And I think as a lot of us have experienced, fighting in
that way and beating ourselves up can actually be physically draining. So it
can actually tire us out and make it more difficult to get done what we want to
do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Or we flee, so maybe we give in to our urge to check e-mails
and try to get rid of that sensation that way. Or we’ll run off and do
something else so that we can distract our minds from that sensation. We’ll go
off and instant message with friends, or call someone on the phone, or play
mine sweeper, or do any of the thousands of things that we can do without
leaving the comforts of our desks to distract ourselves these days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So what I’m proposing, rather than fighting or fleeing, is a
different way of relating to these inner experiences, to these thoughts and
feelings. And that’s to just accept them, is the term that I use. So just sit
there and breathe and relax your body and allow whatever thought or sensation
is coming up to pass away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;If it’s a burning curiosity about your e-mail, for instance,
just sit there and breathe and relax whatever area is feeling tension, maybe
your shoulders or your chest or wherever it happens to be, and breathe and
relax your body, and allow whatever thought or sensation is coming up to pass
away. If it’s a burning curiosity about your e-mail, for example, just sit
there and relax whatever area is feeling tension and allow that sensation to
flow through you. And as you keep doing this over time, and as you keep
noticing and understanding that allowing that sensation to be isn’t going to
hurt you in any way, that it’s actually just going to pass away like any other
thought or feeling that we have, the more you understand that, the more you
become comfortable and familiar with those kinds of sensations. And after you
do this for a while and that experience of burning curiosity about your e-mail
or whatever it is comes up again, you become able to say, OK, thanks for
sharing and I’m going to continue typing this board presentation or writing
this e-mail or sculpting this sculpture, or whatever it is that you do with the
bulk of your time at work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edgar acknowledges
that, as effective as this approach can be, it doesn’t always come naturally. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I think when we first approach these kinds of techniques, we
have some kind of fear or discomfort about the idea of just letting that urge
to check your e-mail to be, or just allowing that sense of emptiness, that
creative emptiness that we call writer’s block, allowing that to be as it is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We tend to come in worrying that if I allow those things to
be there without doing anything about it, I’m going to get hurt in some way, or
they’re going to stay there forever. And then when we actually become trusting
enough to let those be, we start to discover that they’re really not such a
serious problem at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In his book, Edgar
outlines three main elements to Inner Productivity. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I break down Inner Productivity into three elements.
Attention, intention, and foundation. Attention is pretty self-explanatory.
It’s just the ability to hold your attention on a task that you’re doing for a
long period of time without having to make a lot of painful effort. So without
having to constantly drag your attention back from the past or back from the
future or having to constantly take breaks because working is to painful, or
something along those lines. And so cultivating the ability just to hold your
attention is one of the things that the exercises in this book help you to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The second element is called intention. And intention is
basically a 30,000 foot perspective on why you’re doing what you’re doing.
That’s what I mean by creating a powerful intention. So a lot of us in our work
get bogged down and unmotivated because the things that we’re doing seem kind
of minor and meaningless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Like I’m sitting there typing this e-mail, or maybe I’m
rearranging my file folders or something like that. And if I’m not aware, if
I’m not present to the larger context for why I’m doing that, then I can start
to feel really bored and start to think, why am I doing this? I can’t believe
I’m hurting myself like this. But what the questions in the intention section
have us do is to take those questions seriously. OK, why am I doing this?
What’s the overall contribution that I’m making to my business and to the world
with what I’m doing right now? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And when we do that, that reconnects us with that sense of
passion that got us into what we’re doing in the first place. And suddenly it
starts to make sense. Ohhh, OK, that’s why I’m doing that. I’m not just hurting
myself here. I’m not just being a masochist. So that’s the idea behind
intention. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Foundation is a sense of unconditional love or appreciation
for yourself. And when I talk about this sometimes I get some raised eyebrows
and cynical looks like, well, loving yourself is great but it doesn’t pay the
bills, right? Now, what I think is that in our society we tend to base our
sense of self-worth on external achievements, the money that we get or the
prestige or the career or our academic degrees or what the boss said about us
and so on. And the trouble is that when we do that, even if we’re getting what
we want, even if we’re getting money and prestige right now, there’s always
going to be some anxiety about the possibility that we might lose those things
in the future. So that’s what basing our self-worth on external rewards
creates. It creates anxiety. And that anxiety leads to all these neurotic
behaviors that I was doing that led me to come to these spiritual practices in
the first place. Things like waking up at three in the morning in a cold sweat,
thinking oh no, what does the boss think of this e-mail that I sent today. I
hope he was OK with it, and so on. And of course that’s not productive at all.
All that does is get us more frazzled. So developing a sense of appreciation
for ourselves, and really a sense of solidity. Really a sense of groundedness
is what the foundation element is about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While the ideas he
outlines in Inner Productivity are now an integral part of both his career and
his overall life, Edgar admits that wasn’t always the case. In fact, he had
what he would describe as a prejudice against them. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Before I went to law school I had no exposure to spiritual
practices, or I had the kind of prejudices against them that I was talking
about before, like oh, it’s all that airy-fairy stuff. I didn’t really have a
concept of the fact that you could unconditionally respect yourself, or see
yourself as a worthy person. I bought into what I think a lot of us in our
culture buy into, which is of course my worth is based on how much money I
make, or how prestigious my degree is and so on. A lot of us, it’s just
operating unconsciously. We don’t really even have choice around it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So my initial reaction to some of these books and some of
these teachers that talk about self-love was, oh come on. And then when I
actually got into practices like meditation and yoga and I was able to
experience that sense of groundedness that I’m talking about, in my body, I
realized, whoa, these people are coming from a place that I never even knew
existed. And that’s what really sparked my interest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In a way, I’m very thankful for my work in the legal profession,
because without it I don’t think I would have been guided into doing the kind
of work that I’m doing now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edgar is quick to
distinguish between the ideas at the heart of his work and a more formal
approach to spirituality or religion. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;When I use the word spirituality, something that I’ve done
in interviews before and speaking engagements that I’ve done, some people
immediately get turned off. Some people think religion. They think
fundamentalist groups that want to force their beliefs down my throat, or
something like that. And so what I want to make clear at the outset is that I’m
talking about a bunch of very practical techniques. And you can use them and
you can immediately see for yourself whether they produce results for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So I’m not asking you to accept any beliefs. I’m not asking
you to believe in any vision of the cosmos. All I’m doing is asking you to try
these techniques out. And I think that that makes it an easier pill to swallow
with a lot of the things that I talk about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the huge
challenges most of us face is the tendency for our mind to go wandering off in
all directions but where we are, right here and right now. Edgar offered a
simple technique to help bring our attention back to the present moment. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;/span&gt;Our body is usually
something we forget about if we’re working. What I suggest is if we to some
extent keep our attention focused on the body, the sensation that we’re feeling
there, that it actually helps us keep our minds focused on the present. There
are a lot of spiritual teachers out there who talk about the fact that the
sensations coming up in our bodies are always happening right now. So when you
focus on what’s happening in your hands, or your feet, some part of you, then
your attention naturally shifts. Before your mind was wandering off into the
past, into the future. Oh my goodness, is the mechanic going to finish fixing
the car tomorrow, or I hope this person’s opinion of me is good and so on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;A simple exercise for doing this is to just pick some part
of your body. The easiest one for me is my feet on the ground, the sensation of
pressure of your feet against the ground. And notice any other sensations in
your feet right now. Any sort of tingling, or pulse, or warmth, or coldness,
whatever’s there. And notice as you bring your attention there that your
attention, your awareness naturally shifts back into the now. And that’s the
purpose of these body awareness exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As Edgar sees it,
most of us miss out on a lot of what our bodies have to tell us. I think of it
as body deafness. But if we slow down and pay attention, he says, our bodies
have a lot to say about the choices we make. Take our career choices for
example. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In our culture what we tend to do is we tend to focus solely
on cost benefit analysis when we’re deciding which direction we’re going to go
in our careers. How much money am I going to make, what’s the benefits package,
what’s the location, and so on. And a couple of years, or maybe ten or twenty
years down the line, a lot of people end up regretting the fact that they did
that. They wish that they had listened more closely to their instincts. I think
that when you’re paying attention to the sensations in your body, to how it
feels when you consider different career options, that’s a way of getting in
touch with those instincts, that sixth sense, or intuition that people would
like to go with a little bit more when they’re deciding what to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;An exercise that I talk about for people who are interested
in a career transition is just take a piece of paper and write down a number of
possibilities. Just brainstorm for a little bit. Don’t censor based on what
sounds rational. And scan down them and notice how your body feels as you
consider all of them, rather than coming from an intellectual place. Rather
than thinking about the practicality of it. And if you feel a sense of warmth
and openness, perhaps, in your heart, then that can be some inner guidance that
this is something that you’d enjoy doing. That this is something you can stick
with in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Or you might look at something that seems rational, like
becoming an accountant or something like that – no offense to people who are
accountants – and you might feel a tension, a contraction in your body, like
your body is rejecting that idea, even though it sounds rational. And that’s
valuable wisdom too I think that we often don’t listen to. So that listening is
very important in that context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I asked Edgar what
kinds of stumbling blocks he sees as people try to focus on Inner Productivity.
&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;One of them would be that kind of body deafness that you
were talking about, when you’re deaf to what’s going on in your body. We’re
deaf to a whole potential source of motivation that we might be tapping into.
So that’s one example. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Another example would be this attitude that we tend to have
toward our inner experience. What we tend to do is we try to shut them out as
they come up when we’re working. And what we don’t realize is that we’re
actually using a whole lot of energy by doing that. We’re telling our minds
shut up, stop thinking about the vacation you’re going to take in two weeks,
things like that. Or every time we have a painful memory we run off and check
our e-mail so we don’t have to experience that memory. We’re actually wasting a
lot of time and wasting a lot of energy that we could otherwise use to get our
tasks done. So this whole attitude of fighting and fleeing from our experience
is something that does tend to get in people’s way and ends up producing a lot
of suffering. And the irony is that people think if they can just get away from
these thoughts and feelings, or anesthetize them or something like that, then
they’l be able to get their work done. But that’s actually what’s creating the
procrastination in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edgar described the
central most important idea he wants people to come away with after reading
Inner Productivity. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;That would be the attitude of accepting your inner
experience when it comes up. So if you’re sitting there and a painful memory
starts to come up, or a worry about the future, or maybe just some kind of
tension in your body, like your back getting tight, for instance, see if you
can just allow that to be exactly as it is. So notice the urge to do something
about it. Notice the sense that it’s a problem and allow that urge to pass
away, and relax to the extent that you can. And the more you do this, the more
you start to notice that those thoughts and sensations aren’t that threatening
to you when you start to put them in perspective. And you start to be able to
go forward in what you’re doing even if those sensations are coming up. So I
think that’s really key to keeping a sense of focus and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;If you just do that, if you just adopt an attitude of
acceptance, then I think that will grow your personal productivity really by
leaps and bounds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I asked Edgar what he
loves about his work. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Working with people and taking them to places where they’ve
been unwilling to go before, which is one of the major themes of this book –
accepting the inner experience rather than running from it. And seeing that
look on their face and seeing that presence that they have when they realize
that really this isn’t so bad after all. That fear that they never wanted to
explore, or maybe they thought they should never get angry, or they should
never feel sad, or something along those lines. And when they actually allow
that experience to come up and just allow it to be, their whole perspective
shifts and they have this aliveness about them that’s really exciting to me to
witness. &lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“One person can change the world. And they can change the world by taking their values to work, making it a part of how they make a difference at work – not only for the world, but for the bottom line – and making it something they commit themselves to.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;~ Tim Sanders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Sanders&amp;#39; best-selling &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/060960922X/curtrosengren-20" target="_blank"&gt;Love is the Killer App&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favorite books (if you haven&amp;#39;t read it, you should). So when I discovered that Sanders had a new book out, I was psyched. Add to that the fact that it was about using your work to make the world a better place, and I was bouncing out of my chair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of that new book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385523572/curtrosengren-20" target="_blank"&gt;Saving the World at Work&lt;/a&gt;, is the idea that there is a &amp;quot;Responsibility Revolution&amp;quot; underway, one that is making it ever more profitable for companies to do the right thing. And that in turn is creating more opportunities for each of us to use our work as a platform to make a difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this podcast, Sanders outlines some of the key ideas in the book. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen to this podcast and learn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why Sanders believes that one person really can change the world. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why successful companies are focusing on making a difference like never before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How a new paradigm of interdependence is replacing the old acquisition-driven economy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why the time is right like never before to do work you love and make a positive impact. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How being a &amp;quot;good business&amp;quot; boosts the bottom line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six laws to help you make a difference with your company while helping it make money at the same time. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why Sanders is so positive about the future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In his best-selling book, Love is the Killer App, Tim Sanders focused on the very real benefits of showing up in the world in a way that benefits others. In his newest book, Saving the World at Work, Sanders applies that same concept to the business world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sanders, who was formerly Chief Solutions Officer at Yahoo! and later its Leadership Coach, sees a sea change underway, one where corporate social responsibility and sustainability aren’t just the morally right approach to take, they’re ultimately the profitable approach. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that opens the door for each of us to explore opportunities to make a difference at our jobs that we really care about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked Sanders to tell me about Saving the World at Work. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saving the World at Work is a book about a really big change in the marketplace which creates a new leadership opportunity for everyone. The change in the marketplace is what I call the Responsibility Revolution. &lt;/p&gt;What I mean by that is that responsibility has become something that is aspirational. We want it. We want to achieve it. We think that the world has lost it. We believe that we can’t trust governments and companies by themselves to do it. So responsibility becomes something that’s going to start driving more and more of the market. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of you listening might already experience this in areas like carbon. Carbon emissions. Organic. The issue of products being green. Doing business that help out local communities. All of these are part of a much bigger change in the landscape where the customer is starting to purchase the story that stands behind the product and the service. And that changes everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As Sanders sees it, there is a transition underway from an acquisition-driven economy to an interdependent economy.&amp;#0160; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about it this way. Think about the acquisition-driven economy that we’ve lived in for a long time, anywhere from 30 to 300 years. The acquisition economy was about collecting things. Acquiring things. We used bellweather marketing programs like retirement, for example, to create a finish line for people. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I’ve seen is a change. That independence paradigm of acquiring things and building up wealth has given way to a new way of seeing the world, the way our kids see the world. It’s called the interdependent paradigm. And it changes everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as a result what happens is our aspirations get ratcheted up a notch. It’s not enough to be wealthy or have what you need to retire. That’s so 1932. What people want to do now is they want to make a difference. They want to achieve significance more than they want to achieve wealth, or even fame. And significance is purpose. And what I’ve learned is that in the business world, whether it’s getting the most out of employees or getting the most out of customers, if you connect with another person’s purpose, you ignite passion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanders described how Saving the World at Work was an outgrowth of his previous books, Love is the Killer App and The Likeability Factor, which focused on the individual. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My entire writing career has always been focused on the value of doing the right thing. Trusting other people to repay you. And this ongoing idea that you can trust other people if you care about them enough. And I’ve always thought about it at a personal, individual level, and about four years ago I was having dinner with a guy by the name of Don Weisberg, who was the president of Penguin Publisher. He’d been a friend of mine for several years. And he was talking about the importance of companies behaving this way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, if a company committed itself to growing everything it touched, wouldn’t it really make more money in the long-term, because of goodwill and all those other things. And he thought I would be the guy to write that book. So it transitioned me from nice, smart people to responsible companies will win. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets down to a very core idea and that is you succeed by growing everything you touch. And it’s never been more true for businesses. Companies that pull that off and leaders that help other people do that at companies, over the course of time, will do incredibly well as the world continues to change. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As Sanders sees it, technology is a big part of the driving force behind the Responsibility Revolution. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the points I made in Love is the Killer App, one of the premises of the book, was that transparency is creeping in because of the technology revolution. In other words, today, bad guys get found out in real time. And that changes everything, because transparency protected those guys for centuries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book, Saving the World at Work, reinforces that and says, yeah, technology isn’t just making the bad guys found out right away. A vigilant public is doing their job too through social media. And that changes everything because the tools people have now with social media are better than the tools major publishers had 20 years ago to put books out. So it’s an incredible time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I asked Sanders what he wanted people to take away from Saving the World at Work. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Number one takeaway. One person can change the world. And they can change the world by taking their values to work, making it a part of how they make a difference at work – not only for the world, but for the bottom line – and making it something they commit themselves to. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll give you an example of the power of one person. Joan Krajewski at Microsoft started out in the legal group of one of the divisions, the hardware division. Legal groups, they’ll manage things like risk. Sometimes it’s regulatory risk, legal liability risk, etc. She managed a very small function. Risk management environment. So she took a look at everything that had to do with everything that had to do with Microsoft’s environmental issues, whether it was waste, or carbon emissions, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She created a campaign over 18 months where she gathered together people that cared about risk, and she created a network of people who thought there were things that Microsoft in planning, production, delivery, etc. for their product. Over the course of 18 months she put over 400 people together that all shared a passion for making Microsoft greener than it was, and it led to radical innovations, from reducing the form factor of the Xbox 360 by 30% to changing the entire packaging way of thinking at the company, now where they use everything from biodegradable cornstarch packaging, to thinking about software strictly as service with no packaging. And she’s even recruited people within the operating systems group who are now working on a software solution to help. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sanders sees a new paradigm building, one that shifts from a focus on quote unquote making our mark at work, to a focus on making a difference. And that applies on both the individual and the organizational level. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, a lot of times it’s easy for us that we’re going to quote make our mark at work. We get that. But we don’t ever think about ourselves making a difference at work, and the distinction between the two is just large. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what I think of is the idea that for the first time maybe in history, good business is great business. So when you help your company improve its contribution, whether it’s environmental issues, helping local communities, making it a great place to work. When you do that, you boost the bottom line. And when you do that, you obey the first law that I lay down in the book of people who are going to get this right. Law number one, the law of the ledger. Anything you do at work that will be sustainable over time will contribute to profits over time. Never forget that. And if you start from that place, it’s nothing but goodness then to think like Joan at work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I asked Sanders for his take on why making a difference was becoming increasingly important to people. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, a lot of recent tragedies and shocks to the system really take a person back to that place, you know, where you realize that life is short and you want to do something bigger than yourself. And so I think there has been a series of things that we’ve seen 24/7 via the glare of the media that have put us in that place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’ve ever met someone that’s had a health scare, you see a person that’s reconnected with purpose. And I think as a society we’ve had a huge emotional scare over the course of the last decade or so, and it just continues over time. So that’s a piece of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other idea is that as a society, globally, consciousness always goes up a little bit over time, very incrementally, because of this tsunami of information that is available to us has democratized thought. We’ve started to craft purpose as we’ve begun to evolve as a society. And as a result it’s become more and more important. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to give you an analog to the business world, for people that care about branding, Traditionally, brands have always been built because they’re different and they’re relevant. They solve a problem. And what we’re seeing now is that brands are starting to be built because there’s a high esteem for them. They have a great social reputation. And that’s almost as important now as being different or relevant. You see, that’s changed too, because the market’s changed. And again, we want to make a difference with everything we do. Where we work, how we spend our money, what we do with our life, who we influence. And that need structure has changed as we’ve attempted to find more and more purpose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The work of making a difference is done by what Sanders calls Saver Soldiers. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Saver Soldier is a person that takes her values to work and commits herself to not just help the company, but to help the world by helping the company. Joan Krajewski is a Saver Soldier. In the days of the quality movement they had these things called Black Belt Six Sigmas. And a Black Belt Six Sigma cared about quality. He would do anything to improve quality. Well, this is what I mean when I say Saver Soldier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In his interviews with people he describes as Saver Soldiers, Sanders saw six things that all successful Saver Soldiers have in common. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the book I talk about six laws that every successful Saver Soldier seems to obey. These laws point you in the right direction where you can make a difference with your company and help your company make a dollar at the same time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I interviewed dozens of people that I would call Saver Soldiers, and they all shared these in common. So let me give you these ideas, these laws, in no particular order, because you’ve got to get them all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One, law of the ledger. Everything you do over the course of time must feed the baby that’s the company. I learned the law of the ledger from Stanley Marcus Jr., the late great chairman of Neiman. Everything ties to that. Not because you’re a profit animal, but because an organization dies if it runs out of money. It’s a basic realization. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Law number two. The law of abundance says I feel confident, I feel worthy, and there will always be enough to go around. In fact, there’s enough to share. And you have to believe in the law of abundance to let go and [?]. It’s very important. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Law number three. The law of interdependence. The law of interdependence says everything’s connected. The thing that occurs here will create a change in something that occurs there. Each other relies on each other for success. Your success is my survival. And that’s a huge, huge important thing to understand if you’re going to think like a member of the community. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Law number four. The law of the long view. The idea is that if you have a very long view, longer than your competitors, you are less likely to be disrupted or surprised. And the long view is the correct view all the time, even counting the market. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That particular law says that the real winners in the world, say the folks at Toyota that worked on the hybrid synergy program years ago were conducting something called scenario planning. They would imagine a couple different scenarios, world that could exist in ten years, and created a single solution. In this case the Prius, that addressed all those scenarios. Excellent example of the law of the long view. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the next law, a very important one, is the law of reciprocity. The law of reciprocity says that the homo sapien is conditioned from the time that we’re conditioned from the time that we’re children to reciprocate, good, bad or ugly. Someone does something nice to you, you’re a six year old, your mother says what? Say thank you. That programs reciprocity into our brains. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s an important law to leverage. I call this law the secret of the business world. People will reciprocate based on how you make them feel. You’ve got to be authentic to sustain that feeling over time, but if you get it right, you give to someone, they reciprocate by giving you something back or paying it forward, which helps all of us. Refer to the previous law of abundance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, law number six. The law of the last mile. The law of the last mile says when you’re trying to change the world, good intentions aren’t enough. If you don’t finish the last half of one percent, you haven’t accomplished anything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last mile is an old telco reference. I had a career in telco and they always believed that the law of the last mile was the only law that counted, because if you didn’t get the phone signal to the residence, you weren’t in business. And so I tell people all the time, if you want to go change the world at work and you start something, or you join something, and you don’t finish, you’re going to ruin it for people in the future and you’re going to make this type of activity idealistic and not pragmatic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those six laws give anyone a kind of a grounding to begin to think tactically or strategically about, how can I go to work and help it become part of the solution. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While a Saver Soldier’s individual motivation might be a desire to make a positive impact, Sanders stresses the importance of taking the appropriate steps first, ones that speak to the financial bottom line.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this book knowing that this recession was just beginning, so we had to think about sequencing where, if you want to help your company become green, you have to do things in the correct order that resonates, not just with the folks in marketing, but with the folks in the finance group that are scrimping and saving their way to survival. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, if you want to help your company be green, the first thing you do is focus on reducing waste and energy use. You focus on it. You measure it. You document the results. You quantify the savings, and hopefully you can invest a portion of those savings into capital intensive ways of going green like recycling or finding replacement ingredients that are organic or green. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting the sequencing right is critical, because again, you don’t want to create an unsustainable sustainability program. So getting these things following rule number one, ledger, critical. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanders sees four broad categories of intelligence. The two most commonly focused on in the business world are what he calls technical intelligence – book learning, if you will – and fiscal intelligence, the nuts and bolts understanding of business operations and how wealth is created. They’re all things that stem from the logical brain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sanders’ focus has been on emotional intelligence, and by association, spiritual intelligence, two areas that, while enormously powerful, have yet to be embraced as deeply by the business world. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why is because emotional intelligence and spiritual intelligence have yet to be documented as being empirical drivers of the business, per se.&amp;#0160; So technical intelligence, you show me a Fortune 500 company and I’ll show you a company that has made an institution out of measuring the value of either technical or financial intelligence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But emotional intelligence is rather new. I think we didn’t even have that phrase until Daniel Goleman wrote the book of that title a decade ago. But I focus on the idea that if you change the thought processes of people – customers, partners, talent – you change the world. And that certainly shines through in saving the world at work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I asked Sanders what he loves about his work. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mission is to participate in the end of suffering with my talent, however I can do it. That’s just something very basic to me. I think there’s a lot of unnecessary suffering in the world. I think that happiness is the absence of unnecessary suffering. So it’s very easy for me to always use that acid test to measure everything I do. Does it help me promote the end of suffering. This call, for example, fits that acid test. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I like about what I do is I get to live on purpose. And I’ve spent far to long of my life not being able to live completely on purpose. I’ve lived on purpose, but only part time. I also lived on budget most of the time. Lived on somebody else’s nickel a lot of the time. So living on purpose is exciting that I can say no to any request that doesn’t fit my mission, but my family is fed. And gosh, I like that. And you know the other thing I like is, I’m a creative person and I get to get up every day and create content. I mean, who knew there there would be a world where, if you produce helpful content, you get to eat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I also love to travel and give speeches. And I’m excited about my blog. And for those listening, my blog is Sanders Says. And I do a lot of work there, and it’s just wonderful to have these tools, like Twitter and blogging as a platform where you can talk about what matters to you, and sometimes people actually listen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanders comes across as an incredibly positive guy who is bullish on the future. I asked what gave him such a positive perspective. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I very much prescribe to Napoleon when he said that the leader’s role is to define reality, then give hope. And that’s my back and forth throughout my entire life is to just stay balanced in that regard. It’s very easy for me to give hope, and here’s why I’m optimistic. Human beings are good. Sentient beings, they’ve got kindness in their heart. You’re born with it as a child. You look at a five year old and you see a child who’s got room in her soul, her heart, her emotions for other people’s pain and sadness. We lose that over time. But people are good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if we develop them, and give them confidence, show them empathy, we’ll always bring good out. When you show me a person who is dishonest or evil or hateful, I’ll show you a person who is just suffering greatly. And if that’s the case then, we’ve got to live our life as if we actually trusted other people. That we would actually look at a person on the street and say, you know what, who cares if he accidentally walked in front of me. I don’t hate that guy, he’s just a human being trying to get to work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving people a break is very important in your life in terms of the kind of generosity that works. Because if you have an optimistic view of people because they’re human beings, I’ll tell you something. You’re going to have a better view of yourself. Because you’re going to realize that you’re a human being too. You make mistakes. You’re not going to be so hard on yourself. And it allows you to move forward in life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I meet people that find great pleasure in being cynical about other people, I find people that hate themselves and have poor self-image. And I just made a decision a really long time ago that if I think of myself as a successful, helpful person, it’s going to come natural to me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, life’s a struggle. That’s the reason I make that first and foremost declaration, people are good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you for listening to Curt Rosengren’s M.A.P. Maker Podcast.

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Based on everything he saw around him as an inner city kid in Pittsburgh, Bill Strickland&amp;#39;s prospects looked pretty bleak. But then a teacher came along and planted the seed that a different path is possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That seed grew, and eventually Bill founded an organization that has changed the lives of hundreds of people, replanting that seed of hope and possibility over and over again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Strickland is the&lt;strong&gt; President &amp;amp; CEO of &lt;a href="http://www.manchesterbidwell.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Manchester Bidwell Corporation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, an organization that includes a multi-disciplined arts learning center for inner city youth, a vocational training center, and a grammy-winning jazz recording label. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is the &lt;strong&gt;author&lt;/strong&gt; of the book, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385520549/curtrosengren-20" target="_blank"&gt;Make the Impossible Possible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the recipient of a &lt;strong&gt;MacArthur Foundation Genius award&lt;/strong&gt;, and a presidential appointee as a &lt;strong&gt;Council Member of the National Endowment for the Arts&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to this podcast and learn:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What inspired Strickland to found Manchester Bidwell Corporation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Strickland&amp;#39;s organization turned the traditional view of at-risk kids and poor people on its head. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why the people around you are such a vital piece of achieving success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to find a great mentor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most important thing to remember when pursuing your vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How people get in their own way when pursuing their vision. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a teenager in the inner city, the course of Bill Strickland’s life
was drastically altered by his high school art teacher. The teacher
introduced him to making pottery and in the process, planted the seeds
for believing that much more was possible in his future than the sense
of hopelessness that permeated the environment around him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 1968, his life-changing experience with pottery led him to found the
Manchester Craftsman’s Guild in the neighborhood he grew up in. He
never dreamed it would have such a profound impact, both on his own
life and the lives of others. What started with a desire to make a
difference in his community through introducing kids to art has turned
into a nationally recognized organization that has inspired similar
programs in cities around the US, with others in the works around the
world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Bill Strickland is now the CEO of Manchester Bidwell Corporation, an
organization that includes a multi-disciplined arts learning center for
inner city youth, a vocational training center, and a grammy-winning
jazz recording label. He is the author of the book, “Making the
Impossible Possible,” the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation Genius
award, and a presidential appointee as a Council Member of the National
Endowment for the Arts. &amp;#0160;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It all started with the ability of one man to open Strickland’s eyes to a new way of seeing himself and the world around him. &lt;/em&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Well, I was an inner-city public school kid, and an art teacher got
involved with my life and basically saved my life. His name was Frank
Ross, and he was a very imaginative and creative guy who got me excited
about ceramics as a sixteen year old high school kid. And I got pretty
good at it. And in addition to teaching me clay, he also taught me how
to learn, and how to feel good about myself. And that eventually
translated to my desire to go on to college when I finished my high
school experience, largely at the experience of Frank Ross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paradoxically, the seeds for an organization that has done so much good
in people’s lives were planted by violence and destruction. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
while I was an undergraduate at the University of Pittsburgh, the
community was on fire because of the riots and the assassination of Dr.
King and so forth, and I really wanted to help make a positive
contribution to improving things. And the best way I thought to do that
was to use some of my creative skills and my mind, and make a
contribution to the community in that way. And that led me to creating
the Manchester Craftsman’s Guild as an arts program in the community
where I was born and where a lot of the rioting was going on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And I was lucky enough to get an old row house that was donated by the
local Episcopal church. I developed a relationship with the bishop of
the diocese who helped me raise some money. And that’s how we got
started with the program in the sixties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strickland’s book, Make the Impossible Possible, is the outgrowth of
his experience over four decades of creating results that nobody
thought possible. In many ways, the book is a reflection of the
organization itself. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Well I wrote the book because I wanted to promote the idea that my
center is founded on here in Pittsburgh, which is that you can really
increase the quality of your life by extending a hand to help others
who are less fortunate. That part of the payback of living the right
kind of life, with the right values, is that you grow yourself as a
human being, and it increases the life opportunities that will become
available to you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And Manchester Bidwell is an organization that’s all about that,
relative to working with unemployed adults, and welfare people, and
at-risk kids and so forth as we’ve done over the years. But also, in
the process of accomplishing that work, I’ve learned a great deal about
myself. I’ve developed a philosophy of how I’ve elected to live my
life, and the book really reflects that philosophy based on lessons
that I’ve learned over 40 years of working with Manchester Bidwell,
etc., etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For Strickland, Manchester Bidwell is all about the bottom-line results of creating possibility in people’s lives. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Well, the most immediate and measurable change is in the lives of the
students that go to the school. Close to 85 to 90% of our arts kids go
on to college once they graduate from high school, and have turned
their lives in many cases into productive, contributing members of
society as lawyers and schoolteachers and business people and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On the vocational side we train people literally to provide them with a
life opportunity in employment and the ability to pull themselves and
their families out of poverty permanently. So the arts program channels
kids to college. The vocational program challenges and directs people
to employment, and we do this in a facility that has now made a
contribution that is an asset to the community where it occupies the
space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The positive ripple effect from Manchester Bidwell’s work is being felt
in other communities as well. Its success in opening doors to
possibility has inspired other organizations to create similar
programs. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So as a result of that, we’re now building smaller versions of
Pittsburgh in other communities. And in Cincinnati and in Grand Rapids
and in San Francisco, centers now exist that are replications of the
work that we’re doing in Pittsburgh. We don’t own them, but we helped
set them up, and they’re getting comparable results to what we’re doing
in Pittsburgh. And we now are planning eight more centers in the US,
and one in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and we’re having some early
conversations in Ireland, and in Israel, and in Rwanda. So the model in
Pittsburgh is now beginning to really pay dividends because we’re using
what we’ve learned here to apply those principles to apply those
principles to other communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I asked Strickland what kind of effect the difference his work makes has had in his own life. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Oh yeah, I feel that I have a better life as a result of the work I do.
I feel that my life is more enriched. I can directly measure the
meaning of my experience through what happens with other people who
come through here, and it makes me feel that I’m making a contribution
in a way that’s really measurable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There are very few jobs in the world where you can actually say to
yourself, my life made a difference to another human being. So to be
able to say that, not just with one human being, but hundreds, so it’s
not abstract what I do for a living every day. It’s quite measureable,
and quite specific, and in many cases it’s a life as opposed to death
conversation because many of the people we’re working with are down to
their last hope and their last prayer, and to be able to give them a
shot at having a meaningful life is very powerful stuff. And we see it
every time we have a graduation here at the center. It’s very touching.
So I feel very gratified to be given the opportunity to have this kind
of life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The success of Manchester Bidwell’s approach, as Strickland sees it, all boils down to how you look at people. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you treat people with respect, they’ll give it back to you. If you
create environments that are nurturing, you’ll get nurturing human
beings. If you believe in the power of kids – and adults – to do
extraordinary things, they will. And so it really becomes a different
way of approaching what are historically called social problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So we’ve decided that rather than look at social problems as problems,
we look at them as opportunities. And we see at-risk kids and poor
folks as not liabilities, but assets. And people are a function of
environment, and they’re a function of expectations. And if you have
that in motion, you can do pretty extraordinary things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That recognition of the importance of other people runs deep in Strickland’s approach to life. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Well, I think that you can’t stand alone in this world, and if you
think you can you’re wrong, and you’ll die a lonely death. That we are
biologically and psychologically designed to live in community. And
when the community’s healthy, everyone’s healthy. And when the
community is sick, it affects everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So recognizing at the beginning of the conversation that people matter,
that lives matter, that the way that you treat others, the way you live
your life, the way that you acquire values that you learn from mentors
and so forth, really becomes the substance and fabric of your
existence. And to that extent, I believe that that is much more lasting
and much more powerful than simply monetary or political visibility. I
think the way in which you elect to treat others is the way that people
will treat you. Which is not something that I’ve invented, but it’s
something that I’ve rediscovered in my own life and I’ve tried to apply
it in the way I’ve lived each day of my life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Given his focus on other people, it’s no great surprise that one of the
key components he pointed to when asked about the keys to his success
was the people around him. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Well, I had good parenting. My mom particularly was very focused on
giving her children a sense of value and a sense of purpose, so the
foundation was laid by my mom. But also because of my interest in other
human beings, which came from her as well, and having great mentors
along the way, I acquired a value system and an educational outlook
that ended up being complementary to the work that I actually ended up
doing in my life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So my mom, and mentors that I’ve met, extraordinary people, both at the
university and through the arts, and my community work. I’ve learned
from them, I’ve drawn a lot of experience and energy from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strickland offers some advice for how to find great mentors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Well, I think you find them where you live. You don’t have to go
someplace. You find them out of your own experience, and you can define
your mentors by defining what your needs are. It’s pretty tough to find
something if you don’t know what you’re looking for. So it really
becomes important that you formulate some kind of philosophy and a
vision of where you’re trying to take your life and where you’re trying
to take your career.&amp;#0160; And that begins to equip you to evaluate the
experiences and the people around you. And I think that most of the
experiences are close at hand. Most of those individuals are closer
than you think, but if you’re not equipped to see them, you won’t. And
so I think the first place to start is to reflect on what it is that
you want your life to be about, and then begin the process of selecting
people who can help you get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I asked him if he had any advice for people out there who wanted to
pursue their dreams and do the work they feel inspired to do. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Go slowly. Don’t go fast, go slow. Left foot in front of right. Don’t
get out ahead of yourself. Allow the world to become acquainted with
your thinking and your ideas. And that it’s important to build the
house one brick at a time.&amp;#0160; To build a good foundation, and then good
walls, and eventually a good roof and so forth. And that’s a long-term
proposition. That is not something that comes instantaneously. You
can’t buy it in a drugstore. It’s something that comes out of your
experience moment by moment and hour by hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Strickland sees one big way that people get in their own way as they pursue their vision. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#0160;By trying to get to the end of the conversation before they start it
at the beginning.&amp;#0160; And many of the answers that you’re looking for are
yet to be written. They come out of the experience itself. So be
patient, calm down, recognize that this is long-term thinking and
long-term opportunity, and recognize that what’s at stake is your life
so you evaluate things at the level of importance that they deserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wrapping things up, I asked him what gives him hope. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#0160;By looking back from where I came, which is very clearly articulated
in the book. That’s why the book is hopeful, because it is called
mission impossible. And I look back at where I’ve come from, which
allows me to appreciate where I’m at, and gives me the courage and
confidence that I can go further in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;These days, more and more people are coming face-to-face with adversity. In this installment of The M.A.P. Maker Podcast, you&amp;#39;ll hear from Erik Weihenmayer, a man who has turned dealing with adversity into an art form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2001, Weihenmayer made big news by becoming the first blind person to reach the summit of Mount Everest. It was one stop along the way to climbing the highest peak on each of the seven continents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His autobiography, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452282942?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=curtrosengren-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0452282942" target="_blank"&gt;Touch the Top of the World: A Blind Man&amp;#39;s Journey to Climb Farther Than the Eye Can See&lt;/a&gt; was a best-seller. His most recent book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743290224/curtrosengren-20" target="_blank"&gt;The Adversity Advantage: Turning Everyday Struggles Into Everyday Greatness&lt;/a&gt;, written together with Paul Stolz, offers the tools to use adversity to help you thrive.&amp;#0160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this podcast, you will hear Weihenmayer talk about:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you can benefit from adversity&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem-solving&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making the hard choices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why now is a great time to reexamine your priorities&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The importance of surrounding yourself with the right people&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His experience taking six blind Tibetan kids up a mountain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How his work to help people shatter barriers inspires him&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello, and welcome to Curt Rosengren’s M.A.P. Maker Podcast. I’m
Curt Rosengren, and my focus is helping people create careers that
energize and inspire them. It’s all about answering the question, how
do you put your passion to work to make a difference that inspires you,
in a way that lets you thrive? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this series, you will find
insights and inspiration from thought leaders and trailblazers – people
who are crafting a life of Meaning, Abundance, and Passion. &lt;br /&gt;Recently
I caught up with Erik Weihenmayer, who is a climber, author, and
motivational speaker. Weihenmayer reached the top of Mount Everest in
2001 on the way to reaching the seven summits, the highest peaks on
each of seven continents. He is the co-author of the book The Adversity
Advantage, author of a best-selling autobiography Touch the Top of the
World, and subject of two documentaries.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#0160;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and did I happen to mention that he’s blind?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weihenmayer is the first to admit that the path he has taken is a bit on the unlikely side.&amp;#0160; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My
name is Erik Weihenmayer and I’m basically I guess a Jamaican
bobsledder. I’m a blind climber. I’ve been climbing for 12 years
professionally. Climbing isn’t something where you’re like an NFL
football player where people give you money to climb, but you kind of
figure out a way to make a life out of it, and that’s what I’ve been
doing for ten years, climbing and adventuring all over the world. It’s
been really fulfilling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He has also been able to parlay
those adventures into a successful career as a motivational speaker. He
recently spoke at the National Youth Forum for the inauguration weekend
in Washington DC, sharing a platform with speakers such as Al Gore and
Colin Powell. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many people encountering big hairy
doses of adversity these days, the timing for Weihenmayer’s recent
book, The Adversity Advantage, couldn’t be better. The seeds for the
book were planted a few years ago, when he and co-author Paul Stolz met
and realized that they had both discovered many of the same insights
about making the most of life’s challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I
met this doctor. He was a scientist, a PhD. His name’s Doctor Paul
Stolz. And he’s a social scientist who had studied resiliency all over
the world in a systematic way. He has something called the human
resilience project, and he found, he came up with a theory on
adversity. People talk about you IQ, well he talks about your AQ, your
Adversity Quotient, and that people have a threshold for adversity. The
most accurate determination of your success is not your intelligence,
but how well you deal with adversity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he made it his life
mission to help people change their relationship with adversity. So he
interviewed me for one of his other projects and we started talking and
we just hit it off, and we found that we had a lot in common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And
we came at the subject from very different places. I came from very
much an experiential level, and he came at it from science, but we
basically had the same ideas. We had come to understand through very
different ways. And we thought it would be really cool to collaborate
on a book, like no one’s ever written a book like this, where – I don’t
know, fairly goofy, but like a peanut butter cup, you know? Coming
together, chocolate and peanut butter, basically coming together to
form something meaningful. So we did that. I wrote all the experiential
stuff and he wrote all the science based stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I asked Weihenmayer to sum up what the book is about. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well,
I think if I were to condense it into a phrase, the book is about
alchemy. It’s really about taking bad things and making them into good
things. And a lot of times you have to go through adversity in order to
do that. But you can’t tell people, just walk into a storm, because if
they do walk into a storm they get crushed. It’s like climbing a
mountain. You can’t just go climb a mountain without the right skill
and the right preparation. So essentially the book gets people prepared
for the storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A key part of the book’s message is that adversity can be a vital part of moving forward in life. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And
the focus of the book is to really understand who those people at the
top of the adversity continuum, like the people who aren’t just dealing
well with adversity, or avoiding it, but really take it to a new level,
which is to harness adversity and use that energy created to propel
yourself forward to places that you might not have gone to in any other
way. And can propel you to innovation, can propel you towards more
compassion in your life, to friendships, to all sorts of areas that you
would never expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s like adversity is one of those things
that you never ask for. But when it happens and you look back and you
realize a lot of times you didn’t just survive it. It made you better.
It made you stronger in certain ways. And we wanted to really
understand how people do that, so we broke it down and kind of made it
like the seven summits. We had seven ideas that we break down and help
people to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weihenmayer admits that, while the ideas
in the book are powerful, they can be a hard sell because they’re not
about taking the easy road. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all of them come down to
this. I’ve thought a lot about it, and they all come down to the same
thing, and that’s basically hard choices. Not easy choices. And that’s
a hard pill to swallow for most people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the idea that
adversity means – we’re telling people to go have more adversity in
your life. Rarely are people going to go do that. It’s not like we’re
saying be a sadist and ask for adversity. But adversity hits you in
life, and you have a choice. It either destroys you, it stops you in
your tracks, or you figure out a way to harness it and use that energy
to go forward in your life. And if you do it right, sometimes you go
farther than you’d go without the adversity. So in a weird way the
adversity becomes the pathway. But it’s not an easy ride, so it’s a
hard sell to people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we talked about how you can find your
strengths through adversity. But again, you find a lot of your best,
most powerful strengths through adverse situations. And you grow those
strengths through adversity. We talked about how you become more
innovative through adversity, but again, you have to go through
adversity to become more – a lot of times you have to go through
adversity to become more innovative. So a lot of the things that you
gain, unfortunately have to be gained through adversity. And that’s
tough. That’s like telling people go suffer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I asked Weihenmayer what advice he would have for people out there who are suffering through adversity in today’s economy. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well,
one of the chapters we talk about a concept we call pack light. And
that’s a really applicable subject at this time, because we’re all
talking about scaling back right now. Because in society we’ve been
such consumers, and we’ve let that consumerism distract us from our
goals, our dreams. So we talk about packing like a climber, like I
would have to pack for a mountain. You’re carrying basically your house
on your back, and you can’t carry everything you want to carry up a
mountain. And as you get higher up the mountain, and as it gets harder,
you have to basically drop stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when you summit, you’re on
a mountain, maybe you’re on Antarctica’s summit, Mount Vincent, it’s 50
below zero. You’ve dropped your pack even, down the mountain, because
it’s too heavy. So you’re just carrying everything you need in your
person, in your down suit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so we talk about as you move up
in this hierarchy of life, where you’re moving towards what you want,
your goals in life, you have to become more strategic and focused. And
you have to drop a lot of extraneous stuff in life that weighs you
down, that becomes a distraction. All those obligations. All those
responsibilities that you think you’re obliged to. All those materials
that you thought were the things that defined you. You have to strip
yourself down so you’re more nimble, and you’re more ready to take on
adversity, which will always spring up in your path, and so that you’ll
be more able, more nimble, to achieve what you want. And again, that’s
another thing that’s just like a hard choice for people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Put another way, it’s a great time to examine your priorities and ask yourself what life you really want to create. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well,
I think it’s a time to make those hard choices, to scale down your
material possessions, your distractions. It’s time to take a hard look
at maybe some of the losses that you’ve had and see if there is
anything that’s there, a nugget you can use that actually propel you
forward and can make a change in your life that you’ve been wanting to
do anyway, and you’ve been too scared to do it. Or maybe moving slowly
in that direction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think this is a really crucial time to
really analyze our life, and our families, and try to figure out, how
do we not just repeat the same things, and go through the same patterns
that maybe haven’t been very effective in the past. But how do we
create a new paradigm where we’re using these tough things to help us
move forward in new ways that we’ve never been able to do before.
Sometimes these tough times are the best times to make a change in our
life, or to propel us in a direction – sometimes the adversity that we
face is the catalyst that we need to do it. So I would say, see this
time as a great time of change and progress in our lives and use it as
such. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weihenmayer has been taking his advice in his own career as his speaking business has felt the effects of the economy. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve
been speaking quite a bit, but my speaking, because of the recession,
has scaled back. And it’s interesting that maybe six months ago I
turned 40 and I said, you know you’re not going to be able to climb
forever. So I want to go back to my roots. I want to climb. I want to
do interesting adventures around the world, working with youth, working
with disabled people. In February I’ll be climbing an icefall with an
organization, with an amputee that lost his leg in Iraq. In June I’ll
be climbing Mexican volcanoes with blind kids. In July I’ll be doing a
rafting trip with my family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I think this is a great time for
me – my kids are six and eight years old. This is a great time to step
back and to say, what’s really important? And for me it’s my family and
my adventures. And so I’m really using this time to understand how
important those are, and to make good use of time, and not worry about,
I’m not getting as much work as I used to. That’s OK. Everything ebbs
and flows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As we talked about his unusual career, we got to
talking about how much more potential there is to create your own path
than most people realize. While he agreed, he didn’t want to whitewash
the challenges involved. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So not to downplay the
difficulties of doing that. Because when you’re going forward and
there’s no map, you’re creating your own map. And that’s extremely
challenging. In a way, that’s where adventure lies, when you’re kind of
creating your way when you go. And it’s a rare privilege to be able to
do that, but it also lays a lot of adversity on your shoulders. When
you live that kind of life, it’s almost like you’re asking for more
adversity &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s this connection between trying to be
innovative and the adversity that you take on. And that works in
reverse too. Sometimes the adversity you take on, that is what thrusts
you into innovation, and doing new things. So the two are kind of
connected. So it does bring on a lot of adversity, but I think the
rewards are worth it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Weihenmayer sees it, a big part of achieving your potential is surrounding yourself with people who feed that potential. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I
think one is to throw yourself into the right environment. I wanted to
be a climber, so I threw myself into the climbing world. I joined every
climbing club I could. I joined a rock gym. I surrounded myself with
climbers. I found people that believed in my mission, and supported it,
and wanted to be a part of it, and I dropped the people that didn’t. It
was literally as simple as that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because as one individual, you
don’t have the power to have the world on your shoulders. You need a
team. You need a good group of people who believe in you. So I’ve been
very lucky to find people and surround myself with people – and I’ve
been lucky that it’s my family, mostly – some people don’t have that
luxury, but for me it’s been a good family to support me, and good
friends that I’ve reached out and found that support me. And we support
each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s like on a mountain you have a rope team,
people connected on a rope and you’re moving together. And you kind of
have to find your rope team in life. And I’ve worked hard to do that
and maintain that rope team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to be a climber, so I
surrounded myself with the best climbers I could, and the most positive
people I could, that didn’t bring me down. That gave me belief, that
didn’t take it away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite all that he has accomplished,
Weihenmayer is quick to point out that he’s not, as he puts it, some
Super Blind Guy. In many ways, he’s no different than the next person.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve
had that happen a lot. And I guess I’d first respond by saying I’m a
decent athlete, but I’m not a great athlete. I’m not this great
physical specimen. And I have the same ailments and frailties. I have
the same uncertainties, and doubts, and fears that anyone else has. In
fact, fear used to paralyze me. And I’m no Super Blind Guy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And
I think people have said that in the past. They say, you’re inspiring.
And that’s a huge compliment, sure, but in a way I think that word is a
double-edged sword, because people use the word inspiring to say, hey,
you’re like that, but I’m like this. And it’s a way that people use as
a defense mechanism so they don’t have to make hard choices in their
life. They separate themselves from me, let’s say, and it’s a way that
they don’t have to wrestle with their own choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I do
think people do that quite a bit. And it’s important for people to know
that yes, most people have the ability to do more in their lives than
they think. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A big part of Weihenmayer’s success comes from his focus on problem-solving, a skill he says being blind has honed. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve
had obstacles, where maybe I wanted to learn to climb as a blind
person, or I wanted to learn to trek up a mountain. Or I wanted to
paraglide solo. Or I wanted to be a better dad. You know, it’s not like
those ideas are right in front of you. Without eyes, you have to be a
better problem solver. So in a way, those obstacles have helped me to
be a better problem solver. To find ways – when I want to – instead of
stepping back, to step forward, and engage more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so, being
a blind dad, I wanted to be the best dad I could. I wanted to be a part
of my kids’ lives, and so I devised a lot of systems. I had a friend
design a candyland game where, instead of seeing the colors, each color
has a different tactile texture so I can feel where my little guy is on
the board. We put a wrestling mat and have these balls that we can
throw at each other. They’re big blow-up balls, so when they peg me in
the head it doesn’t hurt so bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so those obstacles, those
fears of not engaging help you sometimes create a lot of awesome
systems that you can take with you wherever you go in life. And
sometimes they’re even good enough that they extend and help other
people. And I happen to call them systems. They’re systems, or
strategies, or ideas that help you be more productive, more efficient,
sometimes safer. In combination, they’re the difference between success
and failure, and they lead you to solutions. The purpose that you’re
looking for in your life, they’re getting you closer to that. So you’re
not doing things in such a helter-skelter kind of way, you’re doing
them in a strategic way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In 2004, Erik’s path took him to
Tibet to lead a group of blind Tibetan students on a summit attempt of
a 23,000 foot mountain, an effort that was the subject of the
documentary Blindsight. It all started with an invitation from a blind
German woman living in Tibet. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I climbed Everest, it
was maybe a couple years after I climbed Everest, I got this beautiful
letter – I listen to my e-mail with a voice synthesizer that reads me
the screen – and I got this letter from this lady named Sabria. And
Sabria’s this beautiful blind lady. She’s German, and she lives in
Tibet now, and her story is that she tried to get into the German
equivalent of the Peace Corps. And she was blind and they said, you’re
a risk. You’re a liability. We don’t send blind people into the field.
And so they rejected her even though she was amazingly qualified. And
she had studied Tibetology in college, the study of Tibet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And
so she funded her own way, just her and her cane, to Tibet, and met
some locals and rode horseback through some villages, and wanted to
investigate blindness. And she found blind kids that were three years
old, four years old, hadn’t been taught to walk. Their parents – it
wasn’t like they didn’t love them, but they’d go out to the fields,
herding their yaks and they didn’t know what to do with these blind
kids, and so they’d tie them to beds in dark rooms to keep them safe,
and the kids were just sitting there. [13:22] And all these
superstitions had cropped up, like if you’re blind, maybe there’s a
reason for it, like you have evil spirits inside you. You have demons
inside you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So she realized this was her calling and she
started a school, fought through tons of bureaucracy and superstition
and now trains hundreds of kids a year. Blindness is very prevalent in
Tibet because of all the yak dung fires and all the UV rays because
you’re so high in altitude. And these are the best educated kids in
Tibet now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And she wrote us a note and said I was inspired by
your book, and the kids were too in our school, and she said, would you
ever come over for a visit? And I went to my Everest team and I said,
how would you guys like to do a project in Tibet? And we went over
there and we trained six of her kids. She picked six really fit,
motivated students who were blind, and we went and trained them, and we
came back in the fall and we took them on a month-long climbing
expedition. We pushed through a lot of hardship, but it definitely was
an awesome adventure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They ultimately stood at almost 22,000
feet together – all six kids, myself, Sabria – and that was higher than
any other team of blind people had ever stood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And those kids
are going on now, all those blind Tibetans, they’re going on to doing
really amazing things. They’re not just surviving blindness, but
they’re flourishing. Two of them have started the biggest massage
clinic in Lhasa. One of them started a Braille printing press. One of
them graduated from high school in a sighted school, which first of all
didn’t even want to let her in. She graduated number one in the whole
school. And then one of the kids is taking over the school now that
Sabria and Paul are taking over another project in India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So to
me it’s a really cool story. Sabria’s basically changed a whole society
in certain ways. In ten years. It’s crazy to think that one person has
that much power.&lt;br /&gt;I asked Weihenmayer what attracted him to the project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I
just wanted to be a part of Sabria’s mission. I just really got
inspired by what she had done in Tibet, and I thought it would be
really cool to be a part of that mission in the way I know how, which
is a climbing expedition. And why not take these kids on an amazing
adventure? Something big. Something that nobody in their families,
nobody in their culture had done. Take these kids who were pariahs and
have them do something really special. Because when you start thinking
about big things in your life, the bigness of that, it kind of ingrains
itself into your psyche and it affects you as you move forward, and you
think bigger in your life. You don’t think about just surviving. You
think about doing great. You think about flourishing. So I wanted to be
a part of that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then I like climbing too, so it was a good
chance to go to Tibet and be a part of something really cool. And I
also learned at the end, because we did fall short of the actual summit
that we wanted to get to – we made it almost to 22,000 feet, but the
summit we were going for was 23. And I realized there was a lot of
struggle. And the kids were struggling, and we were trying to figure
out, what was our goal? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A summit is different for everyone. For
me it might be standing on top of a summit of a mountain. But for these
kids, their summits were all over the map. And that’s kind of the
beauty of it, and eventually we found a summit that was meaningful to
everyone. We trekked up to this amazing ice palace. It was like a giant
palace of ice where the glacier had retreated and it left these amazing
canyons and corridors of ice. And the kids climbed all over the ice,
and we had the most amazing day, and it was the most tactile experience
for these blind kids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weihenmayer talks about the meaning and motivation of his work with youth and people with disabilities. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It
might come back to that adversity thing again. Because when I went
blind, I remember sitting in the cafeteria as a freshman right after I
had gone blind and listening to the excitement, all the adventure. All
the food fights, all the laughter going by that I wanted to be a part
of. I didn’t want blindness to be the reason I couldn’t take part in
that kind of stuff, like I wouldn’t be in the thick of things. And I
think in a way that was my biggest fear. That I would be swept to the
sidelines and my life would be meaningless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I think in a
way when you confront that sort of potential future, in a way there’s a
tipping point where the pain of doing nothing outweighs the pain that
it might take to make a change in your life. So I really worked hard to
find stuff that made me fulfilled in life, and to work really hard to
have friends. You know, worked toward the things that were important.
And so for me I can relate so candidly to that fear of sitting in a
dark room listening to life go by. And I think for me that’s important
in my mission to take people that might traditionally be on the
sidelines and get them into the thick of things, and get them
experiencing life to the fullest. And so for me, that’s where my work
takes me, and it’s fulfilling for me in that way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asked what
kind of legacy he wants to leave behind, Weihenmayer describes it as
one of previously unimagined possibilities and shattered barriers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I
would say though, just take a blind guy climbing Mount Everest. This is
something that most people would not ever have imagined possible before
it happened, and so there is a sort of legacy that’s created there in
that it takes people’s ideas of what’s possible and it just drives them
– it maybe kind of explodes them. And so when people have to rebuild
their perceptions of what’s possible, it’s a bigger picture. It’s a
more open – it’s more full of possibilities. So in a way I think that’s
a good legacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And also I think I can directly affect people’s
lives through some of the fun programs that I’m doing in my life. Not
only this program where I take blind kids climbing, through an
organization called Global Explorers, but I run a non-profit called No
Barriers, where we bring together all sorts of new ideas and new
technologies and all sorts of pioneers, many of whom have disabilities,
and we show people who have challenges all these ideas and all these
technologies that have the potential to shatter barriers in their lives
and living more actively and more fully in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We bring
in the latest prosthetic legs that people might be able to tap into
that enable them to run and climb. We bring in mountain bikes for
paraplegics. These people are getting off road, something that they’ve
never been able to do before, onto a trail. We bring in talking GPS
systems and show blind people how they can use this talking GPS to
navigate, not only through cities, but through the outdoors. They can
actually kayak, and hike independently. So we kind of do things that
shatter barriers in life, and that to me is really gratifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(112, 48, 160);"&gt;Hello, and welcome to Curt Rosengren’s M.A.P. Maker
Podcast. I’m Curt Rosengren, and my focus is helping people create careers that
energize and inspire them. It’s all about answering the question, how do you
put your passion to work to make a difference that inspires you, in a way that
lets you thrive? &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(112, 48, 160);"&gt;In this series, you will find insights and inspiration
from thought leaders and trailblazers – people who are crafting a life of
Meaning, Abundance, and Passion. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(112, 48, 160);"&gt;Today’s podcast is the second of a two-part series
featuring Howard Behar, former president of Starbucks International and
Starbucks North America, and author of the book, “It’s Not About the Coffee:
Leadership Principles from a Life at Starbucks.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(112, 48, 160);"&gt;While Behar has had a career many only dream about, he
acknowledges that had his share of fears and failures along the way. Which, as
he see sees it, means he’s pretty much just like everybody else. I asked him to
share his perspective on the bumps and bruises on the road to success. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;One day I was watching a television program and it was about
Ted Turner. This was 20 years ago, 15 years ago. He had formed CNN. Of course,
he was successful. It was interesting. I didn’t know much about Ted Turner. And
somebody was interviewing him and, evidently his father committed suicide when
he was young, and he said, you know, I was so afraid of displeasing my father
my whole life. It’s what drove me. Here’s a man who’s a billionaire. Created
CNN. And here he’s talking as a human being. “I was so afraid of displeasing my
father. I’ve lived my whole life under that fear.” Even after his father died. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So we all have it. It doesn’t make any difference. Everybody
does. Everybody has fears of failure, fears of success. Everybody does fail,
makes mistakes. And the way I have dealt with them, if you came into my office,
you’d see sayings on my office wall, and one of the sayings is, “There’s no
stressful situations, only stressful responses.” I can’t tell you how many
times that I have had to re – I’ve had that on my wall for twenty, thirty
years. I still have to read it when I’m struggling with something. Or when I’m
upset about something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And I have lived with all of that stuff. Fears. I still have
it. You know, one of the great advantages of getting older is that it’s
happened so many times now, when the anxiety comes up in me, I identify it so
quickly. Oh! Oh, there’s my buddy. Anxiety. You know how we all have these
little people on our shoulders, these little voices. I probably have hundreds
of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And one of them is that anxiety one. “You should be anxious about
this.” So I recognize it. I say, I hear you. I acknowledge you.
I’m not dealing with you now. It’s ok. You’re my buddy, because there’s times
when I need you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And then I have all sorts of those voices. And so I think it
goes back to understanding yourself, and feeling the feeling. So when you’ve
had a failure, stop and say, how do I feel right now? Talk to yourself. Talk to
yourself. Right? How do I feel? I’m anxious. I’m mad. There’s just lots of
stuff going on. Somebody’s not going to like me. I’m feeling rejected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Ask
yourself a question. How do I feel? And then acknowledge. Just say, it’s ok to
have all of those feelings. Say it to yourself. Out loud. People will think
you’re nutty, but that’s ok. And so, we all have it, and so from kings to
presidents to famous scientists to great athletes – it doesn’t make any
difference. Just human beings. We all have the same stuff. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(112, 48, 160);"&gt;Rather than hurrying past our failures and doing our best
to pretend they never happened, Behar advocates the seemingly contradictory
idea of celebrating them. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I think that celebrating failure is key because it – I mean,
most of us live our lives with lots of failures, and those failures are usually
– a lot of people say this, but not many of us believe it, but they’re all
pretty much learning experiences. We don’t usually learn very much from the
successes that we had, because we’re so joyful about them, and people are
patting us on the back, and it makes you feel good, but they’re not – there can
be lessons to learn from successes too, I guess, but &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I think you learn much
more from the mistakes because hopefully when you do make those mistakes, you
become a little introspective about those mistakes and you try to figure out,
OK, what could I have done better? What did I do wrong? What changes could I
have made? Etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;A great example at Starbucks, we made lots of mistakes, but
one big one we had, we wanted a bottled beverage. We had a joint venture with
Pepsi. And so we worked on creating what we thought was a fantastic bottled
beverage called Mazagran. Mazagran comes from the French foreign legion, and it
was basically, it was kind of sparkling coffee. Cold coffee. It was a drink
that they would drink. So we tried to create this beverage that would fit into
that category. It was kind of like a coffee cola. And we tested it, and we
drank it, and we thought it was fantastic. And we get it out there and the
thing was an abject failure. I don’t know how many bottles it sold, but there
were no repeat customers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So when you do something like that, you’re forced to ask
yourself the question, what did I miss there? And I think that if you can
celebrate that – and I don’t mean you go throw yourself a big party and say,
“Yay! We were a failure! Isn’t it wonderful?!” I’m not talking about that. But
I’m talking about celebrating the fact that we tried something, and it didn’t
work, and then understanding what we did, how we would have made it better, and
what changes we would have made. And from that product, because it was a
failure, of course, we said, well what else could we do? And bottled Frappucino
was born, which has been a fantastic success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;When you don’t celebrate, or accept failure with a positive
mental attitude, it can stop you from doing other things. Fear sets in – well,
I don’t want to make a mistake again – so now you start to become more
conservative about the things that you do, in an attempt to only have
successes. Once that happens, you pass by so many things that could be a
success because of your fear of failure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And that’s what I think you’re trying
to keep from happening, is having your fear of failure get in the way of the
ability to take more risk, new risk, and to try new things. And when you beat
yourself up too much, or get too conservative, that’s exactly what you do. So
celebrating failure is just really critical in your journey in life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;It’s not
fun. I’m not here to tell you, heyyy, like I was talking about, boy that was
sure fun to blow that thing up. It isn’t. But on the other hand you’ve got to
be able to look at yourself in the mirror and say, OK, I screwed that one up,
and laugh, and say Ok, what am I going to do now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(112, 48, 160);"&gt;Recognizing that approaching failure with a positive
mindset runs counter to how we’re conditioned to perceive it, Behar offers some
suggestions on how to cultivate an attitude that lets you get the most out of
failure. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I think number one, you have to allow yourself to mourn. And
you can be mad at yourself. I mean sometimes I get just – my self-talk, you
know, I can be really mad at myself. I don’t give myself very long at doing
that. What I try to do is I try to set a time limit. I say, Howard, after
Friday, you’re done with that talk. Right? I do that. It sounds strange, but
I’m talking to myself, and I say OK, you’ve got a couple of days to moan and
groan, and then you’ve got to start thinking about what you’re going to do, and
talk only about what you learned, not what you did wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So I think that’s one
thing. It’s a little trick you play with yourself. Acknowledge it. Give your
time to mourn, and to do all those things you need to do. Yeah, it did happen.
I’m terrible. I stink. I will never do anything right. And then starting on
Friday, OK, what did I learn from that? And how will I take what I learned into
the next experiment that you’re going to try?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Another way is, we’ve all had successes too in our lives.
Some successes, some smaller, some bigger. Keep a piece of paper around where
you can go look at it with all your successes on it. Things that went right in
your life, and ask yourself, why did it go right, and what are you proud of, so
you get into that attitude again. Any trick that you can think of that will
play with your brain to get you back on track again. And we can all think up a
zillion things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We always want people to be totally sincere in their
comments about us, or their compliments about us, but sometimes it doesn’t hurt
to go ask your wife, or someone you trust, tell me something I did good, will
you? Pat me on the back, will you? I need it today. It’s OK, right, to ask for
things that you need. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;That’s all. It’s just not taking it too seriously. You know,
most of the things that we make mistakes on are not catastrophic mistakes,
where somebody has died. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(112, 48, 160);"&gt;Looking back over the years, Behar sees numerous keys to
his success. &amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I think number one would be my family. That I had a unique
opportunity as a child, as a young child. My father was fifty when I was born.
He had a little mom and pop grocery store. A little ten unit apartment above
it. He opened the store before the depression. And I had the opportunity to see
him work. And I also had the opportunity to have my own little chewing gum
stand out in front of the store. So I understood early on and developed that
entrepreneurial spirit. Because I was around it. Not everybody gets that
opportunity. Most people don’t. So it was a place that I was really
comfortable. That’s number one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Second thing is, I had a brother and sister that were quite
a bit older than I was, and my parents were quite old when they had me, so I
was always around adults. And because I was the baby, there was just total
acceptance of me. Howie could do no wrong, almost, at one level. Had some
pluses and minuses to that. But Howie could do no wrong. There was just lots of
confidence in me. And aunts and uncles and whatever it was, there was just a
tremendous amount of love and affection. So that developed me emotionally with
a positive feeling about myself, for the most part. And not always, but I think
that was critical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Second thing. I worked in my family’s businesses for a
while, my brother and my brother-in-law, but I had this desire to do something
on my own. So I went out into the work world, and I had a series of teachers,
mentors, we call them, along the way. And I was thirsty for knowledge. I wanted
to be really good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Where that came from, I don’t know. Probably had a lot to do
with, I wanted to be acc – all that love and affection I had in my family, I
wanted that to continue on, right? So the way I got it was being curious.
Because people would see that and say, he he’s curious, I want to spend time
teaching him. And so a series of one after the other people that helped me, and
taught me. In many different styles and many different ways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So I think that was really critical.
Really critical in my life. Having an opportunity to learn from others. And to
have enough awareness that it was important, and to be searching it out. I was
always searching it out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And then I had one significant mentor, a guy named Jim
Jensen, that really started asking me questions that I never asked myself. I
was working in the home furnishings industry at the time, and he was the
president of this company, and one day he asked me, Howard, is it furniture you
love or is it people? And it took me a while, longer than you would think, to
come to the conclusion, no, it’s people that I love. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;That was a turning point
in my life. Absolute turning point in my life. Because then, instead of being
just a student of furniture, I became a student of myself, which was first and
foremost the thing we need to do. I really started to be very introspective,
and asked myself questions, and read and study, and I’d get every self-help
book that was around, and I was looking at all this stuff, and going to
seminars and doing all this stuff, and at the same time learning about others.
What other people like. What motivates them? How do they live their lives? Why
do they live their lives that way? How are they different than I am? Why are
they different than I am? What have their lives been like? What have their
families been like? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And I got very interested in that. Not just for the
learning, but because I thought it would make me a better human being, and a
better student of other people, but I was curious about other people and their
experiences. And I learned from those experiences. So it was kind of a double
benefit. That one guy, with that one question, had just huge impact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And I think the other thing, not having a formal education,
I had to be a lot humbler. I wasn’t a Harvard grad. I couldn’t say, look at
this piece of paper. I knew inside of me that I had to pick up the cigarette
butts. I saw my dad do it, and everybody else in my family, so I knew that it
was OK. It wasn’t beneath me. But I became the best cigarette butt picker-upper
there ever was. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And so learning to pick up the cigarette butts – I would
take jobs that other people thought I shouldn’t, because I thought I could do
it. And I was always open to opportunity because of that. I saw opportunities
that other people didn’t see, and I was willing to take – I had lots of
failures, what you would call failures. At 44 years old, I had $140,000 to my
name. That was it. Total. Including my home equity. Everything. I had lost a
million dollars in a business I had invested in, became president of, so we
were starting over again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;But I knew I only had one way of doing things. I had
to pick up cigarette butts. I had to do things that other people thought may
not be so wise. Going to work for this little coffee company. Who the hell is
going to pay three bucks for a cup of coffee? Right? And I just looked at it
and said, I don’t know where this is headed, quite, but I loved the business. I
loved what the possibilities were. I didn’t know. I just finally settled in and
said I was going to do something I absolutely love to do, and I love coffee, so
it was easy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(112, 48, 160);"&gt;For Behar, part of the key to a successful and happy life
is simply learning to say yes. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We grow up. We’re little children. We’re babies. We’re ten
months old, or eleven months old. We learn to crawl. Everything is interesting
to us at that time. There is nothing that doesn’t. We look and – I mean, if
you’ve ever watched a baby, they’re looking all the time. The ultimate
attention deficit in a baby, right? Because they don’t hold on to a view of
something very long. They’re looking all the time. We’re always trying to
figure out something we can grab, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We’re eleven months old, and we’re up
on our knees, and we’re headed across the living room, and headed to the
cocktail table. And in the middle of the cocktail table is this beautiful
crystal vase with a nice flower in it. And we’re headed there and we get to the
table, and we reach up with one hand and we pull ourselves up on our feet,
because it’s the only way we can stand, and we go to reach across to grab that
little vase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And from the corner of the room comes this loud yell or scream –
with love – no! Don’t touch that. And that’s the beginning of the process of
human beings – and it’s in any language, by the way – coming to think that no
is the most powerful word in the English language, or any language. Because
it’s used by others to influence our behavior all the time, things that we do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;First and foremost it becomes with our parents. Second, we
go to school and it’s not just no the word, but no, you’re not capable. I’m not
just using the literal word no. A teacher writes on your first little paper all
the things that you did wrong. That becomes a no, you’re not good enough. Not
that they shouldn’t correct the paper, but the idea of finding things that are
right, more important than finding things that are wrong. Because we all
gravitate towards that which makes us feel better. All of us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So then we go get our first job, and we go to work and we’ve
got this manual. And it’s got all the things that you should do or you
shouldn’t do. A bunch of little no’s in there, right? So we go to serve a
customer. We’re excited to go to work because now we’re an adult, and now we
get to exercise our inalienable rights. And somebody comes and asks us, can you
do xyz, and what’s the first word out of your mouth? No. We can’t do that. And
you realize that you have arrived. Because now you can say no. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So I just believe that yes is much more powerful. And I
think that we can teach our children about yes much earlier than we do. And we
can create a society of yes, which means a society of support, a society of
caring, a society of hope, of teaching. And like the guy that wrote the One
Minute Manager, he says the key is to catch people doing the right things
right, which are giant yeses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(112, 48, 160);"&gt;Recognizing that the one thing we each have control over
is our own thoughts and actions, I asked Behar for some thoughts on creating a
personal culture of yes in our own lives. &amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Well, all of us have what I call my little board of
directors that sit on my shoulders. There’s always four, five or six of them
sitting and talking to me all the time. As I sit here talking to you, they’re
talking to me. They have a hard time getting through now. But it’s finding one
of those voices that is saying yes to you. Saying yes, you’re ok. Yes, you’ll
be all right. Yes to others. And listening to that voice more than you listen
to the no voice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Because we all have those little no voices sitting on our
shoulders too. And I think it’s recognizing it. Whenever you hear yourself say
the word no, or your actions act like no to others, to your children, to you
significant other, to the people that you work with – whatever it happens to be
– or even no to yourself, is a good time to ask yourself, is that really what I
want to do? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;It’s the same little exercise that you have to do. You’ve got to be
listening to the voices and rejecting the ones that don’t suit you at the time.
I mean, sometimes there is no. I understand that. If I’m busy, and I just can’t
do something, I’ll be out of town. I may not say no, I might say I can’t do it
right now, this week, but I’m open to another week, or it’s just not something
I want to do. That’s OK. I’m not talking about that. I’m not talking about yes
to everything, we’ve got to please every other person. That’s not my point
here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;It’s kind of the yes, how we live our lives, how we are of service to
others, and how we learn. So I think it’s the same thing. How do we do that? By
letting those little voices talk, and when the no one comes out at an inappropriate
time, ask yourself the question, is that appropriate now? Anything that serves
you to just get it up top. Bring it up top. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;To bring those two concepts that we talked about before
together, listening to your little voices and dealing with all those things, I
think one of the things that I like about getting older is that you start to
live long enough where you recognize those voices, or you recognize your
feelings very quickly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So I wake up in the morning, and I may have a grey day. I
don’t know why it’s a grey day. It’s just grey. It could be bright sun and 70
degrees in Palm Springs, and I’m just feeling terrible. Sometimes it’s
physical, but it’s just mental. Maybe it’s a little depression for that day, or
whatever it happens to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Now I recognize it so quickly. Ohh. Grey day. What’s
up? I talk to myself like that. Sometimes out loud. Sometimes people think I’m
a little looney. But sometimes, just the voice, what’s up? What’s going on with
you today? Why are you feeling the way you’re feeling? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And sometimes I know,
sometimes I don’t. But what happens is, as soon as I start asking myself the
questions, it starts to dissipate. I say to myself, it’s OK. You don’t have to
be up today. Once I do that, it’s amazing what happens. And what’s so crazy
about it now even, I can feel the physical difference in my brain, in my body.
It’s amazing. I can almost feel the lightness starting to take over. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Never
could do that when I was young. It’s a great advantage. I probably could have
learned it. I did some meditation when I was young, but I don’t remember – I’ve
read a lot and all that, I don’t remember anybody talking to me about it in
that context. And it’s the same with the yes. When your instinct, or something
says to say no, ask yourself a question. Is that really what you want to do
right now, and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(112, 48, 160);"&gt;As&amp;nbsp;parting
question, I asked Behar what gives him hope. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;People like you give me hope. Young people. There are some
people in organizations that want you to believe that there’s no hope. And
usually it’s because they’re trying to gain some kind of power to influence
what’s going on, and so they intentionally find everything that’s wrong because
it’s in their interest to do so. It’s part of a political campaign. Everybody
that’s gained power in a country, from time, probably, immemorial, from Hugo
Chavez, he creates hopelessness on one level that somebody’s at fault, oh this
is terrible, to our political parties that do exactly the same thing when
they’re running for office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;But when you really look underneath it all, they’re wrong.
They’re just trying to use that to gain something. There’s so much hope to
change things. Look what we’ve accomplished in this world. Look from between
1900 and 2000, life expectancy has gone up by 70% in this country and in a lot
of places around the world. As many poor people as there may be in the world,
incomes are rising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;If you went to Singapore in 1948, it was abject poverty.
You go to Singapore today, sixty years later, and you see a country that’s
risen. Highly educated people, integrated society. And that’s just one place. It’s
going on all around us. Things are happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Do we still have wars? Do we
still do stupid things as human beings? You bet we do. We always will. But
after that happens, things change and we find a new way to do things. Look
what’s going on, environmental movement. Lots of great things are happening.
Whether the world is coming to an end with all this, or whether we had anything
to do with all this stuff – sure, we probably had some. I don’t think we’re
quite as powerful as we like to think, but the point is, we can make positive
changes whether any of that stuff is true or not. We don’t need to put this
stuff in the air, and have all these bad things that we have, right? We don’t.
That gives me hope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I see all these young people growing, challenging the status
quo. The advent of the internet. As much negative stuff as there can be on
there, it’s a tool for great progress, because all of a sudden the world is
opened up. Now, transparency is the word of the day. If something bad happens
in a little corner of Beijing, somebody gets it on their cell phone and it’s
around the world in fifteen minutes. That gives me hope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So I’m hopeful. Always. Why not? &lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As I read Howard Behar's new book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591841925/curtrosengren-20"&gt;It's Not About the Coffee&lt;/a&gt;, I found myself thinking, &amp;quot;Hey!
What's he been doing inside my brain?&amp;quot; So many of the ideas he talks
about align directly with the ideas I focus on in my work, my blog, and this
podcast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When&amp;nbsp; Behar joined Starbucks in 1989, it was a small regional company with only 28 stores. Today, there are thousands of stores worldwide. While coffee obviously plays an important role in the company, for Behar it has always been about the people. And his single-minded commitment to &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; it about the people provided a key ingredient in Starbucks' growth and success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen to this podcast and hear Behar's insights on: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How living an authentic, &amp;quot;one-hat&amp;quot; life contributes to both happiness and success. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to do the groundwork for living that authentic life. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How investing in self-exploration helped Behar recognize Starbucks as the perfect opportunity for him. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;His own vision of a successful life. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first of two podcast featuring Behar. In the next podcast, he talks about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ways to overcome fears and doubts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The value of celebrating failure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The keys to his success. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating a culture of, &amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;Hello, and welcome to Curt Rosengren’s
M.A.P. Maker Podcast. I’m Curt Rosengren, and my focus is helping people create
careers that energize and inspire them. It’s all about answering the question,
how do you put your passion to work to make a difference that inspires you, in
a way that lets you thrive? &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;In this series, you will find insights
and inspiration from thought leaders and trailblazers – people who are crafting
a life of Meaning, Abundance, and Passion. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;Today’s podcast is the first of a
two-part series featuring Howard Behar, former president of Starbucks
International and Starbucks North America, and author of the book, “It’s Not
About the Coffee: Leadership Principles from a Life at Starbucks.” &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;When Behar joined Starbucks in 1989,
there were a grand total of 28 stores. Over the years, he left an indelibly
positive mark on the company’s people-centric culture. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;I have a friend who worked for Behar
at Starbucks back in the 90’s. When I mentioned I was going to interview him,
she made a comment that said a lot about his legacy there. “People didn’t
follow Howard because he had authority,” she said. “People followed him because
they loved him.” &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;“It’s Not About the Coffee” is a book
that shares some of the ideas that made Behar so effective. It’s also a book
that almost never got written. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;Well, I never
saw myself as a writer of books – actually as a writer of anything. And there
were two women that I worked with inside of Starbucks. One was the head of
marketing for the international business, when we first started international.
And the other one was a consultant. And they kept pestering me after I retired
to write all this stuff down that I talk about. And I kept telling them, I’m an
in the dirt guy. I do it, and I’m conscious about what I do, and I teach it
really well. But I never saw myself as writing it down. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;Over a period
of about a couple years I finally said, OK, if you’re so interested in it, you
write it. You can interview me and other people and get the stuff down. So they
did. They started the process. And then about half way in it, they were doing
other things and they lost the energy, and I was hooked. Because it was
interesting. It was forcing me to think about the things that I said a lot more
than – when you just talk, talk’s cheap, as they say. Right? &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;So I had to
start thinking about it. OK, what do I really mean here? And why do those words
come out of my mouth, and how do they fit on a piece of paper, and how do I get
my energy into the writing, and how does &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt;
voice come out here, versus just a book about some nebulous ideas that are
certainly not new. So it became fun, and interesting. And so I got hooked on it
and moved forward on it. And I think at the end of the day I realized that I
was writing a book for myself, as a reminder of the things that I valued and
what mattered to me. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;I’m not a
super-intelligent guy. I learn things in paragraphs. And I find something that
fits me and I latch onto it and I make it mine in some way. I kind of dig
deeper around. So this book kind of is my life through the lessons that I’ve
learned. I mean it’s got the Starbucks logo on the cover, and it says It’s Not
About the Coffee – those are all hooks, of course, to get people interested in
the book, because everybody’s interested in Starbucks. But the truth is, almost
all the stuff in there comes from sixty-three years of living. From mistakes
and from successes and from failures and from pain and from happiness and joy
and fun and agony. Everything. It’s all in there. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;As Behar sees it, people are going to
be happiest and most successful if they align what they do with who they really
are. It’s a level of personal authenticity he calls it one-hat living, wearing
the hat that really fits you and not changing hats based on what you think
others expect. As so often happens in life, he discovered the importance of
one-hat living by doing the opposite.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;I learned the
lesson early on in my career. I was working for a company called Grantree
Furniture Rental. I was living in Portland, Oregon. I got promoted to Vice
President. It was the first time I ever became an officer of a company. And I
was so excited, and I remember calling my mom and saying, you won’t believe
this. And told my wife. It was just a big deal when you’re young. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;And so here I
am thinking I’m the world’s greatest, and one day I’m sitting at the elevator
and the chairman of the board / CEO comes up to me and says, we’re glad you’re
here and glad we were able to promote you and, now that you’re an officer I
want to give you some feedback. And he said, you know Howard, I’ve watched you
a lot, and you’re so passionate about everything you believe in. You always are
wearing your feelings on your sleeve. And I said, yeah, that’s true. I’ve
always been kind of recognized for that. I was outspoken. I said what I thought.
&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;And he said,
you know, now that you’re an officer, you’ve got to rethink who you are and how
you act. Oh, man! Here’s the chairman of the board – I just get promoted, I’m
two weeks into this job and we’re standing at the elevator and he’s coaching me
on who I am. And I went home that night and I was talking to my wife and I
said, you know, I’ve got to adjust. I don’t know what to do here.&amp;nbsp; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;I made some
conscious decisions. You ever hear that expression, sitting on your hands? I’d
go to meetings, and I would literally and physically sit on my hands as a
reminder to shut up. I’d create little signs. Honest-to-god, I’d write it in
little small type so nobody else could see it, and I’d say, Howard, shut up,
and I’d have them in front of me. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;And it
started to make me anxious. And the anxiety started to come out in bending
paper clips. And, oh, that’s expensive bending paper clips, so I started
tearing up little pieces of paper, and I’d roll them up and throw them under
the table. People could always tell how stressful the meeting had been by the
pile of paper. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;About six
months went by and somebody I had worked with, somebody who had been my
advocate to be an officer of the company, came to me and said, Howard, what
happened to you? We’re not getting out of you what we thought we were going to
get, which was this outspoken partner and everything. And I related the story
about Walker Trace and what he had said to me, and he said, you’ve got to fix
that. You can’t live like that. And he was right, I couldn’t. I had started to
do the same thing in other parts of my life. Because I thought, well, OK, if
it’s not working here, then maybe it’s not working at home, and I started
putting on figuratively different hats for everybody that I came into contact
with, trying to moderate my behavior and be what I thought they wanted me to
be. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;Finally it
just blew up. I couldn’t deal with it. I went to Walker and I said, this isn’t
working for me. I can’t do what you want me to do. I’m driving myself nuts.
Which was hard, because that was a big deal, that promotion, and going to the
chairman of the board and telling him that I can’t do – I said, maybe you’ve
got the wrong guy. And we had a great conversation and he kind of loosened up,
and I went back to being what I was. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;I realized at
that point in time what I was trying to do, and then I thought to myself, how
many times had I done that to somebody else, shut them down? Maybe not in the
same way that Walker had. I just made a vow at that point in time – and I was
about 28 at the time, 29 – I said, I’m never doing that again. People are going
to take me like I am. And that’s where the one hat came from. And I coined the
term in my head as one hat, you know, wearing my hat, and being who I was. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;Behar offered some ideas on laying the
groundwork for a one-hat life.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;One-hat
living is being totally in synch with who you are as a human being. And it
takes work, right? You’ve got to be thinking about, what are your values? What
matters to you? How do you want to live your life? Even when you’re young, what
do you want to leave behind fifty years from now? It’s so far out there in the
future for young people. It’s hard for all of us when we’re young to think like
that, but you need to start thinking about that. And how you want to treat other
people. How you want to be treated. And you’ve got to write those things down,
because if you don’t, then it’s just talk. And they’re not written in stone
just because you write them down, but it’s kind of like painting a picture of
yourself in words. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;When you put
all these words together and they paint a picture of yourself, then you should
be looking for things to do, places to work, wherever you’re going to live your
life, your significant other in your life, that fit with that. Because that’s
how you’re going to have a happy, productive life. If you’re constantly in
conflict with your values and how you live your life, where they don’t match
with each other, it’s a recipe for disaster in life. You will see problems, and
you will have problems, and you will be unhappy. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;Figure out
who you are. Live your life according to that. You’ll change, and you re-write,
right? Your life is a work of art. You’re always adding colors or taking away a
little bit, or if it’s music you’re always adding a few notes or taking out a
few notes. Or if you’re writing a book, you’re always re-writing a chapter,
even after the book is done. So that’s what one-hat living is about. It’s just
being in tune with yourself. And it takes work. It is not easy. It is not easy,
and you’ve got to just have the patience to do it. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;We spend more time planning vacation
than we do planning our lives and who we are. And we need to spend the time. Go
take a weekend. Go take a day. Go someplace where you’re totally – wherever it
is that you are relaxed, whether it’s by the sea, or in the mountains, if it’s
in your home, or wherever it is – and just start writing things down. What do
you like in life? And there’s all sorts of good – if you want a formal process,
there’s great formal processes that you can go get books on. But you don’t even
have to have that. Just go write down things that matter to you. Spend that
time. If there’s one thing, a gift you’re going to give yourself as a human
being, sit down, spend the time, and think about yourself. What matters to you?
What do you like in life? What do you dislike in life? What are your values? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;So I think
it’s taking the time to understand who you are, writing it down. Like I said,
painting a picture with words of who you are, goals that you have, what you
want to be, what you want to learn, what you want to accomplish. All that
stuff. How much money you want to earn, what kind of house do you want to live
in, what’s your spiritual life going to be like, what do you want to introduce
your children to? What kind of marriage do you want? How do you want to spend
your off time? How much time? Is work important to you, or is it more important
to go skiing? All that stuff matters. Why should we live our lives not thinking
about and living according to our plan? So it’s important where you choose to
go to work. If you like to be in a place that doesn’t have a lot of rules and
regulations, you’ve got to write that down. Why shouldn’t we think about those
things before we take a job? &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;I think we
spend so much time living, right, that we don’t take a little time for thinking
and planning. And I think that if you do that, then a picture of you starts to
develop that you can actually look at. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;And that
really helps you in terms of focusing on the things that you want to do and not
getting caught up in the heat of the moment.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;It’s not just an abstract philosophy
for Behar. He points out how taking his own advice and doing the deep
self-exploration helped him recognize the Starbucks opportunity as a perfect
fit. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;Lynn and I, about every two years we
go away and we go away and we have what we call the Behar family retreat, a
little planning session. And we each go into separate rooms and we write down
the things, our goals for ourselves as individuals in probably eight or nine
different areas. Spiritual, material, children, travel, whatever it happens to
be. Career, charitable, all those things. And we come back and we present to
each other. And then we have a couples deal, what we want our marriage to be
like. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;So if you go back into my area and
look at the goals that I had, and you look at Starbucks, boom, right there.
Almost seamless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;I wanted to
work in a company where people got to vote. That’s where the person sweeps the
floor should choose the broom came from. A company where everybody participated
in the equity. Long before I went to Starbucks. I sat down with Howard Schultz,
we’re talking about those things, and he says, this is the things I believe in.
I’m thinking to myself, did he read my notes? I knew the place I wanted to be. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;I’m just
going to do it again in a week. Lynn and I are going to Hawaii, and the primary
purpose outside a little R&amp;amp;R time and to give a speech for a couple
companies in Hawaii is to re-look at my life. Who am I today? What do I want to
accomplish? Have my values changed? Is there anything that’s changed in me? Are
my goals changing? What does my next five to ten years look like? Because I
need it now. I’m feeling uncomfortable. Most of the things I feel innately,
they feel good, but I’m uncomfortable that I haven’t spent the time working on
it, seeing, does it fit, and being really intentional. Now my intuition is
working for me, but it’s not enough. For me, anyway. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;For Behar, being aligned with who he is,
what he wants to do, and how he wants to be isn’t just a nice-to-have luxury,
it’s a vital piece of the mix. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;So here was
this little company, Starbucks. 28 stores. I had been a customer for almost
seventeen years. I loved the coffee. It was like, from the day I got in there,
it was just the magic fit. Just like somebody had put a glove on my hand, and
it was sewn so perfectly to my hand that you could see every wrinkle and
everything, and it just fit. It was so comfortable. And to me that’s always been
what’s important, is the place I worked, I had to be totally aligned with the
values of the organization. Primarily how we treated each other, how we treated
the people we worked with, how we treated the people we served. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;And then what
we did. I tend to need to be around things that are more social in nature that
involve people, and creativity, and creative goods or something like that. And
when those things are in a line – the values, my values, and the product – it’s
like it’s effortless. It doesn’t mean it’s without pain, or there isn’t agony,
or the decisions aren’t tough, or all that stuff. But everything is fairly
clear. And my life is seamless. When it’s not like that, my life is pure hell.
And no matter how much money I made, if I wasn’t aligned with what the values
of the organization was, I was miserable. And that just seems to be how I’ve
had to live my life. It was about keeping peace in my brain. About being one
with myself. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;While he has definitely found success
in his career, for Behar the standard measures of success have always been
secondary. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;And a lot of
people hope and wish for stuff, whether it’s material things, or great
recognition, which can be in the form of a promotion to an officer like I was.
And once you’re there you start to realize how meaningless it is. It’s just
like having things. You’re sitting in a beautiful place here, but I grew up in
a 900 square foot house. I was just as happy then as I am now. Do I like this?
Yeah, you bet I do. This is nice. But I can tell you tomorrow I could leave
this place, wouldn’t even think about it. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;But the truth
of the matter is even when I had nothing materially, I still had to have the
other. I had to be in tune with myself, and that’s where I had peace. Whether I
went and bought a used sofa and bricks for a bookcase, which I did for a lot of
my life, it didn’t make any difference as long as I was happy doing what I was
doing. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;Hell, I was
43 years old, or 44 when I went to work at Starbucks. Lynn and I between us had
$140,000 to our name. I had worked in the corporate thing, I lost a lot of money
in a business I had been in. We had a nice house we were making payments on. We
said, let’s get out of here. We don’t need this. And I went, and we took the
$140,000 and we bought $132,000 house. At the time you could buy a house for
$132,000. Put $70,000 of the $140,000 down because I could afford so much a
payment, I think five or six hundred a month. I took the other $70,000 and I
invested, when I got the invitation to join Starbucks, and I put it in
Starbucks when it was a private little company. I didn’t know what was going to
happen, but I always needed a piece of the action. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;I said to
Howard, what can you afford to pay me? He gave me a number. And I said, fine,
and it was a third of what I had been making. And I said to Lynn, we’re going
to have to just cut back. I had two kids, one going to college at that time,
one wasn’t even living with us but came to live with us at that time, and we
figured it out. We just cut our lifestyle. It didn’t matter. We still had the
same friends. But I had to do what I loved to do. I had to do something that
had meaning. It just didn’t make any difference. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;The title of Behar’s book is, “It’s
Not About the Coffee,” which is to say, “It’s About the People.” That might
well have been the title of his career as well. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;Somebody
asked me probably the single most important question that I’ve ever been asked.
It was a mentor of mine, and I reported directly to him. It was in the
furniture business, and the question was, Howard, is it furniture you love, or
is it people you love? You would think that would be an easy question to
answer, because furniture is just an inanimate object, but I’d been in it so
long, and I loved the process of it and the creativity of it, it took me a
while, about a week. I kept going back and forth thinking about it. And one
morning I woke up and I said, Howard, you dummy. Of course you know what you
love. You love people. So from that moment forward, that was in my
mid-twenties, I tried to become a conscious competent about myself. That was a
journey. And about people, about understanding people. And I need to have a lot
of human interaction. I need lots of conversation. I love to be coached, from
superiors, or from people that report to me – I don’t care who’s giving me the
information, who’s helping me to be a better person, I love it. I love to read
all about it. Anything to do with human beings, I’m interested in, in our
journey. So that’s why I love work, and that’s what’s turned me on this whole
time. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;Now on top of
that, I love the creative aspects of work. The product, or the services. I love
puzzles. And I’m a capitalist pig. I admit it. I love – I grew up in retail. My
dad had a little mom and pop grocery store. When I was six years old, out in
front of the store with this orange crates and a little cash drawer, and I
would sell gum – that I would steal from my dad, of course, because I had zero
cost of product. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;Then I come
to Starbucks. Here I am, out of work. I’m trying to figure out what I’m going
to do with my life. I’d been president of a land development company, a
recreational land development company that failed, and I was trying to figure
out what I wanted to do when I grew up. Lynn and I had long conversations about
it. She was working at Group Health, she was a clinical social worker in
oncology, and I said, you know, I’m forty-four. Who knows? We’ve got to start
saving money for retirement, but I’ve got to do what I love to do, and I’ve got
to find that kind of thing. I tried to buy my own business a few times. It
didn’t work out. And then I meet Howard Schultz. A guy named Jeff Brotman, who
was on the board, and here was this little tiny coffee company that I had been
a customer of. I never thought about going to work there, you know. And I
turned right, and developed a relationship with Howard, and like I said, from
day one it was like a glove that fit my hand. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;There’s
something about coffee. It’s just mystical. It’s not just coffee. It’s much
more than that. You go into a Starbucks store – you don’t even have to go into
a Starbucks. In the morning I get up and I have that cup of coffee and I read
the newspaper. There’s something about the taste of it, and the warmth in my
hands, and when it’s really good, it just makes you feel good. It just is
additive to life, and that’s the way I always saw Starbucks. I saw Starbucks as
a human experience. Even though it was a coffee company, or product, I always
thought of it as a human company. That’s why we named the book, “It’s Not About
the Coffee.” It’s about the people. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;There was a
lot of consternation in the company – when I first joined Starbucks, there was
this little handbook that all companies have. Didn’t say a word about people
till like page eight or nine. It was all about the coffee, and its commitment
to the coffee. Well, coffee’s important. It’s our art, our music, literature,
whatever. It’s where we express our creativity. People make all of it happen.
And if you go into a Starbucks today, it’s about people. When we are
successful, we do that well. When we fail, we do that poorly.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;While important, loving what he does
has been only part of the equation. For Behar, it has also been about the
difference he has been able to make in people’s lives. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;You know,
Starbucks, when we were young, you know every organization works on mission statements
and all sorts of things. We had this guy name Jim Collins who wrote a book
called Built to Last. And in the book there’s a concept that he has called a BHAG,
a big hairy audacious goal. And a big hairy audacious goal is defined as
something that’s waaay bigger than yourself. It’s a goal that unifies the
organization and is meaningful. And at Starbucks it goes like this: “To be one
of the most well known and respected organizations in the world, known for
nurturing and inspiring the human spirit.” Known for nurturing and inspiring
the human spirit. That last one – known for nurturing and inspiring the human
spirit – that put definition to everything that I have wanted to accomplish in
my life. It happened to be Starbucks. I was part of that process, but it was
everybody doing it, from baristas to store managers to everybody. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;So when I
look back at my life twenty or thirty years from now and I’m in some nursing
home someplace and they have a television in front of me with a continuous loop of University of Washington
Husky football wins, and I think I’m watching new games all the time, I’ll know
that my life has been fulfilled. I will have had a successful life when
somebody says that about me. That he truly nurtured and inspired other people
to be all they could be. And that is it. That is it. I get everything out of
that. I get everything out of that. It just fulfills my life. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;I asked him what difference it made
when he had that.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;Well, it just
puts me in synch with everything. If I act in that way, I have peace that’s
unbelievable. I sleep. I go to bed easy. I feel like, when I’ve helped somebody
in a day, if they’ve had something they’ve been dealing with, or if they just
wanted an ear, maybe they don’t want any solutions, they just want an ear, and
they’ve gone away and they’ve said thank you, you could have just handed me a
check for ten million bucks. It just goes through my body. The feeling is
unbelievable. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Want a peek behind the scenes at a book publishing company that's out to make the world a better place, one book at a time? Well here's a podcast for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself drawn to books about ways to improve your life, your work, and the world at large, chances are you have some books published by &lt;a href="http://www.bkconnection.com/"&gt;Berrett-Koehler Publishers&lt;/a&gt; on your bookshelf. Berrett-Koehler is an independent publishing company whose books promote positive change on an individual, organizational, and societal level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paid a visit to Steve Piersanti, Berrett-Koehler's founder, President and Publisher, on a recent trip to San Francisco. While I was there, I had a chance to get a glimpse of an &amp;quot;author day,&amp;quot; when the author of a soon-to-be-launched book comes in to the office for a day of connecting with all those involved, from book design to marketing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really impressed with both the company's philosophy of business and the way Piersanti's values have been such a strong beacon in his career path. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listen to this podcast and learn:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How Piersanti turned lemons into lemonade after standing up for his values and getting fired in the process. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How Berrett-Koehler has built success on a collaborative, stakeholder approach to doing business. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Why Piersanti thinks a solid understanding of your values is a key to success.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Piersanti's advice for non-fiction authors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;Hello, and
welcome to Curt Rosengren’s M.A.P. Maker Podcast. I’m Curt Rosengren, and my
focus is helping people create careers that energize and inspire them. It’s all
about answering the question, how do you put your passion to work to make a
difference that inspires you, in a way that lets you thrive. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;In this series,
you will find insights and inspiration from thought leaders and trailblazers –
people who are crafting a life of Meaning, Abundance, and Passion. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;Today’s podcast
features Steve Piersanti, Founder, President and Publisher of Berrett-Koehler
Publishing, a San Francisco-based company whose books promote positive change
on an individual, organizational, and societal level. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;Piersanti’s
first job out of college was as an ad copy writer with Jossey-Bass Publishers.
He stayed for thirteen years, eventually serving as the company’s president.
From there, he went on to found Berrett-Koehler. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;His publishing
career started quite by accident while he was still in college. After hearing a
discussion in an honors program about the lack of student scholarship, he
decided to launch a student scholarly journal. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;He soon
discovered that, with a monthly publishing schedule, he had bitten off more
than he could chew. Between the magazine, his classes, and his job, something
had to give. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;So we worked
all summer getting the first issue out in September, and by the time we hit
that we realized the next issue was due to press, and it ended up being a full
time job, just trying to run this monthly scholarly journal, or magazine. And I
ended up having to drop all my classes, because I just couldn’t keep up with my
classwork and run this magazine. I was also working, trying to support myself,
so I just couldn’t do everything. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Dropped all my classes and was busy publishing this, an
issue a month, and then I was shocked when five or six months after I dropped
all my classes I lost my scholarship. I had a full ride scholarship, and I was
a dropout. I had violated the terms of this contract, and I was thinking, wait
a second, this doesn’t seem quite right. But I realized that I was having more
fun, and learning more than anything I was doing in any of my classes, and so
that’s what I really ought to go into was publishing. I did manage to get some
credit for this experience, and took some independent study classes and
graduated even though I lost my scholarship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;But I decided I should be going into publishing and then I
started looking around for publishing jobs, ended up taking one at Jossey-Bass
Publishers in San Francisco – this was 1977. I started out as an entry level
advertising copywriter, and ended up becoming a marketing director, and then an
editor and an editorial director, and finally moved into general management and
ended up being president of Jossey-Bass, left there in 1991, and founded
Berrett-Koehler in 1992. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the heart of building
Berrett-Koehler was a determination to take a different, more collaborative
approach than the one typically seen in the publishing industry. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Well, Jossey-Bass was acquired in 1989 by Robert Maxwell who
was a media baron, chief rival to Rupert Murdoch at the time. He at the same
time acquired McMillan Publishing Company and he made Jossey-Bass a division of
McMillan. So we were now reporting to a New York company, my boss was in New
York City, and I quickly found out – I was the CEO of Jossey-Bass at this time.
I quickly found out that the only thing that mattered was what the corporate
office in New York City said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;They were Johny-come-lately’s, they had only been involved
with the company for a few months, and they had added zero value to the
company. There was nothing that they did or had done that created any value in
terms of our success as a publ – we were already a highly successful publishing
company. Very profitable, very high reputation, quality work. And we had authors
that had been with us from the beginning. We had employees who had been with us
from the beginning. We had suppliers we had been working with from the
beginning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Nothing else mattered. Only the directive from the corporate
office. Something was wrong with that picture. At that point I realized that
the model for a publishing company in particular, or corporations in general,
something wasn’t right. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So in starting Berrett-Koehler, the objective was to create
a company where all of the stakeholders who contributed value to the company
all had more of a role, an involvement in the running of the company, in the
decisions about the company, in the ownership of the company. In all aspects of
the company. So that’s what we’ve tried to do with Berrett-Koehler, where our
ownership is spread out among all of our different stakeholder groups –
employees, authors, service providers, suppliers, sales partners, colleagues in
publishing – and where there’s high involvement, for example of authors in
decisions about their books. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;For example, the author day that you’ve just come to is an
example of that. This whole day – what you’ve seen is just a lunch, but
actually the whole day is devoted to launching the book. And so it starts out
with editorial meetings, then designer production meetings, then lunch where
the author speaks to the entire staff, and then sales and marketing meetings,
and then more editorial meetings. And the objective is to make it a more
collaborative process, and more of a balance of power an involvement among all
the parties. So that was the concept of founding Berrett-Koehler, and it’s
worked out very well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He sees numerous
benefits to that collaborative approach.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Well, it’s a better experience for authors in the sense that
they – many authors, if you talk to authors, probably nine out of ten of them
have big issues with their publishers, or they’re very unhappy with their
publisher. That’s much less the case with Berrett-Koehler. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The authors will tell you that they’re treated like
nuisances. One best-selling author told me that he was treated by his publisher
as though he were a criminal. And it’s not that publishers are bad people, or
they’re incompetent, or anything like that. It’s just that the structures that
are set up, that are so just publisher-centric, instead of giving authors more
involvement, more of a role, more of a say, really drives it that way. Plus the
sheer volume of work, the sheer amount that you’re trying to keep on top of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So in our case, where we put so much emphasis on creating
structures and attitudes and mechanisms for having a more author-friendly
publishing company, it pays off in terms of the authors’ feeling better about
the relationship, and it pays off in terms of their being a lot more
communication, which leads to good marketing follow-up happening. It leads to
better quality, we believe, in the publications. It leads to more involvement
by the community of the publisher and the authors all working together to get
the books out in the marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The company’s
collaborative philosophy came first, and the company’s editorial focus
developed naturally after that. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Well, of course, the original focus was the stakeholder
model, or the stewardship model, that the company needed to be operated in the
interest of all the stakeholder groups. And the role of the management was to
be stewards, accountable to and acting in the interest of all the stakeholder
groups. We found very early on that the kinds of books that we were most
attracting and that we were most attracted to were books that had a similar
sort of mindset. And so the orientation of the company came first, and then the
publishing orientation followed quickly thereafter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We believe that, in order to create a world that works for
all, change is needed at all levels. At the individual level, at the
organizational level, and at the societal level. And so we publish in each of
those areas. We publish books on personal growth, and individual development,
and careers, and work that are individual, which we call BK Life. We publish
books on organizational change, and management, and leadership, and socially
responsible business, which are called BK Business. And we publish books on
societal change, global and national change, which are called BK Currents. And
so those are the three main focuses of our publishing agenda. All of them are
informed by this creating a world that works for all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So even the books on the individual development, the
question there is not just how you can make the most money, or have the most
fun. It’s always, how can you live a life that’s in keeping with your values
and beliefs? How can you live a life that is going to be good for the world,
and that’s going to support integrity in your life and doing things that are
good for the world? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Same with organizations. The focus is not just on how you
can clobber the competition, or rack up bigger and bigger profits. It’s always,
how can the organization at the same time be a global citizen, practice ethics
and responsibility in your business, and be good for your employees and your
customers. It’s always this broad issue of every level, looking out for the
interests of the individual and the organization and society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He sees multiple
levels of positive impact coming from Berrett-Koehler’s work. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;One level of impact is simply publishing good books that
have provocative ideas in them, that have path-breaking ideas, that have new
ideas, and getting them out in the world, and those books having an impact on
hundreds, or thousands, or tens of thousands of organizations, individuals,
managers, entrepreneurs, activists and so on. The books themselves are a major
part of the impact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Second, simply by our trying to do things differently, all
the people that we interact with, that we touch in some way, whether it’s
authors, or service providers, or suppliers, or customers, we have some impact
simply by doing things differently with them. Setting up a different model. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And the third thing is we hope that our company is a model or
an inspiration for others that may hear this podcast, or may read about us in
magazine articles like the Motto article, and may choose to adopt some of the
things that we’re doing. We don’t view our distinctive practices as
proprietary. We would love it if all of our competitors started copying what
we’re doing. We don’t have any fear that that will actually happen, because
most, they’re just too different, or don’t have the culture to do it, or
something. But we would love it if part of our impact was that hundreds of
other companies started copying us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Piersanti,
sticking to his deeply held values has been a central theme woven throughout
his career. He points back to an early experience as one that started shaping
that path. A few months into his first job out of college, the company he
worked with moved offices. His boss decreed that everyone needed to come in on
a Sunday to get their offices in order so there would be no downtime on Monday.
Being forced to work on the weekend is never welcome news, but for Piersanti it
presented a deeper dilemma. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Now this was a problem for me, because of my religious
convictions I don’t work on Sunday. I never have. And so because of my
religious beliefs, I could not do this. Told the boss I couldn’t do it. He was
extremely upset. Felt that it was an act of insubordination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And here I am, the new kid on the block, first full time job
out of college, and vulnerable with a wife and a child, in a strange city a
long ways away from where I was going to school. But I made a decision, you
know, I have to stick by my values. I have to stick by what I believe, and so I
just didn’t comply. I didn’t come in on Sunday. In fact what I did do was I
came in early Monday morning, and because I was new I didn’t have all that much
stuff. I hadn’t accumulated as much as a lot of other people, and I was able to
get up and running within a couple of hours. But it was a critical decision
point for me, of what was going to drive me? Was I going to stick to my values
and beliefs or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;And so over the years, there were many other points where I
had to stick to what I believed in to show integrity. But that was kind of the
first one to set the course for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That early decision to
do what he believed was right set the tone for a values-based approach to decision
making that would ultimately spark the events that let him to found
Berrett-Koehler.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Later on – I mentioned about when Jossey-Bass became a part
of McMillan Publishing Company. In 1989, McMillan, at the instruction of Robert
Maxwell, sent out a – I got a call from my boss in New York City saying that
there was a corporate-wide workforce reduction going on, and that all units
within McMillan were required to reduce their head count by 10%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;At that point Jossey-Bass had sixty-eight employees, and he
told me that we would be required to reduce our head count to sixty. For a lot
of the New York units it wasn’t such a big deal because they had so much
turnover that if they just didn’t fill open positions, they would hit their head
count target. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We however had almost no turnover, so we would have had to
lay off eight people. There was no rhyme or reason for this. The company – we
had just finished a record breaking year in which our sales went up 22%, our
profits went up 46%. We had already been approved previous to this happening to
hire eight people, and now we were being told, no, you have to lay eight people
off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I refused to do that, and we met with our management and
decided we just could not go along with this, told New York this, they sent out
my boss and the VP of Human Resources to meet with us to work out how were we
going to cut out these people. We sent them back empty handed. Wouldn’t agree
to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Then I got summoned to New York City. I met in the Waldorf
Astoria Hotel with Mr. Robert Maxwell, who had the entire floor, and with the
President of McMillan Inc. and the President of McMillan Publishing, who were
three layers above me in the hierarchy. My boss was missing. They just skipped
him. And they gave me repeated ultimatums that I had to carry out this work
force reduction or resign, or I’d be fired. They made no argument that it made
any sense for our company. They just couldn’t have this little California unit
defying the corporate order. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I politely said I just could not do that. It was not the
right thing to do. It would not be good for the company. Flew back to
California. They arranged for my boss and the VP of Human Resources to come the
following Wednesday. I thought maybe they would come and try and work out some
kind of compromise. Instead, they showed up at 2:00 and I was immediately fired
and out the door. The strength to take that kind of position started much
earlier, with the decision I made earlier in my career. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The grapevine started working very quickly. The next day I
started getting phone calls from people who’d heard about this and were very
unhappy about it, from authors, and suppliers that Jossey-Bass had worked with,
encouraging me to start a new publishing company and offering to support it in
different ways. Authors offering to send their book projects. A group of
suppliers got together and offered to provide much of the infrastructure needed
to start a publishing company. Just on the basis of, not even a handshake, just
over the phone, offering to provide credit and so on. That’s how
Berrett-Koehler actually got started was all these people calling to encourage
me to do so and offering support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I asked Piersanti
what had been instrumental in his own and the company’s success, he pointed
once again to values. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Well, I think the number one thing is having a fairly clear
set of values and commitments of what do I stand for. What’s my view of what
matters in life, and the world, and in business? And then sticking with it
through thick and thin. Berrett-Koehler as a company, because of the changes
and challenges in the publishing industry, as well as mistakes that I and
others made in the company at times, various business mistakes, we’ve had many
challenging times too. But through all of that we’ve tried to stick to our
values, and have done a pretty good job of it. And not resorted, even when we
were struggling, to blaming other people, or creating a culture of distrust, or
one of fault-finding or that sort of thing. So I think the biggest key has
really been clarity of what you’re trying to do in the world and what your
values are and then sticking with it even when it’s not going as well as you
would hope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I couldn’t pass up
the opportunity to ask him if he had any advice for today’s aspiring authors. He
offered his take on the non-fiction publishing world. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;"&gt;Well, most of
the sales today are going to the authors’ own communities and to the
publisher’s community. In these realms of non-fiction, serious books, there’s
not much of a general market any more. The markets have become too glutted,
saturated, and so most of the sales are happening to the author’s own
community. So the advice is really for an author to be a) building up
communities of people that they work with, that they’re associated with, that they
belong to, that know them, that they know the people in the community, and then
publish books that are connected to those communities. Don’t try to publish
something that’s outside of your community. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After I did this
interview, I came home and started looking at my bookshelf. I was amazed to see
how much of what I am drawn to buying is published by Berrett-Koehler. The
books they publish have an inherent sense of hope and possibility. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I asked Piersanti
where he finds his sense of hope. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Well, one answer is simply my personal religious beliefs.
But beyond that, it’s getting to know, working with, benefiting from a lot of
other people who are talented, intelligent, deeply committed to what they’re
doing, and doing wonderful things. Simply seeing so many people who are doing
good, whether they are the Berrett-Koehler staff members, or authors, or people
we’re partnering with, or customers…it’s just the people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The true test of a person is not that you will help someone who can help you. It’s that you will help someone who cannot help you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Guy Kawasaki&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any entrepreneurial leanings whatsoever, you're probably familiar with today's show's guest, &lt;a href="http://www.guykawasaki.com"&gt;Guy Kawasaki&lt;/a&gt;. The author of the best-selling &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591840562/curtrosengren-20"&gt;The Art of the Start&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href="http://www.garage.com/"&gt;Garage Technology Ventures&lt;/a&gt;, and most recently, founder of the news sites &lt;a href="http://alltop.com/"&gt;Alltop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://truemors.com/"&gt;Truemors&lt;/a&gt;, has become synonymous with no-nonsense entrepreneurship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of all that, Guy is one of the top bloggers in the blogosphere. When I checked this morning, his blog, &lt;a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/"&gt;How to Change the World&lt;/a&gt;, was ranked number 60 on Technorati.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a budding entrepreneur or not, this podcast has something for you on your M.A.P. Making journey. Listen and discover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The importance of making meaning in the work you do.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Why the true measure of a person is being a mensch, and what that means.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Why Guy has a bias for action over planning.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The benefit of showing up authentically in the world. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How a guy born in Honolulu ended up such rabid fan of playing hockey. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught up with Guy in the clubhouse of Ice Oasis, the ice rink in Redwood City, California where he plays hockey five days a week if he's in town. &lt;/p&gt;

welcome to Curt Rosengren’s M.A.P. Maker Podcast, where you will find insights
and inspiration from thought leaders and trailblazers – people who are crafting
a life of Meaning, Abundance, and Passion. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;I’m Curt
Rosengren, and my focus is helping people create careers that energize and
inspire them. It’s all about figuring out how to put your passion to work to
make a difference that inspires you, in a way that lets you thrive. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;Today’s podcast
features Guy Kawasaki, a man whose name for many people is synonymous with
entrepreneurship. The most recent of his eight books, the best-selling, The Art
of the Start, outlines the insights and no-nonsense approach to
entrepreneurship he has learned throughout his career. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;That career
started out in the diamond business, but in 1983 it took a turn into technology
when he went to work for Apple as a software evangelist. From there he founded
a series of software companies, started sharing his insights as a writer and a
speaker, and eventually returned to Apple for a few more years as an Apple
Fellow. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;Guy describes
where his more recent path has taken him. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I started garage.com, which was a boutique investment bank
for tech companies. And that has morphed itself into Garage Technology
Ventures, which is now a VC firm. And all the way I also continue to write,
continue to speak, and now I’m the founder – also, still at Garage as the EIR –
but I’m doing Alltop and Truemors, which is a couple of news sites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Alltop happens to be my current fascination, and I think
it’s just good for everybody. I mean, you have a blog that is listed at Alltop,
so theoretically we will send you more traffic because we’re trying to attract
people who are interested in careers. And so, if a lot of people come to
career.alltop.com, some of which knew about you, but many of which did not, so
you’ll gain traffic and new users. That’s good for you. It’s also good for them
because they find a new source of education and enlightenment and information.
So how can you lose? You make the blog and the site owner happy, and you make
the reader happy. Life is good! And if it all works we’ll sell advertising.
Life gets even better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;For Guy, building
Alltop is the most fun he’s had with his work in years. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;it’s just so much fun, because people are just delighted to
get listed there, and readers are delighted to find one-stop shopping
aggregation with no aggravation. So it’s very rewarding. The last time I had so
much fun working was probably the Macintosh division. Now, I don’t think Alltop
is going to be as big as Macintosh, but it’s a lot of fun. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;In his approach
to building a business, Guy points to the importance of what he calls making
meaning. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I think there are probably three principle ways to make
meaning in life. One is to end bad things. Pollution, crime, violence,
whatever. So you stop a bad thing, you’re making meaning. You can also perpetuate
good things. So perpetuate freedom, perpetuate expression, liberation,
empowerment, whatever. That’s also making meaning. I think the third way is to
create something that has never been done before. That even translates into the
venture capital business, because at the end of the day I think that companies
that make meaning, also make money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;From a purely practical
perspective, he also thinks that focusing first and foremost on the money
attracts the wrong kind of people for a startup. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;On the other hand, if you start off a company with the
desire to solely make money, you’ll attract only MBA’s and that’s the worst
kind of people to attract for a start-up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Because so much of starting a company has nothing to do with
analysis and high-level strategic planning. So much of a start-up is about hard
work and luck. Not necessarily in that order either. So the thought that using
MBA analytical skills to create a better start-up I think is an oxymoron. I
think it’s all about luck and gutting it out. I prefer people who take action.
I mean, you can take stupid action, but on the scale of entrepreneurship, most
people spend too much time analyzing and trying to find the perfect solution.
They should ship, and then test. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;From the beginning to end, from the beginning to the time we
shipped, or opened up Alltop, was probably about sixty days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;Why is making
meaning so important?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;That’s why you should start a company. That’s why you should
start a job. You could say that it’s easy for me to say because I have the luxury
of picking and choosing, but it’s why you exist I think. Now, don’t get me
wrong. There’s something to be said for just making a quick buck sometimes if
you can. But I think generally speaking probably the older you get and the
wiser you get, the more meaning is meaningful than money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;He took it a
step further with what he admits might be questionable theology, but is still a
fun way to look at the benefit of making meaning. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Well, my theory, however theologically wrong this is…my
understanding is, you get into heaven by accepting Christ, right? Not by being
a good guy. That’s the way it works. So you can be a bad guy, accept Christ,
and get into heaven. But then my theory is, let’s say that’s true, but what
happens if you get to heaven and it’s like an airplane. Let’s say it’s a Boeing
747. So now you’re in heaven. It’s a 747. Beats a car, a hell, right? Beats
being in a car. So you’re in heaven, it’s a 747, and then you find out, holy
smokes, there’s coach, business, and first, depending on what kind of person
you were. So my theory is, heaven is a 747, and I want to be in first. And not
just any 747. I want to be in Singapore Airlines first. So that’s why I try to
make meaning now. So that when I get to heaven, I have a seat that goes all the
way back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;As Guy sees it,
the ticket to that heavenly Singapore Airlines first class doesn’t come from
doing good with strings attached. In Guy’s philosophy, the person who helps
someone with the hope that they’ll get something back only ends up in coach.
Singapore Airlines first class comes from being a mensch. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Mensch is a Yiddish term that describes someone who’s truly
trustworthy, who is a person who would not care about the possible quid pro quo
return of helping someone, but just does it for the sheer pleasure of helping
people. Fundamentally honest, fundamentally fair kind of person. There’s really
not much higher praise than to be called a mensch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The true test of a person is not that you will help someone
who can help you. It’s that you will help someone who cannot help you. And I
think you can see this time and time again where people will suck up to a Wall
Street Journal reporter. They’ll suck up to the CEO of a powerful company that
they want to make a sail to, or they want to have a partnership with, right?
But they berate the flight attendant. They berate the reservationist. They
berate the person who’s checking you in at the counter. They berate an
operator, or secretary, or administrative aide. So that’s the test. It’s not
that you are smart enough to suck up to powerful people. It’s that you’re nice
enough to be good to anybody. That’s the test. &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;I asked Guy
what kind of meaning he is making with his work. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Hopefully the meaning I’ll make now is with my writing and
speaking I’ll help entrepreneurs be successful, make the world a better place.
So it may be secondary making meaning. Also with the funds we invest we’ll help
these entrepreneurs financially create these companies. And then with my sites,
Alltop and Truemors, we’re trying to help bloggers like you as well as anybody
trying to find information in this haystack called the internet. So they could
amount to some meaning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The fun about it for me is when people say, they use the
site, they read my book, my speech helped them. That’s where I derive value.
That whatever my intellectual property is, they derive value from it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;Entrepreneurship
is about pursuing a dream. While a fear of failure is an all-too-common
obstacle to dream pursuit, Guy sees an especially unique cultural environment
in Silicon Valley that goes a long way in reducing that fear. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We’re having this interview in Silicon Valley, and in the
valley it’s different. I don’t know why it’s different, but failure’s not that
big a deal, and also you’re expected to try a startup. I think in many places,
people’s perspective would be, “Why are you leaving this great job?” And in
Silicon Valley the perspective is, why haven’t you done something
entrepreneurial? It’s very different. So failure here – I can’t say that it’s a
positive. You don’t brag that you failed. But it doesn’t matter how many times
you failed. It matters if you just succeed once, is what happens here. And
that’s unusual. And that may be why Silicon Valley leads in so many
entrepreneurial respects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;Guy points out
the importance of learning from failure, but also recognizes that sometimes
there’s nothing to learn because it was just the result of plain bad luck. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I don’t think you set out and prefer to fail so you can
learn something. You’d be better to just be successful and learn nothing. But,
I don’t know. Every time you fail you learn a little more. The tricky part is
that lots of failure – I don’t know what you can learn from it, because it
could just be bad luck. You could just have been too early. So what do you
learn from that? Next time I won’t be too early, so then what – not be
visionary? It’s not that easy. Certainly if you never try again you’ll never succeed.
You’ll also never fail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;Since he
mentions hockey so often in his blog and his interviews, and I’m a hockey fan
myself, I couldn’t resist asking how someone born in Honolulu ended up being
such a rabid fan of playing the game. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;My kids took it up about five and a half years ago. When
they took it up, I decided to take it up also so I could be a better father.
And I like hockey more than they do. I play more hockey than my kids. If I’m in
town, I play hockey five times a week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;I asked him
what position he plays. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Wherever I hurt the team least. You know, when you take up
hockey at 48, that’s like forty years too late. I never skated at all till I
was 48. So learning to skate at 48 is a non-trivial task. I truly love hockey
because it is the most physically and mentally engrossing sport I’ve ever
encountered. Hockey’s just nonstop. The puck’s always in play. It’s a great
sport. Everything about it is hard. It’s mentally hard. And you have to learn a
skill even to be able to play. Like most people can run and jump. So you’re
kind of born with the ability to run and jump. You’re not born with skating
ability. It’s something you develop. You have to learn how to skate, and then
you have to learn hockey. So it’s 2x what you have to do in most sports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;In his book, The
Art of the Start, Guy incorporates FAQ’s into his chapters. One of those
questions is, “How can I prevent success from going to my head?” I asked him
how he kept from taking himself too seriously and letting his success go to his
head. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There are some people who say I take myself very seriously.
There are also people who say that I haven’t been that successful. So between
the two I’m good as gold. I have a very good time. I don’t give a shit,
basically. I’m 54 years old. I just don’t give a shit about what most, or some
people think of me. And I just want to do my thing and let the chips fall where
they may. I mean really, I don’t have to worry about image or anything like
that. It’s not because I have this great image. It’s because I just – I don’t
care. I’m not intentionally going to piss people off for the sake of flexing
power. On the other hand, if they think I’m doing something stupid, or it’s
lousy, or whatever, at this point I don’t care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;Ultimately,
it’s all about taking an authentic approach to life. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;You know what? I’ve found that if you try to have this
public perception and this consistent story and all that that’s made up, it
takes too much energy, because you have to remember what lies you told. Whereas
if you’re just WYSIWYG, it’s very easy. You don’t have to think about it. So
that’s why – there are great theological and ethical reasons why you should
always be honest, but there’s also my lazy version which is, if you’re always
honest and tell people what you really think, you don’t need to keep track of
what lies you told. And that’s just so much easier. My brain is getting full
and degrading, and so the easiest path is just tell them the truth and then you
don’t have to remember what wicked web you’ve weaved. That’s my theory.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #5f497a;"&gt;Wrapping up, I
shared my perspective with him that a sense of hope is a fundamental element if
positive change is going to happen. As a parting thought, Guy offered a glimpse
of what gives &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; hope for the
future. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Well certainly entrepreneurship gives me hope. The people
still trying these crazy ideas, changing the world. I have four children and
they give me hope. I think more than anything else, I just look at them and how
they view the world and what they’re trying to do, and the joy they bring me,
that’s, I would say, the primary source of hope. &lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m not anti-news. I think it’s really important to be informed. I just think it’s also important to be inspired. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Daryn Kagan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her twelve-year tenure as an anchor on CNN, Daryn Kagan had the opportunity to cover the news from a wide variety of angles. From war to the Oscars to professional sports to traveling Africa with Bono, her TV news career gave her an incredible opportunity to get up close and personal with the headlines. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she left CNN, she decided it was time for a change. The result was &lt;a href="http://www.darynkagan.com"&gt;DarynKagan.com&lt;/a&gt;, the home base for a media company dedicated to positive, inspiring news. Since the site launched in November 2006, it has become a daily destination for thousands of people looking for real life stories that inspire them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site also inspired Kagan's upcoming book, coming out in April, titled, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0696238918/curtrosengren-20"&gt;What’s Possible! Fifty True Stories of Real People Who Dared to Dream They Could Make a Difference&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Kagan shares her story, you'll hear:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How inspiration comes in bits and pieces.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Why having her idea shot down by Yahoo! was the best thing that could have happened to her.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How she takes a &amp;quot;salad bowl&amp;quot; approach to her business. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How following her heart has opened doors and made things easier.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;How deciding how to spend her personal &amp;quot;energy budget&amp;quot; powers her success.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Why she thinks choosing who you want to be is the most powerful choice of all.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Details:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;...one of the nicest comments that John and I would get
when we sent the manuscript out to a lot of business leaders to get
their comments and critique was, thank you Bob and John for
sharing something that successful people already know, but that most
people will never accept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Bob Burg, co-author, The Go-Giver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within three weeks of being published, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/159184200X/curtrosengren-20"&gt;The Go-Giver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
hit number six on the Wall Street Journal Business Bestseller list. The
book has won praises from thought leaders like Michael Gerber, Stephen
Covey, and Seth Godin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this podcast, co-author Bob Burg (who wrote &lt;em&gt;The Go-Giver&lt;/em&gt; together with John David Mann) offers an overview of the &amp;quot;Five Laws of Stratospheric Success&amp;quot; outlined in the book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also shares choice insights like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How he has faced fear and failure and come out on top.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What he knows now that he wished he knew twenty years ago.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Key factors in his own success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No stranger to success even before &lt;em&gt;The Go-Giver&lt;/em&gt; became a bestseller, Burg is also the author of the book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071462074/curtrosengren-20"&gt;Endless Referrals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,
which has sold over 175,000 copies. As a speaker he has shared the
stage with people like Zig Ziglar, Larry King, Brian Tracy, and
President Gerald Ford. &lt;/p&gt;
