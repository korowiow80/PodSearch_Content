The two men develop a deep and trusting bond once Crusoe gets over his struggles with suspicion and doubts about Friday's intentions. We find ourselves at that part of the novel that best illustrates what many critics of Defoe's novel say is a glorification of English colonialism and empire. To be sure, that is part of what is going on in the book. However, there is more to it than that. Defoe, at times, seems close to sowing seeds of doubt about the English world he lived in and its beliefs about its place in the world. Pay very close attention to the conversations between Friday and Crusoe. They move in directions entirely unanticipated by Crusoe. He is constantly surprised by how loyal, intelligent, and civilized Friday turns out to be in his very deepest nature.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33252121-115985255719125500?l=crusoepodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

We find ourselves at that part of the novel that best illustrates what many critics of Defoe's novel say is a glorification of English colonialism and empire. To be sure, that is part of what is going on in the book. However, there is more to it than that. Defoe, at times, seems close to sowing seeds of doubt about the English world he lived in and its beliefs about its place in the world. Pay very close attention to the conversations between Friday and Crusoe. They move in directions entirely unanticipated by Crusoe. He is constantly surprised by how loyal, intelligent, and civilized Friday turns out to be in his very deepest nature.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Robinson,Crusoe,Defoe,adventure,novel,audio,book,audiobook,pirate,shipwreck,sea,ocean,island,literature,english,candlelight</itunes:keywords></item><item><title>Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe - Part 13</title><link>http://crusoepodcast.blogspot.com/2006/09/robinson-crusoe-by-daniel-defoe-part_19.html</link><author>info@candlelightstories.com (CandlelightStories.com)</author><pubDate>Tue, 19 Sep 2006 22:38:28 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33252121.post-115872871723379402</guid><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4627/1192/1600/crusoefriday.0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4627/1192/320/crusoefriday.0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.stoneagerobot.com/RobinsonCrusoePart13.mp3"&gt;Download Robinson Crusoe - Part 13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannibals come to Crusoe's island and make him believe there is a possibility of confrontation.

It's a good story and reading it is a lot of fun.  Difficult, but fun.  Defoe's language is up and down and backward and forward.  It makes you think fast.  Try picking up the book and reading any part of it out loud and fast.  It's tricky.  But it's a very good way to learn more about how Defoe's mind worked.  Amazing.  Are you starting to wonder why Crusoe constantly reminds us of things and says things like: 'As I told you before,' or 'As I said earlier?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He almost insists that you follow the correct sequence of events, but he skips ahead in order to achieve a much more important goal.  He wants you to follow along with his state of mind.  That's why his story-telling language is so twisty and folds back on itself so often.  This is certainly one of the most fantastic things about Defoe's novel.  Its obsessive focus on the man's state of mind sets a precedent that influences almost all of literature following Defoe.

'Robinson Crusoe' by Daniel Defoe is one of the greatest novels in existence.  It marks the start of English novel-writing.  There's so much more in this book than one would ever know from the silly movies that have been based upon it.  In fact, there has never been a remotely good movie made of this incredible book.  It goes so much farther than most writing at exploring the human spirit and the foundations of civilization.  It is one of the most modern books I have ever read.  It was written in 1719.  You'll know what I mean if you listen to it.  It just keeps coming at you without any letup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: left;"&gt;I may move this over to a new blog site specifically for Robinson Crusoe.  But for now, this will do just fine.  I will try to add some introductory information about Defoe over the next week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen and have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33252121-115638508127537419?l=crusoepodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
