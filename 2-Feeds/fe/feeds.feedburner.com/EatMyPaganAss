			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most pagans don’t know the name Edmund “Eddie” Buczynski (aka Minos Gwydion-Hyakinthos), but they should. In the span of only a few years in the 1970s, Eddie established three living traditions of modern neopaganism—the New York Welsh Tradition, the Wica Tradition, and the Minoan Tradition, which includes the Minoan Brotherhood, Minoan Sisterhood, and the Cult of Rhea, or the Cult of the Double Axe. This founding elder stood at the convergence of the hippy culture, gay liberation movement, and the rise of neopaganism in New York City, and took aspects of each to create unique and important contributions to neopagan religion and culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Bull of Heaven by Michael Lloyd" href="https://www.facebook.com/Iakkhos" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7226/6929525430_e27aa8e1e4.jpg" alt="Bull of Heaven by Michael Lloyd" width="292" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>In this episode of Eat My Pagan Ass, Luckylicious interviews special guest <a title="Michael G. Lloyd author page" href="https://www.facebook.com/Iakkhos" target="_blank">Michael G. Lloyd</a> (aka Garan Du), a Minoan high priest, co-founder of the <a title="Between the Worlds men's gathering" href="http://www.betweentheworlds.org" target="_blank">Between the Worlds</a> men’s gathering, and author of <em>Bull of Heaven: The Mythic Life of Eddie Buczynski and the Rise of the New York Pagan</em>, a book that some consider the sequel to Margot Adler&#8217;s seminal history on neopaganism, <em>Drawing Down the Moon </em>(Ms. Adler provides the foreword to <em>Bull of Heaven</em>). As Michael shares in this episode, researching Eddie’s life and its impact on neopaganism was a labor of love that put him in touch with many of our community’s most respected and well-known leaders. As a spiritual descendant of Eddie’s work, Michael hopes that through this book more neopagans will become familiar with Eddie, a man he calls “the Gerald Gardner of the gay pagan community.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Ever wondered what your soul looks like? Just ask <a title="Lisa Owen, psychic artist" href="http://www.bearsoulstudio.com" target="_blank">Lisa Owen</a>, a talented artist who sketches beautiful original art based on her psychic impressions of people&#8217;s souls. After a harrowing near-death experience following a car accident at a young age, her psychic awareness intensified with abilities to see auras and talk to spirit guides and ancestor spirits. Her training with midwestern Native American tribes  taught her reverence for the circle of life and the sacredness of totems, the medicine wheel, and the spiritual artist&#8217;s path. Then, while overcoming a cancer diagnosis that resulted in intensive chemotherapy and a double mastectomy, Lisa&#8217;s artistic powers ignited and she began to shape her visions into drawings, dolls, and altar pieces. &#8220;Stage IIIa cancer&#8230;gave me my art&#8230;art is my juice, my blessing from the gods&#8230;I learned how to live through almost dying,&#8221; Lisa says in this powerful interview, recorded July 17-ish, 2011, at the Sirius Rising Festival at the Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, New York.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have had the pleasure of receiving two soul readings from Lisa during two separate trips to the Sirius Rising Festival, and both have been powerfully moving experiences of healing and transformation for me. She travels the country attending pagan festivals, so be on the lookout for her at your next festival. You can also check her itinerary and view her art on her website at <a title="Bear Soul Studio" href="http://www.bearsoulstudio.com" target="_blank">http://www.bearsoulstudio.com</a>. She is also available for readings and consultations.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One sweltering early September morning at Gay Witch Camp (aka Between The Worlds queer pagan men&#8217;s gathering) in southern Ohio, I was lugging my camping gear to and fro when who should happen to wander by and in a grand gesture of chivalry offer me some assistance but none other than the World Famous Pagan Author and Witch, <a title="Christopher Penczak website" href="http://christopherpenczak.com/online/" target="_blank">Christopher &#8220;Get Off My Robe, Bitch&#8221; Penczak</a>?!? It&#8217;s not every day two of pagandom&#8217;s most notorious gay witches meet for the first time. The earthworms will sing of our fateful encounter for generations to come. As it so happened, being the informed witch that I am (it pays to have dirt on people) I knew Mr. Penczak was going to be there and I was planning to hunt him down and nag him until he agreed to be interviewed. So imagine my delight when he not only found ME but also practically begged me to let him be on the show. Well, what can I say&#8230;they don&#8217;t call me Lucky for nothing. I played hard to get at first, of course, but I consented. He IS world famous, after all.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6203691367_5c0cb608c2.jpg" alt="Luckylicious and Christopher Penczak" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Christopher &#8220;Get Off My Robe, Bitch&#8221; Penczak gets a smooch from Luckylicious.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this episode of Eat My Pagan Ass podcast, Christopher Penczak dishes ALL to Lucky &#8212; starting from his childhood Catholic porn fantasies wending all the way through his meteoric rise to grand poobah (well, 1/3rd poobah) of a pretty awesome school of witchcraft (but not wizardry&#8230;no, including the wizardry curriculum would have opened the school up to threats of copyright infringement from the folks at Hogwarts). Assless chaps are involved, as is much flirting and general silliness, all of which spice up what is a very interesting and informative glimpse into the life of one of modern paganism&#8217;s most prolific witches and occultists, and explores the <a title="Temple of Witchcraft" href="http://www.templeofwitchcraft.org" target="_blank">Temple of Witchcraft</a> he created with his life partners Steve Kenson and Adam Sartwell.</p>

		<itunes:summary>One sweltering early September morning at Gay Witch Camp (aka Between The Worlds queer pagan men's gathering) in southern Ohio, I was lugging my camping gear to and fro when who should happen to wander by and in a grand gesture of chivalry offer me some assistance but none other than the World Famous Pagan Author and Witch, Christopher "Get Off My Robe, Bitch" Penczak?!? It's not every day two of pagandom's most notorious gay witches meet for the first time. The earthworms will sing of our fateful encounter for generations to come. As it so happened, being the informed witch that I am (it pays to have dirt on people) I knew Mr. Penczak was going to be there and I was planning to hunt him down and nag him until he agreed to be interviewed. So imagine my delight when he not only found ME but also practically begged me to let him be on the show. Well, what can I say...they don't call me Lucky for nothing. I played hard to get at first, of course, but I consented. He IS world famous, after all.

<p style="text-align: left;">Lucky&#8217;s interview with this world-famous, chart-topping musical  performance group touches on the need for men&#8217;s mysteries and rights of  passage, the role of voodoo and other Afro-Caribbean religions in the  evolution of American music and culture, and the wonder and joy that  comes from following your heart, living your rhythm, and dancing your  soul.</p>

<p><strong>About the Dragon Ritual Drummers</strong> (Source: <a title="Dragon Ritual Drummers bio and history" href="http://dragonritualdrummers.com/History--and--Bios.php" target="_blank">the group&#8217;s website</a>):</p>
<p><em>The Dragon Ritual Drummers [celebrated] their 10 year anniversary [in] 2010.  Based out of the Niagara Region, they began their journey as favorites in the pagan festival circuit in Ontario Canada.  They have since moved on to play at pagan festivals and large mainstream events all over North America.</em></p>
<p><em>The troupe is comprised of 6 members; Utu, Flint, Adrian, Drago, Naresh and Eion.  All members play a variety of instruments including tribal drums, string instruments, as well as brass and archaic reed instruments heard in the ancient hills and valleys of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.  Their music and performances are creative, intense and powerful.  They bring the audience to their feet dancing as they are swept away in the intense beat of music, inspired from around the world and through the ages.</em></p>
<p><em>The lore of the Dragon Ritual Drummers is attached to the entity from which they take their name, the mythical dragon spirit that resides in an ethereal cave at the brink of Niagara Falls.  The ancient serpent spirit was once revered by aboriginal inhabitants of the region but was eventually cast into a negative legacy by the conquering Iroquois nation.  The serpents legacy was one of obscurity for generations.  From the beginning the the Dragon Ritual Drummers reached out to awaken the ancient water dragon spirit, and the rest as they say is history in the making.  The Dragon Ritual Drummers attribute much of their success to the dragon spirit, achieving unprecedented success for their musical genres world wide.  Their interactive and critically acclaimed CD &#8220;The Epic: A Drum Opera&#8221; tells the story of the Niagara dragon from the ice age to modern times, all with drums and percussion along with beautiful illustrations.  They  currently are promoting their newest release &#8220;Temple of the Drum&#8221;</em></p>
<p>They have been featured in numerous mainstream and pagan media, have owned the #1 ranking on the Canadian MySpace music charts for the genres of &#8220;Afro-beat&#8221; and &#8220;Tropical&#8221;, and are currently in the top 20 in the U.S. MySpace music charts, and ranked #1 for their genre of  World Music on Reverb Nation!</p>

Gay pagans, gay gods, sex magick, frolicking in the forest, and MORE!

 

Lucky interviews the notoriously fabulous (or is that fabulously notorious?) Ocymvio, a gay pagan who's made his home in NYC and has brought quite a big of magick and fellowship to the gay pagan community there. Founder of the NYC Gay Men's Open Pagan Magick Circle, gypsy born, Minoan Brotherhood member, fashion designer, tarot reader, regular attendee at Between the Worlds and Short Mountain Sanctuary, and all around groovy guy, Ocymvio shares his experiences as a gay pagan and how he puts a little swish into his "Walking the Talk." This episode was recorded at Beltane, so there's a bit of friskiness and quite a lot of vulgarity -- served up just how you badass pagans love to hear it!

See Ocymvio's fashion designs on the web at Gypsycamp Clothing.

<p style="text-align: center;">(Sequel to &#8220;Judgment Day XX: Here It Is Again (and THIS TIME It&#8217;s for REAL, We Promise&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="May 21, 2011 Judgment Day by eatmypaganass, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/luckylicious/5744248502/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2681/5744248502_d44b2cf225.jpg" alt="May 21, 2011 Judgment Day" width="500" height="273" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It&#8217;s the same old bullshit since the day anyone walked around claiming to be a prophet: follow some jokester, swallow his bull hook, line, and sinker, give him all your money, sell everything you own, leave your families, and tell everyone the world is coming to an end. When will people learn? Is it self-loathing that turns them against this world, their loved ones, and themselves? What kind of escapist fantasy nightmare are they giving themselves over to, and for what? How does this contrast with the pagan worldview?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Luckylicious talks about loony fundamentalist fringe-heads and acknowledges there&#8217;s more to be learned from their behavior than you might realize at first. Also in this very special episode Lucky interviews the very talented artist and witch, <a title="Email Silkie Lyrazel" href="mailto:silkielyrazel@gmail.com" target="_blank">Silkie Lyrazel</a>, high priestess of the <a title="Grailwood Coven on Facebook" href="http://facebook.org/grailwood" target="_blank">Grailwood Coven</a> in New York City. Silkie shares her insights into the Faerie Tradition, bardic work, ritual drama, living with familiars, staying attuned to nature and the realm of Faerie, and even dishes on True Blood and her vampire/goth fascination. Silkie and Lucky talk about ethical living and how pagans can walk the talk a bit more, as well as take pride in our convictions and stand up for ourselves in the face of persecution, discrimination, and threats of physical violence.</p>

<p>Lucky and Carmen also share some stories of how they have both had run-ins with the po-po lately&#8230;wtf?  No one went to jail, so things are looking up.  Hope springs eternal, and well that was another lame segue &#8212; BLESSED SPRING EQUINOX all you fan-freaking-tastic EMPA listeners!!!</p>

That means anything goes, and it DOES in this  episode of Eat My Pagan  Ass pagan podcast.  Lucky is a single gay pagan  AGAIN (don&#8217;t  worry&#8211;he&#8217;s okay with that) and Carmen has the hots for  some guy and  this time actually works up the nerve to talk to him.

<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0.7em 0px;  line-height: 1.6em; text-align: left;">We touch one last time  (for now)  on the passing of Lucky&#8217;s dear friend, Glitterpussy, and the  pagan  implications of death and, apropos to the season, rebirth.

We respond to some listener emails, which include tarot  and rune  readings, before heading out to Rockefeller Center to gaze upon  the  giant painted-up Yule tree and make fun of NYC tourists (keep  coming  back! we love you!)

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This episode is a follow-on to <a title="Eat My Pagan Ass episode 35 - Glitterpussy" href="http://podcast.eatmypaganass.com/2010/12/15/empa0035-glitterpussy-pagan-music-artist/" target="_blank">Eat My Pagan Ass episode 35</a>, which featured an interview with pagan music artist and one of Lucky&#8217;s best friends in the glamorverse, Glitterpussy. Tragically, Glitter (or Allyson, her given name), passed away unexpectedly on November 5, 2010. Episode 35 was aired as the August 2010 interview was intended, letting Glitter speak for herself in her own words, and including no mention of her passing.</p>
<p>In this episode, we hear the tale of how Glitter and Lucky met in July 2002 at the Starwood Festival, an annual pagan gathering and celebration that was held at the Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, NY (now at Wisteria in Ohio). Be transported back across space and time to this pivotal moment when two stars collided and began a spiral dance in one of the world&#8217;s most magical places.</p>
<p>Lucky shares his feelings about losing a dear friend, and also delves into the uncomfortable subject of what happens when we pass over&#8211;not only for the soul in transition, but also for everyone else left behind.  It&#8217;s not all laughs in this episode, but Lucky does share some of the beautiful gifts of healing spirit Allyson/Glitterpussy gave to those around her.  Through this podcast, you may be touched, too, by this very special, beautiful being whose laughter and love will be sorely missed but never forgotten.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Season 3, Episode 2 (EMPA#0033): It Gets Better (Don&#8217;t Off Yourself!) </strong></p>
<p>Recorded NYC, October 3, 2010</p>
<p>Carmen Kickass and Luckylicious proudly bring you the thirty-third installment of <em>Eat My Pagan Ass</em>. In this episode, we bring everyone up to speed on just where the heck we&#8217;ve been all <strong>summer</strong> long. Lucky&#8217;s been on Fire Island, the notorious gay haven by the sea, communing with the elements and checking out all the delicious, roasting meat (see poem below). Carmen has been hopping the globe, stirring up trouble on both U.S. coasts and beyond. Both of us are asking &#8220;What the fuck is going on with all these <strong>gay suicides</strong>?&#8221; and you can bet we&#8217;ve got something to say about it. It&#8217;s not all Sturm und Drang, however; we take a playful detour through the adventures of <strong>love</strong> (and how NOT to run away from the opportunity to love and be loved in return); we celebrate the official recognition of <strong>Druidry</strong> in the U.K. as a legitimate religion; we reply to some <strong>listener emails</strong>; we dish on<strong> J.K. Rowling</strong>&#8217;s recent appearance on the <em>Oprah Winfrey Show</em>; announce that the legendary <strong>Enchantments</strong> magical store in New York City is alive and well on the Lower East Side; ruminate on the coming <strong>Samhain</strong> season; explore Carmen&#8217;s unnatural fascination with large <strong>zits</strong> (gag); mention <strong><em>Perdurabo</em></strong>, an updated biography on the man, the myth, the legend himself, Aleister Crowley (&#8221;Uncle Al&#8221;), written by Richard Kaczynski; and last but not least we hear a wonderful new song by<strong> Jeff Altergott</strong> called &#8220;It Gets Better&#8221; dedicated to all the GLBTQ youth out there struggling with daily harassment for being who they are.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="It Gets Better by Eat My Pagan Ass, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36178216@N04/5076665348/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4035/5076665348_8ef749b30e.jpg" alt="It Gets Better" width="400" height="331" /></a></p>
<p>Featured artist: <a title="Jeffrey Altergott - It Gets Better" href="http://bit.ly/dCmyQV" target="_blank">Jeffrey Altergott</a></p>
<p>And now for a poem:</p>
<p><strong>Fire Island</strong> September 18, 2010 by Lucky de las Brujas</p>
<p><em>Roiling tides that presage the storms at sea,
Half-naked (or fully bare) boys with tans
Hurling themselves, laughing, carefree,
Into the swelling waters, finding fun
In daring Dame Nature herself.</em></p>
<p><em>Thongs on feet that flip, now flop,
Now left alone along dry, sometimes-splintered boardwalks,
Abandoned by their owners,
Who prefer to feel the fire of the sun
In the hot sands baking—almost burning—
Between their carefully manicured toes,
Connecting body to beach, man to eternity.</em></p>
<p><em>A timeless sounding as surf sinks into the porous shore,
Ephemeral sea foam fizzing into nothingness.
Dingbat birds with tiny bodies, long legs, and even longer beaks
Chase after the receding, briny waters
Wanting to taste the sweet, moist meat of a fat worm
Buried below the thirsty sucking mud.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Pardon our sound&#8211;Lucky forgot to bring the good audio recorder and so this one was made with an iPhone.</p>

<p>Recorded NYC, July 4, 2010</p>
<p>Carmen Kickass and Luckylicious launch the third season of their hit pagan podcast, Eat My Pagan Ass. In this episode, Carmen and Lucky get into the spirit of the July 4 holiday and celebrate a pagan perspective on independence, freedom, liberation, and patriotism. Following the examples of the United States&#8217; founding fathers (and mothers), Carmen and Lucky take a stand against THE MAN, tyranny, oppression, and instead exercise their rights to freedom, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The astrological influences of Cancer are felt in this episode&#8211;security, pride in the home(land), and standing up for our young country in the face of critics. We meditate on mental or spiritual self-imprisonment and ways to embrace and practice freedom on many different levels of existence.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carmen Kickass and Luckylicious are back from their siesta with another episode of the most famous pagan podcast on the planet &#8212; Eat My Pagan Ass! In this episode, we remember the amazing talents of the widely imitated Miss Cleo of Psychic Friends Network fame (don&#8217;t worry, she&#8217;s still alive, thank the Goddess!), discuss the power of intuition and its ability to protect us from dangerous situations, swap some pretty grody recipes, spiral off on yet another tangent about Carmen&#8217;s frickin&#8217; birds, and respond to a TON of awesome listener emails (you guys ROCK!).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Miss Cleo by Eat My Pagan Ass, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36178216@N04/4736557299/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4079/4736557299_99731762d0.jpg" alt="Miss Cleo" width="400" height="390" /></a></p>

		<itunes:summary>Carmen Kickass and Luckylicious are back from their siesta with another episode of the most famous pagan podcast on the planet -- Eat My Pagan Ass! In this episode, we remember the amazing talents of the widely imitated Miss Cleo of Psychic Friends Network fame (don't worry, she's still alive, thank the Goddess!), discuss the power of intuition and its ability to protect us from dangerous situations, swap some pretty grody recipes, spiral off on yet another tangent about Carmen's frickin' birds, and respond to a TON of awesome listener emails (you guys ROCK!).

Thanks to our latest donors to the 666 Club -- Kate and The Highway Hermit.  Also thanks to Brooke for sending us this awesome piece of artwork, which she calls "Holding Magick":


Happy Midsummer, bitches! Love, Carmen and Lucky...

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carmen and Lucky lay their plan for changing the world. Pay attention, pagans &#8212; this is the episode that starts it ALL rolling! Civil rights and drag queen masturbation, all in the same breath!! Carmen explains that there&#8217;s more than one way to dance around a Maypole (ahem), and one of them involves a lot of stinky cheese.  Covens and sex, and Gerald Gardner pops up again, and Carmen alleges a scandalous origin of Wicca&#8217;s founder. Oh, and did we mention sex? We also riff on some tarot cards. Lots and lots and lots of sex mentioned, so keep the kiddies away from this episode. Hope you are all having a blessed Beltane &#8212; remember, WISH BIG! Email us at eatmypaganass@gmail.com to tell us what you wish for this magical season!</p>

Lucky doesn&#8217;t want to get caught in the crossfire and changes the subject to more fun topics, like Sex and Beltane and Maypoles (ahem). But first &#8212; t<a title="Vatican claims homosexuality causes pedophelia" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/apr/13/vatican-homosexuality-paedophilia-claim-condemned" target="_blank">he Vatican is at it again</a>, deflecting responsibility for its sex abuse scandals by blaming homosexuality instead of its unnatural policy of priestly celibacy. Nice try, lump heads. Carmen and Lucky respond to TONS of listener emails about coming out of the broom closet, Project Pagan Enough, high priestesses who can&#8217;t get over themselves, and more candle magic.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Devoutly Catholic Ireland lawmakers have passed a new blasphemy law that makes punishable by a hefty fine blasphemy. To challenge the law, a group in Ireland, Irish Atheists, has published &#8220;blasphemous&#8221; quotes from Bjork, Mark Twain, Salman Rushdie, and others (and should include Eat My Pagan Ass, for that matter!)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/01/02/ireland.blasphemy.law/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/01/02/ireland.blasphemy.law/index.html</a></p>
<p>Carmen and I are going to have a blast tearing this one apart on <a title="Eat My Pagan Ass #23 - The Blasphemy Episode" href="http://podcast.eatmypaganass.com/2010/01/12/empa0023-the-art-of-blasphemy-taken-to-a-new-low/">the next episode of Eat My Pagan Ass</a>. After all, we blaspheme not only most of the world&#8217;s major religions on a regular basis (just listen to our last episode to get an idea of what we think of Catholicism, for example), but we also blaspheme pagan religions on a regular basis. WHY? Because people shouldn&#8217;t take themselves or their religions too damn seriously.</p>
<p>Whatever your religion, time and again we see conflict arising when people forget how to laugh at themselves. How many times have we seen within pagan groups irritating squabbles over how this or that should or should not be done?</p>
<p>Religion is a means to an end (in a manner of speaking), not the end itself. When I see these world religious leaders squabbling over the finer points of their make-believe fantasies of convenience, I am reminded of the bossy kid on the playground who insists that SHE is the only one who know the PROPER way to play house.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all child&#8217;s play in the eyes of the gods.</p>
<p>Where I take issue is that now the government is stepping in and is going to penalize people for criticizing what, in my opinion, deserves much criticism. And even if that weren&#8217;t my opinion, there is something called free speech which I realize is not guaranteed throughout this world but is something I as a pagan believe is a fundamental human right.</p>
<p>Could you imagine lawmakers here in the U.S. doing something similar? Actually, you could, couldn&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Well, I think that it should not just be the atheists standing up against this oppressive bullshit. Blasphemy is healthy. It keeps things in perspective. Pagans and other religious groups would do well to come out against the Irish lawmakers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that some sad people just can&#8217;t take a joke. That&#8217;s all well and good. But imposing fines on those of us who call them out on their crap is just fascist oppression. Call a spade a spade.</p>
<p>Grrrr.</p>

<h2>25 Blasphemous Quotations</h2>
<p>Published by <a href="http://blog.atheist.ie/?p=104">Atheist Ireland</a> on 1 January 2010</p>
<p>1. Jesus Christ, when asked if he was the son of God, in Matthew 26:64: “Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.” According to the Christian Bible, the Jewish chief priests and elders and council deemed this statement by Jesus to be blasphemous, and they sentenced Jesus to death for saying it.</p>
<p>2. Jesus Christ, talking to Jews about their God, in John 8:44: “Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.” This is one of several chapters in the Christian Bible that can give a scriptural foundation to Christian anti-Semitism. The first part of John 8, the story of “whoever is without sin cast the first stone”, was not in the original version, but was added centuries later. The original John 8 is a debate between Jesus and some Jews. In brief, Jesus calls the Jews who disbelieve him sons of the Devil, the Jews try to stone him, and Jesus runs away and hides.</p>
<p>3. Muhammad, quoted in Hadith of Bukhari, Vol 1 Book 8 Hadith 427: “May Allah curse the Jews and Christians for they built the places of worship at the graves of their prophets.” This quote is attributed to Muhammad on his death-bed as a warning to Muslims not to copy this practice of the Jews and Christians. It is one of several passages in the Koran and in Hadith that can give a scriptural foundation to Islamic anti-Semitism, including the assertion in Sura 5:60 that Allah cursed Jews and turned some of them into apes and swine.</p>
<p>4. Mark Twain, describing the Christian Bible in Letters from the Earth, 1909: “Also it has another name – The Word of God. For the Christian thinks every word of it was dictated by God. It is full of interest. It has noble poetry in it; and some clever fables; and some blood-drenched history; and some good morals; and a wealth of obscenity; and upwards of a thousand lies… But you notice that when the Lord God of Heaven and Earth, adored Father of Man, goes to war, there is no limit. He is totally without mercy — he, who is called the Fountain of Mercy. He slays, slays, slays! All the men, all the beasts, all the boys, all the babies; also all the women and all the girls, except those that have not been deflowered. He makes no distinction between innocent and guilty… What the insane Father required was blood and misery; he was indifferent as to who furnished it.” Twain’s book was published posthumously in 1939. His daughter, Clara Clemens, at first objected to it being published, but later changed her mind in 1960 when she believed that public opinion had grown more tolerant of the expression of such ideas. That was half a century before Fianna Fail and the Green Party imposed a new blasphemy law on the people of Ireland.</p>
<p>5. Tom Lehrer, The Vatican Rag, 1963: “Get in line in that processional, step into that small confessional. There, the guy who’s got religion’ll tell you if your sin’s original. If it is, try playing it safer, drink the wine and chew the wafer. Two, four, six, eight, time to transubstantiate!”</p>
<p>6. Randy Newman, God’s Song, 1972: “And the Lord said: I burn down your cities – how blind you must be. I take from you your children, and you say how blessed are we. You all must be crazy to put your faith in me. That’s why I love mankind.”</p>
<p>7. James Kirkup, The Love That Dares to Speak its Name, 1976: “While they prepared the tomb I kept guard over him. His mother and the Magdalen had gone to fetch clean linen to shroud his nakedness. I was alone with him… I laid my lips around the tip of that great cock, the instrument of our salvation, our eternal joy. The shaft, still throbbed, anointed with death’s final ejaculation.” This extract is from a poem that led to the last successful blasphemy prosecution in Britain, when Denis Lemon was given a suspended prison sentence after he published it in the now-defunct magazine Gay News. In 2002, a public reading of the poem, on the steps of St. Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square, failed to lead to any prosecution. In 2008, the British Parliament abolished the common law offences of blasphemy and blasphemous libel.</p>
<p>8. Matthias, son of Deuteronomy of Gath, in Monty Python’s Life of Brian, 1979: “Look, I had a lovely supper, and all I said to my wife was that piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah.”</p>
<p>9. Rev Ian Paisley MEP to the Pope in the European Parliament, 1988: “I denounce you as the Antichrist.” Paisley’s website describes the Antichrist as being “a liar, the true son of the father of lies, the original liar from the beginning… he will imitate Christ, a diabolical imitation, Satan transformed into an angel of light, which will deceive the world.”</p>
<p>10. Conor Cruise O’Brien, 1989: “In the last century the Arab thinker Jamal al-Afghani wrote: ‘Every Muslim is sick and his only remedy is in the Koran.’ Unfortunately the sickness gets worse the more the remedy is taken.”</p>
<p>11. Frank Zappa, 1989: “If you want to get together in any exclusive situation and have people love you, fine – but to hang all this desperate sociology on the idea of The Cloud-Guy who has The Big Book, who knows if you’ve been bad or good – and cares about any of it – to hang it all on that, folks, is the chimpanzee part of the brain working.”</p>
<p>12. Salman Rushdie, 1990: “The idea of the sacred is quite simply one of the most conservative notions in any culture, because it seeks to turn other ideas – uncertainty, progress, change – into crimes.” In 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa ordering Muslims to kill Rushdie because of blasphemous passages in Rushdie’s novel The Satanic Verses.</p>
<p>13. Bjork, 1995: “I do not believe in religion, but if I had to choose one it would be Buddhism. It seems more livable, closer to men… I’ve been reading about reincarnation, and the Buddhists say we come back as animals and they refer to them as lesser beings. Well, animals aren’t lesser beings, they’re just like us. So I say fuck the Buddhists.”</p>
<p>14. Amanda Donohoe on her role in the Ken Russell movie Lair of the White Worm, 1995: “Spitting on Christ was a great deal of fun. I can’t embrace a male god who has persecuted female sexuality throughout the ages, and that persecution still goes on today all over the world.”</p>
<p>15. George Carlin, 1999: “Religion easily has the greatest bullshit story ever told. Think about it. Religion has actually convinced people that there’s an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever ’til the end of time! But He loves you. He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! He’s all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can’t handle money! Religion takes in billions of dollars, they pay no taxes, and they always need a little more. Now, talk about a good bullshit story. Holy Shit!”</p>
<p>16. Paul Woodfull as Ding Dong Denny O’Reilly, The Ballad of Jaysus Christ, 2000: “He said me ma’s a virgin and sure no one disagreed, Cause they knew a lad who walks on water’s handy with his feet… Jaysus oh Jaysus, as cool as bleedin’ ice, With all the scrubbers in Israel he could not be enticed, Jaysus oh Jaysus, it’s funny you never rode, Cause it’s you I do be shoutin’ for each time I shoot me load.”</p>
<p>17. Jesus Christ, in Jerry Springer The Opera, 2003: “Actually, I’m a bit gay.” In 2005, the Christian Institute tried to bring a prosecution against the BBC for screening Jerry Springer the Opera, but the UK courts refused to issue a summons.</p>
<p>18. Tim Minchin, Ten-foot Cock and a Few Hundred Virgins, 2005: “So you’re gonna live in paradise, With a ten-foot cock and a few hundred virgins, So you’re gonna sacrifice your life, For a shot at the greener grass, And when the Lord comes down with his shiny rod of judgment, He’s gonna kick my heathen ass.”</p>
<p>19. Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion, 2006: “The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.” In 2007 Turkish publisher Erol Karaaslan was charged with the crime of insulting believers for publishing a Turkish translation of The God Delusion. He was acquitted in 2008, but another charge was brought in 2009. Karaaslan told the court that “it is a right to criticise religions and beliefs as part of the freedom of thought and expression.”</p>
<p>20. Pope Benedict XVI quoting a 14th century Byzantine emperor, 2006: “Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.” This statement has already led to both outrage and condemnation of the outrage. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the world’s largest Muslim body, said it was a “character assassination of the prophet Muhammad”. The Malaysian Prime Minister said that “the Pope must not take lightly the spread of outrage that has been created.” Pakistan’s foreign Ministry spokesperson said that “anyone who describes Islam as a religion as intolerant encourages violence”. The European Commission said that “reactions which are disproportionate and which are tantamount to rejecting freedom of speech are unacceptable.”</p>
<p>21. Christopher Hitchens in God is not Great, 2007: “There is some question as to whether Islam is a separate religion at all… Islam when examined is not much more than a rather obvious and ill-arranged set of plagiarisms, helping itself from earlier books and traditions as occasion appeared to require… It makes immense claims for itself, invokes prostrate submission or ‘surrender’ as a maxim to its adherents, and demands deference and respect from nonbelievers into the bargain. There is nothing—absolutely nothing—in its teachings that can even begin to justify such arrogance and presumption.”</p>
<p>22. PZ Myers, on his desecration of a Roman Catholic communion host, 2008: “You would not believe how many people are writing to me, insisting that these horrible little crackers (they look like flattened bits of styrofoam) are literally pieces of their god, and that this omnipotent being who created the universe can actually be seriously harmed by some third-rate liberal intellectual at a third-rate university… However, inspired by an old woodcut of Jews stabbing the host, I thought of a simple, quick thing to do: I pierced it with a rusty nail (I hope Jesus’s tetanus shots are up to date). And then I simply threw it in the trash, followed by the classic, decorative items of trash cans everywhere, old coffeegrounds and a banana peel.”</p>
<p>23. Ian O’Doherty, 2009: “(If defamation of religion was illegal) it would be a crime for me to say that the notion of transubstantiation is so ridiculous that even a small child should be able to see the insanity and utter physical impossibility of a piece of bread and some wine somehow taking on corporeal form. It would be a crime for me to say that Islam is a backward desert superstition that has no place in modern, enlightened Europe and it would be a crime to point out that Jewish settlers in Israel who believe they have a God given right to take the land are, frankly, mad. All the above assertions will, no doubt, offend someone or other.”</p>
<p>24. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor, 2009: “Whether a person is atheist or any other, there is in fact in my view something not totally human if they leave out the transcendent… we call it God… I think that if you leave that out you are not fully human.” Because atheism is not a religion, the Irish blasphemy law does not protect atheists from abusive and insulting statements about their fundamental beliefs. While atheists are not seeking such protection, we include the statement here to point out that it is discriminatory that this law does not hold all citizens equal.</p>
<p>25. Dermot Ahern, Irish Minister for Justice, introducing his blasphemy law at an Oireachtas Justice Committee meeting, 2009, and referring to comments made about him personally: “They are blasphemous.” Deputy Pat Rabbitte replied: “Given the Minister’s self-image, it could very well be that we are blaspheming,” and Minister Ahern replied: “Deputy Rabbitte says that I am close to the baby Jesus, I am so pure.” So here we have an Irish Justice Minister joking about himself being blasphemed, at a parliamentary Justice Committee discussing his own blasphemy law, that could make his own jokes illegal.</p>
<p>Finally, as a bonus, Micheal Martin, Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, opposing attempts by Islamic States to make defamation of religion a crime at UN level, 2009: “We believe that the concept of defamation of religion is not consistent with the promotion and protection of human rights. It can be used to justify arbitrary limitations on, or the denial of, freedom of expression. Indeed, Ireland considers that freedom of expression is a key and inherent element in the manifestation of freedom of thought and conscience and as such is complementary to freedom of religion or belief.” Just months after Minister Martin made this comment, his colleague Dermot Ahern introduced Ireland’s new blasphemy law.</p></blockquote>

		<itunes:summary>Carmen 8 Lucky have just returned from the craziest pagan Thanksgiving party EVER. You won't wanna miss this DISH! (Warning: have a barf bag at the ready!)  Also discussed: labyrinths, magic circles (to close or not to close, that is the question), carnivorous pagans, the Judgment Card of the tarot, and the rune Mannaz. Make sure to save some room for dessert!



Email us with your favorite recipes for TURKEY ASS or any non-conventional food that you prepare in a pagan way. What's your must-bring dish that you take to every party and why? What are you grateful for, and how do you express that gratitude? If you're new to the show, introduce yourself. We'd love to give you a shout-out on a future episode of Eat My Pagan Ass. eatmypaganass@gmail.com.

<p>Carmen Kickass and Luckylicious have found their way back to this world from their transdimensional wrong-turn. They describe their fantasmagorical experiences in alternate universes and try to adjust to being gone for 2-and-a-half years.</p>
<p><strong>2012 apocalypse approaches!</strong> Or does it? Are we misinterpreting the Mayan calendar? News flash: the world is better today than when they left it. We&#8217;ve had a quantum shift to the light, kiddies! Let&#8217;s CELEBRATE! Cheney is NOT president in THIS reality! Whahoo! It&#8217;s the Sliders (think Syfy, not beef) episode of <em>Eat My Pagan Ass</em>, season two.</p>
