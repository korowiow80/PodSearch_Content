<strong>Review:</strong> rolanstein</p>
<p><strong>Story:</strong><br />
<em>Laevsky (Andrew Scott) leads a profligate and indolent life in a seaside town in the Caucasus, neglecting his government position and wiling away his days drinking, bathing, lunching, impressing the locals with his cynicism, education and refined intellect, playing cards until late, then stumbling home drunk to his mistress Nadya (Fiona Glascott). He has fallen far short of the noble rural farming ideal he had envisaged when he whisked Nadya away from Moscow and her husband. Not only has his notion of making an honest living from the sweat of his brow and toil of his hands come to nothing, but he no longer loves Nadya. </p>
<p>Worse, he has just received a letter advising of the death of Nadya’s husband, but has withheld the news from her out of fear that she will now expect and insist on marriage. In fact, Nadya is less devoted to him than he assumes. She is a fine-looking woman in her physical prime, well aware of her feminine power and willing to exploit and test it. </p>
<p>Laevsky decides he must away, to freedom and the city life he now pines for! Problem is, he’s in debt and has no money to make good his escape. He begs for a loan from his affable doctor friend Samoylenko (Niall Buggy), who disapproves of his plans but reluctantly agrees. However, Samoylenko himself is short of funds and borrows from Von Koren (Tobias Menzies), a man of science and committed Darwinist newly arrived in the town. </p>
<p>Von Koren despises Laevsky for his pretentiousness and laziness, and for the bad influence he has had on the locals. Indeed, he believes Laevsky is a poor specimen of humanity whose eradication would be in the interests of evolutionary progression! When an opportunity comes up to challenge Laevsky to a duel, Von Koren seizes it. The locals are appalled and try to talk him out of it, but Von Koren sees himself as an agent of ‘natural selection’ and will not be swayed. </p>
<p>The duel goes ahead, but with unforeseen consequences for all.  </em></p>
<hr />
<strong>Review:</strong><br />
The producers of this film adaptation of <em>The Duel</em> have <em>Howard’s Way</em> and <em>Remains Of The Day</em> (one of my all-time favourites) on their CV. As a fan of period pieces and Chekhov, then, my expectations were high. Uh oh&#8230;</p>
<p>First the things that worked. </p>
<p>The cinematography is exquisite. Every scene is beautifully composed, and the choreography works in perfect harmony with the camera. Sheer poetry at the high points, but always superb.</p>
<p>The costuming is wonderfully evocative of the era. Nadya, particularly, could have walked straight out of Monet’s picnic painting. Whoops – I know I&#8217;ve flitted across to France, but am I even in the right period? My history is not good. Whatever, I stick by the observation for good or ill&#8230;have a look at this still from the movie and tell me you don’t agree:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/the-duel-pic1.jpg" alt="" title="the duel pic1" width="565" height="316" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3893" /></p>
<p>Dodgy as my sense of historical chronology undoubtedly is, the environmental and human milieu recreated here is exactly as I imagine it from reading Chekhov. The movie was shot in Croatia, not the Caucasus, but presents as Chekhov territory through and through. It is rare, in my experience, for a film adaptation to so precisely match one’s imaginative ‘visual’ recall of the source literary work. </p>
<p>The performances, too, are universally excellent.</p>
<p>There is something vital missing here, though. While everything is close to perfect visually, dramatically the work is a letdown due to a flawed and unfocussed script.</p>
<p>The motivations of the characters are sometimes unclear. For example, the reasons for Von Koren’s extreme dislike of Laevsky are not well canvassed. Von Koren&#8217;s Darwinism and the dangerously fascist form it assumes for him are glossed over. This is a crucial oversight, since it compromises the narrative: a viewer not familiar with Chekhov’s novella may struggle to understand why Von Koren appears so intent on killing Laevsky in the duel, or even in manipulating him into taking part in it in the first place. Further, a proper understanding of Von Koren&#8217;s political and world view (and Laevsky&#8217;s) is essential to fully appreciating the irony of the ending. No more on that; this is a spoiler-free zone.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/the-duel-pic2.jpg" alt="" title="the duel pic2" width="564" height="315" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3894" /> </p>
<p>Further, the psychology of the characters is not always well delineated. Laevsky and Nadya’s relationship, especially, is mystifying at times. Laevsky claims to have fallen out of love with his mistress, yet is apparently driven so wild by an urgent passion for her that he rips off her new dress to get at the ripe fruit within! In response, she heaves with mounting desire. This is hardly consistent with the behaviour of a couple who have lost interest in each other.</p>
<p>Then there is the tone. It’s wrong. That is, it is not true to the spirit of Chekhov’s novella, which sparkles with satirical wit. He is merciless in lampooning the stereotypes of the day, sparing none of the main characters (or even the minor ones!). He has no favourites – they all cop his irreverent and often hilarious treatment, much to the reader’s benefit. This delectable sense of wicked fun in Chekhov’s telling of the story is all but missing from the movie, although there are some quiet chuckles to be had in places.</p>
<p>Of course, film is a very different medium from literature, and any adaptation must necessarily deviate from the source material, but an important addendum is that omissions and modifications should not compromise the movie itself. </p>
<p>A scene in which Laevsky lies prone and naked while his maid flagellates him is a case in point. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I recall nothing like this in the original (I confess, though, it’s a long while since I read it). That&#8217;s not the issue, though. The problem is the flagellation scene is a crude and rather clumsy metaphor for Laevsky’s self-loathing and apparent sexual repression, and tonally inappropriate. </p>
<p>Ditto Laevsky&#8217;s barking like a dog when overwrought &#8211; is he temporarily insane or feigning? It matters not. He is fully recovered by the next day. Huh?</p>
<p>Chekhov is never crude or hamfisted like this. It’s unfortunate that elements of the script should grate thus, when the filmmakers have otherwise succeeded so brilliantly in faithfully adapting the novella to the screen.</p>
<p>If you’re into period pieces, this visually lush, beautifully filmed and well-performed work is worth the price of a ticket. If you’re into Chekhov, I’m not sure you’ll be all that thrilled with what’s on offer here.</p>

<strong>Review 1:</strong> rolanstein<br />
<strong>Review 2:</strong> Karen</p>
<p><strong>Story:</strong><br />
<em>Driving through the South Australian outback en route to a job interview, drifter Colin (David Lyons) witnesses a fatal rollover when a speeding driver swerves to avoid an oncoming car. The other driver, Jina (Emma Booth), is unhurt. Colin comes across a case stuffed with money in the dead driver’s car, takes it without divulging the contents to Jina and gives her a lift to her nearby homestead. He subsequently makes for the nearest small town, locates the head cop, Frank (Jason Clarke), and hands the loot in. </em><span id="more-3863"></span></p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/swerve-pic-1.jpg" alt="" title="swerve pic 1" width="597" height="396" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3872" /></p>
<p><em>Colin reluctantly accepts an insistent invitation from an outwardly friendly but inwardly suspicious Frank to stay the night at his home, and is startled to discover that Jina is his wife – and an opportunistic seductress with dangerous sub-agendas. </p>
<p>When the case of money goes missing from the cop shop, and with jealousy, greed, paranoia, misunderstanding, murder and a crooked city drug squad cop (Travis McMahon) soon in the mix, Colin finds himself in a small town vipers’ nest, inextricably caught as the innocent party in a deadly three-way fight for the loot.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Review 1</strong> (rolanstein)<br />
<em>Swerve</em> opens with a drug rendezvous on a remote dusty outback plain extending uninterrupted on all sides to the horizon. A man waits casually beside his car as a driver speeds towards him from afar. Contraband and money are exchanged wordlessly. The pick-up driver accelerates away from whence he came, tastes the dope and realises he’s been dudded, slams on the brakes and turns back. The drug supplier splits his attention between the oncoming car and a stopwatch he has in his hand. We know what’s coming, and we’re not disappointed. As the countdown hits zero the approaching car explodes in a fireball. </p>
<p>Subject this early stage of the narrative to logical scrutiny and it falls apart. Wouldn’t any pro pick-up driver taste the wares before he parted with the bucks? Certainly before he zoomed off into the distance&#8230;? And wouldn’t a drug drop-off in a remote area be attended by more than one member of each dealing party?</p>
<p>Well of course, but why spoil the fun? Besides, only the most <em>anal</em>ytical of viewers would subject this opening scene to such narrow-eyed assessment while it is in progress, because there are better things to focus on. The grandeur of the vast outback, for example, and the wonderful camerawork that captures it. The agoraphobic quality of this scene recalls Hitchcock’s classic open road cornfields crop duster attack scene in <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_by_Northwest">North By Northwest</a></em>. There is no cover, nowhere to hide, making this rendezvous of the lawless an act of lethally ironic mutual trust. So, while this gripping opening might not make complete sense and has more than a touch of déjà vu about it, it is well executed and full of tension. And that sets the standard for the rest of the film. </p>
<p>It soon becomes evident that we’re in familiar territory– noir pulp thriller – but lifted out of the American setting we associate with films of this genre and stamped with a distinctly Australian brand, there’s a freshness here deriving from this cultural and geographical reorientation. </p>
<p>The fundamentals and character types of the genre are present: the newcomer in town, the femme fatale, the local small-town cop taking the law into his own hands, the high stakes multi-party quest after ill-begotten booty. However, there are no neon lights shimmering on rainy streets, no venetian blinds casting shadows in dim-lit apartments, and not a lot of the action is enshadowed. This is noir in the glare of the outback sun, in the sinister bowels of a derelict mining shaft, on remote bumpy short-cut dirt tracks, on the Indian Pacific train.</p>
<p>While there is a predictability – well, more an inevitability – about the narrative and characters, the writing is smart, distinguished by a sleight of hand that conceals the liberties being taken with logic and realism, fooling us into accepting the narrative as plausible. Or plausible enough, at least.</p>
<p>When it’s not, as is sometimes the case  – such as when Frank jumps from a bridge on to the roof of one of the carriages of the Indian Pacific as it tears along at full throttle, then subsequently appears inside, unscathed – we don’t mind at all. In fact, we chuckle wryly along with the filmmakers. They’re having fun, we’re having fun. But not so much as to compromise the dramatic tension so vital in a thriller. It’s a tense ride, intriguing all the way to the credit roll, despite the familiar shape of the narrative. And very well paced throughout, which is where so many thrillers fall short. </p>
<p>The sophisticated multi-pronged narrative is tight, character motivations are well set up and psychologically credible, and the dramatic fundamentals are duly respected while avoiding any sense of storytelling-by-numbers. </p>
<p>The performers thrive on the well-managed script. You get the sense that they relished their roles. I particularly enjoyed Emma Booth’s pulpy take on her character – she’s a smokin’ hot femme fatale in that adult cartoonish way of this genre. But really, I’m giving into my hubba hubba whoo whoo whoo side in isolating her for mention. All the actors are good.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/swerve-3.jpg" alt="" title="swerve 3" width="672" height="420" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3873" /></p>
<p><em>Swerve</em> ain’t gonna be up for any prestigious awards. It’s pure entertainment that aims to put bums on seats, and makes no pretence to be anything else. But it’s well-crafted, strikes an intriguing tone, and gets all the important stuff right. And I have to say, I found it a refreshing change from the usual hip-conscious urban-grim arthouse Aussie fare. </p>
<p>This baby is not up with beauties like <em>No Country For Old Men</em>, but it’s a damn sight better than, say, <em>The Killer Inside Me</em>. And a lot of other such American product. It’s hard to compare with other Aussie films of this ilk because there are so few, but I reckon it’s out on its own in that respect, at least among the scant offerings of recent years. Recommended, unless you’re a film snob.</p>
<hr />
<strong>Review 2</strong> (Karen)<br />
The opening scene of <em>Swerve</em> is a promise of good things to come.  It’s beautifully framed and allusive.  The junction of many roads, seen from above, suggests the variety of directions a storyline – or a life – might take, and the ensuing film doesn’t disappoint as the main characters soar and dive on a narrative rollercoaster that reaches a climax on the Indian Pacific train.</p>
<p>Director Craig Lahiff has used a talented production team and competent cast to create a slick movie that’s a whole heap of fun. It tips you the wink early with a billboard advertising the Neverest Hotel that you can sit back and enjoy the ride. And enjoy it I did.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/swerve-pic-2.jpg" alt="" title="swerve pic 2" width="595" height="395" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3874" /></p>
<p>The premise is good – a drugs/money exchange goes explosively wrong, and an innocent passer-by, Colin (David Lyons), ends up with a briefcase full of money.  But hang on, what is he doing? Handing it in to the police? And lighting out as soon as his car is fixed? Of course not! He’s stuck there in the outback town of Neverest; and the local cop Frank (Jason Clarke) pals up with him; and the cop’s wife Jina (Emma Booth), well, she’s a complication-and-a-half. And, natch, a villain is after that money, and Frank turns out to be crooked, and violent, and Jina’s looking for a way out, and Neverest is swarming with police there for a Battle of the Bands(!), and the fun begins.</p>
<p>The plot has holes as deep as the disused mineshaft that figures in the action, and while in a theatre a badly constructed play has people entering and exiting every five minutes, this film has to shift characters in cars hither and thither, so there are a lot of road scenes.  But you forgive the stupid decisions that put characters in danger because the dangerous bits are so wonderfully scary, and the road scenes have the fabulous backdrop of the Flinders Range in South Australia.</p>
<p><em>Swerve</em> has the feel of scary pantomime. You groan, cover your eyes, and want to scream at the actors: “Don’t go back there! Look behind the desk! Don’t trust her/him!”  I said the cast were competent, but I wasn’t damning with faint praise.  They do as much as the script asks of them, which isn’t much: this isn’t a character study after all, and it certainly doesn’t have the richness of, say, Gregor Jordan’s 1999 cracker, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Hands_%281999_film%29">Two Hands</a></em>.  But it’s a hugely entertaining thriller.  Go and see it!</p>

<p><strong>Story:</strong><br />
<em>Romeo (Jérémie Elkaïm) and Juliette (Valérie Donzelli) are a hip young Parisian couple whose care-free and spontaneous world is smacked off its axis when their toddler son, Adam, is diagnosed with a rare and aggressive brain cancer. With a background media announcement of the US invasion of Iraq providing a chronological marker, Romeo and Juliette find themselves on a battlefield of their own, engaged in an epic war against their son’s disease, an unpredictable and enigmatic enemy threatening everything they cherish.</em><span id="more-3835"></span></p>

<p><strong>Review 1</strong> (rolanstein)<br />
I try to start with a blank slate as a reviewer, preferring to know as little as possible about the movie I am to assess. Of course, this is an ideal that is usually compromised by viewing trailers or coming across various sources of information online in the course of routine web browsing. </p>
<p>In this instance, I knew in advance that <em><a href="http://www.ifcfilms.com/films/declaration-of-war">Declaration Of War</a></em> was an autobiographical piece, that the filmmakers/lead actors were the parents of a child who had been struck down with cancer. That meant, I assumed, that this was to be an authentic depiction of their ordeal and that of their son.</p>
<p>Not easy to review, then. Parts of the film that didn’t ring true to me were beyond questioning, weren&#8217;t they? Who am I to pick fault with dialogue or character behaviour directly informed by the real-life experience of the filmmakers? On the face of it, the same might be said of any film, but this is different. Only the parents of a child afflicted by cancer can truly know what it takes to negotiate a path through this dark territory.</p>
<p>This bothered me. I felt tethered. I found myself breaking my blank slate rule, poring over an interview with Valérie Donzelli – and discovered that I was fretting over nothing. </p>
<p>Donzelli: <em>The film is autobiographical insofar as Jeremie and I have had a child who fell gravely ill. The facts are very close to what we went through, but the film isn’t our story.</em> </p>
<p>OK. Unshackled! Review proper starts here.</p>
<p>I should acknowledge that I wasn’t looking forward to this movie. Where&#8217;s the appeal of a film about a little kid with cancer? If it’s done well, it will be gruelling. If not, it will be drowning in sentiment (the dire Australian child cancer flick <a href="http://www.matchingjack.com/">Matching Jack</a> comes to mind). No win, either way.</p>
<p>Well, I’m pleased to report that <em>Declaration Of War</em> is about the parents, not the child. And it’s determinedly unsentimental (sometimes too determinedly). </p>
<p>Rather than focus on the tragic implications of Adam’s diagnosis, Romeo and Juliette refuse to be cowered by the disease and the havoc it wreaks on their lifestyles and routines. When the inevitable “why us?” question is vocalised by Romeo, Juliette replies: “Because we can overcome this.”</p>
<p>This conviction informs their battle plan and shines a light through the darkness and confusion of the daunting way ahead. Not least of the trials they face is the hospital milieu itself: the closed inner sanctum of the surgeons; the confronting appointments with medical specialists who yield vital information about Adam’s condition only in response to the parents’ questions, volunteering nothing of their own accord; conflicting directions from ward staff. Anyone with experience of cancer treatment and the bewildering shunting around from one venue and specialist to another will readily identify with Romeo and Juliette’s plight.</p>
<p>The unmistakable sense of authenticity is enhanced by the fact that much of the film was shot on location in the same hospital the filmmakers had attended when their own child was under treatment, with the cast members including hospital staff performing their real-life roles. </p>
<p>A technical aside:<br />
The hospital scenes were shot using a Canon stills camera(!), utilising well-lit areas to minimise extra lighting requirements.</p>
<p>Romeo and Juliette’s ammunition in their war against the cancer is positivity, which mostly comes across as courageous and credible, if a little perverse at times. To wit, an exchange in which they seek to trivialise the disease by trumping each other’s blackly comic future scenarios for Adam:<br />
“He could have cancer and be a dwarf.”<br />
“He could have cancer, be a dwarf and be black.”<br />
“He could have cancer, be a dwarf, black and Jewish.”<br />
&#8220;He could have cancer, be a dwarf, black, Jewish and gay.”<br />
And so on. Not an entirely original routine, but acceptable enough in the circumstances.</p>
<p>Less so is Romeo’s comedic exaggerated creeping through the hospital corridors as he leads Juliette and Adam out of the hospital in contravention of regulations for an afternoon at the seaside. The seaside part is fine; the escape by cartoonish stealth from the hospital seems forced, inappropriate, and a bit silly.</p>
<p>Soon after, comes the high point of the movie, which more than compensates for this lapse. Adam survives a dangerous operation to remove the tumour, but the surgeon discovers that it has infiltrated the brain stem. Romeo and Juliet conceal the worsening prognosis from their parents, other relatives and friends who are waiting outside the hospital with champagne in anticipation of a good surgical result. Celebrations erupt as the couple emerges to announce that the surgery has been successful. Very affecting stuff.</p>
<p>In a opening scene of the movie, we see a healthy older Adam with Juliet, and know therefore that a happy ending awaits. Rather than detract from the suspense, this foreknowledge focuses attention on the &#8216;how&#8217; rather than the &#8216;what&#8217;, the parents’ experience of the cancer war, rather than its outcome. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, from the viewer’s point of view, it comes as a relief as the film approaches its end when there is a time shift to an 8-year-old Adam (played by Donzelli and Elkaïmon&#8217;s son, Gabriel) at the beach with his parents. The family has endured endless battles, but they have won the war. The victory comes at a personal cost, however, as we learn just prior to the credit roll.</p>
<p>For all its merits in very realistically depicting a world that most parents are spared through sheer good fortune, there are aspects to the film that don&#8217;t work terribly well. The use of voiceovers as an exposition device and narrative prop is distracting and confusing at times, especially since the voices issue from multiple speakers of both genders that are never identified. Further, the voiceovers were often extraneous, merely describing unnecessarily what was going on on screen. </p>
<p>Then there are the names of the lead characters, Romeo and Juliet. Bit naff, what? And Adam for the kid &#8211; well, I baulk at these kinds of obvious mythical references. But it ain&#8217;t a war crime I&#8217;m bitching about here, just a fairly minor irritation.</p>
<p>Of greater concern, I found myself wondering about the point of the film. I mean, to be flippant for a moment, root canal surgery is a profoundly disturbing and challenging experience, too. It’s a big thing for many of us, a personal human drama to be sure (albeit mercifully short and transient relatively speaking), but does this in itself justify fictionalised filmic coverage? </p>
<p>Wrong way, go back! </p>
<p>I realised shortly into the credit roll that <em>Declaration of War</em> is above all <em>a tribute</em>! This is its point. It is a tribute to the hospital staff, the surgeons, the friends and family who supported the couple through their ordeal, the child whose spirit and courage helped to pull him through. It is a tribute that applies to one case of child cancer, and to all cases. And perhaps most of all, the movie is Donzelli&#8217;s and Elkaïm’s tribute to each other. In this sense it is, indeed, a love story.</p>
<p>All in all, not a great film, but a worthy one remarkable for the autobiographical input of the filmmakers and the life-affirming spirit and sense of authenticity they bring to the work.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Review 2</strong> (Karen)<br />
The subject matter of <em>Declaration of War</em> – the experience of a couple when their son is diagnosed with a serious illness – would not normally have me clamouring to get to the cinema.  But I was curious about how “the French” – so often preoccupied with style, beauty, and marital and extra-marital relationships – would deal with a more serious matter. And in this case “the French” are in fact the couple who in real life went through the trauma of having their son diagnosed with a brain tumour. Valérie Donzelli and Jérémie Elkaïm wrote the film, she directs, and they play the lead roles, the improbably and irrelevantly named Romeo and Juliette. I was hopeful that the filmmakers’ personal experience would deliver deep insights in a tender, moving tale.  </p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>There are no plot surprises, so it’s not a spoiler to say that the kid lives and seems pretty well. (Donzelli and Elkaïm’s son plays the child, Adam, in the opening and closing scenes.) I’m glad for him – but the film is not about him.  It’s all about the parents: how they met, their adorable courtship, their immortal love&#8230;</p>
<p>Romeo and Juliette have a baby in double quick time, and struggle from day one.  Little Adam is fretful, both parents are exhausted. Nevertheless this was the opportunity for the filmmakers to establish the depth and beauty of the mother/child bond, and it just didn’t happen. Donzelli, although beautiful (she looks like a young Julianne Moore), has an immobile face, and while this blankness suits the later scenes where she is coping with an onslaught of bad news, it’s curiously off-putting early.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t want to be mean to someone whose child had a brain tumour and who went through the whole testing, diagnosis, surgery, radiation therapy, testing, testing, testing grind with him.  But this is a film about that experience, and frankly I reckon it’s a turkey.</p>
<p>Just for starters the tone is all over the place. There are madcap sequences inserted into what is essentially a blow by blow narrative of the course of Adam’s treatment.  Comic urgency about the preparations for a last-minute train journey to Marseille are ridiculous (what is the point of the babysitter with the funny walk?), and what are we meant to make of the couple’s exaggerated mime-sneak out of the hospital to enjoy a bit of freezing on-shore wind?</p>
<p>Nearly every man-Jacques of the couple’s extended family overreacts wildly to the various diagnoses: Romeo howls in the street, falls to his knees, and smashes his phone, while Juliette goes on a surreal running flight along deserted hospital corridors before collapsing to the floor, from where she is eventually picked up by an impassive bulky orderly and delivered wordlessly back to the waiting room. I guess it’s all part of the job in a paediatric oncology hospital.</p>
<p>Romeo and Juliette cleave together, and the more successful scenes show them sharing their fears and questions.  A funny dialogue about what Adam’s future might hold after his surgery is politically incorrect and feels real, and a late scene where Romeo finally asks, “Why did this happen to us?” also rings true. But a duet where the couple sing of their love is incredibly naff.  I would quote some lyrics but my eyes were bulging in amazement and I lost focus on the subtitles.<br />
If you thought Parisians were sophisticated, cultured and enviable for any reason whatsoever, this song, as well as the ugly urban settings, dingy overcrowded hospitals and a couple of daggy parties will prove otherwise.</p>
<p>“Faction” offers no real narrative arc, no climax, no resolution. The film is hastily wrapped up with a voiceover telling us the outcome, and offering a clichéd uplifting ending, with a healthy Adam frolicking on the beach with his parents.  They all clinch and turn to the light; pull focus; fade to white. Sheesh.</p>
<p>Finally, the couple’s relentless smoking throughout the film must be mentioned. Hell, they can even smoke on a moving motorcycle. There’s no medical knowledge to be gained from this film, no clue as to why the child developed an aggressive brain tumour, and I don’t suggest that they gave their kid cancer.  But seriously, guys &#8230; allo?</p>

<p><strong>Featuring:</strong> Jiro Ono, Yoshikazu Ono, Takashi Ono<br />
<strong>Director &#038; cinematographer:</strong> David Gelb<br />
<strong>Australian release date:</strong> May 10, 2012<br />
<strong>Review:</strong> rolanstein</p>
<p>When I started baking sourdough bread, about 3 years ago now, I was alight with new obsession. I bought bread book after bread book, spent unseemly hours on bread forums, ploughed through many different recipes and techniques, extended my sourdough baking repertoire from breads to panettone, bagels, hot cross buns, stollen, fougasse, Kouign Amann (I’d never heard of it, either)&#8230;</p>
<p>Over time, and with the mania of obsession giving way to mere baking compulsion, I’ve begun to understand that repetition, not range, is the key to incremental improvement of all the little subtle elements &#8211; the unending minutiae &#8211; that separate the able craftsman from the master.<span id="more-3789"></span></p>
<p>Elderly American-based (Vermont) French baker <a href="http://www.farine-mc.com/2009/11/meet-baker-gerard-rubaud.html">Gérard Rubaud</a> is one such master. Rubaud has developed a single variety of mixed-grain bread that he repeats endlessly, fresh milling his grain himself for every bake, adjusting and tweaking his leaven and dough like a violin maestro tuning a Stradivarius. His bread is reputedly superb and in great demand from surrounding outlets, but supplies are extremely limited: Rubaud bakes alone, doing everything he can manually and using a traditional wood-fired oven, unwilling to compromise his quest for premium quality bread in any way. </p>
<p>Rubaud has a Japanese kindred spirit in 85-year-old sushi master Jiro Ono. However, Jiro’s obsessive devotion to his culinary craft and to the impossible quest for perfection far exceeds even Rubaud’s uncompromising extremes – for 70 of his 85 years, he has been doing little else but making, eating and yes, dreaming of sushi! There is a Japanese word for a craftsman like Jiro, whose expertise derives from repetition of process over many years: Jiro is a <em>shokunin</em>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/jiro-dreams-of-sushi-1.jpg" alt="" title="jiro-dreams-of-sushi-1" width="588" height="330" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3811" /> </p>
<p>With his eldest son and sushi-meister heir apparent Yoshikazu and a small, select crew of apprentice staff (an apprenticeship spans decades, so exacting are the master’s standards), Jiro runs a modest 10 seat restaurant in a Tokyo subway station called Sukiyabashi Jiro. The establishment has become a site of pilgrimage for sushi lovers the world over since being awarded a 3 star rating &#8211; the highest possible &#8211; by that Bible of foodies (some would say food snobs), the Michelin Guide. No other sushi establishment has been rated thus.</p>
<p>A 20 course sushi banquet overseen by the master costs $300, is served at stools along a small counter, and is over in 30 minutes! Sukiyabashi Jiro is booked up months in advance. Jiro must be rolling in yen, but he cares not at all for money. His work is his pride, his joy, his meaning in life. </p>
<p>This is never so apparent as when he prepares for his clientele. The seating arrangements along the counter are discussed in detail, reviewed, re-organised according to gender and status. Acclaimed food critics and regulars are awarded pride of place along the counter, seated in the best vantage points from which to watch Jiro watching them! </p>
<p>As he acknowledges, his staff do all the hard work and preparation (eg: massaging an octopus for 40 minutes to ensure its flesh is tender) while he puts the finishing touches to the sushi and fine-tunes the presentation &#8211; which is as precise, symmetrical and salivary gland activating as you might imagine, aided and abetted by some tantalising and excruciatingly delectable close-ups. Part of this fine-tuning involves reducing the size of the portions of sushi served to female clients. And a good thing too, I say – leaves more for us blokes.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/sushi.jpg" alt="" title="sushi" width="800" height="450" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3806" /></p>
<p>A note on sushi-eating etiquette for those who might be inspired to head to Tokyo to experience Sukiyabashi Jiro first-hand: apparently, one takes all of an item of sushi into one’s mouth at once – no nibbling, or biting it in half. Oh, and Jiro, not you, determines and applies sauces, wasabi etc and how much is right for each of the 20 different types of sushi he serves up.</p>
<p>As the meal progresses Jiro finesses his presentation and serving performance according to the responses of his devotees.  The old master’s poker-faced but intense bespectacled scrutiny of his customers as they load his exquisite minimalist works of culinary art on to their tongues is unsettling. Indeed, one Japanese food critic who is a long-term advocate of Sukiyabashi Jiro confesses that he still feels nervous eating there! </p>
<p>While much of the film centres on the elaborate and entirely fascinating back-of-house preparations at Sukiyabashi Jiro (always overseen by the infinitely fastidious Jiro), there are some equally intriguing glimpses into the early morning activities at the premium fish markets from which Jiro sources his tuna and other seafood. Jiro’s favoured vendors are themselves experts of the highest order.</p>
<p>There are some disturbing observations on the depletion of world fish stocks. Some traditional varieties of sushi are no longer on Jiro’s menu because the types of fish used in their making are no longer commercially available, or are so rare as to be priced out of the market – unaffordable even for Jiro and his elite clientele.</p>
<p>We do not learn much of Jiro’s personal life (perhaps because he is so immersed in making sushi that he doesn’t have one!). We are given some meaningful fragments that assist in sketching a background that might hold some keys to his character and extraordinary life choices. For example, he and his brother were abandoned by their parents in childhood and left to cope for themselves. At 15, Jiro found his way into the world of sushi restaurants, and so discovered his destiny. </p>
<p>Single-minded devotion to a calling has a toll, of course. Jiro has no recreational pursuits, and views holidays as a waste of time that could be far better spent making sushi. We see nothing of his wife. His relationship with his sons is emotionally inexpressive, and he comes across as stern, though not uncaring. When his younger son, Takashi, flies his old man&#8217;s famous coop to start his own sushi restaurant, papa gives his paternal blessing but adds that there is no way back. Takashi must succeed or bust. Tough love? Well, perhaps, but in view of Jiro&#8217;s experience of abandonment in childhood, perhaps he knows no other way. Being cut loose worked for him &#8211; or did it? That is a question that haunted me long after I left the cinema.</p>
<p>Range or repetition? Or is the choice not so black and white?</p>
<p>Whatever, this film is a gentle character study, oblique yet captivating, and free of any sense of judgment. Further, it&#8217;s an intriguing glimpse into the zen-like business of creating exquisite sushi. But above all, it is a visual celebration of the sensory delight of fine food that transcends the in-yer-face food porn of TV celeb cooking shows, and will have you rushing to your favourite sushi bar without passing Go! It may be discouraging for those who like to DIY sushi at home, though. Sukiyabashi Jiro severely undermines the truism that nothing beats good ol&#8217; home-made tucker!</p>
<p>Then again, I know that home-made sourdough bread beats the hell out of most bread you can buy, and if mine doesn&#8217;t measure up to Gerard Rubaud&#8217;s (which it surely doesn&#8217;t), well, what&#8217;s wrong with having the bar raised high? Gives yer something to aim for! And as every craftsperson knows, it&#8217;s the journey that matters most, not the getting there.</p>
<p>I find it gratifying that in this dreary time of trash-populist-culture, rampant materialism and careerism based largely on financial reward there are quietly triumphant craftsmen around like Rubaud and Jiro who have truly answered a calling, and for whom money and material gain are irrelevancies next to the ideals of perfectionism that drive them. Here&#8217;s to the <em>shokunin</em>! </p>

<p>I was fortunate as a child to attend just about every national and international production that made it to <a href="http://www.hismajestystheatre.com.au/">His Majesty&#8217;s Theatre</a>: musicals, operas, ballet, choral concerts, we missed nothing. I&#8217;m ever grateful to my mother for her commitment to exposing her brood to live theatrical events. These childhood experiences were not only magical in themselves, but set up an enduring love of live performance art.<span id="more-3751"></span> </p>
<p>Among many highlights, my most vivid memories include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marcel Marceau&#8217;s entrancing mimed depiction of Edgar Allen Poe&#8217;s tale of claustrophobic terror, <em>The Cask of Amontillado</em></li>
<li>A local Italian opera singer (way too corpulent for his role as the romantic male lead) at the tragic climax of Bizet&#8217;s magnificent <em>Carmen</em> &#8211; still my favourite opera &#8211; dropping to his knees and with arms outstretched sobbing a rolled-&#8217;r&#8217; lament: &#8220;Carrrrmen! Carrrrrrrmen!&#8221; I&#8217;d never encountered anything so dramatic, so impassioned, so overwhelmingly affecting. I still tear up recounting that scene.</li>
<li>The wondrously poetic and enchanting <em>Swan Lake</em> &#8211; Tchaikovsky&#8217;s musical score, the gorgeously costumed ballerinas who seemed the very epitome of female grace and beauty, the distracting and giggle-inducing lewdness of the male dancers&#8217; tights&#8230; And that most poignant of endings! The dance of the dying swan is up there with &#8220;Carrrrmen! Carrrrrrrmen!&#8221; as one of the unforgettable highlights of those wonderful childhood outings to His Majesty&#8217;s. Just the culture for a budding melancholic&#8230; </ul>
<p>Since <em>Swan Lake</em> &#8211; the classical version &#8211; is special for me, I was slightly apprehensive about <a href="http://www.sharmillfilms.com.au/?p=1604">Matthew Bourne&#8217;s reinterpretation</a>. I&#8217;d caught the trailer, which featured a flock of ferocious-looking, bare-chested, sweaty male swans with black diamond stripes like warpaint dividing their foreheads. Something&#8217;s going on here and you don&#8217;t know what it is, do you Mr Jones? </p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Richard-Winsor-Flocking_scene.jpg" alt="" title="Matthew Bourne&#039;s SWAN LAKE. 15-12-2009" width="640" height="427" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3770" /></p>
<p>Clearly, I deduced, Bourne&#8217;s <em>Swan Lake</em> was a radical contemporisation. I&#8217;m not a fan of contemporised classics, generally. Detested Buzz Lurhmann&#8217;s <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, for example. </p>
<p>Then there was the 3D aspect. An enhancement, or a distracting gimmick?</p>
<p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, forget about your biases and expectations. Apart from the musical score, which is comfortingly familiar, this is <em>Swan Lake</em> deconstructed, re-conceived and reassembled beyond recognition. It is way beyond &#8216;interpretation&#8217;. Far more radical than, say, Sid Vicious&#8217; junked punk version of Sinatra&#8217;s standard, <em>My Way</em>. And while it is subversive (and indeed, not far removed from the spirit of punk) in all sorts of ways, to label it so is to sell it short. </p>
<p>This is my problem here: how to critique this stunning piece without hanging labels on it that might foster off-putting assumptions on the part of the reader. A contemporised <em>Swan Lake</em> that replaces the female swan contingent with a battery of aggressive male dancers in feathery trousers? If I was reading this critique, I&#8217;d be going pah to that &#8211; not interested! A psycho-dramatic reworking of <em>Swan Lake</em> dealing with oppressed sexuality and high society homophobia?  Pah again! An angry satirical statement in dance unrecognisably mutated from <em>Swan Lake</em> that comically and savagely references the British Royal Family via a crass Fergie-like commoner character and a snobbish, maternally cold, controlling queen who emasculates her son?  Gimme a break! </p>
<p>My task is an impossible one. Matthew Bourne&#8217;s <em>Swan Lake</em> is all of the above, but much, much more, and <strong>so extraordinary that no label fits.</strong>  </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just cut to the chase. This is truly awe-inspiring stuff that works brilliantly on a multitude of levels. There is a gripping narrative venturing into a  twilight zone where swan and human fall sexually, spiritually and ultimately tragically in love &#8211; not so different from the classical narrative, except that the lovers are male. And that makes<em> all</em> the difference! The traditional male-female love story bursts out of its mould and blooms like a dark flower wakening unto a much larger world that resists literal interpretation. </p>
<p>Symbolism is suddenly everywhere, psycho-analytic readings are invited if not implored (mein Gott, Freud would be rejoicing at the richness of this material), and issues of homosexual repression and homophobia beg larger, universally compelling considerations of the dualities and paradoxes of human sexuality, of parent-child relationships, of love in its many guises, of the struggle for self-actualisation in a society that preserves itself through enforcing the status quo, smothers individuality, marginalises The Other, yet allows the powerful all manner of hypocrisies and transgressions.</p>
<p>But that sounds all so complex. This is what matters: Matthew Bourne&#8217;s <em>Swan Lake</em> is impassioned, sensual, erotically charged, thought-provoking, powerfully affecting and very beautiful kinetic performance art of the highest order. It is wondrous that so much should be articulated wordlessly, through music and dance alone.</p>
<p>Well, not quite alone. There is the direction, camera work, lighting, sets, costuming. All combine, along with the musicians and performers, to create something artistically stupendous that is far greater than the sum of its parts (yes, I plead guilty to cliche &#8211; simply unavoidable I&#8217;m afraid).</p>
<p>And then there is the mesmerising Richard Winsor, who is a tour de force as the lead Swan/stranger. I&#8217;m no ballet aficionado, but you don&#8217;t need to be to recognise a performance as phenomenal and as powerful as this. Worth many times the price of admission. I&#8217;ll leave it at that.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/richard-winsor-for-blog.jpg" alt="" title="richard-winsor for blog" width="3226" height="4838" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3769" /></p>
<p>And what of the 3D? Filmed staged live performance is a format that often falls short, although with today&#8217;s technology the gap between live and filmed live is narrowing (anyone who has attended the National Theatre Live screenings will support that contention).  I suspect this magnificent work of Bourne&#8217;s would have stood up almost as well in conventional 2D, but 3D undoubtedly adds something special to dance through creating the illusion of space. Add to that the use of close-ups and other cinematographic dramatic enhancements, and I&#8217;d argue that the filmgoer is no longer ceding a live performance audience much at all. </p>
<p>Nothing can replace the sense of occasion and community of live theatre: the dressing up, the expectant murmuring of the crowd pre curtain-call, the tuning up of the orchestra, the luminescence of a lit stage. But in terms of visual acuity, of getting up close and personal to the performers, and indeed, of immersement in the performance, Matthew Bourne&#8217;s <em>Swan Lake </em>in 3D was superior to any live performance I&#8217;ve attended. It&#8217;s an experience as magical and moving as any I had in my childhood at His Majesty&#8217;s. I can&#8217;t wax any more lyrical than that.</p>
<p>No more superlatives. If you&#8217;re a ballet fan &#8211; just go! If you&#8217;re not, go anyway. </p>
<p>For the doubters, I&#8217;m going to resort to a dirty manipulative sales tactic: fear of loss. Miss this and you&#8217;ll have missed something very, very special. Why would you wilfully deprive yourself thus? </p>
<p>Showing at <a href="http://www.lunapalace.com.au/index.php?cin=events#209">Cinema Paradiso</a> (for Perthites) and across Australia this weekend only. Bloody GO, damn you!</p>

<strong>Review:</strong> rolanstein</p>
<hr />
<p>There’s a new demographic in town (well, outta town, actually): the middle-aged backpacker. </p>
<p>The boomer backpacker phenomenon seems to have erupted out of nowhere, almost overnight. When my partner and I travelled through Lombok in our forties – 15 years ago now &#8211; we came across few other backpackers of our vintage. Very few. Not too many about in Malaysia only 5 years ago, either. But when we went to Vietnam last year, there were greys lumping backpacks everywhere! A few weeks ago we encountered more of the same in Thailand. </p>
<p>Hollywood tapped into the demographic with <em>Eat Pray Love</em> (and, it might be argued, added to its momentum – Julia Roberts has a lot to answer for, going by reports on the escalation in gentrification of Ubud since the release of the movie). </p>
<p>The cynics in our midst – and lawd forbid that I be tarred with that bitter brush – might suggest that this latest old fart backpacker movie, <em><a href="http://theway-themovie.com/">The Way</a></em>, is driven primarily by a boomer-targeted marketing strategy. <em>Eat Pray Love</em> was a big winner at the box office. You can bet Hollywood will be hopping on the boomer-in-mid-life-crisis-does-a-geographical bandwagon until the wheels fall off.<span id="more-3743"></span> </p>
<p>Thing is, <em>The Way</em> is a heart-felt effort from director/screenwriter Emilio Estevez, too earnest to be dismissed as mere bandwagon hopping. Alas, good intentions are not enough to save the movie. </p>
<p>The set-up has promise. Thomas Avery (Martin Sheen) and his 30-something son Daniel (Emilio Estevez) have a bristly relationship arising from their sharply contrasting attitudes to life. The father prioritises career and comfort, the son adventure and challenging himself. Thomas’s stable suburban world is rocked when he receives a phone call from a French gendarme informing him that Daniel has been killed while hiking in the Pyrenees. He flies to France to bring home his son’s ashes, and makes an impulsive decision to complete the trek his son was attempting when killed. </p>
<p>The first sign of trouble ahead, filmically speaking, comes when Thomas meets the gendarme who broke the news of Daniel’s death. The gendarme states vaguely that Daniel perished during a storm while walking the Camino de Santiago, a Catholic pilgrimage route to Galicia, Spain, also known as the Way of St. James (‘The Way’). Incredibly, Thomas seeks no further details on his son’s death, yet listens attentively as the gendarme launches into a detailed rundown on The Way and its history that sounds like an excerpt from a travel guide book. This is the clumsiest and most amateurish instance of exposition I have come across in a movie in years.</p>
<p>It becomes apparent soon after Thomas hauls on his backpack and sets off on his trek that The Way is veritably packed with ‘pilgrims’. Narrative logic pedants like me can’t help but to wonder how poor Daniel managed to die out there as a result of exposure to severe weather with so much human traffic around, and dorms and other accommodation regularly spaced along the trail. Just damned unlucky, it seems (especially since the weather is benign for the rest of the movie!).</p>
<p>By and by, Thomas links up &#8211; reluctantly at first &#8211; with three other trekkers on personal quests: “Joost from Amsterdam” (as he routinely introduces himself), a chain-smoking Canadian biatch named Sarah, and Jack, an Irish poet with writer’s block. </p>
<p>Joost (Yorick van Wageningen) is the most successful of these characters. His simple aim in walking The Way is to lose weight. He wants to slim down for his brother’s coming wedding, but his primary motivation is that his wife won’t sleep with him unless he loses the flab (maybe he’d be better off losing the wife). He’s an endearing character, full of bon homie, and slightly Falstaffian in his irreverence and excesses. He flings himself on every tasty regional speciality that presents itself, and whips out a joint and offers it round at the slightest opportunity. Well, he’s Dutch, innee! National stereotyping, blatantly, but sorta forgivable if you can bring yourself to be charitable about it&#8230;and you can in Joost’s case.</p>
<p>Not so, Jack the Irishman (James Nesbitt – who else?). I have to admit to being heartily sick of this bloke, an Irish everyman whose acting range seems to me very limited. His opening scene here is an embarrassingly overacted and intensely irritating soliloquy that goes on interminably and establishes his character as – guess what &#8211; an eccentric, hard-drinkin’ Irish bohemian with a gripe against the Catholic church. Is there any cliché left out of that mix? </p>
<p>Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger) starts off with a bang, identifying her target, Thomas, as “Boomer” and sledging him and his generation off with an unprovoked volley of putdowns and accusations (self-centred, indulgent, quasi-spiritual, youth-coveting, young-chick-seeking blah blah). She’s no spring chicken herself, which rather diminishes the force of her generation-based attack. While her unoriginal critique of the Boomers is not without substance, it seems odd here, tacked on. It’s as if the screenwriter, not the character, has a generational score to settle and is proud of the rave, which he’s bloody well keeping in the script whether it fits or not.</p>
<p>An Amazonian Joni Mitchell with big thrusting tits and spray-on jeans, Sarah’s appearance is slightly distracting, and at odds with her manner and personal history. She’s supposed to be a victim of spousal abuse, but lookin’ at this gal you can imagine her decking any guy who laid a hand on her. Indeed, in a later scene that lacks any credibility, she reflexively socks poor old Thomas in the jaw. This aside, she’s an insubstantial character who runs out of puff after her strong introduction.</p>
<p>The clichés don’t stop with the characters. There is drinking and revelry at night &#8211; obligatory and fun on the road, but not so gripping filmed. Eccentric characters along the way, natch (those crazy colourful Continentals!), including one that is cartoonish in his silliness – an innkeeper who conducts a party with himself, switching chairs to take on different roles. OK in Monty Python, way outta place here. </p>
<p>There are panoramic shots of the four backpackers trudging along in single file profiled against the sky – quite a few of them. Wide shots of the four against sweeping rural backdrops. Etc. While the landscape is cinematically irresistible and its inclusion integral to the travel theme of the movie, there is not enough of substance going on in the human world. Too much travelogue, not enough narrative or character development.</p>
<p>The most dramatic scene of the movie is not a fictional construct but an excerpt from the real-life theatre of the Catholic church (now there’s an institution that knows how to work an audience). In the cathedral in Galicia that marks the end of The Way, a battery of clergy hoists a massive and lethally heavy thurible high into the vaults via a series of ropes and pulleys; it swings in massive arcs, swooping over the heads of the pilgrims, plumes of incense describing its dangerous trajectory. Jaw-dropping stuff, and wonderfully filmed.</p>
<p>The ending was always headed for anti-climax, since the characters are not well fleshed out and we don’t care enough about any of them, and coming after the cathedral scene a miserable fizzling out is assured. A last ditch attempt is made to save the characters’ inevitable respective transformations from cliché by denying each the objective they set out in quest of, but this uniform perverseness is too neat and obvious a strategy, and all too late.</p>
<p>Redeeming features? The cinematography is fine throughout. And Martin Sheen is as good as ever, giving his all to his lead role. But the woodpile is built hollow. Far more thought needed to be invested in the script, and perhaps more talent. I’m not sure Estevez has the goods as a writer to do the job solo. I&#8217;d be surprised if this turkey lasts long on the big screens before going to Blu-ray and video.</p>

<strong><br />
Director:</strong> Paolo Sorrentino<br />
<strong>Featuring:</strong> Sean Penn, Frances McDormand, David Byrne, Judd Hirsch, Harry Dean Stanton<br />
<strong>Review:</strong> Boomtown Rap guest reviewer, Karen<br />
Other reviews by Karen: <em><a href="http://www.boomtownrap.com/3491/the-artist-movie-review/">The Artist</a></em></p>
<hr />
<p>I vaguely remember reading somewhere that not swinging one’s arms while walking is indicative of some mental health issue.  Google suggests it’s autism; Sean Penn, in his characterisation of the superannuated rock star Cheyenne, may have had the same thing in mind as he slowly, with hunched shoulders and immobile arms, tiptoe-loped through the long, weird, disjointed road movie, <em><a href="http://www.hopscotchfilms.com.au/films/out-now/thismustbetheplace-film">This Must Be the Place</a></em>.</p>
<p>The Cheyenne character spans the ages from Voltaire’s wise-child Candide to the Beatles’ fool on the hill.  Modelled, apparently, on Robert Smith of The Cure, Penn’s Cheyenne speaks high in pitch and low in volume, like Michael Jackson, lives in an Irish country mansion with his capable, upbeat wife Jane (Frances McDormand), and calls none to mind so much as Ozzy Osbourne.<span id="more-3723"></span></p>
<p>The film spends way too much time establishing the facts of his current existence, while simultaneously failing to explain said facts.  We get pretty rapidly that he is retired from an iconic rock career; that he’s either bored or depressed (he thinks the latter, his wife suggests the former); that he feels responsible for some deaths (of fans); that he’s childless but connected in some way to a young woman, Mary, and her mother. All of this is presented in a fairly piecemeal way that’s at odds with the extraordinary camerawork that swoops, tracks, travels and dollies in long scenes that plain camerawork fans like me will find amazing and intrusive in equal measure.</p>
<p>A storyline that seems to be about the artistic value or musicianship of Cheyenne’s body of work is introduced early, never to resurface, and Cheyenne’s own doubts about his worth are revisited later in a gratuitous scene with David Byrne, who collaborated on the music for the film, and who appears in a brilliant but largely irrelevant set-piece that features more of the previously mentioned extraordinary camerawork. (In this case a wide shot of a stage travels back to encompass a band, then its audience, and pans, turning, to zoom in to a close up of Cheyenne at the back of the crowd. The stage mechanics in this scene are worth the price of admission alone; it’s a pretty speccy scene &#8211; but one that arguably did not belong in this story.)</p>
<p>The encounter with David Byrne happens in America, where Cheyenne has travelled by ocean liner to attend the death of his father. News of his father’s illness has arrived via a red telephone in the house of Mary’s mother &#8211; one of a few red telephones whose significance escaped me, along with the nature of his relationship to Mary’s mother. </p>
<p>The film does a sharp turn for its second half: now we discover that Cheyenne has come from a traditional Jewish family, from whom he has been estranged, and that his father, a Holocaust survivor, has spent his life tracking down his Auschwitz persecutor, one Aloise Lange, now resident in the US and possibly still alive.  Improbably, Cheyenne takes up the hunt, and what has been a character study turns into a road movie, complete with chance encounters, transformative brief relationships, and ultimately growth and redemption.</p>
<p>This is a really enjoyable film to watch, intriguing, puzzling, funny and unsatisfactory in turn. It’s not an artistic success, I don’t think: too many events simply don’t cohere (eg: there’s a character who lends his car to Cheyenne – who seems to be the least likely person in the entire universe to have a driver’s licence and to take on the task of driving around America – and who is never seen again, except in flashback when the car, again improbably, goes up in flames).</p>
<p>Further, the Holocaust theme is too big for the brief showing it gets, and the idea of the beauty of vengeance expounded by Lange in the climactic scenes, while huge and worthy of examination (in another film, perhaps), is completely separate from the experience that Cheyenne has had, the understanding he reaches, and the punishment he imposes.</p>
<p>And then the ending: come on! Resolve the central issue of your life, and give up on your hair dye and eyeliner. Yeah, right. I just didn’t buy it, and I still didn’t get who Mary’s mother was, and why she would be interested in the fact that Richard – whoever he was (yes, we met him in Brooklyn, or Queens, or wherever, but who was he?) – had grown into a fine handsome man.  Or why an ageing rocker would think it was a good idea to fix up his young friend Mary with a guy who listened to Mariah Carey!</p>
<p>All of these reservations aside, I reckon it’s a film worth seeing: for the performance of Sean Penn, for the luminous Frances McDormand, for the extras from Freak Central Casting, for the show-off camerawork (eat your heart out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passenger_%281975_film%29">Antonioni</a>!), for the low-key hero’s journey and the funky music track. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We didn&#8217;t do any sightseeing as such (temples etc) for some days into our time at PKK. We were content to just absorb the sights in our immediate surrounds. </p>
<p>After &#8216;breakfast&#8217; (ie: 10.30am or later), we might wander along the seafront promenade and look out on that irresistible bay, in between sizing up the restaurants in advance of lunch or dinner. We&#8217;d rarely last long traipsing about out in the sun before retreating to a premises with fans or aircon for a cold(ish) Singha. At 70 baht per 650ml bottle (53 in the supermarkets &#8211; about $1.75), other choices of beverage didn&#8217;t seem like choices at all.  </p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PKK-blog-8.jpg" alt="" title="PKK blog 8" width="586" height="441" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3639" /></p>
<p>Or we would amble uptown to change money, taking in the routines of the town as we went. You had to amble. It was too bloody hot to do otherwise. The heat is intruding on my recollections, just as it intruded on our days in PKK! Although the temperature was only low-mid 30s, it was a glaring sun and a relentless, humid and enervating heat. In the afternoons, a breeze would arrive to stir the soup but it was too warm to give much relief, apart from fanning sweat-soaked clothes and glistening necks and faces.<span id="more-3646"></span> </p>
<p>The breeze drops with the sun, leaving evenings still and balmy. Al fresco BBQ seafood restaurants set up chairs and tables along the promenade towards dark. Interestingly, the great majority of the clientele are local Thais &#8211; couples and family groups &#8211; with only a smattering of international tourists.  </p>
<p>We&#8217;d wait for the crowd to disperse a little and eat late. It was peaceful, almost meditative, sipping at a cold beer waiting the 30 minutes or so it takes to barbecue a whole snapper in foil, gazing out at the comforting chain of green lights from small squid boats stretching between the northern and southern headlands that mark the extremities of Prachuap bay. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/pkk-blog-8.jpg" alt="" title="pkk blog 8" width="588" height="386" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3675" /><em>The fish is barbecued in foil with lemongrass, oyster sauce, chilli, garlic and kaffir lime leaves. This was a large fish, enough for two hungry people, and cost about 300 baht ($10).</em></p>
<p>There is a good variety of fresh local seafood at these simple little BBQ restaurants:<br />
<img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PKK-blog-10.jpg" alt="" title="PKK blog 10" width="586" height="438" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3677" /><em>Not much flesh on these little blue swimmers, but o so sweet and delicate when you managed to get to it!</em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PKK-blog-11.jpg" alt="" title="PKK blog 11" width="587" height="437" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3678" /><em>Battered squid with dipping sauce: 90 baht ($3)</em></p>
<p>A few things surprised us. Firstly, Prachuap is a very clean town, uncommonly so for SE Asia. There is little litter in the streets, and the long, wide seafront promenade is kept spotless. The beige sandy beach below, which is all but reclaimed by the sea at high tide, looks pristine, but no bathers are to be seen, other than an occasional fisherman wading to or from his anchored boat. According to the owner of our hotel, the water is polluted with oil and detritus from the fleets of local fishing boats. </p>
<p>By day, cuttlefish, squid and fish sit drying in the sun on the promenade, meticulously arranged on racks, an intense fishiness pervading the air. Some might call it a stink. I like it &#8211; it says nuts to any tourists who turn their noses up. The drying racks are part of everyday life in PKK. Take it or leave it. Curiously, incidentally, no cats or flies are drawn to the slowly desiccating seafood.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/PKK-blog-2.jpg" alt="" title="PKK blog 2" width="585" height="439" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3604" /></p>
<p>Prachuap is remarkable for its unassertiveness as a tourist spot. In fact, it hardly qualifies as such. It’s a Thai town first, and a tourist destination a long way second. Long may it remain so.</p>
<p>There are only a few guesthouses and hotels, and no big luxe 4 or 5 star jobs. There are no discos, no girly bars, no happening pubs (unless you count karaoke night at the Hadthong Hotel &#8211; probably featuring mostly Thai pop songs!).  Nothing for the partying backpacker crowd, then. Or the old fart farangs on the hunt for young Thai trophies. Hua Hin, 100K north, takes good care of that demographic. </p>
<p>Tourism is on the creep in PKK, however. In my pre-trip research, I came across a couple of blogs from around 5 years ago warning that it was hard to find food after 9pm &#8211; certainly not the case now, although the restaurants that stay open late are all on the seafront. There is also a night market with a good array of hawker stalls, but the town itself shuts up shop very early, apart from a couple of small 24 hour supermarkets. </p>
<p>The local tourist trade picks up noticeably in the weekends; Bangkok folk after a breather begin rolling in by the busload on Friday night. Otherwise, there is a steady trickle of Caucasians, mostly middle-aged like us. The great majority are Scandinavian. Unlike us, most stayed only a couple of days. Perhaps they were just dropping in for a look on their way to a town 30K or so south solely comprising retired Swedes living off their generous super payments. We were told by a local Thai that the street signs are in Swedish and the shops are stocked with Swedish food and goods. Very annoying and a blight as far as I&#8217;m concerned. Evidently the Thais don&#8217;t agree &#8211; these ghettos of foreign retirees are scattered throughout Thailand and growing as the word spreads that living is easy on a decent pension, effectively fencing off some of the most pleasant areas.</p>
<p>The good news for PKK, at least from my perspective, is that the potential for tourist development is restricted because much of the surrounding land is owned by the military. The nearest swimming beach, Ao Manao, is accessible only via army land. Visitors are required to sign in and out at a check post as they travel to and from the beach. We saw no Western families at Ao Manao, but the Thais flock there in the weekends. The men lounge around on deckchairs among the mangroves sipping whiskey and water, while the women chat, watch the kids on the beach, and order frequent snacks like this from the nearby food courts:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PKK-blog-14.jpg" alt="" title="PKK blog 14" width="586" height="439" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3685" /><em>Som tam &#8211; Thailand&#8217;s famous firey green papaya salad. This looks better than it was. No chilli kick and not much flavour.</em></p>
<p>Some extol Ao Manao as a wonderful swimming site, but I wasn’t greatly impressed. For me, as a spoilt Aussie, crystal-clear water and fine white sand are essential prerequisites of a great beach. The sand at Ao Manao is greyish and although the water seems clean, it&#8217;s very shallow. Waders a couple of hundred metres out were still only waist deep. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a bonus on the way to Ao Manao, if you&#8217;re lucky &#8211; a small isolated colony of Spectacled Lemur living in a patch of jungle off the side of the road. We happened past at feeding time. An unexpected treat.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PKK-blog-12.jpg" alt="" title="PKK blog 12" width="331" height="440" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3690" /></p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PKK-blog-13.jpg" alt="" title="PKK blog 13" width="586" height="440" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3691" /><em>No funny business going on with Mum &#8211; baby Spectacled Lemur change colour as they mature.</em></p>
<p>Military possession of available land aside, unlike many other seaside locations in Thailand, PKK doesn&#8217;t <em>need</em> a thriving tourist industry. These guys are doing fine as they are. A bit more tourist traffic would no doubt be welcome, but I think the locals know they&#8217;ve got a good thing going in their charming little town, and will want to keep it that way.</p>
<p>The standard of living is obviously pretty good. We didn&#8217;t see a single beggar during our 7 day stay. Almost unheard of in SE Asia. I doubt anyone goes short of food in PKK. In fact, there&#8217;s a fair proportion of overweight folk among the locals. There are lots of fatties among the uniformed schoolkids who during recess descend on strategically positioned food carts and stalls serving Thai snack food. My partner, who travelled extensively in Thailand in the 80s and 90s, remarked that this was a notable change. Back then, to be overweight as a child &#8211; or an adult, for that matter &#8211; was to stand out, automatically qualifying for imaginative nicknames like &#8220;Owen&#8221; (translation: fat).</p>
<p>As the days of doing not much melded, we became agitated. Something was niggling at us. In previous trips we&#8217;d stayed switched to travelling mode, even when spending several days in one place. There was always at least a vague itinerary, a list of Essential Destinations, and you&#8217;d consider yourself a travelling failure to miss any of them. No matter how fascinating, pleasant, stimulating, or just plain fun a particular locale might be, we&#8217;d always pace ourselves, calculating how long we dared to indulge in mere holidaying before upping stumps and resuming the join the dots game. This time, the switch kept shutting off.</p>
<p>The guilt began to gnaw, the self-accusations fly. Lazy! Pathetic! 3 days in PKK, and you&#8217;ve hardly been anywhere. 4 days! 5! Get off your arse and see the temples, the fishermen&#8217;s village, the national park! Then pack the hell up and move on. Reclaim the right to call yourself a Traveller! </p>
<p>Then came the counter arguments. We like to be where the crowd ain&#8217;t. We like it quiet. And clean. And pretty. With character. Authentic. All boxes ticked. So why not stand still in a place like PKK, and let it reveal itself to you? Stationary travelling, man. Let&#8217;s call it that. </p>
<p>If only we&#8217;d gotten as clear as that during our stay in PKK, but alas the notion of stationary travelling came to me in hindsight, way too late to save us from our angst.</p>
<p>See, we weren&#8217;t really wasting time. We just thought we were. Staying in PKK without a sightseeing agenda, blatantly doing nothing for days on end when we <em>should</em> have been &#8216;travelling&#8217;, opened access to little things that might otherwise have slipped past as incidentals unworthy of note. Sometimes, you learn more about a place standing still than rushing about picking off the &#8216;sights.&#8217;</p>
<p>The old guy at the Chinese noodle soup place a couple of doors down from our hotel, eternally standing over a steaming pot, impassively stirring. He was there when I went past in the mornings, with a full house of customers slurping over their bowls. Still there in the afternoon, although closed for business. And late one night, when I was making a dash to the 24 hour Seven Eleven for some beer, there he was again. Tireless, a man who&#8217;d found his place as keeper of the pot.</p>
<p>A petite young woman with a portable coffee and drink stall set up on the footpath outside the bus ticket office, deftly serving up a steady stream of regulars with panache that would do any snooty cafe barista proud. I stood off to the side and watched her, unobtrusively I hoped, for quite a while. She never stopped. When she was not serving up espressos, iced coffees, or nimbly tying up plastic bags of takeaway beverages, she was wiping down her tiny working surface. She was doing very well indeed from her little business on wheels. Occasionally, she flashed me a shy smile. I think she knew I was admiring of her work and the pride she took in it. </p>
<p>Then there was the stunning ballbreaker prowling panther-like about her fruit and vege stall at the busy central market, hair piled high like Billie Holiday on one of her album covers. There was something of the mythical American South about this fierce and fascinating creature, a sense of rebellious, unshackled liberation, although she was probably born and bred PKK. She had a haughty aura about her, a withering authority she took for granted. As well she might, strutting around with her knockout figure, shapely hips a-swingin&#8217; in tight jeans, eye-popping cleavage on huge and brazen display, midriff exposed as she stretched for the bananas. Her husband, you just knew, was to be envied and pitied. </p>
<p>When I asked about some oranges, she sized me up contemptuously, impatient at having to waste time working out what this stupid farang wanted. She shot a volley of Thai at me, relishing my uncomprehension, then shoved the oranges I had asked for into a bag and barked out the price. A couple of visits later, a softness came over her &#8211; I had paid my dues &#8211; and she went to some trouble to fetch me a papaya from deep in a pile, the ripest and smallest she had. Perfect for two people for breakfast, and just what I would have asked for if I&#8217;d had the language. &#8220;Kob khun krap&#8221; I ventured, beaming. &#8220;Ka&#8221;, she replied with the air of a queen nodding to a bowing subject, then dismissed me and returned to her wares. What a woman!</p>
<p>And so it went. These are the rewards &#8211; a gradually building mosaic of town life &#8211; that await the stationary traveller. It&#8217;s probably the same in any Thai town not ravaged by tourism, but my bet is that few are as downright <em>pleasant</em> to hang in as PKK.</p>
<p>On our sixth day, we hired a tuk-tuk driver and finally got around to some sightseeing:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PKK-blog-16.jpg" alt="" title="PKK blog 16" width="587" height="441" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3698" /><em>Fearsome 9-headed cobras guard a temple on the way to the fishermen&#8217;s village.</em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PKK-blog-17.jpg" alt="" title="PKK blog 17" width="587" height="436" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3699" /><em>Fishermen&#8217;s village</em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PKK-blog-18.jpg" alt="" title="PKK blog 18" width="587" height="440" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3700" /><em>Another pic taken from the fishermen&#8217;s village. Looks picturesque, but the area is strewn with garbage. Our driver told us the fisherfolk make their habitat as unattractive as possible to discourage tourists!</em></p>
<p>On Day 7, we reluctantly called time on PKK. We could have stayed days longer, but were booked in that night at a hotel in Bangkok and with our visa time running out, had to work out which border to cross, and where. </p>
<p>There was one last treat in store. Years ago, when working as an ESL teacher, I had heard my Thai students raving about mango and sticky rice pudding. I was determined to track some down for this last breakfast in PKK. Tum, our hotel host, had mentioned that it was mango season, and that there was no better time or place to try the famous pudding. She directed me to a stall a couple of streets away. She anticipated that I wouldn&#8217;t find it, and when I returned predictably empty-handed, presented me with a takeaway pack. She had sent her staff out for it, and wouldn&#8217;t hear of me paying. </p>
<p>Madame J and I shared Tum&#8217;s gift with much oohing and ahhing. What a send-off!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PKK-blog-19.jpg" alt="" title="PKK blog 19" width="588" height="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3704" /><em>Not much of a pic, but quite simply, mango and sticky rice is one of the most delicious combinations imaginable, perfectly finished off with the most exquisite coconut sauce topping (in bag to left).</em></p>
<p>As we sat at the bus office, three thirties-something Russians, two male and one female, slopped past swigging out of cans of Chang. Not something I&#8217;d seen any locals doing. It seemed disrespectful. Their whole attitude seemed disrespectful. Then again, what do you expect from fucking Russians? </p>
<p>We sat in silence. By and by, a pretty local girl in smart office attire sitting next to us got up, sauntered to the roadside and flobbed into the gutter. </p>
<p>The bus came and we got on. There was an unsettling sense that our usual travel rhythm was out of whack. The call of the road seemed suddenly tiresome, which was no big deal &#8211; we were no strangers to travel fatigue. Thing is, this was the beginning of our trip, not the end! I cheered up when a 60s American hippy relic seated adjacent to us leaned over and said: &#8220;This must be the old long-haired farang section of the bus.&#8221; </p>
<p>He subsequently introduced himself as Steve. He was travelling with his deaf girlfriend, Andrea.</p>
<p>Turned out we had much in common. Conversation turned to Vietnam, where Madame J and I had travelled the year before, then to the war. Steve had missed out being conscripted due to a fortunate combination of circumstances. &#8220;Lucky for the army and me&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hate guns. Never even picked one up, never will. And I resent all forms of authority.&#8221; </p>
<p>I laughed out loud. It was good to be among like-minded folk. 5 hours from Bangkok, and all was well.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Prachuap Khiri Khan.&#8221; The very name fires the imagination! Its utterance rhythmic, musical, skipping off the palate. Its resonance mysterious, sensual, like an intimate phrase of endearment in an exotic tongue. But it&#8217;s just a fishing town in southern Thailand. And I&#8217;m a man overboard, floundering in nostalgia. </p>
<p>Travelling is so subjective. Take no notice of me. I don&#8217;t do travel advice. This is simply a personal piece I&#8217;m banging out to preserve memories I want to hold on to. Disingenuous? Of course. Who could make such a claim of a piece that is to be posted to the web? Do you need more proof that I cannot be trusted?<span id="more-3626"></span></p>
<p>We had no reason to suspect we would be charmed as we were. TripAdvisor &#8216;experts&#8217;, including a Thai lady resident in Bangkok, had cautioned against spending more than a day or two in PKK. Someone else suggested a day trip from Hua Hin would suffice. &#8220;Nice, but quiet and nothing to do&#8221; sums up the advice. Knowing that we generally like to take things slower than most, we planned on 3 or 4 days. </p>
<p>But we quickly adapted to PKK time, which is, shall we say, unhurried, and before we knew it we were 4 days in. We ended up staying for 7, and would have extended further if we hadn&#8217;t had that bloody 14 day visa deadline hanging over our heads. </p>
<p>A couple of easy days to begin with set up a rather lazy pattern. We would rise late, go downstairs to the airy and extremely pleasant hotel sitting area, and sip coffee gazing out at the always beautiful bay across the road. Sometimes a few of the tables were occupied by other guests, but often we had the area to ourselves. Wunderbar! </p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PKK-blog-6.jpg" alt="" title="PKK blog 6" width="587" height="439" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3636" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;d put off confronting the glare and heat outside as long as we could contain our guilt. The delightful owner of our hotel, Tum (&#8220;like the sound of a drum&#8221;) was always up for a chat, innocently abetting our avoidance tactics. Eventually, we&#8217;d venture out in search of a late breakfast. </p>
<p>Forget Western notions of breakfasty fare. As with other SE Asian cultures, Thais eat the same sort of things for breakfast as they have for lunch and dinner. We were hoping to track down banana pancakes or something egg-based, but nothing doing. Few of the seafront restaurants in PKK are ready for business before lunchtime, so our choice was limited. </p>
<p>A short but hot and sweaty walk along the seafront took us to a modest little place selling traditional Thai food. A steady stream of locals dropped in on motorbikes to take away plastic bags of curries and noodles (yes, noodles, not rice) to their workplaces. There were a few tables for those who wished to eat at the premises. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/PKK-blog-7.jpg" alt="" title="PKK blog 7" width="567" height="438" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3637" /> <em>The pots you see on the countertop contained the curries, which began the day hot, just cooked, and gradually cooled. A very basic operation, but read on&#8230;</em></p>
<p>The owners and staff spoke little English, but were welcoming of the two uncertain farangs gawking about trying to nut out how the ordering worked. Simple enough: point to what you wanted, and the stout cheery lady in charge would ladle it out on top of a bowl of noodles. Weirdly, we thought, the locals were selecting three or more curries and mixing them together. We decided to maintain the integrity of the dish and select just one: green chicken curry (yes, unadventurous, but it seemed reasonable to start with the familiar &#8211; which didn&#8217;t actually <em>look</em> all that familiar). It took a while for the serving lady to accept that we didn&#8217;t want to mix and match. </p>
<p>We sat down with our bowls, upon which pickled vegetables, condiments, sprouted peas and a huge plate of herbs and fresh greens were brought to the table. Everything was so fresh! And our green chicken curries with tiny round eggplants were superb! Bursting with aromatics, zinging with enough chilli to bring out a sweat while allowing the tantalising and perfectly balanced flavours full expression! One of the best meals we were to have in Thailand as it transpired. Total cost: 60 baht ($2) &#8211; for both of us. </p>

<p>We were on a high! PKK was delivering, Thailand was delivering, and this was only the start. How quickly the mood can change when travelling! </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researching Thailand as a travel destination was disturbing. So many accounts online gave the impression that the place was ruined, literally overrun by tourists. I knew that was the case in Phuket, which is why I&#8217;ve never bothered going there, but the entire country? Surely not.</p>
<p>Of course, there would be many towns, many places, with nary a farang in sight &#8211; probably because there was nothing much to see. Yes, we were after a glimpse beneath the bonnet of Thai society (and no traveller gets more than a glimpse, to which anyone who has lived in a foreign country initially travelled through will attest). But we&#8217;re not anthropologists! We wanted to do our glimpsing in locales with more going for them than mere &#8216;authenticity&#8217;! A gorgeous coastal town, perhaps. Sites of historical interest. Regions famed for speciality dishes. The usual tourist stuff, in other words &#8211; but without hordes of tourists.<span id="more-3577"></span> </p>
<p>Mission impossible? Well, it began to seem so. Then we came across a reference to a little place that sounded promising: Prachuap Khiri Khan, a &#8220;typical small Thai town&#8221; (whatever that means) set on a picturesque bay 100K or so south of Hua Hin. A fishing town and administrative centre of the province of Prachuap Khiri Khan from which it takes its name, it was too sleepy for most tourists, claimed our source. As a result, accommodation was far cheaper than in Hua Hin, as was the seafood, locally caught and as fresh as it gets. OKaaaay&#8230;</p>
<p>PKK presented as an ideal first stop: an opportunity to experience a little of Thai life in microcosm, and a quiet, relaxing prelude before the clamour and chaos of our next destination, monstrous Bangkok. </p>
<p>You&#8217;ll recall I had emerged from the train at Hua Hin sick as a baited dog, had a heave next to the platform on a fenced-off patch of lawn that my partner suspects signified something culturally special, then we took a mini-bus straight to Prachuap Khiri Khan. It dropped us in the centre of town. </p>
<p>We declined offers from the tuk-tuk drivers to take us to our hotel, which was on the seafront, just two blocks away. Easy walking distance. Or so my partner thought. I would have accepted a ride if the hotel had been only 50 metres away, but I figured she had the right to inflict a bit of punishment on me for coming down so sick and useless right at the beginning of the trip. </p>
<p>We grabbed our gear, and with the searing mid-afternoon sun ratcheting up my headache to yet another level, my entire purpose in life came down to placing one foot after the other in simple trust that we would make it to our hotel before I collapsed. </p>
<p>The two blocks to the seafront seemed to take an age. To the right, a few hundred metres ahead, was our hotel. I really doubted I could make it. Madame J marched ahead without a backward glance, fancying, perhaps, that she was dragging me along in her slipstream. Prachuap Khiri Khan bay lurched past in my periphery, and even in the blurred glare of that trial of endurance I noted that it was lovely. Not that I cared less at the time. I was fully engaged in resenting the uncaring figure striding out in front and wallowing in bounteous self-pity.</p>
<p>Hours later, having showered and slept a while after managing to keep down a cup of tea and biscuit and drop a couple of painkillers, I came to in greatly improved condition, and the view from the hotel room window revealed itself in all its splendour. Throwing open the blinds to that luscious tropical panorama was to become a daily ritual to treasure &#8211; a marvellous start to the day.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.boomtownrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/PKK-blog-1.jpg" alt="" title="PKK blog 1" width="589" height="444" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3603" /></p>
<p>Things were on the up, and not before time. I had resigned myself to not eating much, if anything, that night, but suddenly I had an appetite. Sunset was approaching, the restaurants and the night market only a walk away, and all that recently harvested local seafood just waiting&#8230;</p>
<p>So began our love affair with PKK.</p>
