									</div></div><p>We are several weeks into the spring turkey hunting season, and while I&#8217;ve heard some great success stories, I&#8217;ve heard more laments of near misses, missed opportunities, and fruitless searches.</p>
<p>I enjoy talking turkey hunting with successful and unsuccessful hunters alike, but I frequently shake my head in disappointment when I hear stories from unsuccessful hunters who haven&#8217;t taken the necessary steps to improve their odds. In many cases, the hunters are entering the woods unprepared and without the tools needed for success.</p>
<p>Just as a quarterback would not step onto the football field for a big game without preparing, practicing, and strategizing, a hunter should not step into the woods without a game plan. Wild turkeys are wary prey, and they have the upper hand when a hunter enters their domain. To level the playing field, hunters need to take action long before the morning of a hunt.</p>
<p>Rather than entering the woods blindly in the pre-dawn hours hoping to walk into a turkey flock, turkey hunters should stick to a well-thought-out plan that draws upon pre-season and in-season scouting. Turkey hunting success rates greatly increase when hunters know where the birds roost, where they feed, where they strut, and how they travel between each area, so hunters should spend just as much time scouting as they do hunting. (In fact, much more time can be spent turkey scouting than hunting, since prepared turkey hunters can successfully end hunts mere minutes after legal shooting time.)</p>
<p>Turkeys’ habits change seasonally, but any amount of pre-season scouting can help locate turkey territories and food sources. These locations provide good starting points for in-season scouting, and with further probing, hunters can find spring roost trees and strutting areas that turkeys frequent. Targeting the roosting, strutting, and feeding locations is a tactic that leads to increased success.</p>
<p>Spending time in the woods listening and watching turkeys is another strategy for increasing harvest success. Many hunters enter the woods during turkey season with a vest full of turkey calls, but few know how to actually sound like hen turkeys. In most cases, turkey hens do not call incessantly, and they do more than yelp. In addition to basic yelps, hunters should learn how and when to make clucks, cuts, and purrs. Perhaps more importantly, they should know when to stop calling. Curious toms will gobble at various calls, but ultimately hunters want the birds to walk toward them or their decoys. Sometimes not calling, or calling softly, will entice a gobbler to close the distance.</p>
<p>Observing male turkeys is also important. It’s exhilarating to hear a giant tom gobble in response to calls, but he doesn’t always do so. In times of heavy hunting pressure or increased competition from other males, toms often gobble infrequently or remain silent as they walk toward calls or decoys. Hunters should be aware that even though a bird has stopped gobbling, he may still be interested in locating the source of the hen calls, and he may march within range silently.</p>
<p>Without fail, I hear at least one story per year of how an unfamiliar or improperly sighted-in gun led to a missed shot, a wounded but not retrieved bird, or multiple birds being dropped with a single shot. Planning and practice are absolutely imperative to prevent these mishaps. Hunters must be aware of their shotguns’ shot patterns with different ammunition and at different distances before they enter the woods. A little practice at the range can be the difference between a turkey dinner and a handful of feathers.</p>

<p>Although rain and wind put a damper on the opening day of New Jersey turkey hunting season yesterday, today was a much different story.</p>
<p>I arrived at my hunting spot around 5:00 AM, and I heard the first turkeys gobbling from the roost at 5:30 AM &#8212; about 15 minutes before shooting time. I thought I was set up close to the roost, but I was surprised to hear them (many of them) gobbling about 250 yards away.</p>
<p>As I questioned whether I should move locations, the turkeys continued their incessantly gobbling for 40 minutes. They finally flew down from their roosts around 6:10 AM. I saw about 10 deer near where I heard the turkeys, but I didn&#8217;t see any of the turkeys on the ground. I could still hear gobbling, but I thought they were walking away from me &#8212; until I saw the deer start to scatter.</p>
<p>Like a bruising bully, a giant tom barreled out of the woods and into the field, spooking the deer. He was gobbling his head off and proceeded to march off toward a wooded thicket about 75 yards from where he entered in the field. Sensing the coast was clear, four more birds followed the big tom&#8217;s path, making sure to keep about a 30-yard cushion between them and him. The big gobbler walked off into the thicket, but the other four entered the field and began walking toward me.</p>
<p>When the four birds dropped down a swale and out of my line of sight, I scrambled to set two decoys on my edge of the field and began calling with my diaphragm call. All four birds gobbled back at my calls, and they began a slow 200-yard march across the field toward my decoys.</p>
<p>I called to the turkeys every few minutes as they cautiously approached. About halfway across the field, I could make out two jakes, one tom with a smallish beard, and one slightly larger tom with a long beard. Lucky for me, the big one was leading the march.</p>
<p>After 45 minutes, all four turkeys were within 40 yards of my 12-gauge &#8212; but there was a problem. They were all walking in a single-file line directly toward me! I couldn&#8217;t shoot the lead bird without potentially taking out all four of them! I was fearful that they would get too close and realize the hens they were calling and courting were plastic, so  I was hoping one of them would make a move. The biggest one did.</p>
<p>He began clucking and half-strutting to catch the attention of the decoys. In doing so, he stepped two feet to his left. Two feet was all I needed, and he was hit with a load of 5-shot that dropped him in his tracks. The other three scampered away.</p>
<p>Not a bad morning, considering it was the first day I hunted during the first week of the season.</p>
<p>He weighed in at 18.5 pounds, had a 9-inch beard, had one 1.125-inch spur, and one 1.25 inch spur. Check out the photos.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[As all 2011-2012 Delaware hunting seasons were seemingly affected in some way by our mild winter weather, it is only logical to question the effect the mild winter and early spring warm up will have on Delaware’s turkey flock and their breeding patterns. With food sources plentiful over the winter, high numbers of both gobblers and hens should have survived with good fat reserves and plenty of energy. Assuming our mild and relatively dry weather continues, the healthy hens should be capable of laying good egg clutches and re-nesting, if necessary.

									</div></div><p>Although some Delaware hunters have packed away their hunting equipment until fall, others are eager to begin their pursuit of a frequently overlooked gamebird in the First State – the wild turkey.</p>
<p>Delaware wild turkey hunting season opened Saturday April 14 (with Saturday April 7 designated as youth season), and hunters should experience success rates on par with the 2010 and 2011 seasons, in which 368 and 487 turkeys were harvested, respectively.</p>
<p>According to Bob Eriksen, certified wildlife biologist and northeastern U.S. field supervisor for the National Wild Turkey Federation, the number of turkeys in Delaware is similar to recent years. “A pretty good hatch occurred in 2010, so two-year-old gobblers should be available in good numbers,” Eriksen says. “Two-year-old gobblers are the bread and butter of spring hunters, [since] they gobble and come to a call more readily than older gobblers.”</p>
<p>While two-year old toms may be plentiful, Eriksen believes the one-year-old jakes may be less abundant this season due to a mediocre hatch in 2011.</p>
<p>As all 2011-2012 Delaware hunting seasons were seemingly affected in some way by our mild winter weather, it is only logical to question the effect the mild winter and early spring warm up will have on Delaware’s turkey flock and their breeding patterns.</p>
<p>With food sources plentiful over the winter, high numbers of both gobblers and hens should have survived with good fat reserves and plenty of energy. Assuming our mild and relatively dry weather continues, the healthy hens should be capable of laying good egg clutches and re-nesting, if necessary.</p>
<p>Just as their energy reserves facilitate healthy egg production in the hens, the excess fat in toms should ensure high activity levels during breeding season, typically meaning that the mature males will actively seek as many mates as they can. With toms actively scouting for hens, turkey hunters can expect to receive responses to calls, especially early in the season.</p>
<p>The early spring warm up and subsequent early foliage bloom may affect this year’s turkey season in other ways, as well. Normal egg laying timeframes and subsequent hatch dates may be a bit earlier than usual, so hunters may hit the Delaware woods and fields with the turkey mating season already in full swing. With the early mating, it is also possible that gobbling activity decreases earlier than normal, leading to more challenging hunts in the final weeks of the season.</p>
<p>The early foliage bloom will make seeing and hearing turkeys more difficult, so turkey hunters will have to use extra caution. “Spring hunters should be extra careful when the vegetation is fully leafed out, making absolutely certain of their targets,” cautioned Eriksen.</p>

<p>My extended family and I spent a week at Amelia Island Plantation on the northern Florida Atlantic coast. In addition to relaxing on the beach and by the pool, we spent a good deal of time fishing.</p>
<p>We surf fished on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, catching a mix of blue fish, red fish (red drum), lady fish, and jack crevalle on dead shrimp. I, and each of the kids, caught at least one fish in the 70+-degree surf.</p>
<p>We also booked a charter boat on Tuesday morning with <a href="http://www.accharters.net/" target="_blank">AC Charters</a> aboard The Wahoo with Captain Billy. We left the marina around 8:00 AM and fished the jetty just outside the inlet. Within 10 minutes after anchoring over a wreck, we were catching fish.</p>
<p>We boated two keeper red fish and kept busy catching a mix of sea bass, stingrays, puffer fish, and even a guitar fish. We trolled around the inlet mouth for the last hour and caught one Spanish mackeral.</p>
<p>The parents and kids had great success on the trip. I highly recommend AC Charters and The Wahoo. Completing the great fishing day, The Verandah restaurant (at Amelia Island Plantation), cooked our catch. Great stuff.</p>
<p>Check out the photos.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know, there is a nesting pair of peregrine falcons that live at the top of the Brandywine Building in Wilmington, Delaware. (In fact, I am lucky enough to be able to view the falcons from my office window.)</p>
<p>The Wilmington falcon story is lengthy, but intriguing, and I encourage all of you to read about the falcons on the Wilmington Peregrine Falcon Webcam Project Blog at <a href="http://wilmfalcons.com/index.html" target="_blank">http://wilmfalcons.com/index.html</a>. Be sure to visit the <a href="http://wilmfalcons.com/blog.htm" target="_blank">Nestbox News</a> page for recent updates.</p>
<p>The Wilmington Peregrine Falcon Webcam website was designed and is maintained by Kim Steininger, a superb photographer. All photographs on the site were taken by Kim Steininger and are of the Wilmington peregrines. (All materials and photos are copyrighted and may not be duplicated without direct written consent obtained from Kim Steininger.)</p>
<p>There are currently 5 falcons eggs in the nest that are expected to hatch around the last week of May.</p>

Photo taken by Ron Charest.</p></div>
<p><em>From my hunting column that ran in <a href="http://www.delaareonline.com" target="_blank">The News Journal</a>.</em></p>
<p>Although some diehard hunters are wringing the final seconds out of the 2011-2012 hunting season by hunting crows and snow geese for the next several weeks, most Delaware hunters have cleaned and stored their guns, packed away their decoys, and moved their camouflage to the back of their closets.</p>
<p>The collective sighs of forlorn hunters resonate throughout hunting households as the sportsmen are forced to deal with the months-long emptiness that accompanies the end of hunting season. The inactivity that now occupies the schedules of many hunters may be welcomed by some and loathed by others, but it is sure to be perplexing to hunting dogs.</p>
<p>Hunting dogs, especially the high-activity searching, chasing, pointing, and flushing breeds like beagles, pointers, and spaniels, grow accustomed to their extended explorations and pursuits when they are hunting rabbits, pheasants, woodcocks, or other small game. Their frequent activity, strong desires to please their handlers, and uncompromising passion to satisfy their instinctive drives leaves them more than content during Delaware’s various small game and upland game hunting seasons.</p>
<p>As a dog hunts during Delaware’s hunting seasons that span from September through February, he becomes more physically fit. Likewise, hunts may make him more mentally alert and less apt to exhibit undesirable conduct like excessive barking and property damage (via chewing, digging, etc.), since the high activity levels provide engaging outlets that eliminate boredom and encourage natural  behavior.</p>
<p>Dogs used for waterfowl retrieving from blinds and boats also benefit from their hunting season activities, and they, too, can be befuddled when the season ends.</p>
<p>Waterfowl, small game, and upland game hunting dogs struggling to comprehend the end of hunting season often look at their owners curiously when alarm clocks ring in the pre-dawn hours. Others jump in trucks and wag their tails excitedly when their owners try to leave for work. And others pace like caged lions when they hear collar bells, see their hunting vests, or smell guns or ammo.</p>
<p>The end of hunting season doesn’t have to be the end of compelling and energetic activities for hunting dogs, however.</p>
<p>To combat the abrupt cessation of hunting-related activities, hunting dog owners should keep their dogs physically and intellectually stimulated during the off-season. Hunting dog owners and their canine hunting companions can engage in multiple activities that reinforce hunting lessons and drills, create memories, and teach new tricks.</p>
<p>Off-season hunting dog activities can incorporate real-life hunting scenarios, such as retrieving fowl dummies on land and in water, and they can introduce new concepts like teaching a dog to track wounded deer or to locate shed antlers.</p>
<p>The hunting off-season also presents a superb time for carrying a camera, rather than a gun, into the woods so that hunters can capture action photos of their dogs locating, chasing, or pointing game. Many of the same game species are present in Delaware’s fields and forests during the spring and summer as in the fall and winter hunting seasons, so photo opportunities can be plentiful.</p>
<p>While structured activities can be great for dogs and owners alike, unstructured exercise and activity is also important for hunting dogs. Allowing them to explore their natural surroundings, run with other dogs, and fetch balls in the water also keep dogs in shape for hunting season and build bonds with their owners.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Here is some feedback (and useful information) I received from Michael Globetti from the Delaware Dept. of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Public Affairs office.  &#8211; SMK</em></span></p>
<p><em>Enjoyed your article in today’s News Journal, Steven – and wanted to expound on your list of offseason activities for hunting dogs and gundogs in Delaware to include field trials and hunt tests, of which the state has a great number, perhaps proportionately more for its size than anywhere else in North America.</em></p>
<p><em>Delaware is renowned for retriever events especially – the state hosted the National Retriever Championships in 2009 in the Dover environs, and the National Labrador Retriever Club has spring and fall field trials each year at DNREC’s C&amp;D Canal Summit Retriever Training Area and nearby Rebel Ridge Farms.</em></p>
<p><em>Pointing dog trials and tests are frequently held at DNREC’s Norman G. Wilder Wildlife Area in Kent County, and spaniel events also are staged hereabouts.</em></p>
<p><em>Micheal also mentioned the DelBay Retriever Club, the country’s oldest continuous club in terms of competition, having been founded in 1937, and which holds a half-dozen field trials and hunt tests annually.</em></p>
<p><em>Couple of other things worth noting about off-season gundog activity: There is a Delmarva Chapter of NAVHDA (North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association) that spans the state, featuring the “continental” breeds such as Vizsla, spinone Italiano and the German shorthair and wirehair pointers. And lastly, DNREC’s not in the dog licensing business any more, having handed it off to the three counties, but all dogs in Delaware, including gundogs, must be licensed &#8211; and the respective counties where the dogs (and owners) reside should be contacted for more information.</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Thanks for the info, Michael. &#8211; SMK</em></span></p>
