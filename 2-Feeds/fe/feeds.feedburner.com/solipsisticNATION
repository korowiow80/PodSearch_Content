      <itunes:summary>Tapage is Tijs Ham and he's our guest on today's show.

While I've always enjoyed his music, I think he's really matured as an artist and as a musician with the release of Overgrown, his latest album on Tympanik Audio. All the elements that Tijs has worked with the last couple of years—the soundscapes, breakcore and IDM—are all there, but his use of all those styles of music is more precise. They're there more to support what he wants to express through his music than overwhelming the music, if that makes any sense. You'll see what I mean, because we'll also hear a live in studio performance from Tijs on today's show.

Speaking of shows, [tlr], who has been a frequent guest on solipsistic NATION, will be performing tonight with Ming and Ping and Mike Diva as NVD-NDR at Til Two here in San Diego. If you live in the area, go see them! I plan to be there so send me a tweet @solipsistic and maybe we can meet up. That's if I get today's show out early enough.

If you can't make the show, fear not. You can download [tlr]'s's performance as NVR-NDR on the October 15th, 2011 edition of solipsistic NATION. TLR was also on the show with tooth_eye, A Beautiful Lotus, Johan Ess and Joshua Decker with a mix of select tracks from their Magicore blog back in March.

One more thing...

I get sent a lot of music, and even though I feature the best of it each week on solipsistic NATION, there's so much that I can't pack it all into an hourly program. Even though I can't play everything that I think is great, I can still tell you about it, so I've started a new feature on the solipsistic NATION website: the song of the day. Recent posts have featured Bonde Do Role, Laid Back and the Drop Out Orchestra. All the music is exceptional and each post features a video or track from the artist. I also include links to download free MP3s if they offer them. If you like the show then I think you'll like the song of the day, so check it out!

Join us again next week when we'll showcase music from Metal Postcard Records.

This last surge of nervous energy is only going to last so long so let me give you the low down on today's show before I collapse into a quivering heap of exhaustion.</p><p>First off, I want to say goodbye to <a title="Adam Yauch Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Yauch" target="_blank">Adam Yauch</a>, or as we know him, MCA of the <a title="Beastie Boys website" href="http://beastieboys.com" target="_blank">Beastie Boys</a>.</p><p>I wasn't a fan of their <i><a title="Licensed to Ill iTunes page" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/licensed-to-ill/id5805839" target="_blank">Licensed to Ill</a></i> album because I could never get past their douchebag posturing. But there was no ignoring their <i><a title="Paul's Boutique iTunes page" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/pauls-boutique/id14319958" target="_blank">Paul's Boutique</a></i> album and <i><a title="Check Your Head iTunes page" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/check-your-head/id15892684" target="_blank">Check Your Head</a></i> was virtually my soundtrack for 1992. As I was growing and maturing, the Beastie Boys were always a couple steps ahead of me, blazing the trail.</p><p>Adam passed away last week. I'll miss his wit, his compassion and his humanity.

      <itunes:summary>I have spent over 12 hours producing today's show. This last surge of nervous energy is only going to last so long so let me give you the low down on today's show before I collapse into a quivering heap of exhaustion.

First off, I want to say goodbye to Adam Yauch, or as we know him, MCA of the Beastie Boys.

I wasn't a fan of their Licensed to Ill album because I could never get past their douchebag posturing. But there was no ignoring their Paul's Boutique album and Check Your Head was virtually my soundtrack for 1992. As I was growing and maturing, the Beastie Boys were always a couple steps ahead of me, blazing the trail.

Adam passed away last week. I'll miss his wit, his compassion and his humanity. The world is a little colder place with one less Beastie. Namaste, Adam.

Life is for the living, so let's get on with it.

This year's Glade Festival is less than a month away and we're going to bring it in with Benji Vaughan, who will be performing along with Raja Ram and Simon Posford on the Origin Stage Twisted Sound System. Between them, they are responsible for such ground-breaking music including, but not only, Shpongle, Hallucinogen, Younger Brother and Prometheus.

The MUTEK Festival is also around the corner, taking place in Montreal May 30th to June 3rd. Last year we spoke with MUTEK founder, Alain Mongeau. This year we have the pleasure of talking with Patti Schmidt, the curator, programmer and web editor for MUTEK. Patti also has the distinction of being the voice for the CBC's Brave New Waves, a music program that features music and culture from the "fringes and the future."

We'll also talk with Vibin.fm's founder, Brian O'Toole. Vibin.fm is the Pandora of electronic music and Brian will explain how it all works, us how Vibin.fm works. Want to have a little fun? Enter any of the other artists featured on today's show at Vibin.fm and see what comes up. I heard some lovely music from Kuedo, Teebs and Byetone.

Last but not least, we'll chat with Craig Colorusso about his Sun Boxes. What are Sun Boxes? Sun Boxes are twenty speakers powered by solar panels. Each speaker has a different guitar note that loops. Once the piece begins they continually overlap and the piece slowly evolves over time. Oh, and be sure to check out Craig's mobile Sun Boxes apps!

Today's show is free. But if you enjoyed yourself, learned something new or heard something you liked, tell a friend about the show. Want to go the extra mile? Write up a quick review on our iTunes page. The more people who know about solipsistic NATION the more shows like today's I can produce.

Join us again next week for a special mix featuring select tracks from the Audio Aashram Music catalog lovingly curated by Praketh, from the blueOrb podcast.

See you then!

<p>Welcome to #twittermix4!</p>

<p>And here's the part where I explain what that means. Explaining what it means is actually one of the <a title="#twittermix web page" href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23twittermix" target="_blank">#twittermix</a> traditions.</p>

<p>So here we go...</p>

<p>When I first joined <a title="Twitter website" href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> there wasn't a lot of labels or musicians on Twitter, which made it almost useless as far <b>solipsistic NATION</b> was concerned. But I stuck around and gradually more and more labels and musicians came online on Twitter, which is also right about the time when Twitter became my social media platform of choice. Twitter had two things going for it that I came to cherish: it was ubiquitous and concise. Twitter's 140 character limit forced you to say what you wanted to say with laser-like intensity.</p>

<p>I thought it would be fun to put together a mix for <b>solipsistic NATION</b> featuring tracks from musicians on Twitter. I approached the artists I had met through Twitter for their participation and asked them to extend the invitation to musicians they new. I believe this was when retweeting came onto the scene. Heady times! Retweeting put me in touch with a lot of musicians I talk to to this day. Come to think of it, I guess that whole process is one of the traditions of the #twittermix.</p>

<p>Anyway, I got a lot of great tracks and the show was a success, but I have to tell you, today's  #twittermix is the best. Not to diminish the previous  #twittermixs but this one's pretty special. Not only is the music as diverse as Twitter itself but the music is topnotch! As an added bonus, we'll also talk with <a title="Clay Nutting website" href="http://claynutting.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Clay Nutting</a>, who is one of the people organizing this year's <a title="Sacramento Electronic Music Festival Facebook page" href="https://www.facebook.com/semfpresents" target="_blank">Sacramento Electronic Music Festival</a>. I really hope to make it to the festival because the've got some incredible talent from folks like <a title="James & Evander website" href="http://www.jamesandevander.com" target="_blank">James &amp; Evander</a>, <a title="Shlohmo website" href="http://www.myspace.com/shlomoshun" target="_blank">Shlohmo</a>, <a title="Mux Moolr website" href="http://www.muxmool.com" target="_blank">Mux Mool</a> and more. If you plan on going, Tweet me on Twitter at <a title="Solipsistic Nation Twitter page" href="https://twitter.com/#!/solipsistic" target="_blank">@solipsistic</a> and maybe we can meet up.</p>

<p>Getting back to my point...</p>

<p>I think Twitter is important to me because it also represents the spirit of <b>solipsistic NATION</b>. Through Twitter I am able to informally approach musicians and labels I would otherwise never get the chance to talk to, and that's led to a lot of incredible shows and struck up a lot of friendships. In turns, musicians and labels have contacted me through Twitter as well as listeners of the show and people who just show up because they got word of the show or are just curious or the other myriad reasons.</p>

<p>Twitter has helped me build up <b>solipsistic NATION</b>, reach out and collaborate and have a hell of a lot of fun. The more I think about it the more I'm convinced that <b>solipsistic NATION</b> could not exist without Twitter. Or be something very, very different without it.</p>

<p>Join us again next week when our guest will be <a title="Tripswitch website" href="https://www.tripswitch.mu" target="_blank">Tripswitch</a>'s Nick Brennan. He's got a very special live set for us.</p>

<p>See you then!</p>

As the producer of solipsistic NATION I rarely have time to listen to other music podcasts. There simply isn't enough hours in the day so there are only a handful of them. Macedonia's Both Sides of the Surface is one. There's also Mikel OD's Most People Are DJs podcast and the Spartacus Roosevelt podcast and definitely the Headphone Commute podcast.

I expect it's the same with you, too.

So, why The Electro Show?

Mainly it's because Nathan has also embraced a freeform approach to producing a show about electronic music. Every genre is grist for his mill. And like myself, Nathan eagerly wants to turn people on to great music even as he himself explores the vast terrain of electronic music in all it's myriad forms.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://solipsisticnation.com/images/photo-abagarecords-M.jpg" alt="Abaga Records" class="alignleft" title="Abaga Records" height="180" width="280" /></p>

<p>Today's <a title="solipsistic NATION: Label Showcase page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/category/music-labels/">label showcase</a> features, by popular demand, <a title="ABAGA Records website" href="http://abagarecords.com" target="_blank">ABAGA Records</a>!</p>

<p>A few months back I asked friends of the show on Twitter which labels you thought I should feature on <b>solipsistic NATION</b> and ABAGA Records came up again and again. You demanded it, I listened!</p>

<p>When I launched <b>solipsistic NATION</b> I was uncompromising in my vision for the show. I wanted to feature the best of all genres of electronic music. Not everyone likes jumping from genre to genre of electronic music but the net is big. I knew that there were listeners out there. We just had to find each other. Six years and 276 shows later <b>solipsistic NATION</b> has found a global audience. And damn, the audience has <i>amazing</i> taste. Whenever I ask for suggestions for guest or labels to feature on the show I'm never disappointed and I'm constantly being introduced to new and exciting things. Today's show is proof of that.</p>

<p>Today's show is also a bit different because I haven't heard the mix yet. Andrew, the label's director, sent it to me and I literally just downloaded it. I have no more idea what to expect that you do, dear listener. Despite the time shifting with podcasts I am, for all intents and purposes, listening to today's the same time as you.

      <itunes:summary>Today's label showcase features, by popular demand, ABAGA Records!

A few months back I asked friends of the show on Twitter which labels you thought I should feature on solipsistic NATION and ABAGA Records came up again and again. You demanded it, I listened!

When I launched solipsistic NATION I was uncompromising in my vision for the show. I wanted to feature the best of all genres of electronic music. Not everyone likes jumping from genre to genre of electronic music but the net is big. I knew that there were listeners out there. We just had to find each other. Six years and 276 shows later solipsistic NATION has found a global audience. And damn, the audience has amazing taste. Whenever I ask for suggestions for guest or labels to feature on the show I'm never disappointed and I'm constantly being introduced to new and exciting things. Today's show is proof of that.

Today's show is also a bit different because I haven't heard the mix yet. Andrew, the label's director, sent it to me and I literally just downloaded it. I have no more idea what to expect that you do, dear listener. Despite the time shifting with podcasts I am, for all intents and purposes, listening to today's the same time as you. But you've never steered me wrong. I'm going to trust in your good taste.

ABAGA Records releases bass music, dubstep, jungle, d&amp;b and other sub-heavy styles of music. Based in Edinburgh, the label provides a platform for artists to get their music heard, with both free and paid releases.

Join us again next week when our guest will be Nathan Phelan, host of The Electro Show.

See you then!

      <itunes:subtitle>solipsistic NATION No. 274: Magicore Voltron Mega Mix</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>On today's show we're going to experience the Voltron Mega Mix lovingly put together by [tlr], tooth_eye, A Beautiful Lotus, Johan Ess and Joshua Decker to celebrate Magicore's two year anniversary. You remember Magicore, don't you? They only put together one of my favorite editions of solipsistic NATION evah! Only this time they're mix is darker, sinister, heavier and far more dangerous. But don't worry, it's still just as fun!

Join us again next week for a very special live set from the Stereo MCs. I'm so excited!

See you then!

Sorry, <a title="_tlr_ Twitter page" href="http://twitter.com/#!/_tlr_" target="_blank">_tlr_</a>, I have duties I must attend to!</p><p>Last week I failed to mention how much I've been blown away by <a title="Tympanik Audio website" href="http://tympanikaudio.com" target="_blank">Tympanik Audio</a>'s recent releases from the likes of <a title="Access To Arasaka web page" href="http://tympanikaudio.com/artists/access-to-arasaka/" target="_blank">Access To Arasaka</a>, <a title="Known Rebel web page" href="http://tympanikaudio.com/artists/known-rebel/" target="_blank">Known Rebel</a>, <a title="C.Db.Sn web page" href="http://tympanikaudio.com/artists/cdbsn/" target="_blank">C.Db.Sn</a> and <a title="Tapage web page" href="http://tympanikaudio.com/artists/tapage/" target="_blank">Tapage</a>. Tympanik Audio always releases great stuff but they've really outdone themselves with this recent batch. Tapage in particular has shown a lot of growth and <i><a title="Overgrown iTunes page" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/overgrown/id477266377" target="_blank">Overgrown</a></i> is his best album yet.

      <itunes:summary>I keep meaning to write up today's show notes but instead I've got caught up in a discussion with friend of the show, _tlr_, about the movie, John Carter. Sorry, _tlr_, I have duties I must attend to!

Last week I failed to mention how much I've been blown away by Tympanik Audio's recent releases from the likes of Access To Arasaka, Known Rebel, C.Db.Sn and Tapage. Tympanik Audio always releases great stuff but they've really outdone themselves with this recent batch. Tapage in particular has shown a lot of growth and Overgrown is his best album yet. He has some how managed the trick of simultaneously being more restrained in his music and complex and dramatic.

Another label that's batting them out of the park is Record Label Records. Record Label Records tends to release music that's a bit more expierimental and that always runs the risk of falling flat. Record Label Records has always managed to find the good stuff, though, and with the recent releases of their Drinking the Goat's Blood and the Cremation of Care compilation albums (and wAgAwAgA's midnight sampler album, which I sadly was unable to play on today's show) they've really brought their A game.

The Centrifuge has also been blowing up. Velapene Screen returns from his live appearance on solipsistic NATION with a track from his album, What If They Can't Trust You? Lodsb also returns with a fantastic track and Myoptik makes his first appearance on the show.

Of course, there are other labels featured on today's show but I wanted to focus on those three because each and every one of them has been releasing music so great that I have to pinch myself to convince myself that I'm not hallucinating it. Can music really be this good?!

A lot of the music heard on today's show can be downloaded absolutely for free by clicking the links below but why not show your support for the artists by purchasing one or two of their tracks. Maybe one of their albums if you really liked what you heard.

If you want to support the show, that's free too. Just tell your friends about the show or give us a rating or review on iTunes if you think solipsistic NATION is with listening to.

Let me sweeten the pot: join us again next week when the lads from Magicore return with yet another mind blowing mix of select tracks from their blog. That reminds me, I need to get back to my conversation with Magicore's _tlr_ about what a turkey John Carter turned out to be.

      <itunes:summary>Today on solipsistic NATION we're going to listen to select tracks from Futuresequence and talk with the labels founder, Michael Waring.

Futuresequence is based out of the UK and began as a blog but has slowly been mutating into a music label that explores the possibilities and boundaries of textures, patterns and sounds and, hopefully, pushes past those boundaries.

I've known about Futuresequence since their first Sequence compilation album. I recently read about the release of Sequence3 in Zite's electronic music section. After downloading all 41 tracks of the album and being blown away by each and every one, it was obvious that I had to feature Futuresequence on solipsistic NATION.

We'll talk with Michael about his label and the music we'll hear on today's show. If you heard a track you liked on today's mix you can always show your support by buying a track or two from the artists by clicking the links on today's show notes.

If you like the show, you can also support solipsistic NATION simply by giving the show a quick 1 to 5 star rating on iTunes. I of course hope you'll give solipsistic NATION a five star rating. You can also support solipsistic NATION by turning your friends on to the show.

The more people who listen to solipsistic NATION the more shows like today's show I can produce. Each edition of solipsistic NATION is free for your listening pleasure. I just ask you share solipsistic NATION with people who enjoy good music.

I'll see you again next week when we'll do it all over again! But completely different.

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="http://solipsisticnation.com/images/photo-velapenescreen-M.jpg" alt="Velapene Screen, Live" class="alignleft" title="Velapene Screen, Live" height="180" width="280" /><p>Can I share something with you that is simultaneously mind blowing and utterly mundane?</p><p>I get anywhere from 50 to 250 tracks emailed my way every week. Let me repeat that: <i>every</i> week. And I've made a pact with myself that if musicians or music labels are generous enough to send music my way to play on the show then I feel obligated to <i>every</i> single song.</p><p>As you can imagine, that takes <i>a lot</i> of time.</p><p>My strategy to deal with this constant geyser of music is to listen to a couple hours of hours a day of music on my phone that has been sent my way in the last week on random. Listening to music on random gives me an approximation what an album sounds like. I realize it's not fair to the artists but it would take me forever to listen to each and every album from start to finish. Random's just faster.</p><p>Anyway, whenever a really good track comes on that I flag it for consideration to play on the show. And tracks from <a title="Velapene Screen Facebook page" href="http://www.facebook.com/velapenescreen" target="_blank">Velapene Screen</a>'s album, <i><a title="What If They Can't Trust You? web page" href="http://www.thecentrifuge.co.uk/_wp/2012/02/cf060-velapene-screen-what-if-they-cant-trust-you-lp/" target="_blank">What If They Can't Trust You?</a></i>, just kept popping up again and again, demanding my attention. Who the hell was this guy? Whoever he was, his music is slamming! I wasn't surprised, <i>What If They Can't Trust You?</i> is a <a title="What If They Can't Trust You? web page" href="http://www.thecentrifuge.co.uk/" target="_blank">Centrifuge</a> release, and The Centrifuge puts out quality music. Check out my <a title="solipsistic NATION No 234: The Centrifuge web page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/solipsistic-nation-no-234-the-centrifuge/">interview</a> with The Centrifuge's Wassim if you don't believe me.</p><p>And as I was listening to yet another killer track from Velapene Screen I suddenly saw him post something to <a title="Twitter website" href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. I wondered if he'd be interested on coming on the show with a <a title="solipsistic NATION: Live web page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/category/live/">live set</a> and sent him a Tweet. Minutes later he Tweeted back that he was interested. We talked further and the results is today's show.</p><p>On the surface that's not such an amazing story but if you think about it, it's almost magical.</p><p>Musicians and music labels send me music to download which I might later play on my show, which is available as a podcast or streaming from an internet radio station.

      <itunes:subtitle>solipsistic NATION No. 270: Velapene Screen, Live</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Can I share something with you that is simultaneously mind blowing and utterly mundane?

I get anywhere from 50 to 250 tracks emailed my way every week. Let me repeat that: every week. And I've made a pact with myself that if musicians or music labels are generous enough to send music my way to play on the show then I feel obligated to every single song.

As you can imagine, that takes a lot of time.

My strategy to deal with this constant geyser of music is to listen to a couple hours of hours a day of music on my phone that has been sent my way in the last week on random. Listening to music on random gives me an approximation what an album sounds like. I realize it's not fair to the artists but it would take me forever to listen to each and every album from start to finish. Random's just faster.

Anyway, whenever a really good track comes on that I flag it for consideration to play on the show. And tracks from Velapene Screen's album, What If They Can't Trust You?, just kept popping up again and again, demanding my attention. Who the hell was this guy? Whoever he was, his music is slamming! I wasn't surprised, What If They Can't Trust You? is a Centrifuge release, and The Centrifuge puts out quality music. Check out my interview with The Centrifuge's Wassim if you don't believe me.

And as I was listening to yet another killer track from Velapene Screen I suddenly saw him post something to Twitter. I wondered if he'd be interested on coming on the show with a live set and sent him a Tweet. Minutes later he Tweeted back that he was interested. We talked further and the results is today's show.

On the surface that's not such an amazing story but if you think about it, it's almost magical.

Musicians and music labels send me music to download which I might later play on my show, which is available as a podcast or streaming from an internet radio station. And I'm deluged in music. All. The. Time. And I listen to this stuff, anywhere I go, on my phone. And I can reach out and contact the musicians I'd like to come on the show by posting message in the aether. Can you fucking believe that shit?

Like I said: utterly mundane but completely magical.

Anyway, listen to today's show featuring a chat with Chris Ghiraldi, the man behind Velapene Screen, and Chris' in-studio performance! His whole life is magical. Became a touring musician at a young age, won the Philly Laptop Battle in 2004 and the New York City Laptop Battle in 2006, received attention from Rolling Stone, remixed artists including Interpol, Meat Beat Manifesto, Radiohead and Regina Spektor, etc.

Before I get out of Dodge, keep your fingers crossed because next month's Live show may feature a set from the Stereo MCs! I hope I didn't jinx it.

See you next week!

<br />Today on <b>solipsistic NATION</b> we're going to reveal the hidden truth behind <a title="Secret Archives of the Vatican web page" href="http://brokendrumrecords.com" target="_blank">Secret Archives of the Vatican</a>... podcast.</p>

<p>I don't listen to many electronic music podcasts because:</p>

<ol>
<li>I simply don't have the time, and;</li>

<li>Most electronic music podcasts bore me, even good ones.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, I love dubstep, but after listening to three or four episodes of a dubstep podcast, I begin to lose interest. I need variety.</p>

<p>Some of the podcasts I do enjoy are <a title="Both Sides of the Surface website" href="http://www.bsots.com" target="_blank">Both Sides of the Surface</a> and <a title="Most People Are DJs website" href="http://www.mostpeoplearedjs.com" target="_blank">Most People Are DJs</a>. The shows are thoughtful, well planned out and offer a lot of variety. I never feel like I've heard the same show twice.</p>

<p>Recently, through Twitter, I've discovered the Secret Archives of the Vatican podcast. It's an excellent show featuring excellent music and I never know what to expect from episode to episode.</p>

<p>The other reason I'm such a fan of the Secret Archives of the Vatican podcast is because the music is reminiscent of the kind of music <a title="Bill Laswell Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Laswell" target="_blank">Bill Laswell</a> was pumping out in the 90s: which is to say that the music featured on the Secret Archives of the Vatican is often mystical and tinged <a title="Philip K. Dick Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick" target="_blank">Philip K. Dick</a>ian paranoia. Which is not to say that the music is not fun or playful, because it often is.</p>

<p>Speaking of Bill Laswell, be sure to check out the marvelous <a title="Sacred Dub podcast web page" href="http://www.sacreddub.com/podcast" target="_blank">Sacred Dub podcast</a>. The shows are infrequent but deliver depth-charge explosions when released.</p>

<p>Vince Millett is the man behind both the Secret Archives of the Vatican podcast and band, and he's also the founder of <a title="Broken Drum Records website" href="http://brokendrumrecords.com" target="_blank">Broken Drum Records</a>, a netlabel dedicated to creating and promoting excellent, globally-influenced bass-driven music.</p>

<p>Vince is also our guest on today's show and he's lovingly hand-picked tracks that have been featured the Secret Archives of the Vatican podcast. I can tell Vince and I have an ironic fascination with the romanticized and eroticized stain of <a title="Orientalism Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism" target="_blank">Orientalism</a> in the tradition of <a title="William S. Burroughs Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs" target="_blank">William S. Burroughs</a>' heroin-fueled hallucinations, <a title="William S.

Vince is also our guest on today's show and he's lovingly hand-picked tracks that have been featured the Secret Archives of the Vatican podcast. I can tell Vince and I have an ironic fascination with the romanticized and eroticized stain of Orientalism in the tradition of William S. Burroughs' heroin-fueled hallucinations, Paul Bowles' Morrocan savage hedonism and Hakim Bey's magical temporary autonomous zones.

Join us again next week when out guests will be Bob Rogers from TaintRadio, Raziel Panic from YouShriek and Brian Botkiller and Mad EP.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://solipsisticnation.com/images/photo-feedbacklooplabel-M.jpg" alt="Feedback Loop Label" class="alignleft" title="Feedback Loop Label" height="180" width="280" /></p>

<p>Back in the day, if I heard and album I dug and wanted to find out what music label had released it I simply had to look at the CD or cassette or even an album cover. These days, despite the amazing advances in technology, it's not so easy.</p>

<p>If I'm walking down the streets of San Diego, as I often do, listening to music on my iPhone and hear a track that I like I can quickly check out the name of the track and the artist but not which label released the album. But at least I have the names, right? I can Google that. But what a hassle!</p>

<p>But surely a minor inconvenience. Not so fast. Sadly, not all artists or labels tag their MP3s correctly, often omitting the name of the song or the artist or the name of the album. No what? Wait until I get home and play the track over my speakers so I can play it to my iPhone and see of <a title="Shazam website" href="http://www.shazam.com" target="_blank">Shazam</a> knows what song it is.</p>

<p>I'll grant you that it's amazing I might be able to solve a mystery with my phone but it's still ridiculous what I sometimes have to go through just to find out which label released which artists.</p>

<p>This is all a long winded way of explaining that if I hear something that I think is good, and good enough that it's worth my time to jump through all those hoops to find out the which label is behind the release, then it's something worth your while to listen to.</p>

<p>The <a title="Feedback Loop Label website" href="http://feedbacklooplabel.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Feedback Loop Label</a> is such a label.</p>

<p>The Feedback Loop Label is a net label from Portugal and founded by Leonardo Rosado and from the label's inception each release has been <i>amazing</i>. And each release found me thumbing through my phone, trying to find out which label was responsible for the beautiful music flowing into my ears. And it was always the Feedback Loop Label.</p>

<p>I've played a lot of music from the Feedback Loop Label and recently label artist Daniel Hopkins of <a title="Landcrash website" href="http://www.landcrash.co.uk/" target="_blank">Landcrash</a> appeared on <b>solipsistic NATION</b> with a recording of his <a title="solipsistic NATION No. 264: Pimmon & Landcrash, Live web page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/solipsistic-nation-no-264-pimmon-landcrash-live/">performance</a> at the White Star. By that point it seemed ridiculous that I hadn't <a title="solipsistic NATION: Label Showcase web page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/category/music-labels/">showcased</a> Feedback Loop on <b>solipsistic NATION</b>, so I emailed Leonardo to rectify the situation. He's our guest on today's show and he's lovingly handpicked select tracks from his label for your enjoyment.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, Feedback Loop is a net label and as such, all their music on their catalogue is available as a free download. In fact you, can download nearly all the tracks heard on today's show by clicking the links below. However, if you like what you hear, and I don't see how you could possibly not, then support the artists and support the label. Feedback Loop does have <a title="Feedback Loop Label Physical Releases web pages" href="http://feedbacklooplabel.blogspot.com/p/cdr-series.html" target="_blank">physical releases</a> that you can purchase and you can buy other releases from the artists as well. You can be a modern day Renaissance patron!</p>

<p>Join us again next week when we'll talk with Bob Rogers from <a title="TaintRadio website" href="http://taintradio.org" target="_blank">TaintRadio</a>, we'll also talk with <a title="Brian Botkiller website" href="http://brianbotkiller.com" target="_blank">Brian Botkiller</a> and <a title="You Shriek website" href="http://youshriek.com" target="_blank">You Shriek</a> and the folks from <a title="6Wunderkinder website" href="http://www.6wunderkinder.com" target="_blank">6Wunderkinder</a>, developers of  <a title="Wunderkit website" href="http://www.wunderkit.com" target="_blank">Wunderkit</a>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://solipsisticnation.com/images/photo-artoffact-M.jpg" alt="Artoffact Records" class="alignleft" title="Artoffact Records" height="180" width="280" />
<br />
<a title="Artoffact Records web page" href="http://kingdeluxe.ca/year-one/" target="_blank">Artoffact Records</a> is a Canadian label based in Toronto that has released over 100 industrial, synthpop, rock, and metal albums since the label was founded in 1999. I listen to <i>a lot</i> of music but when it's a release from Artoffact, I take notice because it's bound to be great. Some of my personal faves have been <a title="Alice in Videoland MySpace page" href="http://www.myspace.com/aliceinvideoland" target="_blank">Alice in Videoland</a>, <a title="Massiv in Mensch website" href="http://www.massiv-in-mensch.de/" target="_blank">Massiv in Mensch</a>, and, more recently, <a title="Saltillo MySpace page" href="http://www.myspace.com/saltillo" target="_blank">Saltillo</a>. Artoffact consistently releases such great music that it's a crime I have <a title="solipsistic NATION: Label Showcase page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/category/music-labels/">showcased</a> their label by now.</p>

<p><a title="Jacek Kozlowski Facebook page" href="http://www.facebook.com/jacek.b.kozlowski" target="_blank">Jacek Kozlowski</a> is the founder of Artoffact Records and he's been kind enough to put together a mix of tracks from his label featuring some crucial releases from 2011 and 2012. He was also cool enough to talk shop about Artoffact and the music industry in general.</p>

<p>When I first started showcasing labels on <b>solipsistic NATION</b> I think I was caught up in the romance of what it would be like to run a label. But as the years have gone by I've come to realize how much sweat equity it takes to run a music label. No sane person would spend that much time and energy in such an endeavour. No, point of fact, it takes passion. So I guesss the romance is still there, after all.</p>

<p>Anyway, to get back to my point, as I've come to appreciate the hard work that goes into running a label I've begun what, I hope, are very pragmatic questions. How do you sign an artist and who do you develop that artist once you do. Practicalities aside, there's also the art of being managing artists. I'm generalizing here but most musicians I've met will gladly go on and on why they lovingly and painstaking purchased the gear they have or give a spur of the moment dissertation on their art and their music but it's another thing entirely when it comes to the quotidian business of being, well... business.</p>

      <itunes:subtitle>solipsistic NATION No. 265: Artoffact Records</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Artoffact Records is a Canadian label based in Toronto that has released over 100 industrial, synthpop, rock, and metal albums since the label was founded in 1999. I listen to a lot of music but when it's a release from Artoffact, I take notice because it's bound to be great. Some of my personal faves have been Alice in Videoland, Massiv in Mensch, and, more recently, Saltillo. Artoffact consistently releases such great music that it's a crime I have showcased their label by now.

Jacek Kozlowski is the founder of Artoffact Records and he's been kind enough to put together a mix of tracks from his label featuring some crucial releases from 2011 and 2012. He was also cool enough to talk shop about Artoffact and the music industry in general.

When I first started showcasing labels on solipsistic NATION I think I was caught up in the romance of what it would be like to run a label. But as the years have gone by I've come to realize how much sweat equity it takes to run a music label. No sane person would spend that much time and energy in such an endeavour. No, point of fact, it takes passion. So I guesss the romance is still there, after all.

Anyway, to get back to my point, as I've come to appreciate the hard work that goes into running a label I've begun what, I hope, are very pragmatic questions. How do you sign an artist and who do you develop that artist once you do. Practicalities aside, there's also the art of being managing artists. I'm generalizing here but most musicians I've met will gladly go on and on why they lovingly and painstaking purchased the gear they have or give a spur of the moment dissertation on their art and their music but it's another thing entirely when it comes to the quotidian business of being, well... business.

Hey, cut me some slack here. I said I was generalizing.

Jacek gave some very insightful and considered answers to my questions on today's show. He also delivered some kick ass tunes so enjoy! Bonus, there are some free tracks below you can download for your continued pleasure but by all means, purchase a track or two. Artists need to eat and after all, it is a business.

      <itunes:summary>Today on solipsistic NATION we're going to select tracks from Immigrant Breast Nest, a wonderful netlabel that was founded to present NYC’s best in weird, mostly electronic, underground music.

Bit of background on today's show.

Dan Abatemarco and fellow musician and partner in crime, David B. Applegate, are the agent provocateurs of Immigrant Brest Nest and they join us today to tell us more about their label.

I first met Dan back in 2010 when I was putting together a semgent about people who were making music with iPods, Iphones and iPads. Performing as Speak Onion he was creating some gnarly noise that shredded my eardrums. Anyone can make noise. Dan was making noise to make music. I was so impressed with Dans music that I later invited him to return to solipsistic NATION with a recording of his live set recorded at the Charleston in Brooklyn for Immigrant Breast Nest‘s record release party, and that's when I first learned of his label. I was blown away with the diversity and the quality of the artists on their label that I knew it was just a matter of time before I would showcase Immigrant Breast Nest on solipsistic NATION.

Most of the tracks on today's show can be downloaded absolutely for free by clicking on the links on today's show notes below, but if you really like what you hear, why don't you throw the artists a few scheckles. Show 'em you appreciate what they do.

Join us again next week when we'll hear music from King Deluxe and The Future Sounds of San Diego, and more!

But I remember one night where I left the house after a terrible argument with my mom. I walked around for a while and then found myself at a local pond that was frozen over and covered with snow.

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="http://solipsisticnation.com/images/photo-electroton-M.jpg" alt="Electroton" class="alignleft" title="Electroton" height="180" width="280" /><p>On today's show we're listening to select tracks from <a title="Electroton website" href="http://www.electroton.net" target="_blank">Electroton</a>. We'll also talk with the label's founder, Martin Weiss.</p><p>I've only recently discovered Electroton and I've loved everything I've heard from Martin's label. Electroton is one of those labels that tends to favor music that seamlessly blends noise with minimalistic beats. On the surface that's no reason to get excited about the label but the trick that Electroton has managed to pull off is make noise and minimalistic beats warm and human. Something that you'd go out of your way to listen to.</p><p>I featured some tracks from Electroton back in <a title="solipsistic NATION No. 244: Static Hiss web page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/solipsistic-nation-no-244-static-hiss/">June</a>.

      <itunes:summary>On today's show we're listening to select tracks from Electroton. We'll also talk with the label's founder, Martin Weiss.

I've only recently discovered Electroton and I've loved everything I've heard from Martin's label. Electroton is one of those labels that tends to favor music that seamlessly blends noise with minimalistic beats. On the surface that's no reason to get excited about the label but the trick that Electroton has managed to pull off is make noise and minimalistic beats warm and human. Something that you'd go out of your way to listen to.

I featured some tracks from Electroton back in June. Since that show I've been meaning to have Martin on the show to talk with us and share more music from his label. It took a couple of months so I'm happy to that our schedules finally worked out so that we could arrange some time to talk.

If you're a regular listener to solipsistic NATION I also want to apologize for getting some of the shows out late the last two months. I appreciate your patience and I should be back on track in the next few weeks.

Some of the things you can expect from solipsistic NATION in the next few months is an interview with Geeta Dayal, the author of Brian Eno's Another Green World; Martin Vera, who has assembled the Future Sounds of San Diego compilation album, and Lyle Owerko from The Boombox Project.

See you next week!

      <itunes:summary>On today's show we're going to hear Mobthrow rocking it live at the Riddim Collision Festival in Lyon to celebrate Ad Noiseam's 10 year anniversary!

I've been a fan of Ad Noiseam for quite a while and for good reason. Ad Noiseam consistently releases great music. It's that simple. And while Ad Noiseam obvioulsy has a love for breakbeat and dubstep with releases from the likes of Enduser and Bong-Ra it also embraces ambient and experimental music as well, with releases from folks like Wilt and The Mount Fuji Doomjazz Corporation.

Nicolas Chevreux is the founder of Ad Noiseam and you can hear my interview with him and more music from his label here.

I've been a fan of Mobthrow almost as long as I've been a fan of Ad Noiseam.

A few years back I had Kostas from Subheim to talk about his now defunct label, Spectraliquid, and while he was on the show he played some great music from Blackfilm, Cardopusher and Ebola. One of the artists that was also featured on the show was Mobthrow and even in a mix of great music his tracks stood out.

Mobthrow had some great beats and rhythms but it was tinged with a lot of moody atmospherics and some of his tracks were downright noirish. With the release of his first full length album, Mobthrow's music has not only become grander in scale but somehow, at the same time, even more intimate.

Angelos Liaros is Mobthrow and he joins us today by phone from Berlin to talk about his latest album and his live set at the Riddim Collision Festival for Ad Noiseam's 10 year anniversary.

Join us again next week when we'll showcase music from Electroton and talk to Martin Weiss, the label's founder.

See you then!

I do, however, love the idea and I spend a couple of hours every week listening to music selected by people I know on exfm. In fact, today's show was inspired by music I heard from Charles and <a title="Murat Esmer exfm page" href="http://ex.fm/muratesmer" target="_blank">Murat Esmer</a> on exfm.</p><p><a title="Stuntdouble Soundcloud page" href="http://soundcloud.com/stuntdouble" target="_blank">Stuntdouble</a> has been my friend for just about as long as I've been in San Diego. While he wears his heart on his sleeve the man has got hidden depths and during the time I've known him he's been polishing his flow, alchemically transferring his words into your brain. And it doesn't hurt when you have someone like <a title="Tenshun Soundcloud page" href="http://soundcloud.com/10shun-tenshun" target="_blank">Tenshun</a> crafting your beats. The guy makes his own vinyl, for crying out loud!</p><p>One of the things I love about hip hop and punk is that it tends to be intensely regional. I hail from Boston, so it's hard for me to see San Diego as anythng other than a slice of paradise. Stuntdouble and Tenshun really brought their A game on <i><a title="The Ballad of Shawn T. Nelson web page" href="http://www.accesshiphop.com/store/?itemid=21245" target="_blank">The Ballad of Shawn T.

Bryan Charles Hollon is Boom Bip and "Mascot And The Moth" comes from his new album, <i><a title="Zig Zaj iTunes page" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/zig-zaj/id464970843" target="_blank">Zig Zaj</a></i>.</p><p>"It's Up There" is by <a title="The Field MySpace page" href="http://www.myspace.com/thefieldsthlm">The Field</a> from their new album, <i><a title="Looping State Of Mind iTunes page" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/looping-state-of-mind/id460417889" target="_blank">Looping State Of Mind</a></i>.

      <itunes:summary>Today on solipsistic NATION we'll talk with Charles Smith, the co-founder and COO of exfm, an online musical service that I'm very excited about. As you browse the web exfm gathers every MP3 file that you come across and builds a music library for you that you can share with your friends.

I don't get to listen to much music that way because I'm already up to my neck with music that is constantly being sent my way. I do, however, love the idea and I spend a couple of hours every week listening to music selected by people I know on exfm. In fact, today's show was inspired by music I heard from Charles and Murat Esmer on exfm.

Stuntdouble has been my friend for just about as long as I've been in San Diego. While he wears his heart on his sleeve the man has got hidden depths and during the time I've known him he's been polishing his flow, alchemically transferring his words into your brain. And it doesn't hurt when you have someone like Tenshun crafting your beats. The guy makes his own vinyl, for crying out loud!

One of the things I love about hip hop and punk is that it tends to be intensely regional. I hail from Boston, so it's hard for me to see San Diego as anythng other than a slice of paradise. Stuntdouble and Tenshun really brought their A game on The Ballad of Shawn T. Nelson and it's densely packed with rhymes and beats and their track "Enemy" kicks off today's show.

We'll also hear "Quietus" by Meat Beat Manifesto from their new album, Answers Come in Dreams. Jack Dangers is the man behind Meat Beat Manifesto and he came on the show to talk about Answers Come in Dreams last February and you can listen to that show here.

We'll also listen to "In The Throes Of It" by Roots Manuva from his new album, 4everevolution. I've been a fan of Roots Manuva since his 1999 release, Brand New Second Hand, and the reason I've been such a big fan is because he's not afraid to take chances with his music and his musical and lyrical ability has really grown because of that.

"Mascot And The Moth" is by Boom Bip. Bryan Charles Hollon is Boom Bip and "Mascot And The Moth" comes from his new album, Zig Zaj.

"It's Up There" is by The Field from their new album, Looping State Of Mind. Axel Willner is The Field and I was turned on to him by Amy Grill when we talked about her docoumentary, Speaking in Code. In Speaking in Code Amy followed the lives of several different musicians such as Monolake, Modeselektor and Axel. You can find that show here.

We also hear the Unkle Surrender Sounds Session #16 of Trentemøller's "Neverglade" from Trentemøller's Reworked/Remixed album. As always, Trentemøller's music is brooding and gorgeous.

"Dead Guitars" is by Seefeel from their self-titled album that was released last year on Warp Records.

From The Chemical Brothers' Further album we'll hear the tracks "Escape Velocity" and "Snow" featuring the dreamy vocals of Stephanie Dosen.

"Dictaphone's Lament" is by Tycho from his 2010 release, Past &amp; Present and we're going to close today's show with "Disappear" by Phutureprimitive. "Disappear" comes from Phutureprimitive's Kinetik album and he was on the show just a few months ago to talk about his new album. You can hear more music from Phutureprimitive, Bluetech, Pitch Black and Ott on the June 26th, 2011 edition of solipsitic NATION here.

Join us again next week when we'll do it all over again, but completely different. See you then!

      <itunes:summary>[tlr] makes his triumphant return on solipsistic NATION as NVR-NDR with a special live set and a handful of studio tracks from his Extreme Hyper Impact album!

[tlr], you may recall, was on the show this time last year with a mix of select tracks from the Magicore blog he runs with tooth_eye and Phil. That show was one of my favorite from solipsistic NATION in 2010 because it was so fun, imaginative and exhilirating. Magicore is a genre that exists solely in [tlr]'s head so I was thrilled when he alchemically transmuted his imagination into reality with the release of his Extreme Hyper Impact album. I admit it, I want to live in [tlr]'s world, anime exagerated eyes and speed lines and all. If you like what you hear then why not spend a few bucks on [tlr]'s album so we can all live in his world.

Some quick apologies before I go.

Today's show was actually supposed to go out two weeks ago. solipsistic NATION is a labor of love but sometimes the demands of day-to-day life intrude on the show. I've been so busy lately that it doesn't take much to derail working on solipsistic NATION and that's exactly what happened a few weeks back. My apologies go out to [tlr] and especially to you. I can't tell you how much I appreciate that you listen to the show.

Come back again next week and we'll do it all over again. See you then!

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="http://solipsisticnation.com/images/photo-blotteracid-M.jpg" alt="Blotter Acid" class="alignleft" title="Blotter Acid" height="180" width="280" /><p>So here's the pitch: 100 songs on one show.</p><p>This show has been brewing for, I don't know, the last three or four years. Since <b>solipsistic NATION</b> was first launched I've accumulated a huge library of music. To be honest, at this point it's a constant deluge and I'll never catch up with it. There's only so many hours in a day.</p><p>Anyway, not only do I have this huge library of music to choose from to put together each show I've also got a lot of tracks that clock in at a minute or less. At some point it seemed obvious that I should put together a mix of just those brief tracks. In fact, I've tried to do this show several times in the past but it never gelled. I almost gave up on the idea but last weekend I rolled up my sleeves and gave it another shot and what do you know, it finally came together!</p><p>It was still a Herculean task, though. As you might have noticed, last weekend's show didn't go out, so Cyclopean was this project. But after much sweat and blood I stand before you diminished, but I stand before you nonetheless with, one show with 100 songs.</p><p>What I like about today's show is that these tracks are more fragments of songs than a song proper. They suggest a song. And since there are <i>so many</i> tracks, I can explore a lot of different moods and ideas very quickly. So much so that the show seems more like an auditory hallucination that a mix. At least that's how it feels from over here in the <b>solipsistic NATION</b> studios.</p><p>Okay, I'm wrung out like a sponge. I'll see you next week when I'm back to full charge. See you then!</p><p><i>Photo Credit: &#169;<a title="J. Todd Olson website" href="http://toddolson.com" target="_blank">J.

      <itunes:subtitle>solipsistic NATION No. 256: Blotter Acid</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>So here's the pitch: 100 songs on one show.

This show has been brewing for, I don't know, the last three or four years. Since solipsistic NATION was first launched I've accumulated a huge library of music. To be honest, at this point it's a constant deluge and I'll never catch up with it. There's only so many hours in a day.

Anyway, not only do I have this huge library of music to choose from to put together each show I've also got a lot of tracks that clock in at a minute or less. At some point it seemed obvious that I should put together a mix of just those brief tracks. In fact, I've tried to do this show several times in the past but it never gelled. I almost gave up on the idea but last weekend I rolled up my sleeves and gave it another shot and what do you know, it finally came together!

It was still a Herculean task, though. As you might have noticed, last weekend's show didn't go out, so Cyclopean was this project. But after much sweat and blood I stand before you diminished, but I stand before you nonetheless with, one show with 100 songs.

What I like about today's show is that these tracks are more fragments of songs than a song proper. They suggest a song. And since there are so many tracks, I can explore a lot of different moods and ideas very quickly. So much so that the show seems more like an auditory hallucination that a mix. At least that's how it feels from over here in the solipsistic NATION studios.

Okay, I'm wrung out like a sponge. I'll see you next week when I'm back to full charge. See you then!</itunes:summary>

By listener request I was planning to showcase the Moment Sound record label, but due to scheduling conflicts and a blackout that took half of the west coast, I was left in the lurch without a show.

Presto! Instant show!

Bonus: having David on the show also gives me the excuse to play his cover of The Beatles' "Hey Jude" from David's Bollyhood Bass album.

I love a lot of music, and I love a lot of bands but if you asked me to pick just one, I had have to say that it's The Beatles. Hands down. And I suspect it's the same with David.

I've been a fan of David's music since his Bollyhood Bass album was released back in 2010. Feels weird saying that because I feel that some how I've always been listening to David. Some musicians are just that way, you know?

While we were waiting at a stop light a SUV pulled up next to us and playing some bass thumpingly track. It's not the sort of thing I ordinarily enjoy but I liked it. I think I said those very words to Sandi.</p><p>"Who do you think it is?" she asked.</p><p>I pulled out my phone, flicked through a few screens and activated Shazam. Just as I stuck my phone out the window the SUV sped away. I think <a title="Shazam page" href="http://www.shazam.com" target="_blank">Shazam</a> only heard three seconds of whatever the SUV was playing and within seconds I had my answer: it was <a title="Foz Tee Facebook page" href="http://www.facebook.com/FozTee" target="_blank">Foz Tee</a>'s <a title="Shakin' It for Daddy iTunes page" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/what-the-uk-is-missing-volume-2/id373464167" target="_blank">"Shakin' It for Daddy"</a> featuring Nicki Minaj and Robin Thicke. I clicked the button to buy the track from iTunes and in a minute or two it was on my eager little phone.</p><p>Think about that for a moment.</p><p>I just stuck my hand out the window, heard a fragment of a song and a few minutes later we're listening to it on our car.

      <itunes:summary>Since I don't have any guests on this week's show so I guess I'll take this opportunity to ramble.

Today my friend Sandi and I were out driving to go grab a bite to eat. While we were waiting at a stop light a SUV pulled up next to us and playing some bass thumpingly track. It's not the sort of thing I ordinarily enjoy but I liked it. I think I said those very words to Sandi.

"Who do you think it is?" she asked.

I pulled out my phone, flicked through a few screens and activated Shazam. Just as I stuck my phone out the window the SUV sped away. I think Shazam only heard three seconds of whatever the SUV was playing and within seconds I had my answer: it was Foz Tee's "Shakin' It for Daddy" featuring Nicki Minaj and Robin Thicke. I clicked the button to buy the track from iTunes and in a minute or two it was on my eager little phone.

Think about that for a moment.

I just stuck my hand out the window, heard a fragment of a song and a few minutes later we're listening to it on our car. And we take that sort of thing for granted. That's amazing! It's almost magical. I can't believe I live in a world where something like that is not only possible, but mundane.

That's all I got.

Come back and join us again next week when we'll have two, count 'em, two live sets by Polyfuse and NVR-NDR. Hopefully I'll have something more coherent to say by then.

Until then, enjoy today's show!

      <itunes:summary>Playing the best of all genres of electronic music means exploring new labels. Just last week, for example, we heard some wonderful stuff from Ember Music.

Playing the best of all genres of electronic music also means playing recordings of live performances and in the last few months we've heard concerts from Zion Train, Matta and Speak Onion.

Playing the best of all genres of electronic music also means exploring the history of electronic music, and the history of electronic music is remarkably dense when you consider just how brief that history is.

Quick sidebar: my net friend Jeremy Meyers turned me on to an excellent article by NPR's Michaelangelo Matos about how the major labels sold 'electronica' to America. It covers a lot of the same ground I've been exploring in the last few week's on the show as well as some excellent reportage of big beat acts like The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers.

My own history with electronic music probably began with Kraftwerk's Autobahn album back in 1974, but my relationship with electronic music really blossomed in the early 1990s with compilation albums like Waveform Records' AD series and Caroline and Astralwerks' Excursions in Ambience compilation albums and Beyond Records Ambient Dub compilation albums. Those albums really transformed what ambient and dub and electronic music could be and introduced me to a lot of other musicians and labels.

The last few months I've been exploring that period in the history of electronic music on solipsistic NATION and I've had the pleasure of talking with Forest from Waveform Records and Brian Long, who curated the Excursions in Ambience compilation series.

On today's show we're going to continue that exploration by talking with Kim Cascone about his From Here to Tranquility compilation album series from Silent Records and playing select tracks from those albums.

The From Here to Tranquility albums were particularly special to me because as much as I loved the AD and the Excursions albums, I didn't think they were very ambient. The Tranquility albums, on the other hand, may have had a few chillroom rave type of tracks, but the thrust of the series was primarily ambient, and the ambient music that the Tranquility albums seemed to favor had a weird, science fiction vibe to it, which was a lot different from the psychedelic earthiness of Brian Eno's On Land album that I was used to. Nevertheless, the Tranquility albums challenged and shattered my preconceptions of what ambient music could be.

Each Tranquility album was special and each album further expanded the horizons of ambient music.

The From Here to Tranquility compilation albums are just one phase in Silent Records own history, which in turn is just a brief chapter in Kim's life. Even so, those albums are magical and timeless and I'm really excited to share them with you, and if you've already heard them before, to re-introduce you to those albums.

We'll have Kim back in a few months to dig more into the history of Silent Records.

Oh, and before I go, if you liked Tylervision's "The Last Human", then you love his track " Purdy Deyenol."

See you next week!

Clearly, the monolithic major labels that ruled the industry for so many decades is a thing of the past. Oh, they're still there, lumbering about desperately trying to evolve to the new environment that the asteroid that is the internet has created. Now is the time for smaller, more nimble labels to flourish in their particular niche in the ecology of electronic music. In Ember Music's case it's distributing music through services like <a title="SoundCloud website" href="http://soundcloud.com" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> and <a title="Bandcamp website" href="http://bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a> on behalf of the artists on their roster and giving the talent the lion's share of the revenue. Refreshing, huh?</p><p>I mention that because Ember Music really is a wonderful label and if you enjoy any of the music you hear on today's show then I encourage to purchase just one track by one of the artists from today's mix.

Ember Music is an artist-run label and I think that's the other reason I'm excited in particular about today's show.

In Ember Music's case it's distributing music through services like SoundCloud and Bandcamp on behalf of the artists on their roster and giving the talent the lion's share of the revenue. Refreshing, huh?

I mention that because Ember Music really is a wonderful label and if you enjoy any of the music you hear on today's show then I encourage to purchase just one track by one of the artists from today's mix. If you're feeling especially generous, buy a few songs. Maybe an entire album. Anything to support the artists and Ember Music. There are links below to all the artists who appeared on today's show. The rest is up to you.

Join us again next week for a very special conversation with Silent Records' Kim Cascone about his seminal compilation album series, From Here to Tranquility.

See you then!

      <itunes:summary>Today's show was originally going to have interviews with Amon Tobin and Dr. Toast about their new albums; an interview with the folks from the Norbergfestival, which is taking place in Sweden this weekend; and an interview with Geeta Dayal about her book about Brian Eno's album, Another Green World.

But shows like that take a lot of time. I have to schedule the interviews, come up with some hopefully thought provoking questions, then record and edit the interviews, never mind producing the actual show. Add in a day job and suddenly flying to Indiana to say goodbye to my grandfather. I just didn't have that kind time to wrap up the month with a show like that. I promise to deliver that show to you next month, though.

So what have I got for in store for you on today's edition of solipsistic NATION? Glad you asked.

As of last night I had no idea what I was going to do for today's show and then I remembered a mix I had been putting together for Macedonia for his excellent Both Sides of the Surface podcast. Macedonia had invited me to be a guest DJ on his show about a year ago and I've slowly been pulling tracks I thought would perfectly fit right into his show while still conveying the spirit of my own show.

That was the plan, but since I had nothing for today's show, well, my back was against the wall. I'll come up with another set for Macedonia. Hopefully it wont take another six months.

Speaking of Macedonia, you really need to hear his latest podcast. Macedonia's show is always fantastic but he's really been batting them out of the park in 2011. There's a reason I've been listening to Both Sides of the Surface for the last five years. I urge you to give his show a listen and his latest podcast is an excellent place to start.

Lately there's been a huge uptick in the number of people listening to the show. If that happens to be you, thanks for tuning in. And thanks to all you long-time listeners, too.

Just in the last six months I've done features on the Excursions in Ambience and Waveform compilation albums, I've had live performances from everyone from Atari Teenage Riot to Zion Train and segments with everyone from Bluetech to Skinny Puppy's Ogre.

I can't help but think part of that is due to the number of people who listen to the show. If you'd like to help support the show then turn your friends on to solipsistic NATION if you think it's something they'll enjoy as much as you do.

Who knows where the show could go if there was even more of us!

And since there are so many of you listening to solipsistic NATION there's a Kickstarter project I want to you to consider funding.

You know Kickstarter, right? It's a website where people, mostly artists and designers, can try and crowd source funding for a project they want to produce. The most famous Kickstarter project to date has been a very stylish watch band for Apple's iPod Nano.

My buddy, Knitting Guy, has a far humbler but no less magical idea. He wants to transform stop signs in San Diego into flowers. Even if you only kick in a buck you'd be helping him out a lot. Go here for more information.

Join us again next week for a special live set from Speak Onion. I guarantee he'll melt your ear buds.

See you then!

Astralwerks is owned by <a title="Virgin Records/EMI website" href="http://www.virginrecords.com/" target="_blank">Virgin Records/EMI</a> and distributed by Caroline Distribution in the US and continues to release amazing electronic music.</p><p>Brian currently runs <a title="Yes Know Management MySpace page" href="http://www.myspace.com/yesknowmanagement" target="_blank">Yes Know Management</a> and represents artists such as <a title="The Juan McLean website" href="http://www.thejuanmaclean.com/" target="_blank">The Juan McLean</a> and <a title="VHS or Beta website" href="http://www.vhsorbeta.com/VOB/Home.html" target="_blank">VHS or Beta</a>.</p><p>The <i>Excursions in Ambience</i> albums are no longer being pressed and are not available as digital downloads.

      <itunes:summary>Today's show is very special for me and I imagine it will be a very special show for a lot of people, because today we'll be talking with Brian Long and showcasing music from the Excursions in Ambience compilation album series.

Back in the early 1990s when I was first falling deeply in love with electronic music, Caroline Distribution released Excursions in Ambience, which captured my imagination and expanded my horizons of what electronic music, and ambient music, could be.

Excursions in Ambience turned out to be an incredibly successful album, and was quickly followed up with Excursions in Ambience: The Second Orbit, The Third Dimension and ended, sadly, with The Fourth Frontier.

Brian was the AR &amp; Project Manager for Caroline Distribution back in the early 90s and was the man responsible for releasing the Excursions In Ambience series as well as being instrumental in the launch of Astralwerks. Astralwerks is owned by Virgin Records/EMI and distributed by Caroline Distribution in the US and continues to release amazing electronic music.

Brian currently runs Yes Know Management and represents artists such as The Juan McLean and VHS or Beta.

The Excursions in Ambience albums are no longer being pressed and are not available as digital downloads. You can still find used versions of those albums, however, and I've included links below where you can find them on Amazon for a fair price. You can always give sites like eBay a try. too.

If you enjoyed todays' show, and really, how could you not, then you'll probably dig last month's show featuring Waveform Records. I'm going to continue the theme next month with an interview with Silent Records' Kim Cascone and play select tracks from his From Here to Tranquility compilation albums.

A special thanks goes out to all of you who expressed their concern and sympathies for my grandfather's failing health. The last two weeks have been an emotional roller coaster for me and I'm grateful I was able to say goodbye to him. I'll see you again next week. I'm not sure what I've got in store for you. As you can imagine, my schedule has been a bit disrupted, but I'll think of something.

See you then!

Once a month on solipsistic NATION I feature a live performance from an electronic musician.

Arranging and preparing for four interviews, waking up in the wee hours of the night to call <a title="Pitch Black website" href="http://www.pitchblack.co.nz" target="_blank">Pitch Black</a>'s Michael Hodgson, endless hours of editing and mixing, two essential applications crashing constantly, etc. It is by sheer will alone that I was able to pipe today's show into your tender and wanting ears. And what a show it is!</p><p>I've spent the last couple years off and on trying to <a title="solipsistic NATION Label Showcase web page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/category/music-labels/">showcase</a> <a title="Waveform Records website" href="http://www.waveformhq.com/" target="_blank">Waveform Records</a> and that <a title="solipsistic NATION No. 243: Waveform Records web page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/solipsistic-nation-no-243-waveform-records/">show</a> finally came together earlier this month. Quite by coincidence, <a title="Bluetech website" href="http://www.bluetechonline.com" target="_blank">Bluetech</a>, <a title="Phutureprimitive website" href="http://www.phutureprimitive.com" target="_blank">Phutureprimitive</a> and <a title="Pitch Black website" href="http://www.pitchblack.co.nz" target="_blank">Pitch Black</a> had all recently released new albums, and all of them had releases on Waveform Records. I'm new to <a title="Ott website" href="http://www.ottsonic.net/" target="_blank">Ott</a> but he's somehow managed the trick of sounding at once utterly familiar and worn in but completely fresh and surprising at the same time.</p><p>Bluetech's album, <i><a title="Rainforest Reverberation BandCamp page" href="http://criticalbeats.bandcamp.com/album/bluetech-rainforest-reverberation" target="_blank">Rainforest Reverberation</a></i> is classic Bluetech and 100% of the proceeds from all music sales go to end deforestation, species loss, and cultural upheaval in the Amazon. For more information visit <a title="Critical Beats website" href="http://criticalbeats.org/Critical_Beats_for_the_Climate/Welcome.html" target="_blank">criticalbeats.org</a> and <a title="Amazon Voice website" href="http://amazonvoice.org/" target="_blank">amazonvoice.org</a> to stay tuned for regular updates and future releases. Evan has released over 20 albums, and he's founded two really fantastic record labels, Native State and <a title="Somnia website" href="http://www.somniasound.com/" target="_blank">Somnia</a>, where he's released even more great music. You can listen to more music from Evan and his two record labels by downloading shows number <a title="solipsistic NATION No. 77: Native State Records web page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/solipsistic-nation-no-77-native-state-records/">77</a> and <a title="solipsistic NATION No. 102: Somnia web page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/solipsistic-nation-no-102-somnia/">102</a>.</p><p>I've been a fan of <a title="Phutureprimitive website" href="http://www.phutureprimitive.com" target="_blank">Phutureprimitive</a> since the release of his first album, <i><a title="Sub Conscious BandCamp page" href="http://phutureprimitive.bandcamp.com/album/sub-conscious" target="_blank">Sub Conscious</a></i>. Phutureprimitive is another artist that took a few years to get on the show but the stars aligned and a window opened up for Rain to talk about his new album, <i><a title="Kinetic BandCamp page" href="http://phutureprimitive.bandcamp.com/album/kinetik" target="_blank">Kinetic</a></i>, and it was well worth the wait. From the music, to the albums, title, to the album cover, <i>Kinetic</i> is meant to convey one thing: <i>movement</i>. So get your booty moving!</p><p>While I was putting today's show together I asked folks on Twitter and Facebook who they thought I should also include to round out the show and Pitch Black came up time and again and is an obvious choice if you give it a moment's thought. Another happy coincidence: Pitch Black have also released a new album and it's called <i><a title="Remixes & Rarities BandCamp page" href="http://pitchblack.bandcamp.com/album/remixes-rarities" target="_blank">Remixes &amp; Rarities</a></i>. Mitch was gracious enough to come on the show to talk about their new album and how much Pitch Black owes their sound to dub, so much so that it's their "lead instrument."</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, I'm new to Ott but I'm now a dedicated fan. I said that Ott's music also feels very familiar. Earlier in his career Ott worked with such luminaries as <a title="Brian Eno Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno" target="_blank">Brian Eno</a>, <a title="The Orb website" href="http://www.theorb.com/" target="_blank">The Orb</a>, <a title="Youth Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_%22Youth%22_Glover" target="_blank">Youth</a>, <a title="African Head Charge Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Head_Charge" target="_blank">African Head Charge</a>, <a title="Steve Hillage Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Hillage" target="_blank">Steve Hillage</a>, and <a title="On-U-Sound website" href="http://www.onu-sound.com/" target="_blank">On-U-Sound</a> and I can't help but think those experiences rubbed off on the young Ott. No wonder Ott's music feels instantly beloved.</p><p>A bit of news...</p><p>This has been a banner month for <b>solipsistic NATION</b> and Junes's not yet over!</p><p>As of today, <b>solipsistic NATION</b> has been downloaded over a whopping 33,000 times this month. That's a record but it gets better still. This <a title="solipsistic NATION No. 242: alka, merohedra, Alexei Borisov and 80(sun), Live page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/solipsistic-nation-no-242-alka-merohedra-alexei-borisov-and-80sun-live/">month's live show</a> featuring <a title="alka MySpace page" href="http://www.myspace.com/alka" target="_blank">alka</a>, <a title="merohedra SoundCloud page" href="http://soundcloud.com/merohedra" target="_blank">merohedra</a>, <a title="Alexei Borisov MySpace page" href="http://www.myspace.com/alexeiborisov" target="_blank">Alexei Borisov</a> and <a title="80(sun) BandCamp page" href="http://80sun.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">80(sun)</a> has been downloaded over 11 thousand times! That's more than the other show that was the most downloaded edition of <b>solipsistic NATION</b>. That was <a title="Amon Tobin website" href="http://www.amontobin.com/" target="_blank">Amon Tobin</a>'s <a title="solipsistic NATION No. 123: Amon Tobin Live web page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/solipsistic-nation-no-123-amon-tobin-live/" target="_blank">live set</a> and that show took over two years to break 10,000 downloads!</p><p>Listen, I work hard on the show because I love the music and I want to share it with as many people as I can. If you like what you hear, you can help the artists by spending a buck or two on one of their songs, maybe buy an entire album. You can help me out by telling your friends and your net friends on Twitter and Facebook about <b>solipsistic NATION</b> if you want to share the music with them too.</p><p>Finally, and sadly, I don't know if you've heard the news but <a title="Cheb I Sabbah website" href="http://www.chebisabbah.com" target="_blank">Cheb I Sabbah</a> has been diagnosed with Stage 4 stomach cancer and that his cancer is spreading to his liver and left lung. Without immediate and proper treatment, the prognosis given is very grim. Cheb does not have health insurance. As you can imagine, the cost to treat his cancer is going to be astronomically expensive. To make matters worse, due to his weakened condition, Cheb has had to cancel many shows, bringing his income stream to a complete halt.</p><p>But you can help.</p><p><a title="Indiegogo website" href="http://www.indiegogo.com" target="_blank">Indiegogo</a> is crowd sourcing to raise money to help pay for Cheb's medical expenses.

      <itunes:summary>I've got a great show for you today. Well, great if you like things that snap, crackle and hiss.

We'll hear a couple tracks off of the Clicks &amp; Cuts 5.0 - Paradigm Shift compilation album. Clicks &amp; Cuts was released by the newly relaunched Mille Plateaux label, and Clicks &amp; Cuts caused a bit of stir in the electronic music community.

I think the album is pretty dope and I'm basing that solely on the music.

We'll also hear a couple tracks from Electroton with artists Weiss, Thorsten Soltau and Kabutogani. I don't know a lot about Electroton but so far everything I've heard from the label has been absolutely fantastic so I'll be keeping my eye on them, and so should you.

I got a really nice email earlier this week from Lyman, who listens to the show from the UK. Lyman likes the show and he also turned me on to some really great music ranging from flamenco to French horn and Javanese Gamelan music to some Renaissance music. You can find videos of the music Lyman introduced me below.

Last week's label showcase featuring Waveform Records got a lot of love. Macedonia from the always excellent Both Sides of the Surface podcast said that his wife still has her copy of the One A.D. compilation album along with releases from Higher Intelligence Agency and Sounds From The Ground.

Seven on Facebook told me that Waveform Records A.D. series helped him study while he was in med school and was excited to learn that he can now listen to more music from Waveform Records on the Musical Starstreams online radio show.

If you liked last week's show featuring Waveform Records, then you're really going to dig next week's show. We'll talk with Bluetech, Phutureprimitive, Ott and Pitch Black and hear tracks from their new albums.

See you then!

<br />On today's show we're going to hear select tracks from artists on <a title="Waveform Records website" href="http://www.waveformhq.com" target="_blank">Waveform Records</a>. We'll also talk with <a title="Forest web page" href="http://www.starstreams.com/forest.html" target="_blank">Forest</a>, who is the label's co-founder.</p>

<p>Today's show is kind of a big deal for me. Back in the early 90s there were a clutch of albums that came out at roughly the same time I was falling in love with electronic music. <a title="Beyond Records web page" href="http://www.discogs.com/label/Beyond" target="_blank">Beyond Records</a> <i><a title="Ambient Dub web page" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/tagging/customer-tags/A1MM3TIZPH4P0J/ambient%20dub%20series" target="_blank">Ambient Dub</a></i> , <a title="Astralwerks website" href="http://www.astralwerks.com" target="_blank">Astralwerks</a> <i><a title="Excursions in Ambience Amazon page" href="http://www.amazon.com/Excursions-In-Ambience-%28Series%29/e/B000AQ0CJS" target="_blank">Excursions in Ambience</a></i> and Waveform Records <i>A.D.</i> compilation albums were on heavy rotation on my show when I was spinning at <a title="WMFO website" href="http://wmfo.org" target="_blank">WMFO</a>. I still consider those albums essential listening and they introduced me to a wider world of electronic music beyond industrial and happy hardcore.</p>

<p>When I began <b>solipsistic NATION</b> I had a list of record labels I wanted to feature on the show and Waveform Records was always on the top of the list. It's a real treat for me, and I hope for you as well, to have Forest on today's show. Forest will flesh out the history of Waveform Records and it's origins in Forests radio show, <a title="Musical Starstreams website" href="http://www.starstreams.com" target="_blank">Musical Starstreams</a> and it's connections to Beyond Records. We'll also get a look at how online reviews can unfairly dog an album for years. And we've got some really, <i>really</i> great music to listen to!</p>

<p>Next month, by listener demand, we'll showcase <a title="Katabatik Records website" href="http://www.katabatik.org/kollektion/" target="_blank">Katabatik Records</a>. Joins us again next week and we'll do it all over again. But completely different!</p>

Today's show is kind of a big deal for me. Back in the early 90s there were a clutch of albums that came out at roughly the same time I was falling in love with electronic music. Beyond Records Ambient Dub , Astralwerks Excursions in Ambience and Waveform Records A.D. compilation albums were on heavy rotation on my show when I was spinning at WMFO. I still consider those albums essential listening and they introduced me to a wider world of electronic music beyond industrial and happy hardcore.

When I began solipsistic NATION I had a list of record labels I wanted to feature on the show and Waveform Records was always on the top of the list. It's a real treat for me, and I hope for you as well, to have Forest on today's show.

Mutek is an annual five-day event in Montreal which kicks of this year June 1st.

Each year, more than 100 artists, panelists, and industry professionals participate in what has become a leading event of its kind in North America. MUTEK also hosts numerous international versions of its festival in locations often under-represented in such places like Mexico City, Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Colombia.

Today's show is a bit of a hodgepodge mix of acts I'd like to see at this year's Mutek Festival. Amon Tobin has been on solipsistic NATION a couple times and his live set is actually the fist edition of solipsistic NATION to break 10,000 downloads but I've never actually seen Amon rock a show. I finally saw Badawi on Meat Beat Manifesto's Autoimmune tour and if I was going to this year's Mutek Festival I'd definitely see Badawi again.

      <itunes:summary>Today on solipsistic NATION we're going to bring in the Rapture with a mix put together for us by Praketh, who is also the host of the blueOrb podcast.

Praketh has only released a handful of shows on blueOrb but when he does, well, they're just breath taking!

I first came across Praketh's blueOrb podcast back in 2006 when he released his Down The Rabbit Hole (Electronic Chillout Mix). I still remember the first time I listened to it.

It was an early morning in San Diego. I had just pulled an all-nighter and was walking down the street to get some coffee. I had Praketh's mix playing over my headphones and I was hearing things that I wasn't sure was part of his mix or sounds of my city. They blended together so seamlessly I couldn't tell one from the other. but they made that morning a magical experience.

And then there was the music, the beautiful music! With tracks from the likes of Tycho, Boards of Canada and Nalepa it's hard to go wrong, but in Praketh's hands he turned those songs into a narrative and an emotional journey.

I was so touched by Praketh's mix I asked him if I could feature it on the show, and you can find it here.

Last month, Praketh emailed me with a link to another mix he had put together and asked if I would consider playing it on the show. I said yes before I had even downloaded his mix.

Praketh is an Indian based electronic music DJ who also performs as buffaPirate.

As blueOrb he plays music that's emotional and rich in texture. As buffaPirate he spins bass heavy electronic music like Dubstep, drum and bass and Glitch-Hop.

In 2008 he moved from Bombay to New Delhi to work as the A&amp;R/Label Manager for Audio Aashram and Programming Head for Radio79.com. As of 2011 he has focused more on his own music productions, which I am really looking forward to hearing more of.

Go to soundcloud.com/praketh to learn more about Praketh and hear more of his wonderful mixes.

Join us next week when we'll talk with Alain Mongeau, the founder the Mutek Festival taking place in Montreal next month.

      <itunes:summary>Looks like we picked up a lot of new listeners thanks to last week's show featuring Karsh Kale, Tim Tim Sköld, Ogre and Hoodoo Engine. If that's you, welcome aboard!
The first weekend of each and every month I feature a live performance with a quick interview with the artist. Recent shows have included concerts from Igorrr, :papercutz and Atari Teenage Riot.

On today's show we're going to listen to a live set from James and Andy of Matta. I think you're going to dig it. I've already played it enough times over my headphones that I think it's worn a permanent groove in my brain.

James and Andy have remixed everyone from Hecq to Haters and they recently released their album, Prototype, on everyone's favorite label, Ad Noiseam Records. Prototyope is definitely worth your money, but listen to today's show first before you run off to download it.

Join us again next week when we'll showcase the music of Herb Recordings!

      <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://solipsisticnation.com/images/photo-hecate-M.jpg" alt="Hecate" title="Hecate" height="180" width="280" /></p>

<p>I'm still astonished how quickly this week's show came together. And what a great show it is!</p>

<p>Hey, I'm like you. I've got a job, I've got a life. I'm a busy guy. But I've got a to-do list as long as my arm and every day I chip away at it. A quick email here, a phone call here, and slowly but surely things get done. But when I'm in this mode I don't often see the forest for the trees. Or is it the trees for the forest? I can never remember how that goes. Anyway, my point is that sometimes I'm so caught up in the minutea of producing a show that I lose sight of the big picture.</p>

<p>In the last couple of weeks I learned that <a title="Karsh Kale website" href="http://www.karshkale.com" target="_blank">Karsh Kale</a>, <a title="Tim Sköld website" href="hhttp://www.skold.com" target="_blank">Tim Sk&#246;ld</a>, <a title="Ogre Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nivek_Ogre" target="_blank">Ogre</a> and <a title="HoodooEngine website" href="http://www.hoodooengine.com" target="_blank">HoodooEngine</a> had released or were about to release new albums. I dig them all so I do what I do sent out the emails and made the phone calls. There were other musicians, labels and festivals I wanted to feature on the show as well but they didn't happen due to availability and time constraints and before I knew it, this week's show had been distilled into a gem of greatness.</p>

<p>I discovered Karsh Kale right about the same time I discovered the <a title="Asian Massive Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_underground" target="_blank">Asian Massive</a> (or Asian Underground) scene. Over the years I watched the careers of Karsh Kale, <a title="Asian Dub Foundation website" href="http://www.asiandubfoundation.com/" target="_blank">Asian Dub Foundation</a> and others grow over the years and it's a wonder that I haven't had someone like Karsh on the show earlier. Karsh has released <a title="Karsh Kale discography Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karsh_Kale#Discography" target="_blank">six albums</a> and recorded and performed with everyone from <a title="Zakir Hussain Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakir_Hussain_%28musician%29" target="_blank">Zakir Hussain</a> to <a title="Yoko Ono website" href="http://www.imaginepeace.com/" target="_blank">Yoko Ono</a>. Karsh's latest album, <i><a title="Cinema iTunes page" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/cinema/id432456306" target="_blank">Cinema</a></i>, is his most ambitious album to date. It's big, bold and melodramatic, and Karsh's experience scoring films has had an impact on the scope of <i>Cinema</i>.</p>

<p>Tim Sk&#246;ld was another surprise! Before I knew it, one night after work I found myself in front of a microphone talking to Tim about his long career, from his rock roots in bands like <a title="Kingpin Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Skold#Kingpin" target="_blank">Kingpin</a> and <a title="Shotgun Messiah Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_Messiah" target="_blank">Shotgun Messiah</a> and then later playing with the likes of <a title="KMFDM website" href="http://www.kmfdm.net/" target="_blank">KMFDM</a> and <a title="Marilyn Manson website" href="http://www.marilynmanson.com/" target="_blank">Marilyn Manson</a>. Tim also released a <a title="Skold Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skold" target="_blank">solo album</a> back in 1996 and 15 years later he's followed it up with <i><a title="Anomie iTunes page" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/preorder/anomie/id432199824" target="_blank">Anomie</a></i>, due out May 10th. Tim was great to talk with and I found that he's as much an agent provocateur in person as he is in his music. I also had some great questions to ask him from folks like Jeremy and <a title="Royb0t Twitter page" href="http://twitter.com/#!/Royb0t" target="_blank">Royb0t</a> from Twitter and Facebook.</p>

<p>Ogre's is set to release a second album with ohGr called <i>unDeveloped</i> that also due to be released May 10th. Ogre and <a title="Skinny Puppy website" href="http://www.skinnypuppy.com/" target="_blank">Skinny Puppy</a> have scored the post apocalyptic soundtrack to our lives for nearly 30 years. While Skinny Puppy was my introduction into industrial music, there's industrial music and then there's Skinny Puppy. They're in their own category and to call them industrial is kind of limiting. I was curious to see what directions Ogre would explore through ohGr and to be honest, I didn't like <i>unDeveloped</i> at first. As Ogre mentions during our chat, people rarely give music full attention because they're usually multitasking while they're listening <i>to</i> music. I was doing the same thing with <i>unDeveloped</i> but one night while I was going out for a run I listened to <i>unDeveloped</i> and without being aware of it I found myself lost in the album and now I think it's one of my favorite album of 2011.</p>

<p>Once I finally realized that Tim and Ogre were going to be guests on this week's show I knew I had to include Hoodoo Engine. I've wanted to play tracks from their <i><a title="EgoWhore iTunes page" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/egowhore/id393267809" target="_blank">EgoWhore</a></i> album since it was released in 2010 but it was just one of those scheduling things. Hoodoo Engine would be perfect for today's show and to top it off, they're gearing up to release their new album, <i>Murder the World</i>, and it's more wretched and evil than <i>EgoWhore</i>, if such a thing is even possible. The core of Hoodoo Engine is <a title="Marz233 Facebook page" href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1344373344&ref=ts" target="_blank">Marz233</a>, James Curcio and Johann Ess. Just to be above board, both James and I are on the <a title="Alterati website" href="http://www.alterati.com/blog/" target="_blank">Alterati Network</a>, but I've known James long before Alterati when I interviewed him about his book, <i><a title="Join My Cult Amazon web page" href="http://www.amazon.com/Join-My-Cult-James-Curcio/dp/1561841730" target="_blank">Join My Cult</a></i>. While you anxiously wait for the release of <i>Murder the World</i> you can watch <i><a title="Clark web page" href="http://www.alterati.com/blog/clark/" target="_blank">Clark</a></i>, a gonzo mockumentary reality show art film surrounding the struggles of an independent artist in a capitalist world.</p>

<p>Oh, special thanks to <a title="tricil website" href="http://tricil.net/" target="_blank">tricil</a> for providing the incidental music during my interviews with Tim and Hoodoo Engine. While I was putting together today's show I realized that I didn't have any instrumental music from either of them and went on Twitter and asked if anyone had some tracks I could use for music beds. tricil stepped responded in minutes and generously let me use his tracks "rcc3" and "conserve destroy." There are links to download those two tracks below.</p>

<p>Enjoy the show. I'm going to shut up and go outside and get some sunshine. But I'll still be listening to today's show on my earbuds. Joins us again next week for a <a title="solipsistic NATION: Live web page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/?cat=9">live set</a> from the lads from <a title="Matta SoundCloud page" href="http://soundcloud.com/matta-music" target="_blank">Matta</a>. Or will they be our <a title="solipsistic NATION: Guest DJs web page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/?cat=6">guest DJs</a>? See you then!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<img src="http://solipsisticnation.com/images/photo-tangerine-M.jpg" alt="Tangerine" title="Tangerine" height="180" width="280" /><p>Whew, just barely got this week's show out and I owe it all to <a title="Potion Factory website" href="http://www.potionfactory.com" target="_blank">Potion Factory</a>'s <a title="Tangerine! web page" href="http://www.potionfactory.com/tangerine/" target="_blank">Tangerine!</a> software. Tangerine lets you easily create playlists by analyzing the beats per minute and the beat intensity of your music.</p><p>Between work and interviewing people for next weeks big show featuring the likes of <a title="Skinny Puppy website" href="http://skinnypuppy.com" target="_blank">Skinny Puppy</a>'s <a title="Ogre Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nivek_Ogre" target="_blank">Ogre</a>, <a title="Marilyn Manson website" href="http://www.marilynmanson.com" target="_blank">Marilyn Manson</a>'s <a title="Tim Skold website" href="http://www.skold.com" target="_blank">Tim Skold</a>, <a title="Hoodoo Engine website" href="http://www.hoodooengine.com" target="_blank">Hoodoo Engine</a> and <a title="Karsh Kale website" href="http://www.karshkale.com" target="_blank">Karsh Kale</a> I just never had time to put together a mix for today's show. But I did have a card up my sleeve: Tangerine!</p><p>I told Tangerine! to randomly pull from a playlist I had created in iTunes of tracks that I had listened to and had given a three to five star rating. I also told Tangerine! to to choose songs that had both mid to high BPMs and beat intestity.</p><p>Tangerine! did a pretty good job. I was surprised by some of the tracks it selected, but overall I was pleased with the results. I just had to soften the edges here and there. While Tangerine! would never replace a DJ but it does a pretty damn good job. Tangerine! is $24.95 and runs only on Macs. Sorry, PC guys.

      <itunes:subtitle>solipsistic NATION No. 236: Tangerine</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Whew, just barely got this week's show out and I owe it all to Potion Factory's Tangerine! software. Tangerine lets you easily create playlists by analyzing the beats per minute and the beat intensity of your music.

Between work and interviewing people for next weeks big show featuring the likes of Skinny Puppy's Ogre, Marilyn Manson's Tim Skold, Hoodoo Engine and Karsh Kale I just never had time to put together a mix for today's show. But I did have a card up my sleeve: Tangerine!

I told Tangerine! to randomly pull from a playlist I had created in iTunes of tracks that I had listened to and had given a three to five star rating. I also told Tangerine! to to choose songs that had both mid to high BPMs and beat intestity.

Tangerine! did a pretty good job. I was surprised by some of the tracks it selected, but overall I was pleased with the results. I just had to soften the edges here and there. While Tangerine! would never replace a DJ but it does a pretty damn good job. Tangerine! is $24.95 and runs only on Macs. Sorry, PC guys. Potion Factory isn't sponsoring this week's show, I just happen to like their product.

Before I get out of Dodge, I just have to say that I love my Apple Magic Mouse and wireless keyboard.

The keyboard may be a touch on the small side but it's a tight little device and really well designed. The keys have a matte finish feel to them, giving them a slight sand papery feel, which pleases. The keys also make a satisfying clacking sound when you type, enough to make you feel like you're accomplishing something, but not distracting.

It took me a few weeks to warm up to my wireless mouse but now I love it. What really helped was installing MagicPrefs, which cleared up the default settings lousy cursor tracking. MagicPrefs also gave me the options to customize my mouse clicks to perform specific functions. Very cool stuff.

Okay, I'm done geeking out on gear. Come back again next week's big show. See you then!

In my movie, PVT's "Community" would be the music that you'd hear at the beginning of the movie when all the production companies display their logos and "Community" sets the mood immediately for the rest of the movie. Big, solemn, and mysterious.</p><p>From "Community" we make our way to <a title="Neil Milton web page" href="http://feedbacklooplabel.blogspot.com/2011/02/fbl010-various-artists-brave-new-world.html" target="_blank">Neil Milton</a>'s "The Broken Lines" from the <i><a title="Neil Milton web page" href="http://feedbacklooplabel.blogspot.com/2011/02/fbl010-various-artists-brave-new-world.html" target="_blank">Brave New World</a></i> compilation album released by the <a title="FeedbackLoop Label website" href="http://feedbacklooplabel.blogspot.com" target="_blank">FeedbackLoop Label</a>. The "Broken Lines" is our movies' introduction as intoned by our narrator. As our narrator speaks we dissolve to ocean waves in the night. The camera pulls back to reveal our sinister city and we segue into <a title="Kabutogani MySpace page" href="http://www.myspace.com/kabutogani" target="_blank">Kabutogani</a>'s track, "Ducts," from Kabutogani's <i><a title="Bektop iTunes page" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bektop/id321089760" target="_blank">Bektop</a></i> album. The camera slowly begins to advance on the city, picking up speed until we glide over the shore and into the city streets.</p><p>I don't know what kind of movie this is but it's definitely got a noirish vibe to it with some scifi undertones, kind of like <i><a title="Dark City Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_City_(1998_film)" target="_blank">Dark City</a></i> or <i><a title="The Matrix Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix" target="_blank">The Matrix</a></i>.

"Big City Nights" sounds like music that signifies that our movie is moving into it's second act and Undermathic is moving the story right along with it.

Mmm, sounds introspective, pensive and full of regret. Our heroes must be doing a lot of soul searching right about now. Smoking cigarettes, walking through the rain, driving nowhere on their motorcycles through the city streets.</p><p>Before "Mimikry" we'll hear "Concerning The Bombs" by <a title="Starting Teeth MySpace page" href="http://www.myspace.com/startingteeth" target="_blank">Starting Teeth</a> featuring <a title="Larytta MySpace page" href="http://www.myspace.com/larytta" target="_blank">Larytta</a> from the <i><a title="Let's Get Creaked web page" href="http://creaked.bandcamp.com/album/lets-get-creaked" target="_blank">Let's Get Creaked</a></i> compilation album.

That's definitely the smash cut to act three.</p><p>And how do we resolve out little movie?

      <itunes:summary>Today's show is a soundtrack for an imaginary movie set in an imaginary city. Think Bladerunner's LA meets William Gibson's Sprawl meets Tron: Legacy.

Our first track is "Community" by PVT from their Church With No Magic album released by Warp Records. In my movie, PVT's "Community" would be the music that you'd hear at the beginning of the movie when all the production companies display their logos and "Community" sets the mood immediately for the rest of the movie. Big, solemn, and mysterious.

From "Community" we make our way to Neil Milton's "The Broken Lines" from the Brave New World compilation album released by the FeedbackLoop Label. The "Broken Lines" is our movies' introduction as intoned by our narrator. As our narrator speaks we dissolve to ocean waves in the night. The camera pulls back to reveal our sinister city and we segue into Kabutogani's track, "Ducts," from Kabutogani's Bektop album. The camera slowly begins to advance on the city, picking up speed until we glide over the shore and into the city streets.

I don't know what kind of movie this is but it's definitely got a noirish vibe to it with some scifi undertones, kind of like Dark City or The Matrix. I wonder what the big reveal will be? Will our heroes find that they are living in a digital illusion or that their city is actually a spaceship?

We've meet our protagonists and antagonists and the conflict and drama begins as Weiss' "Rezykla" weaves the plot elements together. Thorsten Soltau continues that theme with "Rezykla7."

What soundtrack would be complete without Brian Eno and from Eno's 2010 album, Small Craft On A Milk Sea, we'll hear "Complex Heaven." Come to think of it, this week's show probably wouldn't exist without Brian Eno's many scores for imaginary films.

From Undermathic we'll hear "Big City Nights" from their album, 10;10pm, out on Tympanik Audio. "Big City Nights" sounds like music that signifies that our movie is moving into it's second act and Undermathic is moving the story right along with it. The stakes are suddenly bigger and plot twists abound.

"Shrouding" is by Perfect Blind from their Three Spires album and this to me sounds like your chase scene or fight scene music, right?

This is all leading to the big showdown.

Let's be honest, the music is more to suggest the idea of a kind of movie than an actual plot or storyline. I'll leave that you screenwriters out there.

In act three we listening to Subheim's remix of SE's track, "Mimikry." Mmm, sounds introspective, pensive and full of regret. Our heroes must be doing a lot of soul searching right about now. Smoking cigarettes, walking through the rain, driving nowhere on their motorcycles through the city streets.

Before "Mimikry" we'll hear "Concerning The Bombs" by Starting Teeth featuring Larytta from the Let's Get Creaked compilation album. From Suicide Inside we'll hear "Kill The Guilt" from their album, Dead Red. That's definitely the smash cut to act three.

And how do we resolve out little movie? Well, we're going to close with the Oneohtrix Point Never Edit of King Felix's "Metal Confection." Kind of feels like resolution music where the big plot twist is revealed and with Phutureprimitive's new album, Kinetik, we roll credits with his track, "Disappear."

I hope you enjoy this week's soundtrack to an imaginary movie. Join us again next week and we'll do it all over again. But completely different!

The Centrifuge focuses on the expression of the experimental aesthetic in electronic music, with an emphasis on electronica, glitch, ambience and minimalism, acid, IDM and drill and bass.</p><p>When I relaunched <b>solipsistic NATION</b> as a podcast and later as a radio program I had a mental checklist of labels I wanted to feature on the show. In the last five years I've slowly checked off most the of those labels. There are still plenty of labels left on that list but I've decided to focus more and more on exploring the blossoming of new electronic music labels. Most of these labels are netlabels, which makes sense in this age of the internet. What curious, though, is how electronic music labels often lends itself to collectivism, and that's a theme we'll explore on today's show.</p><p>The Centrifuge as a collective entity has been around since 2007 and its main purpose was to put out releases by <a title="Eutechnik MySpace page" href="http://www.myspace.com/eutechnik" target="_blank">Eutechnik</a>. The Centrifuge has grown very quickly during those last four years and has grown its roster of artists. They've been kind enough to send me links to downloads of the latest albums released on The Centrifuge and I've always been impressed with what I've heard. <a title="The Weather Channel MySpace page" href="http://www.thecentrifuge.co.uk/_wp/2010/07/cf047-the-weather-channel-ep-released" target="_blank">The Weather Channel</a>'s "Weather Channel 0" still gives me chills to this day (<a title="The Weather Channel free mp3 download" href="http://www.thecentrifuge.co.uk/ccount/click.php?id=108" target="_blank">click here</a> for a free download) and <a title="Roy of the Ravers web page" href="http://agency.thecentrifuge.co.uk/roy-of-the-ravers/" target="_blank">Roy of the Ravers</a> still makes me want to dance.

      <itunes:subtitle>solipsistic NATION No. 234: The Centrifuge</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>Today on solipsistic NATION we'll showcase The Centrifuge, a UK-based electronic arts collective that runs a digital record label and organises events around Europe. The Centrifuge focuses on the expression of the experimental aesthetic in electronic music, with an emphasis on electronica, glitch, ambience and minimalism, acid, IDM and drill and bass.

When I relaunched solipsistic NATION as a podcast and later as a radio program I had a mental checklist of labels I wanted to feature on the show. In the last five years I've slowly checked off most the of those labels. There are still plenty of labels left on that list but I've decided to focus more and more on exploring the blossoming of new electronic music labels. Most of these labels are netlabels, which makes sense in this age of the internet. What curious, though, is how electronic music labels often lends itself to collectivism, and that's a theme we'll explore on today's show.

The Centrifuge as a collective entity has been around since 2007 and its main purpose was to put out releases by Eutechnik. The Centrifuge has grown very quickly during those last four years and has grown its roster of artists. They've been kind enough to send me links to downloads of the latest albums released on The Centrifuge and I've always been impressed with what I've heard. The Weather Channel's "Weather Channel 0" still gives me chills to this day (click here for a free download) and Roy of the Ravers still makes me want to dance. Just wonderful stuff!

Nearly all the music is available as a free download from The Centrifuge at thecentrifuge.co.uk, or, you can just click the links from the playlist below.

Next month on solipsistic NATION we'll showcase Herb Recordings. I have no idea what I'll be doing for next week's show but later this month I'll be interviewing Skinny Puppy's Ogre and KMFDM's Tim Skold. You can always follow me on Twitter at solipsistic to find out what else I've got planned for future shows.

See you next week!

      <itunes:summary>'m going to talk gear for a bit so please indulge me.

I relaunched solipsistic NATION in 2006 because I had just purchased a Mac Mini and it came with GarageBand pre-installed. GarageBand changed everything because suddenly I could create shows easily and quickly. It's safe to say that if I hadn't picked up my Mac Mini that solipsistic NATION would never have happened.

I loved my Mac Mini. It was a speedy little machine that got stuff done quietly. I often petted it and called it a good boy. I kid you not.

I didn't just use GarageBand to produce solipsistic NATION. I used software like Sound Studio to record IDs and voice overs and edit interviews for years. But over time I added more tools to my toolkit like Levelator, iTunes-LAME and SoundSoap. And after a hundred shows I had accumulated a lot of audio files. I hadn't noticed it but my Mac Mini was slowly growing old and decrepit.

In the last year I came to dread working on my machine because it was painfully slow. Just switching between applications could take anywhere form 30 to 60 seconds. Saving files took forever. It was psychically painful to even think about working on the show on my Mac Mini. The machine I was once called a "good boy" I now cursed.

Last month I had to put the old boy to pasture and I picked up a new Mac Mini from Apple. I don't think I can adequately convey how much of a joy it is to work on it. Actually, I can. It's exactly like when I first got my original Mac Mini. But on steroids. Now I'm eager to edit episodes of solipsistic NATION. It's like falling in love all over again.

Take today's show, for example. Our guest is Igorrr and we're going to listen to a recording of his concert in Stockholm from earlier last month.

A lot of music gets sent my way but there are certain labels that I will always make a point of listening to first. Once such label is Ad Noiseam.

Ad Noiseam consistently releases such mind blowing music on regular basis that not only have I showcased the label on solipsistic NATION but I go out of my way to listen to whatever music they are kind enough to send my way.

Last year Ad Noiseam sent me an album called Nostril by Igorrr. I didn't know what to expect but if it was released by Ad Noisem that was good enough for me. That said, I was completely surprised and utterly delighted by Igorrr's baroque infused breakcore.

I asked Igorrr if he had recorded any concerts that I might feature on solipsistic NATION and he was kind enough to send me his Stockholm show.

I'm really excited to present Igorrr's concert on today's show and I was equally excited to produce the show. My new Mac Mini works like a champ and I was able to effortlessly switch back and forth between apps and edit and save large audio files in record time. So much fun!

Thanks for letting me geek out about today's show and my new Mac Mini. I just had to get that out of my system.

Join us next week when we'll showcase music from The Centrifuge. See you then!

<br />This month's showcase features a label that actually appeared on the <a title="solipsistic NATION No. 83: Dubsonic web page" href="http://solipsisticnation.com/?p=137">Dubsonic</a> edition of <b>solipsistic NATION</b> and that label is <a title="Iberian Records MySpace page" href="http://www.myspace.com/iberianrecords" target="_blank">Iberian Records</a>. That show also included music from <a title="Boka Records website" href="http://www.bokarecords.co.uk/" target="_blank">Boka Records</a>, <a title="Hot Flush Recordings website" href="http://www.hotflushrecordings.com/" target="_blank">Hot Flush Recordings</a>, <a title="Immerse Records page" href="http://www.immerserecords.com" target="_blank">Immerse Records</a> and a lot of other labels putting out fantastic dubstep EPs and LPs.</p>

<p>That show was just a snapshot of each label and I've been meaning to focus more in-depth on each label as we go along. On today's show we're going to hear 21 select tracks from Iberian Records.</p>

<p>I've come to love Iberian Records in the last few years because while their release may be few, each one is special and I've really enjoyed the horizons of bass and groove driven music they've been exploring.</p>

<p>Howie is one of the founders of Iberian Records and he returns to <b>solipsistic NATION</b> to talk about his label.</p>

<p>Join us again next week. Our guest will be my buddy, Headphone Jack!</p>
