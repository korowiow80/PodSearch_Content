     <title>Episode 51--The Chick Whisperer--Supercharge Your Social Life</title> 
      
<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Greg Greenway (http://www.thechickwhisperer.com/greg) Remember back in school when everyone wanted to be one of the 'cool kids'?  Well, nothing has really changed, huh?  Sure, it's great to be invited to happy hour after work with all the movers and shakers in your office, but what if you could really take your social life to a level that most guys can only dream of?  Imagine hanging out on a regular basis with rock stars, multi-millionaires and even political leaders.  Check this, not only has my co-host Greg Greenway of Social Circle Training pulled that off, he's about to show you how to adjust YOUR reality accordingly as well.  Listen closely as he throws down some GOLDEN advice on how to win friends and influence people that would make Dale Carnegie himself jealous.  Just for good measure, we also answer a voicemail from Jake who's dealing with the revelation that his current girlfriend is a bit more (ahem...) 'experienced' than he had previously thought.  Visit www.onlinedatingdomination.com and grab your copy of my free report '6 Secrets To Meeting An Amazing Woman Online'.  While you're there, prepare to be blown away by Online Dating Domination 2.0</itunes:subtitle>

     <title>Episode 50--The Chick Whisperer--Wall-To-Wall Women...All Day Long</title> 
      
<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Lance Mason (http://www.thechickwhisperer.com/lance) I hope this doesn't shock you, but guess what?  There really ISN'T a designated place and/or time to meet women.  The raw truth is that women are all around you...all the time...all day long.  The only real question is what are YOU going to do about it?  Are you equipped to interact freely with ANY and EVERY woman you see as you go about your daily life?  Join my co-host Lance Mason from Pickup 101 and me as we go WAY, WAY beyond what's commonly known as 'daygame' and get down to what a full-on LIFESTYLE of meeting and relating to women can really, truly look like.  Amazingly, you (yes, YOU) could get to know more women TODAY if you only made the best of your regular trips to, say, the gym and the supermarket.  Lance and I have got your back, with the often-requested practical tips you can use in BOTH places--even if we pretty much openly DISAGREE on some of them.  Hey...we report, you decide.  Plus, we answer a truly challenging question from Corey in Pittsburgh on what happens when gay friends start setting you up with their female friends.  That, of course, throws the whole issue of 'gay game' on the table...  Have you discovered The Difference yet?  Get a free special report called 'Six Physical Moves That Make Women Hot For You' when you do.  http://www.thedifferenceinfo.com</itunes:subtitle>

     <title>Episode 47--The Chick Whisperer--Cars And Women, Not Necessarily In That Order</title> 
       
<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Matt Farah (http://www.thechickwhisperer.com/tst) Fellow gearheads and connoisseurs of fine women rejoice... Joining me for this show is Matt Farah from TV's The Car Show on Speed Channel and head car nut over at thesmokingtire.com.  We hit the ground running (or make that rolling) with a great voicemail question on which car to drive if you want to attract women, but you DON'T want to look like a pretentious prettyboy.  Then we dive right into the subject du jour, talking back and forth about every single thing you can think of, as long as women and cars are involved.  Which cars are 'girl cars' and should therefore be avoided?  What should you do if you can't exactly afford a killer ride at the moment?  And what if you're stuck with a station wagon or (God forbid) a mini-van?  We cover all of that and more, including some surprising info on women and motorcycles and--best of all--how to make sure the DRIVER (that's you) is doing his part to generate massive attraction in women.  If you haven't yet checked out the latest X &amp; Y Communications program The Difference, be sure to do so.  Guys all over the world are already seeing stunning results:  http://www.thedifferenceinfo.com/subscribers</itunes:subtitle>

<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Jordan Harbinger (http://www.thechickwhisperer.com/jordan) Man, have you ever really WANTED to strike up a conversation with particularly sexy woman...but just drew a TOTAL BLANK?  Or worse, have you ever actually STARTED talking to her only to somehow WRECK your chances--without even knowing what you said or did that messed everything up?  Well, it's time to put all of those bad memories behind you forever.  Joining me as co-host for this illustrious episode is fellow podcaster and dating coach Jordan Harbinger from Pickup Podcast--and we've got solutions for you that will leave you speechless.

While we're at it we answer a voice mail from Nate in California who's just coming off of a LTR and is wondering how to tell when it's the right time for him to jump back into meeting and dating new women.  Have you heard about the latest X &amp; Y Communications program called The Difference?  In it I finally fork over all of my very best secrets on how to be better with women at every level.  Now that I'm 'retired' from dating and seduction and living the dream with Emily, I have no reason to hold back.  From now on every single advantage with women that I've ever made my own can be yours also.  Grab a cold one and check it all out at http://www.thedifferenceinfo.com/subscribers</itunes:subtitle>

     <title>Episode 45--The Chick Whisperer--How To Be A Badass</title> 
       
<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Josh Pellicer (http://www.thechickwhisperer.com/josh) Most guys tend to suspect that men with POWER are the ones who get all the women.  That can be social power, physical power, financial power and even intellectual power.  But what if you're not exactly the center of your social circle, don't have the physique of a WWE wrestler, aren't exactly a Yale graduate and can't write a check for a million bucks?  Can you still attract the women you REALLY want?  The answer is a resounding YES...but you'll have to know how to harness your inner badass and introduce him to the world.  Josh and I are going to show you how to do exactly that...all in the name of making the chicks go wild and scream your name (or at least one special one).  Listen in as we also answer a terrific voicemail from Brian in Kentucky on whether he should try to get his ex back or go ahead and let his ex set him up with her hot friends instead, like she wants to.  Wait until you hear our surprising answers to that one.  If you haven't checked out the new Facebook page yet, head to www.facebook.com/scotandemily for a free special report on how to reconnect with women you knew months or even years ago on Facebook.</itunes:subtitle>

     <title>Episode 44--The Chick Whisperer--I Can't Get No Satisfaction</title> 
       
<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Michael Fiore (http://www.thechickwhisperer.com/oral) Why is it that so many of us as guys all over the world aren't having as much sex as we'd like to?  I mean, even guys who have a woman in their lives tend to complain that they're not getting enough--and when it does happen it's a bit weird or even flat-out boring because she's not really into it at all.  So the big question is this:  If women love sex so much, as we're always told is the case, what's wrong with this picture?  What's most frustrating of all is that this whole issue is particularly common when it comes to women giving us oral pleasures.  Well, join world-class sexual satisfaction expert Michael Fiore and I as we talk about finding an 'oral fixation' for the problem at hand.  We'll also cover other great ways to make women WANT the same level and frequency of sexual passion that you do...and how to make it happen.  Wait until you see what's possible through text messaging alone.  In addition, find out about Michael's recent appearance on the Rachael Ray show, and whether she actually looks good in person or not.  As always, we answer one of your voicemails--this time from Brian in Charlotte--on how to handle a situation where you want to get a woman's number but have virtually NO TIME to get the job done.  Be sure to get on our newsletter list if you're not already at www.deservewhatyouwant.com, and get a free special report on how to get first dates AND second dates.</itunes:subtitle>

     <title>Episode 43--The Chick Whisperer--From Same Night Lays To Long Term Relationships</title> 
       
<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Nick Quick (http://www.thechickwhisperer.com/quick) So what is a guy like the undisputed king of 'same night lays', Nick Quick, doing on a show like this?  The answer is pretty simple, really.  You see, Nick was just recently in an exclusive, monogamous relationship with a woman who really knocked his socks off.  So wait a minute, here...why would a guy who can sleep with a different woman every night get a steady girlfriend?  What led to that choice?  And arguably the best question of all, was he able to make leave his previous lifestyle behind?  We wanted to know!  And sure enough, Nick covers all those questions and more...all in a twisting, turning discussion that eventually evolves into a full-bore expose on why, with whom and under what circumstances women choose to have sex.  Fascinating stuff awaits, believe me.  We also answer a voice mail from Ron in Louisiana on how to handle being with a woman who just might be 'on the rebound'.  Wait until you hear the somewhat surprising words we have for Ron.  Right now we need to hear what's on YOUR mind as far as the future projects you'd like us to work on.  Speak your mind at www.thechickwhisperer.com/survey ...and thanks a million in advance for your all-important input.</itunes:subtitle>

     <title>Episode 42--The Chick Whisperer--How To Make Her Laugh...And What To Do When She Cries</title> 
       
<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Elaine Davis (http://www.thechickwhisperer.com/elaine) We already know that women all over the world love a guy with a sense of humor, right?  But is 'having a sense of humor' necessarily the same thing as knowing how to make her laugh?  Stand-up comedienne and dating coach Elaine Davis sits in to discuss the finer points of this all-important topic, and I'll give you a hint:  Sorting through all of this might not be as complex as you thought.  Find out why being 'funny' isn't always your instant ticket to success with women, as so many dateless professional comedians can attest to.  Instead, you're about to discover all the true (but not always obvious) secrets to bringing a smile to a woman's face in the most attractive way possible.  In particular, listen closely toward the end for a powerful 'silver bullet' that all but eliminates the dreaded 'try too hard' factor.  By the way, while we're at it Elaine and I answer a voicemail from a listener who has a question that reflects the flip-side of today's topic...what to do when the woman in your life plays the 'crying card' during a disagreement.  Are you a fan of the TCW podcast? If so, be sure to leave us a review on iTunes and I'll send you all nine retired episodes for free...hear all the details right at the beginning of this show.</itunes:subtitle>

     <title>Episode 39--The Chick Whisperer--Are Women Really Touchy About Being Touched?</title> 
       
<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Bill Preston (http://www.thechickwhisperer.com/preston) OK, so you've got her in front of you and she seems to be attracted to you.  And man, you can't wait to get your hands on her.  But should you wait anyway?  Or should you 'escalate kino'?  It's seems like a tricky call to make, no doubt.  On one hand, if you go in too early you're likely to get slapped or something.  But on the other hand, if you wait too long she's going to think you lack the guts to make a move like a real man should.  Well, once and for all my man Bill Preston and I do what we can to take the 'trickiness' out of figuring out when--and exactly how--to touch a woman.  The truth of the matter is that women really do LOVE to have male hands all over them, and if you can read the signals all the confusion just melts away...kind of like her heart.  Good stuff.  Head on over to www.themansapproach.com and get your FREE REPORT called '5 Things Women Wish You Knew When Approaching Them'.  It's all yours, with my compliments.</itunes:subtitle>

     <title>Episode 38--The Chick Whisperer--Quit Making Everything So Complicated</title> 
       
<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Brad Howard (http://www.thechickwhisperer.com/adonis) Based on the type of e-mails we get, I can tell you that most guys are straight-up making the process of approaching and meeting women WAY more complicated than it has to be.  Most of us over-analyze even the idea of approaching a woman to a fault, and assuming we ever dig ourselves out from under that we then rely on a massive system of rules, sequences and 'if/then' strategies that end up just derailing us instead of helping us reach our goals.  Well, here's the simple truth:  Approaching and meeting women doesn't have to be NEARLY as complicated as you think.  Brad and I show you the disarmingly simple reasons why--all the while discussing the finer points of why meeting women is like sales, among other things.  Plus, we take a voice mail from Craig in Colorado on how to build a social circle from scratch and hit it with a big, heavy hammer.  Be sure to get in on the X &amp; Y Communications newsletter by visiting http://www.deservewhatyouwant.com/ and score your copy of my latest special report called, 'Get The First Date...And The Second Date'.</itunes:subtitle>

     <title>Episode 33--The Chick Whisperer--Are Women Really So Hard To Figure Out?</title> 
       
<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Marni Kinrys (http://www.thechickwhisperer.com/wing)  On the auspicious occasion of the long-awaited launch of Chick Whispering, the book (and now complete program) inspired by this podcast, I invited none other than Wing Girl extraordinaire Marni Kinrys to join me for what may be the definitive Chick Whispering discussion, superseding all others.  Listen in as Marni talks about some absolutely primo ways to figure out what's on a woman's mind--quickly and easily.  We also delve into some of the deeper issues as to why so many people prefer to flat-out give up on MOTOS (Members Of The Opposite Sex) rather giving a fair shot to figuring them out.  Also, we tackle a terrific voice mail from Donovan in New York city on dating older women.  For more on the new Chick Whispering e-book, stop by http://www.chickwhispering.com for an intro I've produced that explains it all.</itunes:subtitle>

     <title>Episode 26--The Chick Whisperer--The Dude Whisperer</title> 
       
<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Mirabelle Summers (http://www.thechickwhisperer.com/fireworks)  OK, when I read the new book Fireworks With Females I thought it was pretty good. Then I figured out that a woman, namely Mirabelle Summers, wrote most of it.  She's basically "The Dude Whisperer", based on what I've read.  Naturally, that's when I got on the phone and invited Mirabelle to co-host a TCW episode with me. And it was as epic a conversation as I had expected, most definitely. Get ready to find out--for real--what women want, what women THINK men want, what they REALLY think about men approaching them, and even the truth about whether or not they're really "trying to keep men from being successful with them".  It's all in this episode, and much more...including an e-mail from Thomas in Houston who has given all his power away to his woman.  Find out what Mirabelle tells him...  Are you on our newsletter yet?  If not, I've got a FREE e-book on how to meet women on Twitter.com just for signing up.  http://www.twiduction.com</itunes:subtitle>

     <title>Episode 17--The Chick Whisperer--Do Great Women Even Really Exist?</title> 
      
<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Rion Williams (http://www.thechickwhisperer.com/rion). Simply put, there's no other man who spends quite as much time studying the social dynamics between men and women as Rion Williams.  So when he stops by to co-host the show, you can be assured that the discussion will invariably turn towards the highest echelon of great women and how to attract them.  If various forums around the Seduction Community are any indication, there's widespread belief that even the very existence of truly great women is a myth--especially in North America.  Listen in as Scot and Rion explore that concept, offering some very real explanations of why guys might feel that way.  More importantly, find out how to escape that pessimistic frame and start discovering unbelievably high-quality women in YOUR home town.</itunes:subtitle>

OK, so the terms 'playboy', 'pickup artist', 'player' and 'ladies' man' are all heard a lot, and guys are bombarded with advice on how to be one (or all four).  But, seriously, what do these terms mean? And more importantly, how do you know if the shoe fits or not?  Find out as Scot breaks it down with a guy who should know.

     <title>Episode 11--The Chick Whisperer--Daytime Pickup</title> 
      
<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Brad Finsilver (http://www.datementor.com).  Most of the attention given to pickup tends to center around bars and clubs.  But a true measure of a man who is in control of his own dating world is how effectively--and authentically--he can approach women and create attraction anywhere he goes.  We challenge you to leave the peacock home for now and consider the possibilities for igniting femininity in broad daylight...right there in public.

<itunes:summary>Co-Host Brad Finsilver (http://www.datementor.com).  Most of the attention given to pickup tends to center around bars and clubs.  But a true measure of a man who is in control of his own dating world is how effectively--and authentically--he can approach women and create attraction anywhere he goes.  We challenge you to leave the peacock home for now and consider the possibilities for igniting femininity in broad daylight...right there in public.

     <title>Episode 10--The Chick Whisperer--Talking To Women You Just Met</title> 
      
<itunes:subtitle>Co-Host Sebastian Drake (http://www.thechickwhisperer.com/vibe).  You've heard terms like 'approach', 'banter' and 'rapport' riffed on elsewhere.  How about a completely different outlook on talking to women you've just met?  Get your head around what a woman truly wants when it comes to first-impressions and WIN.  Fair warning, guys:  What is unleashed in this episode is revolutionary yet makes perfect sense.  It could be the most important message you've heard in a long time, allowing you to separate yourself from the herd...but isn't that what you've come to expect from TCW?<a href="http://www.podcastalley.com/"> My Podcast Alley feed!</a> {pca-c69da4177b4e354f29ef8140a3ec458c}</itunes:subtitle>
