<description>In this episode of Aurelicast, the guys introduce their bandmate and good friend, Ezra Bettencourt. He is posed with the ultimate question, but not before your hosts cover their weekly reviews of the new Cattle Decapitation album Monolith of Inhumanity, as well as the classic release of Death's 1993 album Individual Thought Patterns. As for Ezra's question...Let's just say that there's a whole lot of crybaby involved.
The news this week is on opposite poles with your hosts in Son of Aurelius. On one hand, you have the incredibly unfortunate incident of theft that befell the incredibly talented Ulcerate recently in New York. On the other hand, you have the recent record deal, supposedly worth $750,000, that was signed by the costume rockers in Ghost. But are both of these situations in a position of reversal? Find out when you tune in to this week's episode of Aurelicast, and don't forget to keep those e-mails coming at us! Thank you for all your support, keep it metal!Audio/Post Production by Max Zigman/Parade Outrageous Studios&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<description>Welcome back to another airing of Aurelicast! In tonight's dialogue, the guys are joined by their long-time friend and musical colleague, Joel Horner. Some of you may know him better as the long-time bassist of death metal legends, Decrepit Birth. Others may know him as the current bassist of the recently reformed and mind-blowing Odious Mortem. We're not here to split hairs....However, what we are here to do is tell you about these various metal masters podding their faces off about prog rock legends firing AK-47's, as well as what they would look like after being fused to their drum sets. Well... that and having tables flipped onto them at legendary concerts.... Speaking of concerts, have you ever wanted to see bands like Rush, Behemoth, or Hate Eternal? Well, a certain Mr. Guest Appearance has seen em all, if not played the same stages, and has been so kind as to divulge his experience to you, our loyal pod-ees.In addition, the Son of Aurelians review the new prog-rock collaboration, Storm Corrosion, as well as reminisce on one of the greatest death metal albums of all time: Suffocation's Pierced From Within. Don't miss this, and so much more in the newest episode of Aurelicast. Audio/Post Production by Max Zigman/Parade Outrageous Studios&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

<description>Welcome back to the Son of Aurelius podcast, Aurelicast!!! This time around, the guys get together and crack the ice by breaking down the doors to Irish pubs, knocking down some fish and chips, and dubbing each other with titles that are too amazing for words. After all the jerkin around, business gets down with discussions on the newest Gorod release, A Perfect Absolution, as well as this week's classic, Psycroptic's Scepter of the Ancients. Vocalist Riley McShane is posed with one of the great questions of our age, and dives deep to answer: "What is the best usage of clean vocals in metal/death metal?" While the answer may be surprising to some, it is definitely an opinion you don't want to miss.
Bringing it back to our world in news, our favorite Aurelians go over Slayer's Jeff Hanneman and his debilitating.... spider bite? Hopefully that shit will heal up quick, otherwise he'll miss out one of the many...... metal cruise ships?? What the fuck is going........ Anyway! The Slaughter Survivors tour is going to hit the road soon, bringing all of our friends in Pathology, Fallujah, Enfold Darkness, and other greats to the same stage, but with the recent loss of drummer, Jack Blackburn, how will Enfold Darkness make it happen? Find out all of this and much, much more on Episode 2 of Aurelicast, Mad Dogging the Pacific Coast. P.S. Men turning into women.

<description>Welcome to this week's episode of the Son of Aurelius podcast, Aurelicast! The guys dive headfirst into a run-down of tech-death champs Spawn of Possession's brutal new release, Incurso. This latest endeavor from the legends themselves is an undeniable masterpiece, but can there be too much of a good thing? From new age to old school, our hosts reflect ten years back to celebrate the release of Lucid Interval. As many of you know, and for those of you that don't, this album is considered to be what defined the sound for the deathgrind masters, Cephalic Carnage. From free beer to 808's, these will be a pair of reviews you won't want to miss. Bass of Aurelius, Max Zigman is confronted with a question: What is the album that brought you to the crossroad where you transitioned into death metal? The answer? Only one of the greatest death metal albums ever released, of course. Still need a hint? Well, they've been heavily involved in the band's next topic: The Summer Slaughter Tour. This year's lineup has been quite the toss up, but the end result is one that is guaranteed to melt faces. Cannibal Corpse, Between the Buried and Me, and.... Fleshgod Apocalypse? Rumors speculate their absence, but the real question is, "Why?" In recent news, and in a most unfortunate turn, RoadRunner Records has recently shut down their offices in the UK and Canada; a devastating blow to dozens of men and women, now out of their jobs. Trivium's Matt Heafy had a mouthful to say about the decision to "cut costs," but the relativity to metal that his comments make ring too true to ignore. Our friends in SoA discuss the scene, and much, much more. Make sure to tune in to the premiere episode of Aurelicast, and get to know the most down to earth melodic tech-death shredders, Son of Aurelius.

This latest endeavor from the legends themselves is an undeniable masterpiece, but can there be too much of a good thing? From new age to old school, our hosts reflect ten years back to celebrate the release of Lucid Interval. As many of you know, and for those of you that don't, this album is considered to be what defined the sound for the deathgrind masters, Cephalic Carnage. From free beer to 808's, these will be a pair of reviews you won't want to miss. Bass of Aurelius, Max Zigman is confronted with a question: What is the album that brought you to the crossroad where you transitioned into death metal? The answer? Only one of the greatest death metal albums ever released, of course. Still need a hint? Well, they've been heavily involved in the band's next topic: The Summer Slaughter Tour. This year's lineup has been quite the toss up, but the end result is one that is guaranteed to melt faces. Cannibal Corpse, Between the Buried and Me, and.... Fleshgod Apocalypse? Rumors speculate their absence, but the real question is, "Why?" In recent news, and in a most unfortunate turn, RoadRunner Records has recently shut down their offices in the UK and Canada; a devastating blow to dozens of men and women, now out of their jobs. Trivium's Matt Heafy had a mouthful to say about the decision to "cut costs," but the relativity to metal that his comments make ring too true to ignore. Our friends in SoA discuss the scene, and much, much more. Make sure to tune in to the premiere episode of Aurelicast, and get to know the most down to earth melodic tech-death shredders, Son of Aurelius.
