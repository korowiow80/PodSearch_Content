		<description><![CDATA[<p>Utica Tomagotchi is now speaking. He&#8217;s speaking to an audience of one: You. Utica has a message for you. It concerns the assassination of your household appliances. He&#8217;s giving you an excuse to use your training. He reminds you to keep emotion out of It. This is a practical matter. If you want to move forward in life, you&#8217;ll have to do it without a toaster oven. You don&#8217;t need the portable foot bath pan where you&#8217;re going. (He says you&#8217;re going to Switzerland, but that&#8217;s irrelevant for our purposes.)
</p><p>Utica explains that without anyone else in the house, no one need find out. You&#8217;ll live as a Shaker from now on, but that&#8217;s OK. It&#8217;s what you want, right? The indulgence of convenience keeps you soft. One bullet through the automatic butter warmer will make you strong.  </p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a somber June 2, here in Southeast Michigan. The cloudy skies and low temperatures have returned. People are staying in and holding onto their children a little tighter when they do go out.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Tonight, amidst the low rumble of horizon traffic and the errant bottle rocket pop, a steady, sharp crack is heard. It&#8217;s off in the distance, sorta up and to the left. But it also sounds very present. It sounds like it&#8217;s right here.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Or it&#8217;s almost here. I did some research, made a few calls. It&#8217;s confirmed. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the sound of the damned tunneling their way out of hell. </p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s taken them eons. But as time went on, their ranks swelled. Each black soul doing its part. Pushing and scraping and clawing against the rock. 1800km to the surface.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>They&#8217;re going to break through any moment now. Most people are in denial about it. Who can blame them? What can we do about it?</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The ghostbusters are scattered to the winds. Superman is dead. We can&#8217;t stop them. Most people wouldn&#8217;t want to.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say, at most, we&#8217;ve got 72 hours. I&#8217;m going to cover myself in colorful balloons. But I haven&#8217;t coordinated anything.</p>
<p>God&#8217;s unwanted children are returning to the earth and we&#8217;re worried about smoking cigarettes near pets. </p>

Did you, in a moment of panic, accidentally glue your entire miniature plastic farm setup to the underside of your desk? Are you sure miniature plastic farming is for you? Wouldn&#8217;t you rather be counting the finger holes in bowling balls? Or repeatedly counting all 50 states on wall maps to ensure they didn&#8217;t forget any? Or counting on your state-approved &#8220;Big Brother&#8221; to come get you out of this mess before you&#8217;re forced to amputate a leg? </p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The key to understanding the lunacy of the American workplace is that randomly throughout the day, large quantities of live snakes are dumped into the offices, cubicles and work areas. Workers and customers alike are left to deal with the chaos using push brooms and coffee creamer. The delivery system was created by some of the super villains that started PayPal. Closed circuit television systems allow bosses to evaluate worker ability and composure.
</p><p>&#160;</p>
<p>Most of these reports go unread at this point, though, as the majority of the Managerial class in America long since turned to stone. More than likely a gypsy&#8217;s curse. Midnight janitorial crews have since faced the frozen execs towards blank walls.</p>

<p>In other words: No one&#8217;s watching.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Your primary concern with an over-sized* American flag is storage. It&#8217;s one thing to cover the front of your building, mother-in-law apartment, or used sofa pile with a 70&#8242; x 90&#8242; American flag; it&#8217;s an altogether different thing to store it, safely and legally.</p>
<p>After observing proper folding techniques, it would still result in a coffin-sized section of cloth and would as such, overpower the conventional, &#8220;one garbage bag and then into the attic&#8221; approach. The obvious next step of two garbage bags, one coming from each side with a slight overlap, still fails with a flag of this size. A crucial midsection would remain exposed to storage mites and closet fleas.</p>
<p>Patriotic ingenuity points us to a three bag solution. Before fitting on either end bag, a simple scissors cut turns garbage bag three into an open-ended garbage sleeve, able to slide freely over all sensitive sections of the flag. Loading this first, then tucking either edge under the end bags ensures total coverage, total peace of mind.</p>
<p>At this point one may safely store an enormous American flag alongside spare mattresses, under model train sets, and beside inherited wig collections, confident that no portion is exposed to the tentacles of those translucent creatures that are found only in crawl spaces.</p>
<p>*Some prefer the descriptor, &#8220;American-Sized&#8221;, improving it to, &#8220;American-Sized American Flag.&#8221; </p>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>With Memorial Day upon us we spent the last few nights locking down and securing all of the valuables and electronics. Anything that contains metal, really. It can all go at any time, at any hour during the three day weekend.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s not taped down, it&#8217;ll get sucked up by the magnet trucks the veterans drive up and down the residential streets. Local ordinance says they get to keep whatever sticks. As a thank you for their loyalty and obedience, we extend them this courtesy.</p>
<p>They drive slowly up and down both sides of the street, with ultra-high-powered magnets mounted in the truck beds. It&#8217;s not uncommon to see VCRs, dehumidifies, ceremonial swords, even orthodonitic appliances fly right out the window and into the nets of these vehicles.</p>
<p>And if we hear their sirens, according to the ordinance, we citizens are to stand facing the road in the front yard and fully absorb these magnet rays with our bodies as a sign of respect for Their Sacrifice.</p>
<p>Although no one has reported it first hand, rumors persist that the veterans return the metal to their VFW bars where it is consumed by crazed former air force members. </p>]]></description>
