But it's also about the thinking we already have. Since few of us ever investigate what we think, we're mostly just thinking what we've learned to think. Which means we're really thinking with somebody else's head. Based on the landmark work of psychoanalyst and social scientist Norberto Keppe.</description><language>en</language><managingEditor>noreply@blogger.com (Richard Lloyd Jones)</managingEditor><lastBuildDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2012 03:10:41 PDT</lastBuildDate><generator>Blogger http://www.blogger.com</generator><openSearch:totalResults xmlns:openSearch="http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/">176</openSearch:totalResults><openSearch:startIndex xmlns:openSearch="http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/">1</openSearch:startIndex><openSearch:itemsPerPage xmlns:openSearch="http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/">100</openSearch:itemsPerPage><feedburner:info uri="richjonesvoice" /><atom10:link xmlns:atom10="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" rel="hub" href="http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/" /><media:thumbnail url="http://www.richjonesvoice.com/podcastlogo.jpg" /><media:keywords>Philosophy,consciousness,metaphysics,physics,Analytical,Trilogy,Dr,Keppe,Keppe,quantum,physics,spirituality,education,economics,sociopathology</media:keywords><media:category scheme="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">Society &amp; Culture/Philosophy</media:category><media:category scheme="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">Education</media:category><media:category scheme="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">Religion &amp; Spirituality/Spirituality</media:category><media:category scheme="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">Science &amp; Medicine/Social Sciences</media:category><media:category scheme="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">Health/Alternative Health</media:category><itunes:owner><itunes:email>rich@richjonesvoice.com</itunes:email><itunes:name>Richard Lloyd Jones</itunes:name></itunes:owner><itunes:author>Richard Lloyd Jones</itunes:author><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="http://www.richjonesvoice.com/podcastlogo.jpg" /><itunes:keywords>Philosophy,consciousness,metaphysics,physics,Analytical,Trilogy,Dr,Keppe,Keppe,quantum,physics,spirituality,education,economics,sociopathology</itunes:keywords><itunes:subtitle>Science, philosophy, psychology, quantum physics, religion.

Which means we're actually thinking with somebody else's head - not necessarily our own. And how much of those philosophies, ideas and theories are true? Thanks to the work of Brazilian/Austrian psychoanalyst and social scientist, Dr. Norberto Keppe, separating the wheat from the chaff is a lot easier today.

It explores the psychological condition that lies behind the lust for power, and shows clearly that this drive is most times fueled by a pathological desire for self-service and narcissism, not for the common good. "It is extremely important to perceive that the established powers have been organized so as to control the will of the people, paralyzing their capacity to act," Norberto Keppe writes in this profound book. In other books, Keppe writes forcefully about secret groupings of powerful people acting in the shadows as constituting the basis of all social sickness. Here, he's talking about the Bilderbergers and the Trilateral and the secret societies at Yale and all that mess. And just saying that pushes us into the territory of conspiracy theories for some. I mean, what's next? Questioning the moon landing? But Keppe's voice is not strident or self-righteous. Instead, it's a fresh breeze of sanity into this minefield of subterfuge.

We understandably get apoplectic about the cases of corruption evident in corporations like BP or rogue traders like Nick Leeson. I even remember some self-righteous media pundits lamenting the blow to baseball represented by Pete Rose betting on the game. We all get irate when facing these levels of unethical behavior, or even when a loved one betrays a trust. But this is when it would be timely to remember Shakespeare's counsel in moments of self-righteous indignation: Methinks you doth protest too much. It's well known in psychology that we can often tee off on behavior outside that we also partake in, and that can be a tough pill to swallow. It takes all the honesty and virtue we can muster to see that external conduct as a mirror reflecting back our own sins. But it is exactly this that's required of us today. Because one thing we must admit - if the world has gone astray, chances are pretty good we've contributed to that. A Cure for Corruption, this time on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head.

The TV mini-series "The Tudors" lays out in all its deceit and subterfuge the nest of vipers that was the British Royal Court of the 15th and 16th centuries. Ancient Rome was no picnic either from all accounts. And Chinese warlords scheming to be Taipan operated within complex webs of treachery. Not much has changed. We're inverted, so we still practice to deceive and think, in our boundless delusion, that it will all come out ok in the end. It's been that way for centuries. So prevalent is it that we could be excused for thinking that political gamesmanship is just human nature - whether it's office competitors vying for the bosses favor, or contestants on a reality TV show pacting to get another sent home, or unelected bank leaders meeting in secret to decide world monetary policy. Treachery and cunning, though, in all their proliferation, are far from what it means to be truly human, and this disinverted view deserves more headlines than it's gotten.

And not a superficial treatment either. But a deep investigation into what it means to be a true leader here in the 21st Century. Gone are the old values we once held so high, like charisma and conviction and coercion. It's a new time, and it requires true leadership, not the pseudo leadership we see all around us today. Only question is ... what is true leadership anyway? The science of Analytical Trilogy is uniquely placed to answer that question.

Maybe that's why most of us don't like looking too closely. It becomes overwhelming. "Can't you talk about something else," is how my mother often phrases this sense of overwhelm. The implication being that not talking about it makes it disappear. An absurd rationale, of course, but one that's rather common in our addicted-to-positivity society. In the science of psycho-socio-pathology elaborated at the International Society of Analytical Trilogy where our program originates, this is called an Inversion. Seeing problems is a negative. You have to make lemonade with that mountain of lemons, after all. Problem? what problem? What we've got here is a heaven-sent opportunity, not a problem at all. That's the common parlance. But to really solve the problem, we have to forget about the inverted dictums of the motivational literature. There it is written that we need to forget the past and look to the future - exactly the polar opposite of what we should be doing. Real leaders, in truth, need to look very hard at the reasons we're in the mess we're in. Freedom and Leadership, today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head.

I was on the train from Rhinebeck, NY to Toronto - a beautiful but tedious journey with only vestiges of the former romance of train travel to keep me company. I was settled in with snacks and bottled water and ample reading material to fill the long 10 hours or so ahead of me. My book of choice at that time was Norberto Keppe's Liberation of the People: The Pathology of Power, and I felt myself changing as I read. Or maybe it wasn't a change as much as a recognition. T.S. Eliot spoke about how at the end of all our exploring we would arrive at where we started and know the place for the first time - and that perhaps comes closer to how I felt. It was like a recognition in Keppe's writing of something I also knew to be true but had forgotten. Keppe's great book does that - reawakens our idealism and gives us a glimpse of the new society that's possible. And all this can happen because Keppe helps disinvert us and get us back on track.

And we look at how it impacts all aspects of human life on our planet. There's only one problem: this psychological wisdom is not being studied sufficiently. This is something we're trying to correct on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head. Inversion is the name of this psychological condition, and it's the root cause of our problems. This means it's essential to be studied and understood more completely. Here's a start.&amp;nbsp; Listen to our highlight program here.

And I only say "potentially" because it remains to be seen if humankind will do what it takes to reverse the downward cycle we have been in for millennia. I know this sounds like heresy to those conditioned to hearing about the progress of modern society, but I am, of course, talking about a decay at a level much more profound than technological. Because, really, what benefit is it to us to be able to Twitter what we had for breakfast if the air is poisonous and the social injustice continues unabated? All our vaunted progress is moving us further and further away&amp;nbsp;from a better society, not closer, and this is happening because of an inverted worldview inside the mass of humanity. This Inversion is, of course, not perceived by us. And educating human beings of this provides the reason for our show, and underscores the importance of Norberto Keppe's science of Analytical Trilogy, which provides the base for what we do on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head.

Norberto Keppe's science of psycho-socio pathology helps us understand this crucial question, and brings a deep wisdom to the consideration that few people are discussing. We hope to contribute to changing that. Here's an excerpt from our latest Thinking with Somebody Else's Head program, The Wrong Vibration Between Power and People.

The latest initiative - the "I won't pay" movements surging in Greece and a few other countries in Europe, specifically targeting Metro ticket turnstiles. And, of course, the surging up of indignation causes conniption fits in those in power - from extreme, like the violent crackdowns in Syria and even in #Occupy locations in North America, to more hidden, like the reports leaking out from the Bilderbergers and Trilateral Commission that subtly suggest that all this is a thread to global stability.&amp;nbsp; This is, of course, a huge crock of horse hooey, since it's the stability of the elite's iron hold on power that's really being threatened. And from the people's point of view, how could that ever be bad. But we the people play into these Machiavellian tactics when we follow unthinking into that dark night.

From marketed scientific publications like the Aquarian Conspiracy to the blue environmentally pagan humanoids of Avatar to the end of the world apocalypse that Hollywood envisioned as the running out of the Mayan calendar, we've been up to our keisters in pop culture interpretations of the changing consciousness brought by a relentless new age spirituality for almost as long as I've been alive. And way longer than that in the esoteric literature from Europe. Some portray this as an inevitable product of the cosmic cycles of consciousness that are moving us dramatically towards the third millennium. Others say it's all the destiny outlined in Revelations in the Bible. Still others that it's all the product of the endless cycles of birth and death being acted out on a global scale. A lot of room for interpretation and speculation, isn't there? Which is why it's important, here in the middle of the thing, to try to do something and not just speculate.

His theory also single-handedly put the damper on space travel when he linked everything to the speed of light. After all, if we have to propel a spacecraft at that speed, well how will that be possible? And even then, if it'll take a few million light years to get anywhere interesting, you can see how that could dampen enthusiasm for space exploration. Now, Einstein wasn't a bad guy. He was just inverted. However, he did say some good stuff, too, like how we should never lose our holy curiosity when contemplating the marvellous structure of reality. Somehow that touches poetry, doesn't it, and makes a case for how science shoulders up to art when it's at its best. Norberto Keppe maintains that art is actually the basis of civilization, essential as the main pillar of any advanced culture. And art brings with it an implication of beauty and goodness - something we too often neglect in our modern technological paradigm. Let's bring it all together a little.

A small hint: there'll be some internal soul-searching required. But along the way, a very optimistic view of business and working for ourselves. It's powerful stuff when combined with the science of psycho-socio pathology elaborated at Norberto Keppe's International Society of Analytical Trilogy.

Kurt Cobain maybe summed it up best when he said he was always busy acting like he wasn't naive. Like he'd seen it all, like he was there first. I think that speaks for a generation. You can't be gullible anymore, God forbid. You have to know what's cool and what's not and prove that in what you wear and drive and love Of course, there's the really complicated aspects to consider, like your best friend who keeps walking blindly into disastrous relationships with men who throw down her heart and stomp that sucker flat. This is pretty pathological, and I think speaks of a deep self-destructive alienation, not guilelessness at all. We are all of us vulnerable to this kind of personal heave-ho based on the level of denial we are in about reality - reality in this sense meaning how we really are behind our masks, and how we see the true state of our upside-down society. And this we will never see unless we undertake some profound self-analysis. Removing the Rose-Colored Glasses: The Dangers of Social Alienation, today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head.

This latter position firmly in the lead judging by the mad scramble for mall parking and the expanded line-ups at liquor store checkouts. And since there is so much attention given in all the normal channels to this economic and convivial perspective, let me fill a gap by taking a stand for the true spirit of Christmas. For the story, rich in lore and wonder and marvellous mystery, is a beautiful one that, even though largely ignored 11 1/2 months of the year, finally and necessarily demands to be heard and reflected upon.&amp;nbsp;It is a time when we who feel this can venture forth our thoughts and feelings about this most sacred of times, and contemplate the mystical story that lies at the base of our December celebrations.

I remember a few of them homesteading in the woods off the dirt road to my favorite swimming hole on Vancouver Island. I remember the homegrown vegetable gardens and the hastily assembled log cabins and the pungent odor of their strange cigarettes. I wouldn't pay much attention if I was alone beyond noticing you could barely see their eyes under all that head and facial hair. But if my father was with me ... well, then I'd hear a few lectures on the long, windy drive back home. The values of work, the satisfaction of a job well done, the "I had to walk 5 miles to school - both ways" speech that all parents at that time seemed to pull out of their back pockets at times like these. I appreciated my father's point actually ... especially as I got older. But I sympathized with the rebels, too. But now I'm noticing the same "Get a job!" catchphrase going out from Wall St. to all the OWS occupiers. For sure, work is needed for the liberation of the people. But not the work the 1% is thinking we need. Working for Ourselves, today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head.

This is not to denigrate the efforts of responsible and courageous journalists the world over, of course, who are fighting to expose the corruption of the systems where they live, but in most cases, our media only report news that favors those in power. It's high time we held our media to some higher standards than just giving us what they think we want. They have a responsibility, after all, to defend the people's interests, and we are remiss in not demanding that of them. So ... occupy the media is what we say. And what we'll explore on our Thinking with Somebody Else's Head program today. Click here to listen to the full episode.

How all that works is the subject of our show today. Through near death experiences, everyday guilt feelings and spiritual teachings, we can see that our lives have a purpose, and that purpose cannot be fulfilled unless we're prepared to live from a commitment to goodness, truth and beauty. And in our inverted world of flexible morals where good is relative and evil depends on the circumstances that's a challenge. But evil is still evil and good is still good, and it all plays out inside us every time we do something. For that matter, there is much inside us that we don't have contact with as much as we should, and I hope our program today will fix that a little.

Martin Luther King stated that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Isn't it this demand that is echoing through all these diverse societies these days? And the oppressors, to echo King's language, are not giving up easily, as is being witnessed by Occupy activists everywhere. Dr. King, though, I don't think really understood why it has always been that way. What causes the oppressor to cling so tenaciously to power is not well understood or broadcast, and needs to be. Norberto Keppe's science of Analytical Trilogy does that. But the other side of the coin is that to be a fighter against the barbed wired of oppression takes some cojones. And it is this courage that must be summoned from deep inside us if we're to vanquish injustice once and for all. Standing up for Truth, today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head.

Lincold talked about how you could test a man's character by giving him power, and we can all use that to slag the visible power brokers that stalk the halls of power. These are the front men and women, the mouthpieces for the New World Order. But I have been reflecting on how to bring the light to bear on the power behind the throne - for this is certainly the most urgent need. Eisenhower warned us about the acquisition of unwarranted influence by the military-industrial complex back in the '50s, and this was prescient. But many other of the more ethical front men in history have warned us about a scarier and more dangerous power - financial control by the private banks. In fact, Rothschild, perhaps the biggest financial manipulator of them all, once clarified it for us: "Give me control of a nation's money and I care not who makes its laws," he said. Chilling stuff for any who understand Norberto Keppe's analysis of the pathology of power. Liberating ourselves from socio-economic power, today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head.

Something idealists have strived to create for centuries, with little success. Orwell was rather skeptical about the human creature. "No advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimeter nearer," he stated. And there are 2 points to say about that. One is that he is suggesting something about the inner struggle of man. We're born for happiness, but reject it at every turn. This is an issue of human psychology, which we discuss frequently on our show. But there is a perverse power structure in control, too, which dominates us because the sickest people are there. This is a sociopathological view, and an understanding of both these aspects can be had through Norberto Keppe's science of psycho-socio pathology called Analytical Trilogy. This is the essential scientific underpinning that the Occupy movements need to have urgently if they're to be successful in effecting change. And yet, it's a scientific viewpoint that's been denied humanity because the powerful haven't liked what Keppe explores in his books. Especially in his Liberation of the People, the first study of the psycho-social pathology of people with power, psychotics who are impeding human development and destroying society. If we don't stop them immediately, we will witness the rapid demise of civilization. This is what we'll get into today on our program.

There are protests happening in many cities in North America and Europe, and of course, the Arab Spring continues. Even totally censored China has activists plying the social networks to build support for their causes. So, things are changing. And all this is welcome. We human beings that make up the 99%, and even some in the 1%, are waking up to the very disagreeable social situation and saying, "Hey wait a minute. This sucks!" But I'm struck as I follow all this that now more than ever we need an orientation that goes beyond party politics and personal agendas and really gets us to the root causes of this mess. And then lays out a game plan for how to change things. Once and for all. I have been living and broadcasting and teaching from the International Society of Analytical Trilogy for 10 years now, and become conscious every day of how the science Norberto Keppe has elaborated can help us in this struggle for our freedom.

The Arab Spring, Occupy Wall St., the scheduled Oct. 15 global protests. Is it possible we the people are waking from our long hibernation? Are we really saying "enough is enough" collectively? This can give us hope as we analyze facts like 46% or our tax dollars here in Brazil going to pay interest on bank loans when this developing country's infrastructure needs are so great. This can help us to resonate with the fight of the 99% against the 1%, that powerful statistic from Michael Moore's documentary critique of capitalism. But we should be cautiously wary as well because we have ample experience of how the naivete of popular protest can lead to an illusion of change while the power remains untouched. This is perhaps most urgent here: we need a clear vision of what's gone wrong at the roots if we're to fix it. We'd like to offer something in that spirit today. Nothing gives us this vision as well as Norberto Keppe's science of Analytical Trilogy. It's an amazing science for revolutionaries, and we'll explore that today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head.

I know many people are feeling that something's just not right in our world today, but don't know how to characterize this general malaise they feel any more than that. Our program is trying to address that ... indeed, Dr. Norberto Keppe's science of Analytical Trilogy has been shedding the light on what's gone so wrong for over 50 years now. Either we're slow learners, or we've really been avoiding the consciousness he brings. So, no more avoiding. Understanding how humanity painted itself so tightly into this corner is here in our program today, along with some hope for a way out. Or at the very least, how to cope with the difficulties and offer a hand out to those in more serious need. First in our program today, Susan Berkley with some thoughts on modern Judaism here shortly after the Jewish New Year, along with some thoughts on the Occupy Wall Street protest movement. Then Claudia Bernhardt Pacheco with her perspectives from a lifetime career as a psychoanalyst on what's gone so wrong, and how to fix it. Consciousness for a Conscious Planet, today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head.

And especially we look at how we've gotten so off track - particularly over the past century. This is not always comfortable consciousness we bring. It's a little harrowing to hear about the pit we've dug ourselves into. But we are hardly the first to shine the light on the decadence all around us. In 1917, three young Portuguese shepherds were visited over the course of 6 months by an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary. She, also, did not bring comforting news. What she did bring was a clear vision of what was going on in the world and what was required of us if we wanted to survive it. And I think we would do well to heed her advice to humble ourselves and change our ways. And trust that goodness will triumph. We'll explore all of this today on our program.

And watched their heads nod knowingly. These are pretty astute analysts down here of the social situation. They’re students and teachers with me of Dr. Norberto Keppe’s scientific studies into the psycho-social causes of our life-threatening problems on the planet. They were not surprised at the facts really, but they were very impressed at how Ferguson put all the complexity into a coherent package. This is well done. Down here in Brazil, we receive the TNT channel in our cable TV package, and I’m flabbergasted at how many times the Harry Potter or Jason Bourne blockbusters are run. They repeat constantly. I think Inside Job should be on that kind of rotation. But I also think Dr. Keppe’s TV shows should get more airing, too. Not sure if you even knew about his TV shows, but we have a number of excerpts on our site for you to see really remarkable new media. With considerable philosophical, theological and scientific teeth. Because in all the brilliance displayed in Inside Job, I still think it suffers from a lack of understanding of the science of psycho-socio pathology that Keppe brings. I feel most social activism falls into this trap actually. And this is the science we expose in our show. We’ll do that again today.

And it seems clear that all of this is implicated in the current economic meltdown being led by the U.S. Regulators want to blame Wall St., Wall St. wants to blame the regulators, apologists for the Bilderbergers, Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission even point to the Baby Boomers as the cause. And all of this just muddies the waters. You listen to the pundits and the debaters and the talk show blowhards and cable TV comedians and end up believing in whichever espouses the economic or political philosophy you already adhere to. And nothing changes. You just wind up feeling that you don't really know anything, no matter how informed you are. Well, to begin with, there's been a systematic effort over many decades to eliminate the regulations put in place in the 1930s to stop the kind of financial sector gluttony and greed that got us in trouble in 1929, and is repeating itself again now. This is not being understood. We get almost no historical context to explain what's going on ... and so we don't solve the fundamental causes of the problems. We'll try to shed some light on the causes today on our program, with a panel discussion with a number of Americans linked to Norberto Keppe's science of Analytical Trilogy so we can try to understand, once and for all, what's really going on. And what we can do about it.

It's our contention at the International Society of Analytical Trilogy in Brazil that if we understand the benefits of good action, we would all be more inclined toward it. But perhaps we've forgotten that tenet of society, that do unto others creed that earlier generations grew up with. I'm not sure when it happened exactly, but somewhere along the way, being good got a bad rap. It became cool to not care, to look after number one only. Maybe we threw the goodness baby out with the bath water when we were marching for revolution in the '60s and trying to undo everything our forefathers had erected, but in doing that, we tuned out on some good stuff, too ... not just the insanity of war. It's fundamental to our society to do good. But it's also essential to our sanity. And with the horror of Norway reverberating throughout Europe and the world, it's timely to remember that we have contributed to this very destructive world in more concrete ways than we maybe wish to consider. We'll look at that today on our program.

And we’re totally ingenuous about that. But ignorance of corruption is no excuse, and our silent acquiescence is a form of condoning it. Norberto Keppe’s work of Analytical Trilogy has made enormous strides in giving us the tools to analyze the powerful behind the creation of the most unjust society in history – today’s – and that’s why his work has been so attacked by media and political figures alike. But the work is still there, albeit out of the mainstream, and available to help you understand the world we live in, and how we’ve gotten so off track. We’ll explore the genesis of Keppe’s study into sociopathology and offer a searing critique of the media that keeps us asleep today on Thinking with Somebody Else’s Head.

A couple of questions there that don’t have easy answers. Which is maybe why we avoid them so arduously by distracting ourselves with happy hours and blockbusters and diverse entertainments. There is so much energy spent on just surviving that I’d like to step back from today to consider life in a deeper way.

Norberto Keppe’s science of Analytical Trilogy contains priceless perspectives on any number of important themes for all concerned citizens. And knowing this puts us in a much better position to work for change. Without his science, we end up just criticizing, or worse, replacing corrupt systems and people with even worse situations because we didn’t understand more deeply what was going on – as happened with the French Revolution where the nobility was replaced by the even worse financial/economic power structure. As Keppe writes, “Our task today is to disinvert the position of humanity, which is now at the service of the individual interests of a few thousand people, meaning that the rest of us cannot work for our own benefit. We’ve organized a senseless social system within which we’re all forced to live. From the time we’re born, we are confined in an inhuman social framework that increases our psychological tension to the extreme.” With the perspectives brought by Analytical Trilogy, it is now possible once and for all to put a stop to the powerful and begin living in harmony with what we are in essence. Today, we’ll look at all of that by considering the decay that lurks in the land of plenty.

Bribery and corruption are common and there are signs the world is speedily coming to an end.” The latest doomsday prognostication from the Mayans? Not exactly. A statement allegedly lifted from an Assyrian tablet dated 2800 B.C. It’s clear mankind has been on the wrong path for some time, but what specifically are the steps we’ve taken off the straight and narrow? At least some of the blame can be laid at the feet of Freud and Marx and other schools of psychology. Professor Karl Jaspers, arguably humanity’s greatest psychological scientist, said that some psychologies and sociologies have performed perversions in society and exerted devastating power. Let’s look at how these ideas have helped us corrupt our planet and ourselves. Eliminating Faith and Truth: the Failure of Psychological Science, today on Thinking with Somebody Else’s Head.

Some government official with his hand out or a doctor accepting an all expenses paid fishing trip in exchange for promoting new pharmaceuticals, or a baseball player betting on his own team. It’s part of doing business in some countries, and whispers of it are always present wherever big events, like the Olympics and the World Cup, are held. But corruption is not reserved only for corporate boardrooms or secret meetings of the world’s power brokers – although it’s certainly in abundance there. It’s also inside all of us who corrupt ourselves without knowing how, or why.

Prominent journalist, Bill Moyers, has suggested that there’s nothing more important for a democracy than ensuring an independent and free media. The loss of this, then, is of great concern to any who seek to live in freedom. Media has become at best a kind of sideshow and at worst, completely irrelevant, because it doesn’t tell us what’s going on. We’ll look at that and consider the implications of this for the liberation of the people, today on Thinking with Somebody Else’s Head.Join the conversation at Facebook.

The current disturbing levels of apathy appear to be the reason for the success of Stéphane Hessel's Cry Out! - a French publishing phenomenon. This 13-page pamphlet encourages youth to recapture the French spirit of resistance by rejecting the "insolent, selfish" power of money and markets and by defending the social "values of modern democracy." Norberto Keppe's, Liberation of the People, written the the mid 1980s, offered a call to all idealists, all who believe in goodness, truth and beauty, to unite so a new society could be built, the Kingdom of Man on Earth. Keppe foreshadowed Hessel's admonitions, and he goes deeper, too, explaining how we got so off track and offering concrete solutions to fix things. We explore how that's more than idealism and actually approaches true romance, today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head.

How we in the public rise up in collective indignation at suggestions of sexual impropriety while hardly looking up from our breakfast cereal at revelations of the lies that pushed us to war! Not to diminish the charges in any way, but there's more going on here than first glance would tell us. Deeper explanations are needed ... and fast. Especially when we consider Strauss-Kahn's prominent role in criticizing the global financial system while moving to reduce the importance of the dollar in IMF negotiations. How to look at this terrible situation with consciousness, humility and even wisdom? We'll conduct an Analytical Trilogy psycho-socio analysis of the DSK affair, and consider what real malfeasance goes on around us all the time unnoticed and even supported.

Or a mix of those elements with corruption and evil? That question strikes deep to the issue philosophers have struggled to answer for centuries. Today, we are very fortunate to have some conclusions on the subject, originating from Norberto Keppe's school of Analytical Trilogy. And the conclusions reached at Keppe's scientific society allow us to look with new eyes on transcendence, psychic phenomena, death and human meaning. All of which we'll do on our program today.

Or an inverted celebration based on a false sense of unity? We make a strong argument for the latter this week on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head. You see, when the celebration fades away, the real problems will appear again. The economy, the growing gap between the poor and the extremely rich, the scandalous profits made by pharmaceutical companies that poison us with unnecessary medicines, the millions in drug cartel money laundered by the U.S. banking system ... those are the real dangers facing America, not some obscure Al Qaeda terrorist network hiding in the mountains of Afghanistan. And these real problems we're not addressing. There are enormous dangers of using outside scapegoats to mask our deep societal problems, and we'll explore all that on this week's program with Claudia Bernhardt Pacheco.

But it was a powerful thing. There was a real spirit of change moving back then, and the answer did seem to be blowing in the wind. The spirit wavered there bravely for a time, but then got lost in the drugs and greed and the “me” generation. And always, the spectre of the pathology of power was there, attacking the protesters on campus sit ins and submitting a generation of idealistic youth to the horror of Vietnam and the mindless menace of violence and nuclear obliteration. What happened to our activism, and can it be recuperated? Through the science of Analytical Trilogy elaborated by Norberto Keppe, let’s try to rekindle a social conscience today on Thinking with Somebody Else’s Head.

In fact, there is ample evidence that the socio-economic power in charge today holds back the development of humankind. But most critics (and there are many, including many excellent ones) can’t connect the dots to give us a complete analysis of it because they’re lacking the understanding of the science of psycho-socio pathology. Which is exactly what we bring every week on Thinking with Somebody Else’s Head. In spite of being attacked relentlessly by the powerful because the powerful know that if his work gets into the world, they lose their hold on power, Norberto Keppe has been resolute in his condemnation of the pathology of power. We’ll go deeply behind the curtains of power to expose all that on today’s show.

We’ll even go a little further: it leading us into mental and physical illness. After all, human beings cannot live in balance if society is out of balance. The dynamics between the individual’s internal problems and the resultant social difficulties has rarely been studied … and never with the clarity and vision we’ll introduce today. Stress as a consequence of social sickness, led by the most unbalanced individuals in our society today – our leaders – and what we need to do to improve it. Depression and Society.

These are all aspects of society we have to deal with in our modern world. But not only in the external population. No, there are many of those personalities in power today. And they use the police and military to squash dissent in all of the myriad and horrible ways we’ve seen in the 20th century. Let’s bring the precise lens of psycho-socio pathology brought by Norberto Keppe’s science of Analytical Trilogy to the subject today. We’ll analyze Society on the Couch through Keppe’s astounding book, The Psychoanalysis of Society, and also consider the inequality in economics and how it creates such social injustice. All that and more on this week’s installment of Thinking with Somebody Else’s Head.

What it’s showing us is that our way of behaving on the planet, even our lauded scientific philosophy itself, has led us not to the promised land of abundance and happiness, but to the brink of disaster. We are seeing the inevitable results of an inverted worldview. This is much discussed and understood in the science of Analytical Trilogy – but discussed far less than it should be in the world at large.

That won’t stop us from attempting the task, however. Because something changed in science. Although scientists today are generally against any idea of a transcendental reality, it wasn’t always like that. For centuries, the greatest geniuses considered the ultimate creative force of God fundamental to understanding of anything. And then, it all changed. Let’s explore that change, and show how modern scientific dogma has led us to a blind alley that we won’t be able to escape from without reuniting science with theology and philosophy – which is exactly what Norberto Keppe’s Analytical Trilogy does. Within this critique will also be some fundamental knowledge about the human psyche and its contribution to our problems, and the hopeful possibilities emerging from the Keppe Motor.

And why is this so fundamental? Because there are so many twists and turns in human relationships, in work, in all professions, in life, that if you don’t understand what’s going on between people’s ears, you will never be able to truly succeed in your life. And knowing what’s going on in women’s psychopathology has seldom been well analyzed, and our society suffers as a result. We’ll dive deeply into what’s going on in women’s heads today with one of the foremost experts on women and their role in society’s destruction, Dr. Claudia Bernhardt Pacheco. That's today on Thinking with Somebody Else’s Head.

When did they become so old fashioned? Nowadays we live in a world almost totally dominated by greed, getting something for nothing, and exploitation. Our premise today is that this goes directly against the foundations of our civilization, and our human essence. That’s serious stuff.

And his science of Analytical Trilogy was having a big effect – which the powerful didn’t like all that much. Meaning that Keppe and his team of researchers were attacked relentlessly – especially when it became clear that Keppe was touching a sensitive nerve and making a lot of people conscious of the pathology of power and how it was leading America to ruin. Didn’t get Keppe too many invites to State Department soirees back then. And this was extremely unfortunate. If we had listened to Keppe back then – if we’d been given the chance to listen to him – things would be very different in America today.

A bacteriologist has little knowledge of what an endocrinologist does, much less does a paleontologist understand anything of molecular chemistry. And although all of it may be Greek to us, there is a synthesis in science that comes from disinverting the basis of the scientific disciplines. Norberto Keppe’s work of Analytical Trilogy has accomplished that Herculean feat, and we are the lucky beneficiaries. Science that makes sense today on Thinking with Somebody Else’s Head, and along the way, a consideration of good and evil, what’s happening in the Arab world, and how our minds influence nature – beautifully explained as always by Dr. Claudia Bernhardt Pacheco and Richard Lloyd Jones.

Jahweh. Jehovah. The Almighty. God. Whatever name He goes by, He’s been honoured and worshipped by the greatest human beings in history. Only in our modern times have we systematically acted to remove the Creator of the universe – and of ourselves – from our human institutions. At great damage to ourselves. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else’s Head, our Christmas show, the Modern Relevance of God. Well, it’s a beautiful topic today because it speaks to something deep in all of us – even if we don’t acknowledge it. The sense of meaning we all look for and have such difficulties finding in our modern philosophy. God is largely out of the picture in human affairs today, and we’ve removed Him at great expense to our collective well being. The modern scientists and thinkers have elaborated theories that try to explain existence and all the magnificence and immensity of the universe in materialistic ways, as not needing the “Immovable Mover”, as Aristotle called Him. And the pathological powerful who often held the reins of the churches have contributed to the modern day aversion to God as well. After all, who wants to consider a God who is intoned from high places as the bringer of pestilence and war and famine. Those things have nothing to do with God but blaming Him for them marks an enormous projection into God of what we do. I am not talking about that vision of God at all, but of the infinitely beautiful and loving creator of all of this – and it’s this One we would like to talk about in our program today. Just let me say one more thing before we begin. Buried in the release of all those diplomatic cables recently on the WikiLeaks site is some clear admissions from the U.S. Military and CIA that they are engaging in a series of actions designed to increase apathy among the world’s population so that leaders can ignore voters and a very nefarious agenda can be implemented. I think this is linked with our loss of hope, and that means it’s all linked to our loss of contact with true spirituality and God. So here at Christmastime 2010, let’s consider the modern relevance of God. After you’ve listened, if you have comments, I’d love to hear them: rich@richjonesvoice.com Dr. Claudia Bernhardt Pacheco from Norberto Keppe’s International Society of Analytical Trilogy joins me. Keppe’s science allows us a deep perspective on all the important issues of human existence. And this one today is perhaps the most important.

So we build walls to keep out the Mexicans, we stone the "terrible" married women who sleep around, we blame everyone but ourselves for our troubles. And perhaps one of the most pernicious areas dominated by the "problem comes from outside" mentality is health. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Where our Health Really Comes From. Every couple of days I receive a great e-newsletter from Dr. Mercola. It's chock full of great information - too much for me to keep up with, frankly. But there's lots of good stuff in there about how GM foods are taking over, the dangers of artificial sweeteners and fluoride and even vaccines. It's invaluable stuff. It struck me, however, how materialistic it is, and so limited because of this. So many details about nutrition, like simple secrets to better digestive health, the things men can do to tweak their prostate health, amazing tonics and teas and supplements. Oh, were it that easy, right? It seems we are addicted to looking for solutions outside. My father, who's 86 now, has a health food store in his bedroom. Exotic things like shark cartilage, Komodo bearded dragon dusting powder, leucistic sugar gliders. Man's search for healing medicinal tonics is centuries old. This desperate drive to find our health answers outside has been exploited by many snake-oil salesmen among others - including the first Rockefellers. The father of J.D., J.D. being the oil robber baron everyone knows about, was well known for bottling a strange concoction and travelling all over America palming off bottled raw petroleum as a magical elixir he assured the gullible would cure everything from gas to cancer. His son, the very same J.D., was suitably impressed by this - especially when he realized it cost only $2.00 a barrel to concoct the elixir from crude petroleum, and that barrel would produce 1000 - 6 oz. bottles of the stuff. He labelled it Nujol, and sold it as a cure for constipation back in the 1920s. We're so desperate to find the origins of our illnesses that we'll spend a fortune looking for magic from outside. This fear of things outside reached its zenith in the 20th century with Darwin's theory. If we're all animals, it must be a jungle out there, so eat or be eaten my friend. And look at all the disastrous collateral damage of that inverted view. Louis Pasteur kicked into action at the end of the 19th century with th etheory that disease would originate from germs formed outside - and this took off because of the huge support of the burgeoning pharmaceutical industry that would make billions selling medicines to kill those offending germs outside. And we'd forget all about the amazing work of Antoine Bechamp, Pasteur's contemporary and a far superior scientist to Louis, who arrived at exactly opposite conclusions from his rival. This battle is a fascinating one, actually, that we'll dive into a little today with Dr. Claudia Bernhardt Pacheco, a world-renowned author, psychoanalyst, and pioneer in psychosomatic medicine from Dr. Keppe's International Society of Analytical Trilogy.

You're best friends with someone at work when suddenly they get promoted. After this move upstairs, they don't want to know you. They become aloof and unapproachable - almost like they've become somebody else. What's actually happening is that the new power has liberated the pathology that always existed. They've started the very self-destructive process of selling out. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Power and the Loss of Ideals. "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely," was how Lord Acton supposedly put it back in the 19th century. But like Shakespeare's famous "To be or not to be," most have never heard what the insightful Lord Acton said next. It was, "Great men are almost always bad men." Of course, this last would depend on how you define great men. If you limit that definition to men or women of material accomplishments only, perhaps. But it's difficult to ascribe the word "bad" to those of a more altruistic and benevolent nature. Gandhi, Mozart, Puccine, Da Vinci, Mother Theresa, Jesus - it would be difficult to accuse them of evil. But there appears to be something that happens to those who are linked too much to power. And this is something Dr. Norberto Keppe has explored substantially in his writing - particularly in his book, Liberation of the People: the Pathology of Power, where Keppe turns his keen psychoanalytic mind on what goes on in power situations. He goes so far as to say, "The well balanced individual is not interested in having power. Only those who are extremely sick become attached to positions of power and command so as to counterbalance their psychological shortcomings." In this sense, Keppe is going a huge step beyond the usual, "Oh, he's crazy," which is normally how we denominate those in power who do ridiculous things. Keppe is analyzing this psychologically, and is therefore providing a scientific view that goes well beyond the typical ideological divisions that govern whether we see a political or business move as positive or negative. And he points to this pathology of power as being the fundamental factor in our inverted and disturbed social life as well. In his book, Sociopathology, he puts it this way: "The core of sociopathology is the desire for power. Any individual who has unlimited power inevitably creates serious disorder because he is able to give free rein to all of his psychopathology." This really moves the debate to an area more linked to reason and analysis, rather than just the usual emotional venting that occurs when talking about societal leadership. This is leading edge psychological work that Keppe is developing here. We put up some interesting stuff about the pathology of power on our site at www.healingthroughconsciousness.com. Check it out and let me know what you think. rich@richjonesvoice.com Dr. Claudia Bernhardt Pacheco from Keppe's International Society of Analytical Trilogy is here today to continue our discussion on power - particularly as linked to the loss of idealism and romanticism.

There's a general belief that without those in power, we'd have no one to protect us or look after our needs. But past citizens had a wiser view. They knew that those in power could be dangerous if not controlled. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Diagnosing the Sickness of Power. In a love sonnet, Shakespeare praised those that have power to hurt and yet will do none. And oh, wouldn't it be fine to encounter that some day in a political figure. But more and more it seems they fail us again and again, and, like the football team down 28 - 0 at the half needs to re-consider its game plan, so, too, do we need to look with fresh eyes at power and the powerful.Thankfully, there's a vast body of literature and analysis of all things human that accomplishes that much-needed perspective. And that's the remarkable science of Analytical Trilogy developed by a noteworthy Brazilian scientist named Norberto Keppe. When I first came across Keppe's exploration of the pathology of power in his book, Liberation of the People, I was in my early '40s and locked into my career and feathering my nest, as most of us think of doing. But something in that book spoke deep to my dormant idealism and re-kindled the spark that lies inside all of us. I think it was that part right at the beginning where Keppe states, "We want to summon all of you who have a practical nature, all who possess idealism and dynamism, all who believe in goodness, truth and beauty, to unite so that a new world can be built, a new society: the true Kingdom of Man on earth." Wow. Gives me a rush even today. So 9 years ago, I packed all my stuff into a storage locker in Toronto and schlepped it on down here to Brazil to discover for myself the cause of all the depth charges going off inside me every time I read Keppe's work. I'd like to share a little bit of that with you today, and if it lights your fire, invite you to get in contact with me so we can explore what we can do together to bring this idealism to more people, and through resonance with these like-minded people, contribute towards this Kingdom of Man on earth. Dr. Claudia Bernhardt Pacheco is uniquely qualified to talk about the pathology of power. She lived through considerable attacks from the powerful in North America and Europe, not to mention Brazil, who didn't like what she and Keppe were publishing and teaching. She's here with me today.

Some things just aren't made to go together. Like being given plastic cutlery at a Brazilian barbecue restaurant, they're incongruous and difficult to reconcile. Some more profound examples could include faith and doubt, humility and self-confidence. And what about God and science? Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, the Marriage of Theology and Science. This is a prickly subject. I'm aware of that. But I feel I would be doing a dis-service to you who listen faithfully to this program if I didn't address the subject. Because there are fundamental questions to raise that can only be addressed if we wade into these uncertain waters. What is the origin of life and the universe? What is the purpose of life? These are the questions that perhaps should occupy our dinner conversations with dear friends much more than they do. Especially in recent years. And in large part, I think this is because science has split from theology and philosophy over the past 500 years or so - culminating in our 20th Century position that there's no way to marry science and theology. Science has become a strictly materialistic pursuit perfectly represented in Einstein's famous formula - the most famous of the 20th Century - that E=mc2. No material, no energy is the inevitable conclusion of this equation, making Einstein's proposal one of the most materialistic theories in the history of science. And it's also difficult to distill spirituality from the Quantum Physics camp. Parallel realities. Alternate universes. Unlimited realities awaiting your choice to come into being. How to make sense of that in any practical way? I watched What the Bleep do we Know a couple of times and, I must confess, couldn't make head or tails of it. The Architect's speech from Matrix Reloaded is a classic example of how confused we've become by this separation of science and theology. Critics call it "profound" but "confusing". And it is that. Listen: "The first matrix was perfect ... flawless, sublime. A triumph equaled only by its monumental failure." What does that mean? No, we need a better starting point than this. A starting place that can be found in the work of Norberto Keppe. His Analytical Trilogy is a re-synthesis of science with philosophy and theology that has been missing. Keppe considers philosophy to be the mother of science and theology the grandmother, and it's very illuminating to look at reality through Analytical Trilogy eyes. Let's do that today ... try to bring the incredible wisdom from 5000 years of theological and philosophical study back into science. Or at least, start the process of understanding that. Keppe's books will fill out the knowledge. If you're interested in more, write me at rich@richjonesvoice.com. One of the discoveries here at the International Society of Analytical Trilogy is the application of Keppe's disinverson of metaphysics to result in the Keppe Motor, and we'll start our conversation there with Dr. Claudia Bernhardt Pacheco. How do you see the Keppe Motor's importance, Claudia, in this consideration of bringing theology back into science?

It began in the '50s and was apparently stopped in the '70s. But CIA veterans say the research continues. You may find it hard to believe, and the whole field is dismissed as being the province of paranoid conspiracy theories, but mind control is going on. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, HAARP and Mind Control, part 2 in our series with Nick Begich on the HAARP technology. You'll hear Dr. Begich make reference to MK-Ultra in this program. This was a super-secret and illegal CIA human research program run by the Office of Scientific Intelligence. This program used many drugs to manipulate individual mental states and alter brain function. It's a little difficult to get total information about it since then-CIA director, Richard Helms, ordered all the MK-Ultra files destroyed back in 1973. What were they trying to hide, do you think? That offence should be a prison sentence, shouldn't it? According to sworn testimony in front of the U.S. Congress' Church Committee in 1975, these mind control experiments were conducted without any knowledge or consent of the subjects. There's no other way to put it ... this was a crime against humanity of the 1st degree. Of course, the U.S. hasn't been the only country traipsing through this mucky terrain, but it is perhaps the biggest democracy involved, and that should give us some pause. You'll hear a little bit more about this in our program today, but I would recommend that you research it a little more. It's pretty horrific stuff, but essential to know about. MK-Ultra is the illegal CIA program you're looking for. And in the middle of this sickness, where the sickest people control our political and economic structures, comes Norberto Keppe's Analytical Trilogy, with its beautifully conceived science that gives us a way to understand these crazy things we see around us. His clear view of human psychopathology is extremely well articulated in all of his many books, and his explorations of how we the people have given power to these unbalanced powerful people in charge is food for thought. We have to wake up, and fast, and start giving more value to those inner aspects of our essential structure - goodness, truth, beauty, dignity, ethics. Right now, we're all pretty lost in this inverted worldview that puts money above work and aggression above conciliation and dialogue. And technology at the service of whatever perverted idea the men and women in the shadows want to dream up. Which is the subject of our program today. Email me if I can help you with any more information at all about any of our topics on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head. Today, Part II of our program on HAARP, this time, the nefarious uses for mind control, with my colleague, Susan Berkley.

The Shadow People that have been summoned from the beyond through black magic practices and that terrorize us while we conduct our daily lives. It's too much for our program to delve into the supernatural occurrences of the Shadow People ... but the real life men in the shadows? Let's go. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Part I of Playing the Haarp - an investigation into one of the U.S. government's Black Budget projects that has very dire ramifications for humanity and planet Earth. The Black Budget. What is that? Michael E. Salla from the Center for Global Peace at American University in Washington, D.C., says, "The CIA has the unique legal ability among all US government departments and agencies to generate funds through appropriations of other federal government agencies and other sources 'without regard to any provisions of law' and without regard to the intent behind Congressional appropriations. Every year, billions of dollars of Congressional appropriations are diverted from their Congressionally sanctioned purposes to the CIA and Department of Defense-based intelligence agencies without knowledge of the public and with the collusion of Congressional leaders. The covert world of ‘black programs’ acts with virtual impunity, overseen and regulated by itself, funding itself through secret slush funds, and is free of the limitations that come from Congressional oversight, proper auditing procedures and public scrutiny." He goes on to say that the CIA black budget is annually in the vicinity of 1.1 trillion dollars – pretty high considering that the DoD budget for 2010 is something like 664 billion dollars. Now, these are figures - statistics - and one thing we should know about stats is that they can be used in any way you want to use them. But one thing is clear - there are gobs of dollars floating around that appear to be outside any Congressional oversight. And that should make us pause. Because that money is being used by men and women in the shadows to do all sorts of stuff - and I don't have much confidence that these enormous sums are in the hands of people with good intentions or even competence. If the disaster of BP's Gulf of Mexico oil spill is anything to go by, any illusions of corporate or government competence should be dashed forever. Brazilian psychoanalyst and social scientist, Norberto Keppe, has written about this extensively over the past 50 years, and today more than ever we'd be wise to take heed of what he says. But let me warn you ... what he says is not for the faint of heart. Let me also stress, however, that Keppe follows scientific principles in his analysis. He's the world's foremost expert on the human psyche, his conclusions arrived at after 50 years of research and clinicial experience. He has seen the attitutes he describes in his over 30 books in action. In his 17th book, Liberation of the People, written prophetically 24 years ago, Keppe provides an incisive analysis of the pathology of power. This book tells it like it is. Listen: "Generally speaking, the adminstrators of power must be endowed with consdierable aggressiveness and above all must be Machiavellian, people who go to any extreme to make greater and greater profit. Peole with no compassion whatsoever. This is the mentality of those who lead the world." Is it possible to have peace on Earth with such aggression? Keppe's inevitable conclusions whos us the inverted psyche we all have, and how those in powere have more serious imbalance and sickness. So his book is a must read for any who are still laboring under the impression that those in power have good intentions for we the people. They don't, and they keep many of their projects and processes in the shadows. Keppe's book is available to all. rich@richjonesvoice.com if you're interested in how to get a copy.

Then she went on, "We have to see this God or whatever it is in relation to all that is valid and workable in science." I agree. Because whatever you call Him - God, energy, the Great Spirit - the world is poorer by excluding Him. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, The Relevance of God in our Modern Society. And as I launch into this program, I am fully aware of the heat this will cause in some circles. One of the distinguishing aspects of our modern society is the almost certain guarantee that if you talk openly about the need to introduce God into human affairs, you are sure to raise howls of protest and derision in many circles. God, it seems, is considered at best old fashioned and quaint, as if talking about Him suggests you're a child who needs the comfort of fairy-tale proverbs about miracles and salvation to help you sleep at night, and at worst like you are a dangerous Bible thumping lunatic spouting Biblical scripture in answer to any dilemma and leading any who follow into a mind-controlling cult. I feel this keenly whenever I enter into this subject here on the program. I'm a modern Canadian, after all ... a baby-booming WASP raised with the requisite Darwinian scientific education. I remember wll how I felt when listening to the religuous people who came knowcking on my door on Saturday morning. I do believe we have been fed a very distorted story about God, and that we are very out of touch with a meaningful understanding of God and the nature of Man and the universe. To the point where we now have knee-jerk reactions when we face this issuethat have nothing to do with reason. My colleague, Sofie Bergqvist, talked in a previous podcast, Liberating Ourselves From our Free Will, about this when she told a sotry about an immigrant student in her Swedish high school who innocently stated in Biology class that she didn't hold to Darwin's theory and instead believed that God had created the world and all in it. Sofie's classmates were predictably cruel in meting out their justice for this heresy. They simply shunned the girl. No one talked to her, no one invited her to parties, no one had anything to do with her. It's not difficult for me to see the same thing happening in my native Canada. Ad we are countries, Canada and Sweden, who consider ourselves paragons of tolerance. But let me tell you, my dear, northern, first-world, modern compatriots - that primitive shunning and ex-communication would never happen in Brazil. Another of my colleagues, a Brazilian, was conducting a Portuguese class for a group of foreigners trying to learn the language when the subject of belief came up. One of the students started to speak about his belief in God and how he thought it was important for the human being to have contact with this spirituality. A fellow student - from France - rose up in protest and started the standard put-down that I don't need to describe. "Whoa, hold on a minute," my colleague said firmly. "You're in Brazil now. Here, we don't attack others for their beliefs or lack of belief. We're not like you in the first world. Here, we respect a person's right to have his beliefs, even if they're different from ours." Dead silence from the French woman. Message received. When I came to Brazil 9 years ago, I remember teaching an English class where one of the students began to speak about his faith, and I said, "You mean, you can talk about these things here?!" The students laughed good-naturedly. Another ignorant foreigner lost in political correctness and censorship. The good news today is, my dear listener, that we can begin again to consider a scientific view of God through the remarkable work of Brazilian psychoanalyst and social scientist, Dr. Norberto Keppe, whose science of Analytical Trilogy is a re-union of science with philosophy and, can you believe it, theology to give us a vast, deep and comprehensive view of the human being and</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Philosophy,consciousness,metaphysics,physics,Analytical,Trilogy,Dr,Keppe,Keppe,quantum,physics,spirituality,education,economics,sociopathology</itunes:keywords><description>A listener asked me recently, "Why is it necessary to speak of God."

I agree....&lt;br/&gt;

Like the Japanese admiral who reflected after Pearl Harbor, "Perhaps we've just awakened a sleeping tiger." It's always used to point to a condition of potential that waits, dozing in the wings, for its hour upon the stage. But in today's desperate world, we need the sleeping tiger to get its butt into gear. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Waking the Sleeping Tiger. This program, I hope, will be a clarion call to all who have a spark still burning in the embers of their idealism. As there was for me when I read Norberto Keppe's seminal book for idealists the world over, Liberation of the People: the Pathology of Power. This book was a beacon for me because of its scientific analysis of our inverted social structure which has led us so far from anything remotely resembling a just situation. This book is a searing critique that manages to give us hope even while it's pointing out the sickness and destruction that has come at our hands. Because Keppe's book speaks to a deeper level in us than just revolutionary fervor like that "off with their heads" blood lust that perverted ideals behind the French Revolution. Keppe speaks to universal values like tolerance and dignity while shining an unwavering critical eye on the causes of our current desperate impasse, while continuing to suggest reasonable and rational solutions to our dilemma which we could put into practice immediately to great effect. He also has some extremely important things to say about the pathology of power, and how power is controlled by the sickest individuals on the planet - something that's never been understood well because of our admiration for the rich and famous that stems from our Inversion and envy, which he outlines in this book, and because the powerful manipulate everything in secret so that everything goes to their favor and not the favor of the vast majority of human beings. We quite simply don't get the full story in our media and halls of education and so remain ignorant of this nefarious situation. This, of course, is what I'm trying to address through this program. And what Norberto Keppe has been trying to address for decades through his books and TV and radio programs. Our program today will be a wake up call - we hope - for any of you with dreams for a just society still burning, however dimly, beneath your breast. Keppe's science of Analytical Trilogy offers real hope for a way back from the abyss. I'd like to make Keppe's monumental book, Liberation of the People, available to you free of charge. I'll only ask you to help with mailing costs. We'll foot the rest. I think if enough people can get up to speed with Keppe's ideas in this book, really start to resonate with them, we're not too late to effect real change on this planet. Email me if you'd like a free copy of Liberation of the People. And one other thing ... our psychosocial forum May 13 - 15, 2010 here in São Paulo will be another good thing for you to know about. Check out the site. Today, psychosocial therapist, Gilbert Gambucci, joins me to try to wake up the sleeping tiger.

You couldn't help it. There was nothing you could do." These are the beguiling voices we hear. Victims drive the ratings on daytime TV, after all. Blaming, finger pointing, laying on the guilt - so common, so righteous, so ... convenient. And so wrong. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, freeing ourselves from the Prison of Victimhood. Now you who are regular listeners to Thinking with Somebody Else's Head will already have a good idea which side of this theme we're goint to come down on, don't you? Our program, based as it is on the cutting edge psychological research coming out of the Brazilian school of Analytical Trilogy, could do nothing other than focus the discussion inward. Because that's where the trail inevitably leads. Norberto Keppe, the scientist behind the profound work coming out of Analytical Trilogy these days - and it is formidable indeed, in the areas of education and medicine and economics and physics - Keppe puts forward the idea that we have contact with all the magnificence and glory of Creation through our inner selves, that beautiful atmosphere of universal knowledge and wisdom that resides within each one of us. Plato called it the world of infused knowledge, meaning intelligence and savvy that we are born with. In Keppe's language, these universal knowings within would be divine concepts inside the human mind. And this opens the door to a staggering thought given all the modern science that points in the opposite direction, and that is that we are not creatures who are evolving to greater intelligence and knowledge at all, but we are instead creations with all possible understanding already infused in us. And coming to re-discover that is an inner journey. There is already evidence of the presence of this native intelligence and sense of ethics from our very beginning as babies in excellent research coming out of the Infant Cognitive Center at Yale and University of California at Berkley professor, Alison Gopnik's studies into the Philosophical Baby, and they've reached fascinating conclusions about the rich and intelligent inner life of babies from the beginning. All of this to say that it's by treading the inner path that we really come to know reality, not through our external machinations. Not to say we don't gain substantial wisdom from our experiences - of course we do - but I mean that it's through this outer contact that we come to know ourselves, that self that already exists and is not simply a product of our outer experience. Which is what Socrates was contending 2500 years ago. So victimhood, that state of being shaped and fashioned by our outer traumas, can be re-considered, which is exactly what we'll do today. Helena Mellander, a frequent contributor to Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, is a Swedish journalist who's been having quite an impact with her new blog in Swedish written with our colleague, educator Sofie Bergqvist. Helena wrote about this recently to interesting discussion from the Swedish community. If this also stirs your desire to comment, I'm always happy to hear from you. rich@richjonesvoice.com.

Offically "low-wage" familes are increasing in number significantly. While the 1% at the top end is springing for $175.00 gold dusted hamburgers at the Wall Street Burger Shop, the rest of us just feel squeezed. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Popping the Positive Thinking Bubble. Yes, we're coming at this positive thinking thing again because I feel strongly that there is something in our culture of positive thinking that has led us astray. And I think that's been borne out when we just look around us at the society we've created. We have children who've been uber-stroked with compliments heading into the workforce and completely incapable of coping with criticism, up-in-the-cloud investment experts who demanded only positive financial analysis and perspectives and thereby stayed blind to the dangerously inflated investment instruments that were poised to collapse all around our ears, we have U.S. Fed and Treasury experts being blindsided by the greed and selfishness on Wall Street that they didn't want to see. Well, Norberto Keppe's science of Analytical Trilogy allows us to understand how all this could happen by putting us in touch with the roots of our human psychopathology that leads to all this, and that our dogma of positive thinking blocks us from seeing. So I'd like to explore this a little more today with my colleague, Susan Berkley. But before we do that, a reminder about our World Psycho-Social Forum coming up in Brazil May 13-15, 2010. Love to have you join us for that. It would be good to let you know more about this intriguing forum, so you can write me for any more information you'd like ... rich@richjonesvoice.com and I'll make sure you're completely up to speed. And one more thing - I've been doing a lot of work with my good friend and Thinking with Somebody Else's Head supporter, Will LaJeunesse, on our Healing Through Consciousness site. This is the call-in psychological program and podcast I do with psychoanalyst, Dr. Claudia Bernhardt Pacheco. We've got a lot of interesting resource material on that site about Analytical Trilogy, so feel free to check it out. www.healingthroughconsciousness.com. Let me know what you think.

Ask for it, believe in it, receive it - the mantra for getting what you want. And woe betide you if you fail to follow its sunny side up paradigm. Then you can be hit with a double whammy - problems because you weren't positive and guilt on top of that. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, the Downside of Being Up. Well, we're striking into the core of one of the foundational pillars of the American way of life today. We're weaned on positive thinking from the time we're in our mothers' wombs. We're praised and coddled and told we can do anything. We're reminded to use smiles as umbrellas and exhorted to make lemonade with the lemons life deals us. Positive thinking, or the importance of it anyway, comes as natural to us as breathing. And it's a tricky thing, because it seems so right. But it can lead us to something so wrong. Positive thinking is based on the premise that human beings have wonderfully good intentions, and for those occasional hiccups that occur during our gilded steps along the yellow brick road leading to happy ever after, we just need to re-frame our thinking and we'll be back up on our feet and heading in the right direction again faster than you can say "think and grow rich." But there's a dark cloud moving over the sunny side of the street. Americans, for all their training and encouragement to think positively, are not very happy people. A recent analysis of over 100 happiness surveys worldwide found Americans mired in 23rd place among developed nations. The Happy Planet Index puts the U.S. in 150th place worldwide. Americans are #1 in anti-depressants, they have more kids on Prozac and Ridalin than anyone in the world and pessimism about economic recovery is high, too. What's going on? Well, we can turn to the study of psychology for some clues. According to the leading-edge research emerging from Norberto Keppe's International Society of Analytical Trilogy in São Paulo, Brazil, the basic premise that we're well intentioned and good hearted people who occasionally screw up is being challenged. Exhausive clinical research and practical testing have shown a darker underbelly to the human psyche. And that is that we are much more pathological than that. We actually have many more desires against our development and happiness than we have believed or perceived, and positive thinking only serves to slip a thin veneer over this deeper trouble, and so only covers for a little while. Like painting over a water mark in the ceiling, the leak behind continues unaffected, causing more damage than if we'd gone to the problem in the first place. So it is with our psyches. And real understanding of this is well documented in Norberto Keppe's vast body of work. Our Trilogy portal offers a door into all of this if you're interested in exploring more. And I would highly recommend that. And all of Keppe's extraordinary work will be laid out from March 12 - 15, 2010 at our World Forum on psycho-socio-pathology, along with some planetary solutions, and I encourage you to get on my mailing list for updates on that. Today, professional broadcaster, Susan Berkley, joins me for what is not our first kick at the positive thinking can, but I feel it's very important to tackle this again.

He's also present in the minds of millions of young ones by the time December rolls around. The other is the definition of kindly. He's also bearded and all knowing. But here the comparison ends. Because, unfortunately for our souls, we don't remember Jesus all that well. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, the True Father of Christmas. Like many born in Christian countries perhaps, I grew up with a clear knowledge of the Nativity story. I even played the black Wise Man in my Sunday School's presentation many years ago where we used black shoe polish to tint my lily white skin. It was an unremarkable production probably that nobody but me and the odd other participant even remembers. But it was highly significant nonetheless because it was a version of a story that was being rehearsed and presented in churches large and small at around the same time all around the world. We were remembering in our humbel ways the true reason for Christmas. And that made it beautiful. I don't even know if they still go to all that trouble in St. Peter's Anglican Church in my hometown of Victoria, but I hope they haven't given in to the politically correct mania of excising all the Christian customs in an attempt to make the people from other cultures feel more at home. It is, after all, our customs that make us unique from other cultures. If I'm traveling in Europe, I'm not there to experience Canadian ways of life after all. The ideal is cultural diversity, isn't it? Not cultural homogenization. Like I never understood all those British tourists going to the south of Spain and requesting egg and chips. But this I'm talking about speaks to a bigger point, for it's not the customs only that are in peril. It's Christmas itself. Or at least the true Christmas, for the frantic, stressed, commercial, no-parking-in-sight one continues unabated. So let's try to explore the real Christmas spirit. And remember if we still can what the Being whose birthday we celebrate at this time was trying to teach us. At a time in our history when our latest Nobel Peace Prize recipient brazenly prepares us to accept war by stating that we would not see an end to violent conflict in our lifetimes and that he was unable to be guided by the powerful and peaceful examples of Martin Luther King and Gandhi, we can do no better than to call on the example of the greatest of Beings ... Jesus Christ. Today, musician and fellow teacher and researcher at the International Society of Analytical Trilogy, Gilbert Gambucci, and I will remember the true father of Christmas.

And the owners are the same big guys who chum around on boards and in secret clubs with the big money industries that get all the favorable press coverage. The influence on our information consumption is ghastly. And we have to wake up to that. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Media Literacy. Well, maybe for you this report will be old news. I have the distinct impression that you who listen to Thinking with Somebody Else's Head are not unconscious consumers of media. You look around, you seek out the alternative views, you pay attention to dissident points of view and you don't buy in to the bill of goods they're trying to sell us in what passes for most news coverage these days. But maybe there'll still be some statistics here to surprise you. I hope so anyway, because I believe that this issue of media influence, like political influence, being driven by the most powerful lobby groups and the dominant profit makers in our savagely capitalistic world, is one of the fundamental issues of our time. However, media criticism is as thick as the blackflies a Lake Manitou in Northern Ontario. And anyone with any capacity for independent thought knows enough to be somewhat wary. Still I don't think many people know the enormity of the problem yet. And here again, Dr. Norberto Keppe's science of Analytical Trilogy can provide an insightful and in-depth analysis. I was explaining in a recent teleclass how North America is a perfect breeding ground for the vast expansion of the military-industrial-pharmaceutical complex, which has taken root so strongly in no small part because of substantial spreading of its message by a mercenary and controlled media. The entrenchment of this destructive joint cartel has been possible in North America and around the world in varying degrees because of a psychological condition called "exteriorization." And this means the tendency to see our problems outside. If our disease comes from germs, we need the drug companies, who prey on that fear to make outrageous profits and sell vaccines and drugs by the ton. If the problem is terrorists, we need huge military spending to protect ourselves from those fanatics lurking behind every closed door. So we North Americans are a perfect market for selling things to protect us from the outside. Keppe's work is truly psychological in returning the human being to the true source of our difficulties and solutions: inside the psychological life of the human being. And by doing that, our society begins to change, too, and reflects this more mature interiorized wisdom. This, I can assure you, is being understood here in Brazil better than in any philosophical or spiritual or psychological orientation in the world today. As always, I'm available to steer you in the right direction if you'd like to learn more. rich@richjonesvoice.com for your comments and questions.

And indeed, our food philosophy used to be closer to common sense in the past. My parents, already a generation closer to nature than mine, taught me that the best thing you could put in your body was something you washed the dirt off before putting it in your mouth. But, oh my, how things have changed! Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Controlling our Food. It should be a no-brainer. The food we eat should be the closest thing to nature we can get. The whole alimentation industry should be based on that premise. But it's a long way from it. Now we've god hormones to make the birds and cows grow faster and with more meat. We've got pesticides and chemical fertilizers to the point where it's advisable to peel the apples before eating to avoid the greatest concentrations of these toxic substances. We've got additives for this, enriched minerals for that, our food is fortified and treated. We're surrounded by toxins and belly full of food whose nutritional value is highly suspect. There are many factors at play. We've built enormous industries of chemicals that make substantial profits for huge corporations. The fact that many of them are based on tycoons wanting to find uses for their industrial waste is not well understood by us. In fact, the pharmaceutical industry was established on the waste products from the oil and coal industries, which is why Rockefeller and Carnegie were so keenly interested in Pasteur's Germ Theory. They figured if they could get that theory accepted in the top medical schools in the land they'd have another almost endless source of profit. Heck, if every disease has a specific germ responsible for it, then you need a specific medicine for each germ - plus all the R&amp;D industry to go along with it. So they commissioned Abraham Flexner to do an exhaustive analysis of the medical education system in Canada and the U.S., and his Flexner Report changed totally how medicine was taught and perceived. Of course, the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations threw money at any medical research facility that focused on finding the germs responsible for a multitude of diseases old and new. And if these medical centers could dedicate themselves to creating a drug, a pharmaceutical medicine that could be created with coal and oil waste, well, here's more money for you! And quickly, medical education began to change. That was Mr. Pasteur who influenced that. But he caused a lot of damage in the food business, too. His introduction of paranoia into medicine led to the creation of artificial food - including plastic and chemical additives and processes that would ensure us we never got infected with any of those evil little bacteria. Monsanto was created in 1901 with exactly that intention, and they haven't stopped infecting our lives with beastly products and practices since. All of this is explained in Norberto Keppe's work of Analytical Trilogy, which is the science of showing us the source of our problems within, not without. And it is very valuable work to explore. rich@richjonesvoice.com if you'd like more information about any of Keppe's work. This Pasteurian craziness is at the basis of the Codex Alimentarius, too - a U.N. led attempt to categorize and control all foodstuffs. This gives a lot of preference to treated and genetically modified food over natural food, and this is very dangerous. Medical doctor and infectious diseases specialist, Dr. Roberto Giraldo, joins me today to discuss this theory.

These are things we take for granted most of the time. "That's just the way it is," we say, and we step out confidently upon that premise. But what extensive research and clinical study from Brazil is showing us is that we would do well to investigate a little deeper. Our thinking, it turns out, is not always our own. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Fathers of the Lie Part II. Last time on our program, Cesar Soós and I began our discussion about the leading thinkers who have had such an impact on our human civilization. And how their mistakes have led us collectively to the mess our modern society finds itself in today. We talked about Aristotle's monumental error of placing the senses as the determiner of knowledge. "Nothing comes to the mind which doesn't pass first through the senses," he asserted, thereby enshrining sensory, positivistic science as the lord of the domain. Aristotle's ideas were resisted for a few centuries, particularly by Augustine, who leaned more towards Plato's universality, and Anselm. But Aquinas, the great medieval theologian, brought Aristotle back to the forefront, and the battle was on. Francis Bacon, Descartes, Comte followed, and science changed from considering more metaphysical explanations for the origin of things to seeing all phenomena only in terms of their physical characteristics. Left in the wake as well were the moral or theological tenets of science, which thus became strictly materialistic. The Big Bang, the search for the particles that cause gravity or even intelligence and creativity, the destruction of material nature to get energy - all are consequences of this academic difference of opinion. Right away, we see that philosophy and theology have dramatically influenced science, which does not come solely from experimentation at all, as scientists would have us believe. Dr. Norberto Keppe's Analytical Trilogy is a more advanced science because it accepts the important discoveries and truths from philosophy and theology in its scientific postulates. Dr. Keppe was telling a group of us recently that Analytical Trilogy is a science that accepts and integrates what's true from all fields. And this is possible because of two things: Keppe's establishing of a true metaphysics on which to base an analysis of anything, and Keppe's clarification of what's going on in the human psyche, which causes us to misinterpret reality and put many inverted ideas into our theories. This is no small thing, and difficult to explain in entirety, so I encourage you to read Keppe's work to get a fuller view. Our portal at trilogia.ws will lead you in some interesting directions, and of course, I'm always available to steer you in the right direction at rich@richjonesvoice.com. On our last program, we showed how Freud and Darwin made crucial errors that have led society and science in the wrong direction totally. Today, I continue my fascinating discussion with Cesar Soós ... part 2 of Fathers of the Lie.

But knowing what the truth is, recognizing it when it pulls up alongside, ah, that's a little more difficult. Especially as our materialistic worldview would tell us that truth depends. And this idea of relative truth is a lie that comes to us from somebody else's head. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, the Fathers of the Lie. If you've been tuned in to our program for awhile now, you'll know that we're based on the science of Analytical Trilogy, which is trilogical because of its union of philosophy, science and spirituality. And this spiritual part is an important aspect of science that was for all intents and purposes cut out of scientific consideration with the rise of positivistic science in the middle of the 19th century. Auguste Comte, the father of Positivism, talked about the quest for truth going through 3 phases, with the theological being the first or, we could say, most primitive. The philosophical phase would be next, and the positivist the last, meaning the most mature. And this last phase states that we know the most when we base ourselves on actual sense experience. Right away, we can find some flaws with this view in that we know many things without having experience. Recent studies at Yale and Berkley suggest that little babies have working knowledge of basic arithmetic and physics principles as well as a well developed moral sense. And all of this with with no previous sensory experience. So, linking all our societal development to positivistic science bases us not on something superior, but inferior. And we desperately need the amalgamation again of science with philosophy and theology or spirituality, which is precisely what Keppe's work of Analytical Trilogy does. More about this expansive work can be found at our Trilogy portal, or write me by email for more information or observations or questions. Always great to hear from you. Our program today will be the first of two parts exploring how the inferior sensory-based science got so entrenched in our academic institutions - and our society in general. It's the result of a great lie perpetrated and followed by many great thinkers who were fooled into following the lie. And that lie has been inspired by the supreme liar in the Universe - Lucifer. And that's why reintroducing the 5000-year wisdom from Judeo-Christian theology is so important. Keppe knows this, and that's why I consider his science to be the most important science to be studied in the world today. Cesar Soós, one of our great Keppean metaphysics scholars at the International Society of Analytical Trilogy, is my guest today for the first part of Fathers of the Lie.

And we're vaccinating a significantly larger number of kids because of it. Many hospital boards and health care systems even link incentive pay for executives and directors to their pediatric immunization rates. But there's more than a conflict of interest going on here. Vaccinations, it appears, are downright dangerous. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Re-thinking Vaccines. Well, get ready to have your eyes opened. Dr. Roberto Giraldo has brought something very interesting to Brazil since moving here from New York City. Giraldo is a Colombian medical doctor with a speciality in infectious diseases and immunology. He's worked a lot with AIDS patients all over the world and has much to say about the inverted medical system he's worked in for over 40 years. And he's been talking lately with Dr. Norberto Keppe. Keppe is the scientist behind Analytical Trilogy, which is the science I base these programs on. And they've been talking incessantly about the bad science Louis Pasteur brought to the world, and the forgotten enius of Pasteur's contemporary, Antoine Béchamp. We'll explore that a little more in our program today. If you start investigating the vaccine business, you're in for quite an eye opener. First of all, be very clear about this: vaccinations are a business. Forget all the drug industry hype about protecting our children, this is a profit-based endeavor through and through. A couple of years ago, independent market analyst, Datamonitor, commissioned a report from a vaccine analyst - and who know there even was such a thing. Hedweg Kresse was her name, and in this report she discussed the future outlook for vaccine profits. Turns out she's predicting that the introduction of high priced vaccines will induce some rapid growth in the pediatric and adolescent vaccines market. She's predicting that that market's goint to quadruple by 2016 across the U.S., France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the U.K. and Japan. They're projecting it. That means they're going to make it happen. The crucial factor, what'll make these stupendous profits possible, is the "introduction of a product into national vaccination schedules." This means they're preparing product, and marketing it through highly paid lobbyists to government officials in these countries. And then slipped in ominously right after this comment is consultant Kresses' admission that this product introdution into national vaccination schedules virtually guarantees market expansion and high coverage rates in the target population. "Coverage rates." My God, the language. That means the numbers of people who are vaccinated. You can just imagine the directors of the vaccine companies hashing it out with flow charts and projection sheets. Talking about windows of opportunity and profit margins and return on investment. Kind of chills the blood, doesn't it? But you know what else guarantees that these new high priced vaccines are adopted by various national vaccination schedules? Reimbursements. That corporate speak for payments to directors of hospital boards and health care systems based on the immunization rates they achieve in their institutions. So they're paid bonuses if they increase immunizations. That doesn't leave a very warm feeling in my heart either. With all this need for marketing, it makes you wonder about the efficacy of the marketed product, doesn't it? Kind of like junk food lobbyists pushing for their product's inclusion in school lunch programs. It's "good business" but I'm pretty sure the kids aren't going to benefit all that much. And so it is with vaccines - a dubious medical procedure with little good science behind it. Now I know this is a shock. Anything that cuts directly against the prevailing point of view always raises the hackles of some. But vaccinations, like Pasteur's Germ Theory itself, is something that's been marketed - peddled actually - by some who stand to make a ton of money by p</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Philosophy,consciousness,metaphysics,physics,Analytical,Trilogy,Dr,Keppe,Keppe,quantum,physics,spirituality,education,economics,sociopathology</itunes:keywords><description>Vaccines have been sold as essential for our survival.

But hidden behind these strategies is a massive trap. Money, which is supposed to be a means, has become the ends. Today, capital is more important than your mother. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Redefining the Relationship Between Work and Capital. One of my students, a Director at a large European supermarket chain, was lamenting the plight of human beings after returning from his summer vacation in Europe. "People seem lost," he said. "They seem very far from the basics of life. Then he went on to make an interesting parallel. When he was a boy growing up on the French island of Martinique, he became fascinated with bee-keeping. He learned the basics from his dad, then began to branch out to develop his own bee hives. Marked by a strongly competitive nature and beset with the rivalry that commonly springs up between sons and fathers, he set out to see if he could overtake his father's honey production. He studied and researched the latest bee breeding techniques to learn how to maximize production, do more with less, ramp up his production to steroid-high levels without increasing his investment substantially. He imported queen bees from France and America, bred them with his local product, and very shortly achieved impressive spikes in production levels. He admits to feeling a certain power in this, a sensation that he was creating some kind of super bee that would lead the way to continuously higher quantities of honey. But his success was short-lived. Hybrid bees, it turns out, are much more fragile than natural ones. They bred quickly and produced a big jump in honey output over the short term, but were genetically weaker and more sensitive to fluctuations in environmental cycles. What's more, their breeding cycles were totally out of sync with nature's. Bees would breed robustly, then fly out of the hive looking for flowers to pollinate, and the flowers wouldn't be out yet. Over the long term, my student realized, mucking around with nature had disastrous - and expensive - side effects. In our discussion, we were making the connections between the philosophy underlying his desires to out-produce his father, and the mania in business today to produce ever increasing profits based on projections and stockholder demands rather than natural business cycles. "If I'm to have any possibility of meeting those imposed financial goals," he told me, "Something's going to have to give. I'm going to have to take shortcuts somewhere - with employee relations or salary limits or even business ethics." So look at that dilemma. We're all twisted up inside because of exactly this struggle. Our megalomania causes us to impose our will on natural cycles so much, bending and twisting and changing everything to fit with our "getting more for less" philosophy, that we completely screw up the greater system. And then, oh, do we suffer! Because it's hard, sometimes impossible, to find our way back. Wasn't that lament exactly what Dante was articulating when he wrote, "Half-way upon the journey of our lives, I roused to find myself within a dark wood, for the straight way had been lost." This program based on Brazilian psychoanalyst and social scientist, Norberto Keppe's science of Analytical Trilogy, is an attempt to help us find the straight way again. I am always open to hearing from you about these themes. rich@richjonesvoice.com Today, we'll focus in on how much we've strayed off the path and gotten all twisted around in economics. My colleague and fellow teacher, Sofie Bergqvist, joins me today to provide some illumination provided through Keppe's book, Work and Capital.

Schumann called music the language that permits us to converse with the beyond. Artists carve mythology into stone and record history on canvas. So maybe it is true that through art all men are saved. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Art and Transcendence. Whenever any of my colleagues here at the International Society of Analytical Trilogy bring art and esthetics as a classroom subject, the energy changes in the room. The students, often tired and stressed out after long days, perk up and something beautiful happens. In fact, one of my good friends down here, Helena Mellander from Sweden, a very gifted singer, was recently giving a lecture to a select group of human resources professionals down here in Brazil about the leading edge strategies for dealing with stress that are emerging out of Dr. Keppe's science of Analytical Trilogy, and as part of her lecture, she sang a couple of songs. Well, let me tell you, it had a magnificent impact. Everyone felt it - the combination of knowledge/reason, and feeling/intuition. "There are certain moments that come along where your life is different afterwards," said one participant. "This was one of those moments for me." Art and spirituality go hand-in-hand. Well, they used to anyway. Consciously. But spirituality is always present with great art of any discipline. Keppe has always recognized this, and has written that art and esthetics is the basis of civilization. And incidentally, I'm writing this as I'm preparing to head off to our 6th Festival of the Arts at our Grande Hotel Trilogia in Cambuquira, Brazil this weekend. There are some wonderful things happening there that I'll be letting you know more about as time goes on. Our initiatives there are serving to bring the place to life, and it's been let go for many years, so we are witnessing a great comeback now. It's in a beautiful part of Brazil, nestled among coffee plantations, the verdant Atlantic Forest and some of the best mineral waters on the planet. It's a forgotten town in a jewel of a setting, but it's receiving new lifeblood now. As always, you can get me anytime by email if you want to know anything more about everything we are doing down here: rich@richjonesvoice.com, and I'm always happy to hear from you.

He was one of the most celebrated scientists of his time, and a giant in medical circles even today. He supposedly proved the Germ Theory of disease, the basis of most medical education. But Louis Pasteur's science was highly questionable. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Debunking the Germ Theory of Disease. Well, we are entering sacred territory today on our program. Pasteur's ideas have been sacrosanct for at least a century, and all significant medical research is based on his proposals. The multi-billion dollar industry that is cancer, AIDS and numerous other disease research initiatives if firmly entrenched in our western world, as is the powerful pharmaceutical industry, and even the areas of immunology and vaccination. Not much of modern medicine is untouched by Pasteur's influence. But in looking at his life, you enter a world of subterfuge, deception and just plain wrong conclusions that were cynically adopted by Carnegie and Rockefeller in the U.S. and used to influence medical research and education in most of the developed world. And for one distinct purpose - to sell pharmaceuticals that there were developing form the waste products from their coal and oil industries. That's right ... there were serious ulterior motives at play in the promotion of Pasteur's questionable scientific conclusions. Not the first time this has happened of course. Henry Ford was instrumental in leading the move in America for the creation of the suburbs. "We shall solve the city problem by leaving the city," he stated, thereby combining his social vision with his economic self-interest. You can sell a lot more cars if people are commuting back and forth for miles every day. This blatant manipulation for economic reasons is not new to us, is it? Were any of us surprised to find former vice-president Dick Cheney's company, Halliburton, picked to lead the re-building of Iraq shortly after its former CEO pushed so hard for the war that would necessitate the re-building? But what may surprise you is that there was an entirely different scientific view than Pasteur's being elaborated at the same time - in total opposition to Pasteur's ideas - and this science is the more certain one, as proven by research in many locations, including our International Society of Analytical Trilogy here in Brazil. And, of course, 2500 years of Chinese medicine. That more complete science came from the formidable research of French biologist and medical doctor, Antoine Bechamp, and who has ever heard of him? Incredible, isn't it? His work is far more in line with Dr. Keppe's studies in psychosomatic medicine, and this truly deserves our attention today. As always, you can check out all of our work on our Trilogy portal site, or email me anytime and I'll guide you in the right direction so you can learn more about Norberto Keppe's great science. Today, medical doctor and infectious disease specialist, Dr. Roberto Giraldo joins me to talk about Bechamp's lost but important science.

You'll hear loads about purpose, about forming habits, about listening and motivating and focus. And we read the books and watch the videos and pop in the CDs on the commute to work. We do the visioning they recommend, we pay for the coaching. But we're missing one important understanding. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, the Psychological Habits of Highly Successful People. This is a follow-up to a Podcast I produced a month or so ago with psychoanalyst, Leo Lima. Leo joins me again today to penetrate a little deeper into this area of success. To be honest, this is not something we understand well in North America actually. For all our focus and purported reverence for it, I think we just feel, frankly, traumatized by the subject - or at least by the focus on only one aspect of success, that being the financial/fame aspect of it. We've had decades of Dale Carnegie and Napoleon Hill and the thousands of others with the recipe for success, and if we haven't achieved it within those narrow parameters, don't you think we start to feel a little desperate? Either that or we just check out completely, look at it all with an ironic and disparaging gaze, host another martini or hug another tree and congratulate ourselves for living a balanced life far from the craziness of the corporate climb. But this misses the point, too. Because there is something to all this success stuff. We don't have all this focus on it for no reason. The problem is we're asking the wrong questions. Instead of worrying about what we need to do to achieve success, what time management system we need to adopt or what habits we need to strengthen, we need to understand a metaphysical point: success is natural to the human being. We are made for this already. It's not something we need to build or reinforce - although there is certainly work and effort and discipline required. The whole thing is much more subtle and profound than that. We have all we need to operate at maximum capacity already. But we have attitudes - psychopathology in Norberto Keppe's language - against that capacity. This is some pretty revolutionary research that's being revealed from the International Society of Analytical Trilogy in Brazil where I produce these programs. And the content of Thinking with Somebody Else's Head arrives from these pioneering discoveries about the psychological and spiritual state of the human being. Our psyche, it turns out, has been understood, and its comprehension through Dr. Norberto Keppe's science leads us to far different conclusions than the vast bulk of published material that graces the book shelves and TV talk shows up to now. This makes Keppe's work among the most vital knowledge available on the planet today, which you'll hear in a moment. Keppe divulges all of his wisdom in over 30 books that contribute significantly to the intellectual treasury of mankind. You can explore those on our Trilogy portal site. I'd also like to invite you to participate with us in our call-in psychology show, Healing Through Consciousness. Dr. Claudia Bernhardt Pacheco, vice-president of Keppe's International Society of Analytical Trilogy, joins me every week to take your calls and questions about specific areas of your life that you'd like some clarification on. We record every Monday at 2:00 pm ET - through Skype. Healingthroughconsciousness is our Skype name, so just enter us in your Skype contact list and you're set to go. Joneshealing@gmail.com is our email address if you prefer to be more anonymous. So today, I asked Leo Lima to join me again to continue our discussion about success.

Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, let's take a critical look at the Swine Flu. We're very impacted by inverted science, as we've explored many times on this program. Scientists since Pasteur see all sorts of nefarious things in the microbes swimming in their Petri dishes. We have vaccines for this, medicines for that, radical radiation treatments to kill this and that disease. But we miss a key point when we look down at the microbic level to find the source of our maladies, and that is that disease doesn't really come from that level. Our materialistic philosophy introduced by Aristotle's great inversion that we understand reality through the senses has led us deeper and deeper into the quirks and quarks, and further and further from the universal understanding that Aristotle's master, Plato, suggested was inside us. "Infused science" he called it, saying we were born with it. Brazilian psychoanalyst and social scientist, Norberto Keppe, agrees with that. He talks about the universal concepts we possess. "Divine concepts inside the human being," is how he puts it. And this corrects Aristotle's metaphysical error: the lesser things don't create the greater, we could say. Meaning tiny viruses could never really CAUSE our maladies. They're there many times, but what lets them take hold is something bigger - the state of our psychological lives, which directly affects our immune system. Dr. Roberto Giraldo is a Colombian doctor, a specialist in internal medicine with a major in infectious diseases and clinical tropical medicine, and he's perhaps a perfect guy to talk about this. He works with AIDS and cancer patients all over the world, and he doesn't believe much in the Swine Flu scare.

The comments flow endlessly from book titles and magazine articles. Our predominating materialistic world view limits our discussion of it to fields of money or fame. But as our defining economic structure crumbles before our very eyes, we'd be well advised to try to redefine it. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Re-defining Success. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you of our other radio project ... a new show I'm developing with Dr. Claudia Bernhardt Pacheco, a frequent contributor here, called Healing Through Consciousness. This is a program focused on offering advice and counseling to you for any problems or difficulties that you want help with. We regularly take calls and emails to delve deeper into those difficult problems that you haven't been able to solve or get on top of. All the information about how to participate is on our site. Or feel free to write me anytime: rich@richjonesvoice.com There is much exciting and important emerging from the Brazilian school of Analytical Trilogy, the science I base these programs on. Our radio programs develop and spread those ideas, so do take the time to find out more. You'll be glad you did. We've approached the idea of success in a popular Thinking with Somebody Else's Head program way back in January of 2007, but I'd like to come at it again, this time from a little more metaphysical point of view. We're very limited in talking about success today because of the economic bias we bring to any discussion on the subject. From the Forbes List to winners on the Apprentice, we give a lot of airtime to success defined by an extremely narrow range of parameters. And that makes us very shallow and it deteriorates our cultural and even intellectual experience. Lily Tomlin expressed it well when she said, "Sometimes I worry about being a success in a mediocre world." Amen, Ms. Tomlin. What's the value of that? But there is a hunger for more. There has to be. Tell me there is. It's why I'm putting all this energy and time into this Podcast. Actually, we see evidence that people are seeking more in the acceptance of Norberto Keppe's TV show around the world - and Keppe's show is the polar opposite of the completely irrelevant discourse that defines today's TV talk show. And there's more evidence, too, in the worldwide acceptance flowing to Britain's Got Talent winner, Susan Boyle, an ordinary, anything but the usual collagen-lipped, air-brushed, made-by-marketing, limited talent wonder we're normally spoon-fed by our mediocrity-addicted media. We're hungry for authenticity. I often think of Keppe's Analytical Trilogy like the water of truth on our parched earth. So let's look at success in that light today.

Tulipmania was in full swing in the 1600s, and it looked much like the dotcom madness of the 1990s. It crashed eventually, of course, but caused little lasting damage. Could the same thing be true today? Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, the Stock Market Crash's Silver Lining. Of course, it should be pointed out that in all the madness surrounding the trade in rare and exotic tulip bulbs, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange never got in on the deal. Madness it was, with speculators brokering deals in taverns and bars, and some bulbs changing hands 10 times in a day. It's not much of a stretch to fast forward to images of amateur day-traders hunched over PCs and trying to make fast cash on gambling that kozmo.com stock prices will go down at some time in the future. But the big difference between 1636 and 2008 is that our stock markets, from the Nasdaq to the Nikkei, are heavily involved. And so today's worldwide stock market crash is marked by at least 2 things that distinguish it from the Holland of the 1600s: 1. It's worldwide 2. It's having a big impact on the economy Could there really be anything good about this? Well, not if you're looking at the situation form a traditional point of view. But the economic view of someone who understands the psyche of the human being and the distortions of society that spring from that psyche can shine a lot of light on the situation. This can help us see what's going on from a new perspective, and can even lead the way to correcting our distrotion and setting society on the right track again. We've looked at this aspect of the impact of Man's psyche on society in a number of our podcasts, and I encourage you to look through the Thinking with Somebody Else's Head archives for those. I can steer you in the right direction, of course, at rich@richjonesvoice.com Gilbert Gambucci has been studying Brazilian psychoanalyst Dr. Norberto Keppe's economic viewpoint on all this for the past couple of months and is putting together a blog to explore many of Dr. Keppe's ideas - especially as they relate to society. That blog - featuring great video of Keppe - is at www.promiseland.info. Check it out. Gilbert joins me today to explore the silver lining behind the crash of the stock market.

But it's the less well-known stories that make us catch our breath. The quiet, intelligent teenager down the street who overdoses. The cousin who doesn't make it through rehab. The childhood friend who gets in with the wrong crowd and is shot in a drug deal gone sour. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Drugs and Power. It's been awhile since I've posted an episode of TWSEH. I've been busy with a new and related project to let you know about ... a live radio call-in show I've been conducting with Dr. Claudia Bernhardt Pacheco, vice-president of the International Society of Analytical Trilogy here in São Paulo. Claudia's a much in-demand Trilogical psychoanalyst with extensive international experience in treating all manner of human relationship, health, work and personal issues. My idea for the past copule of years has been to create a forum where she and I could take live calls from listeners and offer our unique perspective on the problem. You see, I receive many emails from listeners to this Podcast asking specific questions about problems or difficulties. There's the young woman from the Balkans who's terrified of AIDS. The young guy in the Pacific Northwest who's concerned about his inability to stop sabotaging his relationships. The 2 brothers who struggle with depression. I help them as much as I can - I do special Podcasts on the themes, I write personally to all who write to me, I suggest books and other resources. But I cannot do what a psychoanalyst trained by Dr. Norberto Keppe can do. Keppe's science of Analytical Trilogy is vast, and provides an analysis of the human psyche that no one - not Freud or Klein or Jung or Rogers, any of them - was able to accomplish. And that means that when this science is applied in a therapeutic way to personal or social issues, the analysis that emerges is right on the target. And that's what we want to do with this live call-in radio show. We're calling the program, Healing Through Consciousness, and all the information is on our site at www.healingthroughconsciousness.com, or of course you can email me at rich@richjonesvoice.com. This show is a marvellous opportunity to get some real overview of your problems or issues or questions about anything. So do join us. Our Podcast today is taken from our program actually, and entails Dr. Claudia's long response to a listener's question, about ... drugs. That enormous social problem. And the war on drugs? Welll, that's a deceiving name. Anyone who saw Ridley Scott's American Gangster film saw the movement of drugs into the U.S. from the Vietnam War. Afghanistan opium production climbed back to 96% of the world production after the American-led invasion there after 9/11. In some circles, the introduction of hallucinogenic drugs into the changing consciousness of the '60s was a direct plan to subvert that idealistic movement. And then there's the CIA's Bluebird Project to remember - a planned study to analyze the effect of drugs on mind control ... and we can imange what's happened with all that research. So when the question came up on our Healing Through Consciousness show, Dr. Pacheco jumped right into the heat of it. She's no stranger to the issue in truth, having published a searing critique of the role of governments and so-called law enforcement agencies in organized drug trafficking back in the late '80s. The American Drug Multinational she called it, and it pulled no punches. And Claudia didn't pull any punches in how she answered our caller's question either.

On top of a recession, it's hardly good news. We've been warned about this for at least 30 years, but we've been dinosaur slow in adapting to the warnings. Obama's got his New Energy for America Plan ... but is it possible we're too late to change? Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, The Keppe Motor: Revolutionizing Science, Technology and Energy. You know, sometimes there's so much happening at our International Society of Analytical Trilogy in São Paulo, Brazil, I literally don't know where to begin to bring you up to speed. The revolutionary discoveries and landmark psycho and sociological wisdom emerging from this Brazilian school of Analytical Trilogy founded by Dr. Norberto Keppe are impressive. Dr. Keppe's TV show is now being aired in 45 countries and 221 channels worldwide. Episodes of this podcast have been downloaded over 250,000 times. Our newspaper here has a weekly circulation of 50,000. Dr. Keppe's clinic is one of the largest private clinics in Latin America and is home to ground-breaking work in psychosomatic medicine coordinated by Dr. Claudia Pacheco - a frequent contributor to Thinking with Somebody Else's Head and my co-host on an upcoming live Internet radio call-in show on bbsradio.com beginning March 10, 2009 at 10:00 a.m. ET. Well, there's lots more to say, but you get the picture I'm sure. This is a hot-bed of the newest research into human potential and psychological science. And it's rock-solid stuff, let me assure you. No matter what area you want to enter - relationships, health, money, corruption and power, the arts - you'll find a persepective here that is new, fresh, provocative, and causes us to re-think most of what we think we know. In a good way. Check out our portal site to get an overview of some of what we're doing: www.trilogia.ws Maybe the hottest development here these days is the Keppe Motor, a light-years development in the capturing of free, essential energy. Let's find out all about that, and something about the revolutionary new physics principles behind it, too, with one of the inventors, engineer Cesar Soos. Click here to listen to this episode.

Actually, nearly every major figure in the history of philosophy has weighed in on the topic somewhere in their work. Free will ... the capacity of rational agents to choose a course of action from among various alternatives. Is the issue really that complicated? Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Liberating ourselves from our free will. Well, Hume was right. The issue of the free will is contentious. And I'll be diving into the controversy, too, in a moment. A fascinating subject. But first, a number of you have been writing to ask that I let you know about the new call-in radio show I'm launching with world-renowned author and psychoanalyst, Dr. Claudia Pacheco. I'm not surprised there's so much interest. You who've been listening to this Podcast over the past year and a half must've come to appreciate the clarity and wisdom of the science behind this show. It's called Analytical Trilogy, and it's not an easy science to encapsulate in a sentence or two. Analytical Trilogy is essentially a union of theology, philosophy and science that gives us a comprehensive view of the psychology of the human being and the reflections of this human psychology on the greater social structures we live within. Our political structures, our wars, our education systems of lack thereof, our environmental challenges ... all have their birthplace inside the human psyche. And no one in history has clarified that better than the man behind Analytical Trilogy, Dr. Norberto Keppe. Whether it be something every psychologist or human potential workshop leader has weighed in on - like depression or self-esteem or self-sabotage - or something no one talks about - like the psychology behind the pathology of power - when we turn the Trilogical lens on the topic, you hear a perspective you've never heard before. And it lands. It feels right. It just "makes sense," as many of you writing to me have confirmed. And we'll be doing that kind of analysis, live, with Dr. Pacheco and I taking your calls and emails and answering your concerns personally. Can you imagine how impactful that will be? So, I'd like to keep you informed about that. We're projecting our first show to be on Mar. 10 at 10 a.m. ET (NY time) on BBS Radio - bbsradio.com But do get on my mailing list to stay informed: rich@richjonesvoice.com. Looking forward to hearing from you. Now, today, liberty and our free will. You know, we in the western world have this idea that we're really free, and that we're also really quite socially evolved. We have recycling programs in place, we're advanced in our social programs. And we also think that we're super tolerant and welcoming of all other points of view and cultural traiditons. Well, certainly we have that idea in Canada. We pride ourselves on our open-mindedness. But underneath our politically correct external persona, there is a high degree of censorship and intransigence. And all that means we're not really so accepting after all of ideas and philosophies that stray from what we perceive as our superior beliefs and ways of doing things. Go against that, and you'll find you're not really free to give that opinion. Sofie Bergqvist is a Swedish educator and lecturer and translator of a number of Norberto Keppe's books, and she joins me today. Click here to listen to this episode.

The rhetoric-loaded speeches that gave us goosebumps. The hand-on-the-heart pledges that promised to lead us out of the darkness. The words from the speechwriters are scarily simple to speak. But after we're all softened up, after we're primed for change, we usually get ... more of the same. Will it really be different this time? Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Obama: Hope and Virtue. Well, this is a topic I'm more than a little interested in. Hey, I'm a product of the '60s. I've still got a little of that revolutionary flame burning in me. The same flame that burned bright for a decade or so before it dimmed in the face of assassinations and Watergate and too many strange chemicals in our bloodstreams. And, of course, the "greed-is-good" mantra intoned in stock market boardrooms that carried the promises of easy money and double-digit returns on investment to any where were quick enough to jump on the bandwagon. And now that has played itself out and revealed itself to be nothing more than what we should have known it was from the beginning - and empty promise. Empty, why? Because it was based on an inverted philosophy: that it was good - even possible - to get something for nothing. You know, the scientific discoveries that I base this program on have a powerful finality: they allow us to analyze what's going on in us and our world through a clarifying lens, and that lens is a profound understanding of the human psyche and our society, which is, after all, just a reflection of what is going on inside of us. And through this science we can conclude that life, it turns out, is not a confounding conundrum or unsolvable riddle at all. Some conclusions have been reached about us and the universe we inhabit, and those conclusions have arrived through the work of an extraordinary scientist, Brazilian psychoanalyst and social scientist, Dr. Norberto Keppe. I've been exploring this on these podcast for the past year and a half, and I'll be expanding my discussions of Keppe's synthesizing work of Analytical Trilogy - a bringing together of science with philosophy and theology - in a new Internet radio show that I'll be launching in mid-March, 2009 with Dr. Claudia Pacheco. This'll be a live call-in show where we'll address specific problems and questions brought by callers and those who write to us. This will give you a first-hand look at how Keppe's Analytical Trilogy sees the human condition and the society we live in. Get on the mailing list to be kept informed of that: rich@richjonesvoice.com Keppe's perspective on our problems is refreshing and clarifying, as you'll know if you've been listening regularly to this program. And one of the things he noted right away when he moved to New York in the early '80s was the incredible decadence the country had fallen into. Every area was in decline, and this was being hidden by the appearances of prosperity that were being given off by the enticing profits on Wall St. A lustre we now know to have been polished by considerable deception and smoke and mirrors. Keppe warned us of this at the time - warned us that moving away from ethics and goondess and beauty would continue to bring disaster. And now we're smack in the middle of the crisis he predicted. And Obama seems to be hip to that, admitting that we need to be more responsible, more ethical, get back to work. We need to "put aside childish things," as he put it. I'm joined by a couple of American today, and together we'll look at Obama's promise of hope and virtue through the lens of Analytical Trilogy. Click here to listen to this program.

We've got massive foreclosures and forecasts of trillion dollar deficits. Our kids have A.D.D. Everything we touch causes cancer. And our football team missed the playoffs. Again. No doubt about it ... living in the 21st century is bringing a lot of stress. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, we'll dig deeper into what really causes our stress ... and more importantly, how a therapeutic science from Brazil can help us finally understand and deal with our admittedly stressful world. Here at the beginning of 2009, we have a pretty bleak outlook. Well, it's time to offer an anti-dote to all that. Some hope, if you will. And the moment I say that I realize how trite it sounds to our jaded ears. We've heard it all before, haven't we? This book, that 10-steps-to-a-greater-you, this magic pill. We're caught between wanting something to believe in and having been disappointed so many times we've stopped believing. Almost. We're cynical, sardonic, ironic as hell. But one of the problems is that we've been looking too much outside ourselves for resolution. It's tough to resolve our essential problem out there because the source of our difficulties lies inside here. And what we're exploring on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, what forms the basis of all our work at the International Society of Analytical Trilogy here in São Paulo, Brazil is a comprehensive science that gives us the consciousness needed to treat those inner demons. Norberto Keppe's Analytical Trilogy is a union of theology, philosophy and science that really fills in the blanks of our understanding of ourselves and the world we live in. As a listener wrote recently, "Keppe's greater principles make a great deal of sense." And sense is what we'd like to continue bringing in 2009. Let's try to make sense of stress today. We have a lot of if in our world. Helena Mellander is a Swedish journalist working in our Trilogical companies here in Brazil, and she's also been working for some months now to develop some deep health programs for companies based on Keppe's work. One of the principal reas of concern in these workshops is dealing with stress. Click here to listen to this episode.

We send out the cards with the heartfelt wishes for peace and goodwill. We sometimes sing the songs. But the desires for peace on earth and remembrances of the real meaning have long been obscured in the frustration of finding a blasted parking spot. Joyous Christmas time is not much of that anymore. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, let's re-visit the True Meaning of Christmas. I remember in my youth waiting for the Christmas spirit. That elusive feeling of peace and spirituality that would kick in at some point in the holiday season. It could be a cold evening visit from a group of carollers that did it. Or a visit from a much-loved but little-seen relative. Or maybe Scrooge's transformation in the annual family viewing of Dickens' A Christmas Carol. And now I'm dating myself, aren't I? It even starts to sound like I'm talking about the 19th Century! But it was something that did take over at some point: the Christmas spirit. For a short time, all would really be calm, all would really be bright. But around 2:00 pm on Christmas Day, we'd all start to feel the restlessness kick in. No stores to go to. Nothing open. Nothing to do. Actually, maybe that's why they instituted Christmas Day NBA games. Everyone just go too bored. And I don't think it's any coincidence either that the 26th - Boxing Day in Canada - is the biggest sales day of the year in my country. People are so jumpy they'll start lining up at 5:30 in the cold morning to be the first to slap credit cards on the counter to get the deeply discounted Blu-Ray DVD player or next year's Christmas wrap. But let's try to return today if we can to remember the true spirit of Christmas. Let's see if we can't overcome our materialism a little to have a new spirit this year - and one that is much needed. Dr. Norberto Keppe's Analytical Trilogy gives us a beautiful perspective - a theological, philosophical and even scientific insight into what should be our most precious and spiritual time of the year.

Those raised on the French philosophy of Sartre and Voltaire might lay the blame at the feet of society. More existential thinking would point the finger at individual responsibility. But only Norberto Keppe's new science gives us the tools to do a more complete analysis. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, we'll look at the roots of our destruction, and what we have to know about ourselves in order to stop, which is the crux of the thing, isn't it? I'm Richard Lloyd Jones. Well, one of the very clear problems we run into when tackling the issue of what's going on these days is that we always wind up in the same place. There's this theory over here, that one over there, 3 more somewhere in the middle. How in the world does the ordinary citizen make sense of it all? There are so many problems in so many areas. The Comptroller General of the U.S. shocks us on 60 Minutes by talking about fiscal cancer and all that entails. Al Gore's excellent documentray warns us that the catastrophic deep freeze produced by special effects wizards in The Day After Tomorrow movie could actually happen. Fanatics talk about Divine retribution. You can get an earful in whichever direction you turn. But is there any way to boil all this chaos and crisis down to something chewable? Is there any way to point to an overarching and principal problem? And perhaps more importantly, if there is a defining explanation, can it also offer us a solution or two? I think "yes" on all those counts. You see, our difficulties begin in our way of seeing and relating to the world. We and the society we live in are products of what's going on in our philosophies of life, in our psyches. And there's one point from which we must start in considering this: we are not the latest editions of the human species standing on the most recent rung of the evolutionary ladder. We're not like software upgrades - the latest version with considerable improvements over Zinzanthropus Man from several million years ago. This is a key aspect of Brazilian psychoanalyst, Norberto Keppe's work: that we have all perfection inside us. As nature is complets, so are we. Our problem is that we deny and even destroy what we are. This makes our problem not one of not having arrived, of not knowing any better. No. It's more serious. We know what is right, what we should do individually and collectively to have a better world, to have the paradise we should live in. We know ... but we don't do it. This is something deep inside the human psyche, which is why it took a psychoanalyst to discover it. Dr. Norberto Keppe's work is totally about helping us understand this dynamic. And it's what we explore all the time in this Podcast. And what we'll be expanding into an Internet radio show coming in January. Make sure you get on the mailing list to be informed about that: rich@richjonesvoice.com That show will be conducted with psychoanalyst, Dr. Claudia Pacheco, who joins me on today's podcast as well.

After all, we go to the gym to keep our bodies toned, we go to the driving range. Why wouldn't we do something to address those psychological glitches that pop up in all of us? But what do we do when our whole society is showing signs of breakdown? Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, we'll try to put "society on the couch". But a couple of things first. I always appreciate hearing from you. Your feedback is really helpful in helping me shape the program, so don't hesitate if you've got a point or a question to raise. I'm always available - rich@richjonesvoice.com. If it takes me a day or two to get back to you, hang in. I'm getting to it. If you've listened to the Podcast for awhile, you'll know Dr. Claudia Pacheco very well. She's a frequent contributor here and frankly is indispensable to this program - and indeed to everything we are doing down here in Brazil at the International Society of Analytical Trilogy. Well, Claudia and I are working on something really interesting ... a live, Internet call-in radio program which we're targeting to launch in January 2009. Make sure you're on the mailing list to learn more - rich@richjonesvoice.com What this'll be is an online advice show with Claudia, who has 25 years of experience in Norberto Keppe's Analytical Trilogy - to my mind, the most innovative, effective and powerful form of psychoanalysis on the planet. Anyone who's got any experience with Trilogical analysis knows the experience of taking a long-standing issue to a session and getting a completely fresh take on it from the analyst. "Wow! I never saw it that way before," is a common comment. Keppe's Analytical Trilogy goes to the root of the problem, which is always something deep inside us, hidden from view. This is true deep psychology, often helping us see clearly for the first time long-standing issues that have been blocking us from achieving what we feel we have the potential to achieve. And who doesn't feel that? And after Norberto Keppe himself, Dr. Claudia Pacheco is the best in the world at helping people at this deep level. So this radio program will be very cool. To have a chance to listen to her weekly will be a great opportunity to address some of the core issues of human beings ... and you'll be able to call in personally with individual questions and issues. We're calling the program "Healing Through Consciousness", and we're both pretty excited about it. Make sure you get on the mailing list. We'll keep you updated. You know, we've had a lot of response to the last 3 podcasts looking at the roots of the economic crisis. A few thousand downloads of those programs - giving a pretty loud message that people are looking for some answers, some ways to understand what is going on. One of the applications of Keppe's work is in the area of social psychology - analyzing the society as we would a person's neurosis. And why not? The corporation's been given the same rights as a human being through some decision of Congress way back along the way. As the Federal Reserve - a mostly private institution - was created by Congress back in the early 1900s, even though they had no constitutional basis to do so. So why wouldn't we hold society's systems up to scrutiny? In fact, we must. I noticed in the N.Y. Times earlier this week that European and North American political leaders admit they may not be willing to fulfill their commitments to cap harmful carbon emissions or phase out polluting factories because of the slumping economy. A European Commission spokeswoman said, "Investing in reducing emissions is more difficult to do in times of economic downturn." This is simply hard to believe, isn't it? How in 2008 can we make decisions based on profits over the environment? Hard to believe unless you understand about Inversion, Keppe's seminal psychological discovery.

A change in Madonna’s marital status, too … for what that’s worth. Not that those last 2 mean much. And whether the first is truly meaningful remains to be seen, doesn’t it? One thing is clear, though … there’s not much change in the economic picture. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else’s Head, we’ll continue our series looking at the causes of the economic crisis. Well, after a historic day at the polls, America has woken up to the same scary reality as before. Jobless rates are up, stock prices are generally down … well, you know the story. Some of you much better than me, actually. But what I’ve been trying to do in this series of podcasts over the past few weeks is investigate some of the reasons for the mess. And I don’t mean in terms of explaining how the sub-prime mortgage market suddenly went south. No. But one thing I can help with is getting at the causes of all this. This is no small feat, in reality, and can be done because of the expansive work done on the subject at the Brazilian school of Analytical Trilogy founded by Dr. Norberto Keppe. Look, one of the hardest things about trying to get a handle on what’s really going on is the style of the media. You watch CNN or CBS, and you get volumes of information. Analysis of the sub-prime aspect, reporting of G-20 meetings with ex-president Bush (and man, does it feel good to say ex-president Bush) … you get opinions and policies and figures, and spin, glorious spin. But it’s extremely difficult to pick your way through the information. It’s always been like this. In our Information Age, we’re bombarded with information but starving for perspective. You have to know how to understand all this, and I don’t mean in the sense of being able to debate economic policy - the benefits of government stimulus packages over tighter regulations and broader oversight, or vice versa. No, there’s got to be an overall view to be had. And it’s exactly here that Norberto Keppe’s work does what was before him very hard to do. Because of his success at mapping the human psyche, Keppe was also able to apply those findings to the society as a whole - verifying that what the human being does outside he first does inside himself. That our external social structures are simply the reflection of ways of seeing the world, of philosophies and biases and often questionnable reasoning. One of Keppe’s landmark discoveries is that we are inverted. We act against our nature now in favor of our inverted values. “Cash flow is more important than your mother,” as one Wall Street broker termed it. This Inversion stems from inside us. I want to start there today because understanding our psyche leads to understanding our society. And that means putting the finger on causes, so that we can take real steps to change, not just rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic.

Markets are down, foreclosures are up. Shanty towns are springing up in southern California. We’re officially in recession, it appears. And what got us here varies depending on which side of the political argument you listen to. The only problem with that is … it’s a little difficult to get at the real root causes. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else’s Head, let’s try to understand it a little better in the second in our series of what’s going on Behind the Economic Crisis. Depending on how long you’ve been listening to Thinking with Somebody Else’s Head, you may or may not know that our work here is based on the extraordinary discoveries of Brazilian psychoanalyst and social scientist, Norberto Keppe. In a profound series of books he wrote in the 1980s, he essentially created a new branch of social science called “social pathology.” This was the application of his psychological assessment, analysis and treatment of the human psyche to the greater society in which we live. Our society, he determined, is a reflection of the unrecognized parts of our individual psychological reality. “The cycle is centuries old,” he wrote. “Man creates an increasingly sick society as he is increasingly sickened by it.” This awareness occurred shortly after he moved to New York at the request of a number of professors and academics to introduce his work there. He went expecting American ingenuity and “can-do” attitude to take his work,and spread it worldwide, as they did with everything else - from Breton Woods economic policies to pop music. But he encountered a country in trouble. “America has stopped working,” he noted. America was not producing anymore and was instead content to sit back and let the 3rd world do the work while they applied themselves to making money with money; that the U.S. was exploiting the globalization of the desire for a piece of the American Dream they’d so artfully perpetrated, stimulated and fed to chain everyone else to pulling the sled while they rode along behind, sucking up the profits. Keppe saw psychological Inversion in the creation of an economic system that rewarded a company with increased stock prices for lowering costs by farming out production to Asian sweatshops. He saw a psychological condition in the hunger for power and money and consumer goods that was causing us to destroy the planet in our insatiable desire for more, more, more. The three books I mentioned earlier were, and continue to be, extraordinarily astute and prophetic - Decay of the American People (and the U.S.), which we discussed in our last episode of Thinking with Somebody Else’s Head, Liberation of the People: the Pathology of Power, and Work and Capital. These books discussed, analyzed and clarified the psychopathology of the human being that was manifesting in the social structures we had created. This was something remarkable for the time, and remains so even today. You’ll find those books totally relevant in today’s situation. Like they were written yesterday. Write me for more information: rich@richjonesvoice.com What Keppe noticed was the break in our social structures had made from our essential nature. From philosophy, Keppe knew that the essence of life was goodness, truth and beauty. At the same time, being successful in society often meant going against those values. We can’t suggest, for example, that the richest and most powerful among us got that way by acting like Mother Theresa or Albert Schweitzer. And we the people have bought into it all big time. We all want to throw our money into the stock market and see it double or triple or at least bring in 10 or 15% returns. And for doing what, exactly? As Warren Buffett has noted, we’re not a nation of investors anymore, we’re a nation of traders. Which conjurs up images of men and women staring for hours into laptop computer screens to squeeze dollars out of the differenc ein exchange rates between the Yen and the Euro.

Financial crises have been with us since the stock market was invented. But let's not forget that everytime the market struggles, there's a ton of money pumped in to shore it up. Public money. But this time, there's a lot of resistance to it. Could it be we're finally waking up? Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, the first in a series of what's going on Behind the Economic Crisis. First of all, apologies for not posting here for awhile. I was very busy preparing for our 1st World Conference of Analytical Trilogy, which wrapped up last weekend in San Diego. It was a great event actually, that a number of loyal Thinking with Somebody Else's Head listeners attended - and I was very gratified to see that. Mike McVay joined us from Houston, Mark Carlson and Jane Reading were in from Sedona, Rozann Wellman and her mother flew in from Utah. And my fellow Canadians were there in some force, including Dennis Hilton from Vancouver, Will LaJeunesse and his father from Edmonton, and Jason Coombs, late of Windsor but now living and working with us in São Paulo. We had 3 1/2 days of very fascinating lectures and workshops that really highlighted the expansiveness and depth of Norberto Keppe's comprehensive science of Analytical Trilogy. We also had a chance to feature the revolutionary Keppe Motor at the event, and at a couple of press conferences in L.A. and San Diego. And now, awareness of this revolutionary technological achievement has spread significatnly all over the world. Our Keppe Motor site provides more information for you, and so does our blog. If you're really interested, set your Google Alerts to Keppe Motor and Analytical Trilogy to stay up to speed. We were, of course, in the U.S. during the historic Senate and Congressional discussions of the $700B bailout package proposed by Bush and Treasury Secretary Paulson. That was wild stuff to watch. Coincidentally, perhaps, we were leaving the U.S. during the dramatic no vote to the package last Monday. This was not the first time Keppe's work had been introduced to the country. Keppe and Claudia Pacheco were invited there personally back in the early '80s to spread their innovative and solutions-based work there. After years of admiring the American society, Keppe was shocked at the decay he discovered in America. He wrote a series of books aimed at conscientizing Americans of the wrong path they were heading down with the poorly conceived Reaganomic policies of the time. Liberation of the People, The Decay of the American People (and the U.S.), and Work and Capital laid it all out clearly - the decay, the pathology of power, the inversion of placing capital above work, the destruction of the ideals of the Founding Fathers and the Constitution, the solutions Keppe's work proposed. Although the American people loved his work (and still do), the power structures didn't, and it all culminated in Keppe and Pacheco fleeing the persecution in 1988. They lost everything, but re-established in Europe and finally found it safe enough to head back to Brazil. Their work flourishes here today, and our World Conference was another attempt to have Keppe's work sprout in the country that is so lost and so in need of real solutions. We're going to explore the problems behind this current crisis in the next few podcasts. First thing to say is that this is not a new crisis at all. As Keppe noted in the '80s, the economic orientation towards speculation was creating a disastrous situation in the country. Money policy should be linked to production, to work - not to encouraging us to make money with money, as Reaganomics was doing. All the production of virtually everything has been moved offshore - to China and Mexico and India and Taiwan - and this is a disaster for the U.S. If there's no production anymore, what generates the cash? Speculation.

But writers and thinkers from Homer to Schopenhauer have always known there was something powerful going on below the surface of our demeanor. "There's daggers in men's smiles," as Shakespeare put it. But with the help of a brilliant Brazilian psychoanalyst, the way is becoming clear. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, Hope for a Troubled World. Norberto R. Keppe has been plying his trade for half a century or so. And it's a difficult trade indeed ... developing a theoretical, philosophical base to understand, and a therapeutic methodology to treat, the human psyche. That vast, murky part of us that lurks in the shadows has been perceived but never brought fully out into the lights. Freud caught a whiff of it in his early reading of Schopenhauer and his early studies with the great hypnotist and neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot. The subject fascinated him sufficiently to dedicate his life's work to developing a way to treat what we couldn't see, and worse, didn't want to see all that much. Humankind's greatest artists depicted kingdoms being lost and lives being destroyed by the machinations of this unexplored netherworld. And those dark, unfathomable passions lay deep inside us, as well we ordinary humans suspected in our quiet moments when we were alone with our thoughts. The problem was, Freud and Jung and Kraepelin and the other founding fathers of psychology didn't get it quite right. And that left a void in understanding, and a hodge-podge of theories and opinions that have often conflicted. Certainly, they've confused us, and led some of us to discredit psychology. "We've had 100 years of psychotherapy and the world's getting worse," as James Hillman and Michael Ventura put it in their critical analysis 15 years ago. But that's only because they haven't read Keppe's work yet. Norberto Keppe has discovered some answers for us. For example, that we are not unconscious at all, but conscious of much more than we realize. There is great hope in Keppe's science of Analytical Trilogy, which we'll explore soon at our World Conference of Analytical Trilogy, Sept. 24 - 27, 2008 in San Diego. And that we'll explore today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head with Dr. Claudia Pacheco. Click here to listen to this episode.

We're stressed because of work. We're shy because our family's shy. We're sick because there's a nasty flu bug going around. We vaccinate. We medicate. We pop vitamins and supplements to pump up our besieged immune systems. We're burned out and fed up. Because of what's going on outside. There's only one thing we forgot: the real problem is inside. Today on Thinking with Somebody Else's Head, the Inner Game of Health. Well, this is a subject we can speak on with some authority here at the International Society of Analytical Trilogy in São Paulo, Brazil. Dr. Norberto Keppe, whose work inspires and forms the basis of our podcast, has been working with psychosomatic illness for decades. He formed the first psychosomatic clinic in Latin America at the Hospital das Clinicas, part of the medical school at the University of São Paulo back in the '50s. Here's how it'd work back then: the patients the medical doctors couldn't get anywhere with - the hopeless cases - they'd send to the new guy in that psychosowhatchamacallit department. Then maybe they'd roll their eyes and wink at each other knowingly. "What chance did this young upstart, Keppe, have," they'd suggest smugly, "When the greatest medical scientists of the time like them couldn't even get to the bottom of the problem?" But more than a few times they'd have to eat their tongue depressors when their patients - the hopeless cases - would come back with miracle cures and spontaneious remissions. All through this process of psychoanalysis he was developing. He refined his studies with work in deep psychology in Vienna with Viktor Frankl, Igor Caruso and Knut Baumgarten, and his work deepened profoundly with his discovery of Inversion in the late '70s. This was a psychological discovery that gave Keppe a glimpse of a fundamental problem inside the human being that caused almost all of his physical, mental and even social problems. Let me be sure to underline this: Keppe's discovery of our psychological inversion has connected all the dots of the map of the human psyche. With the Keppean understanding, we can treat all disease, all relationship problems, all self-sabotaging behavior - even problems at the economic and political levels, which were before this seen as totally disconnected from the sphere of psychology. Keppe's Analytical Trilogy is a unified science as no science before it has been. Join us in San Diego, Sept. 24 - 27, 2008 to get the overview of Keppe's comprehensive science as it is applied in many areas of human endeavor. www.wcatus.org. And of course you can write me anytime at rich@richjonesvoice.com Dr. Marcia Sgrinhelli is a Trilogical dentist who's been working with Keppe for 20 years. She's the autho of 2 books on psychosomatic dentistry. She applies his therapeutic discoveries in her thriving dental practice here in São Paulo, and is closely involved with the Trilogical Psychosomatic Department here coordinated by Keppe's close associate, Dr. Claudia Pacheco. Dr. Sgrinhelli joins me today. Click here to listen to this episode.
