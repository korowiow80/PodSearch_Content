		<itunes:summary>In this episode of the Start Teaching Guitar podcast, I'll talk about some of the common excuses we tend to make for not taking action in our teaching businesses. The biggest reason guitar teachers FAIL is because they don't take the bold, positive actions that can bring the success they're looking for. I'm going to call some "B.S." on a bunch of the excuses we all make from time to time and share some insights on how to take action to start or grow your teaching business. Should be interesting!

I go into MUCH greater detail about each item in the podcast, but here’s a rough outline for you:


Overcoming Your Own Excuses - Part 1

3) The Economy Is Too Bad
4) Not Enough Skill/Experience

<p>I go into MUCH greater detail about each item in the podcast, but here’s a rough outline for you:</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Teaching Guitar</h2>
<p>If you have your own questions you’d like me to answer, send them in an email to <strong>info@startteachingguitar.com</strong> and I’ll include them in a future episode of the podcast!</p>
<p>Here are the questions I answer in this episode:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>1) I&#8217;m about to start teaching group classes in a community center. What do I do about students having acoustic guitars playing along with students with electrics? I don&#8217;t have that many little practice amps, and don&#8217;t want students lugging in their own.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>2) Thanks for the great site and resources. I really think it&#8217;s great! I am implementing your monthly tuition idea into my teaching and it&#8217;s helping a lot with the no shows. I was wondering how you handle students who want to come every two weeks. I find that once a student goes to every other week they eventually quit coming anyway, but it really messes up my schedule. Any Ideas? Like what happens if a full-time student wants that time slot, also if your bi-weekly student misses one lesson he has basically tied up most of your month for that time slot and had only one lesson.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3) I&#8217;ve been making my brain smoke recently trying to help one of my students with her songwriting skills.  She&#8217;s trying to write a song, but she doesn&#8217;t quite like the way that is sounds.  I want to help her with it&#8230;but I don&#8217;t know where to look for the right concepts to teach.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>4) If you&#8217;re the sole provider for your family, how do you go about providing health insurance for your family as a self-employed guitar teacher?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>5) I&#8217;m just looking at your barre chord handout &#8211; what program do you use to create your worksheets? I want to create a bunch of new worksheets, and need something that will produce similar results.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>6) How do I decide how much should I charge for lessons?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>7) How do I advertise to attract new students?</h4>

<h3><strong>The Secret to Getting Results and Staying Motivated (Part 2)<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s the not-so-secret &#8220;secret formula&#8221;:</p>
<h4>1) Setting Goals</h4>
<ul>
<li>Questions to ask your students to help them identify their goals:</li>
<ul>
<li>“What do you want to get out of playing the guitar?”</li>
<li>“If you could do anything you wanted on the guitar (and you had the skills to pull it off), what would you do?”</li>
<li>“What kind of places do you want to be performing at in 6 months? 3 years? 5 years?”</li>
<li>“Do you want to perform your own original songs or cover songs written by other people?”</li>
<li>“Do you want to be paid as a musician, or just do it for the enjoyment of playing?”</li>
<li>“If you want to get paid to play, do you want to do this full-time or only part-time while you pursue something else?”</li>
<li>“How fast do you want to be able to play scales, licks and solos?”</li>
<li>“What specific techniques do you want to be able to perform on the guitar?”</li>
<li>“By what date do you want to be able to perform them?”</li>
<li>“What songs do you want to be able to play note-for-note on the guitar?”</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>2) Establishing Milestones</h4>
<ul>
<li>Examples of milestones for your students:</li>
<ul>
<li>When they can play their first song</li>
<li>When they reaches some kind of anniversary in their guitar playing (3 months, 6 months, 1 year, etc)</li>
<li>When they know all the notes on the fretboard (or even a single string)</li>
<li>When they have mastered barre chords (or even a certain type)</li>
<li>When your student goes from being a beginner-level player to being intermediate or advanced</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>3) Earning Rewards</h4>
<ul>
<li>Ideas for rewarding your students:</li>
<ul>
<li>You can organize your curriculum into “levels” and make it a really big deal when a student graduates to the next level&#8230;give them a certificate or something to formally recognize the achievement</li>
<li>Some teachers give out “Music Money” (like Monopoly money) and actually pay their students to practice&#8230;I’ll put a link in the show notes to some resources for that. Works good for younger kids, and you can let them spend their “bucks” on prizes you could keep on hand</li>
<li>Doing a student concert or “recital” every 3 or 4 months is a good venue to reward everyone for their hard work&#8230;besides giving them a chance to play in front of people, you can actually give out certificates, prizes or whatever you think is appropriate to reward them</li>
<li>If you teach group classes, one way you can reward your students is to get them to help you teach the groups&#8230;the more they advance in their playing, the more responsibility you could give them</li>
<li>You could even do some kind of gifts, tuition discounts, etc.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

	You can organize your curriculum into “levels” and make it a really big deal when a student graduates to the next level...give them a certificate or something to formally recognize the achievement
	Some teachers give out “Music Money” (like Monopoly money) and actually pay their students to practice...I’ll put a link in the show notes to some resources for that. Works good for younger kids, and you can let them spend their “bucks” on prizes you could keep on hand
	Doing a student concert or “recital” every 3 or 4 months is a good venue to reward everyone for their hard work...besides giving them a chance to play in front of people, you can actually give out certificates, prizes or whatever you think is appropriate to reward them
	If you teach group classes, one way you can reward your students is to get them to help you teach the groups...the more they advance in their playing, the more responsibility you could give them

<p>I go into MUCH greater detail about each item in the podcast, but here’s a rough outline for you:</p>
<p><span id="more-1611"></span></p>
<h3><strong></strong><strong>What Your Students Want You To Know (But Are Afraid To Tell You)<br />
</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<h4>&#8220;Briefly demonstrate the goal, then spend the time I&#8217;m paying for showing me the building blocks. Not the other way around&#8230;&#8221;</h4>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4>&#8220;Do you know the difference between fully teaching someone something on the guitar, and just &#8216;showing&#8217; someone something on the guitar?&#8221;</h4>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4>“I have had great teachers and poor ones. The great have no judgement on music and show respect for all types versus jealousy or bitterness that some music is too simple or the original musician is not that talented. The great impart the passion for music in all forms.”</h4>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4>“I have had a couple of guitar teachers (as an adult). One was not really a good match for me and after lessons for a while (a couple of months) I decided to find a different teacher. I didn&#8217;t really have to say anything. Here in the Boston area there are tons of guitar teachers. You do have to spend the time finding the right one for you.”</h4>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4>“It would be nice to see more focus on one specific area of guitar playing rather than throwing a bunch of non-related exercises at the student. The most effective teaching I&#8217;ve had, in school or otherwise, has always started out basic and moved toward more advanced. This seems obvious. So guitar teachers, instead of asking me why I&#8217;m not practicing the multiple-octave-string-skipping-tapping-and-sweep lick you&#8217;re showing me, why not instead outline a clear set of routines I can use to test the waters on while working up the ability to play something that advanced?“</h4>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4>“My guitar teacher is an AWESOME player. He does flamenco jazz, but he doesn&#8217;t make a great teacher (he&#8217;s a performer before he&#8217;s a teacher).</h4>
<h4>I told him my long term goal was to solo. Every week he throws a different scale at me. It&#8217;s been a few months, and I can play tons of scales, but I still can&#8217;t solo much of anything. He&#8217;s not good at connecting the dots. He taught me speed exercises and scales for soloing, but I feel like that&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve done. He never connected the scales with soloing.</h4>
<h4>I&#8217;m teaching myself how to solo at home now. I throw on an Al Di Meola album and play solos on top of everything until it sounds right. I&#8217;ve learned more through the Al Di Meola songs than at a lesson.”</h4>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4>“Instead of writing down tabs for scale, exercises and modes during the lesson, do it once and make copies for all of your students instead of wasting costly lesson time. Make your one-on-one lesson time with students efficient and more cost effective for them. Give them a game plan and tell them what they will be learning during the course of a series of lessons and demonstrate by playing what they should be able to play at the end of a set course of lessons &#8211; if they practice and understand the teaching objectives. When they learn the notes on the fret board, tell them to vocalize the notes they play while they are playing all notes on each string, scales and modes. It would nice to have a series of video clips showing past students&#8217; progress at monthly intervals to help set expectations for new students. Help them learn how to set up their guitar properly &#8211; the basics.”</h4>

		<itunes:summary>In this episode of the Start Teaching Guitar podcast, I'll be talking about 10 traits of a successful guitar teacher (well...the first 5 of them, anyway). A great way to be more successful as a guitar teacher is to take a look at what OTHER successful people are doing and learn from them.

If you can UNDERSTAND some of the things that make other teachers successful and APPLY those same concepts and principles to your own teaching business, you can make some incremental improvements and see your business GROW. In this episode I'll share some of the most common "success traits" I've seen in guitar teachers who are doing things the right way, and I'll also include some advice about how to apply those traits to your own teaching business.

10 Traits of a Successful Guitar Teacher - Part 1

1) Loving What You Do
2) Being a Life-long Learner
3) Using Technology To Level the Playing Field
4) Having a Business Mindset
5) Taking Care of Yourself

There&#8217;s no &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; approach to creating your lesson policies&#8230;you need to ask yourself some important questions about how you want your business to look, and then create your lesson policies based on the answers that work best for you.</p>
<p>For this reason, the topic of lesson policies goes hand-in-hand with the topic of lifestyle design. In this episode, I&#8217;ll be taking about both and how they work together to help you have the kind of life you really want as a guitar teacher. One of the cool things about teaching guitar is that it gives you the freedom to design your life almost any way you choose!</p>
<p>I go into MUCH greater detail about each item in the podcast, but here&#8217;s a rough outline for you:</p>
<h2><span id="more-1045"></span></h2>
<p><strong>Designing Lesson Policies That Work<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong> 1) Lifestyle Design</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What do I really care about? What things are really important to me?</li>
<li>Why do I want to teach guitar lessons in the first place?</li>
<li>What makes me feel happy and fulfilled more than anything else?</li>
<li>What are my top 5 values?</li>

<ul>
<li>How much am I charging for lessons?</li>
<li>What methods of payment will I accept?</li>
<li>How often will I require payment?</li>
<li>Will I give refunds or not? Under what circumstances?</li>
<li>Will I offer any discounts for buying lessons in bulk?</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Scheduling</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>How will I schedule my lesson times?</li>
<li>What will I do if a student doesn&#8217;t show up?</li>
<li>What will I do if a student is late?</li>
<li>Should I do &#8220;make up&#8221; lessons or not?</li>
<li>What days do I want to take off?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the best way for students to communicate schedule changes with me?</li>
<li>How will I communicate schedule changes with them?</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Expectations</strong></li>
<ul>
<li>How much should my students practice every week?</li>
<li>How long should my lessons be?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s my general approach to teaching guitar?</li>
<li>What sequence of concepts will I take my students through?</li>
<li>How will I judge what level they&#8217;re currently on?</li>
<li>How will I decide when they&#8217;ve reached the next level?</li>
<li>How will I reward/recognize them for that accomplishment?</li>
<li>How will I discover and then work toward my student&#8217;s goals?</li>
<li>How will I discover their definition of &#8220;results&#8221; and make sure they experience that?</li>

<ul>
<li>Your own website</li>
