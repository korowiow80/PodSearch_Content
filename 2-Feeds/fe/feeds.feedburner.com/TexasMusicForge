Our features draw on traditional Texas music forms such as folk, blues, country and Tex-Mex, but also newer forms such as ambient, downtempo, house and electronica. In short - whatever best tells the story. Speaking of which, we like the short story form. We like taut, well-edited scripts and good acting. We like work that appeals to what Abraham Lincoln called "the angels of our better nature." We like house-rockin' good music. We like the idea of creating audio to be the soundtrack for each listener's own imaginary movie. Yeah, and we love Texas. You too?
