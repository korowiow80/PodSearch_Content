Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Is he able, but not willing? If he is both able and willing, whence then evil. And if he is neither able nor willing, why call Him God at all? What is ‘evil’ anyway? Does it really exist? Are there different kinds of evil? If so, how do these differences affect the so-called problem of evil? Is the existence of pain and suffering logically incompatible with the existence of God? Or is there some way to rationally reconcile the existence of evil with the existence of God? Even if there is some way to resolve the apparent inconsistency, doesn’t the existence of evil at least make the existence of God improbable? Given the tremendous amount of senseless pain and suffering evident in the world, isn’t it highly unlikely that a benevolent God exists?</p>

Or is it some kind of demonstration that a contradiction (or absurd consequence) follows from apparently reasonable assumptions? Do paradoxes actually point out some inexplicable fact about the nature of the world? Or are they just logical/linguistic games?

What about the particular format of the GRS? The music, commercials, monologues, discussions, guests and street interviews… is there any method to the madness? Is this an appropriate way to do philosophy? Can a philosophy talk show be fun, sarcastic, informal, goofy AND informative, engaging, relevant and thought provoking?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why does it seem like everyone’s in some sort of therapy these days? You’ve got the psychiatrists, the psychologists, social workers and counselors galore! Marriage counselors, Divorce counselors, Economic counselors, and Spiritual counselors. No one’s questioning the fact that people enjoy having specialists helping them out with their problems. I guess the real question is, are individuals getting the help they need from these therapeutic specialists? Are these therapeutic aficionados the right people to consult when you want a problem resolved? Perhaps they are. But how come no one ever asks a philosopher to help with their problems? Philosophers have been in the “problem solving business for over 2000 years, and are often able to work through difficult issues in unimaginable ways. In this special GRS episode, the crew is going to try and put our money where their mouths are and do some live philosophical counseling. So if you’d like to have a real problem solving professional analyze one of your personal conundrums, have a seat on the ‘Socratic Couch’ and tune into this ‘tongue in cheek’ episode of the GRS.</p>
