So weather it is about getting our staff to cooperate with us, or to get clients to entrust us with business, our main task is to make other people, want to give us what we want.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest ways that professionals and professional firms can improve their marketing effectiveness is to think through and make sure that they are actually putting their marketing efforts in places which yield the highest return.<br /><br />This is actually not commonly the case. Most firms say that they believe that marketing to existing clients is the best source of new revenue. But when you add up all of the non-billable hours that are spent on marketing you often get surprised that a very high majority of it is diverted to chasing new clients.<br /><br />In this clip, we examine all of the places that marketing efforts can go. We make some very clear recommendations about where the priorities are.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In thinking about business development, there are two basic mindsets that must be distinguished. On the one hand, you could focus on trying to win each transaction, transaction by transaction. Somewhat rudely, I call this the mindset of going for the quick hit, or the one-night stand.</p><p>The other way of coming to market is trying to build relationships. Trying to get good at romance, where you're trying to persuade potential clients to enter into a long-term relationship with you.</p><p>The key point is that we must understand that whilst either can be made to work, there is a crucial difference between being good at one-night stands and being good at romance.</p>]]></content:encoded>

we're going to explore how management, in a society of professionals,
can really be made to work. The clip opens with an example of
fabulous management, fabulous coaching, that was done to me early in
my career, and contrasts with the sorts of management that we often

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most interesting challenges
in business is that very often we already know what we need to
improve but we donâ€™t always get around to tackling it.  The same
is, of course, true in our personal lives and in this video, I will
use that analogy to suggest ways that we can actually improve our
business by drawing upon what it takes to improve our personal lives.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description>In order to succeed, a professional firm must have values, principles and standards. These should not exist as goals or aspirations, but as solid bottom lines that the professionals within the firm must live up to.</description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among the most important things I've learned is that to succeed, a professional firm needs values, principles, or standards. But you have to use these words very carefully. In many firms, their values are things they aspire to &mdash; things they wish to be &mdash; and that is not the sense in which I am using it here. I'm using the values in almost the religious sense, that these are the principles we will not be prepared to break. What I am trying to report to you is, firms that have such principles, flourish.</p>]]></content:encoded>
