<p>To celebrate this milestone we&#8217;ve launched our winter sale, so you can now get 25% off our memberships and premium versions of the courses. In most cases these premium versions include lesson guides in pdf or ebook format and extra audio or video content. All the courses available on our website can be purchased at this special reduced rate by using the coupon code winter2011 at checkout. The sale will continue until midnight on New Year&#8217;s Eve &#8211; or Hogmanay as we say in Scotland, so you still have almost two weeks to take advantage of these special prices, and get a head start on your language learning for 2012.</p>
<h3>Update on current shows</h3>
<p>The reaction to our new show for Spanish learners, Q&amp;A Spanish, has been fantastic. We&#8217;re delighted that lots of you are now emailing us with your questions, or leaving voicemails so that we can include your questions in the show. JP and Nahyeli are enjoying answering your questions &#8211; even the difficult ones! If you&#8217;re learning Spanish and you&#8217;ve not yet listened to Q&amp;A Spanish, you can find out more about the show, download the episodes, and find out how to contact us to ask your question at <a href="http://qandaspanish.com">qandaspanish.com</a>. We&#8217;re also really pleased with On Location French, our new video blog produced by Sophie in Paris. Sophie records her regular videos with a small camera and microphone all on her own in Paris and although we had some teething problems with sound, things are settling down now. She&#8217;s been including some really interesting phrases &#8211; and this week&#8217;s expression is a fantastic construction to add to your vocabulary! You can access On Location French on iTunes, Blip.TV or of course at <a href="http://radiolingua.com/shows/french/on-location-french/">onlocationfrench.com</a>. Turning to our other courses, although we&#8217;ve had a delay with our new One Minute Languages series, we&#8217;re getting back on track and there will be new episodes out this week of our Dutch, Flemish and Arabic courses. As far as Coffee Break French is concerned, we&#8217;re now into the final eight lessons of Season 3 and in these episodes we&#8217;ll be going back through the texts used in this season and picking out some of the most important grammar points, then helping learners practise these constructions with a series of translation and dictation exercises. There will be lots of extra members-only content, so with our winter sale currently on, perhaps now is the time to take advantage of our special pricing.</p>
<h3>Happy holidays!</h3>
<p>Finally, we&#8217;d like to wish you all a very happy holiday season and hope that you get the chance to relax, spend time with your friends and family, enjoying everything that the festive season brings, and get the chance to work on your language &#8211; or put it into practice if you happen to be travelling! Don&#8217;t forget that you can join us in our <a href="http://radiolingua.com/shows/festive-phrases-advent-calendar/">Festive Phrases video series</a> each day of December until the 25th to learn a festive greeting in a different language. Use the link on the home page of the Radio Lingua site to open each day of our linguistic Advent Calendar. Until the next time, happy holidays from everyone here at Radio Lingua!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://rlnvault.com/rln09/wp-content/uploads/categoryicons//postcat-a-rlnnews.gif" width="350" height="60" alt="" title="Radio Lingua News" /><br/><p>It&#8217;s five years since we launched the first lesson of Coffee Break Spanish, and since then we&#8217;ve served up millions of language lessons to learners around the world through our podcasts, our enhanced lessons and our ebooks. We&#8217;re delighted today to announce five new courses, and we&#8217;ll also be letting you know about a few exciting projects which are due to be launched early in 2012.</p>
<h3>Spanish</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-7219" title="qandaspanish-600" src="http://radiolingua.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/qandaspanish-600-150x150.jpg" alt="qandaspanish-600" width="150" height="150" />¡Empecemos con el español! On the 18th October 2006 we began with Spanish, and we&#8217;re doing the same today. Today we&#8217;re delighted to launch a brand new Spanish show. When you&#8217;re learning a language on your own, or if you don&#8217;t have access to a teacher or a native speaker, it&#8217;s difficult to get the answers you need to help you make progress. We receive questions almost every day from learners through posts on the website, emails, voicemails, tweets and Facebook, and we decided that the best way to deal with all of these questions would be to launch Q&amp;A Spanish: you ask the questions and we provide the answers. Q&amp;A Spanish will be hosted by teacher and languages expert JP Villanueva and native Spanish speaker Nahyeli Mendivil, so you have the best of both worlds! Each week they&#8217;ll help you develop your confidence in Spanish further by providing tips and examples of Spanish vocabulary, usage and grammar. Q&amp;A Spanish starts today, so you can already subscribe to the podcast. <a href="http://radiolingua.com/shows/spanish/qa-spanish/">Click here to find out more</a> about how you can take part in the show.</p>
<h3>French</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-7220" title="onlocationfrench-600" src="http://radiolingua.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/onlocationfrench-600-150x150.jpg" alt="onlocationfrench-600" width="150" height="150" />We&#8217;re also delighted to be announcing a brand new French video show. In On Location French you can join Sophie who is a UK student currently studying in Paris. She&#8217;s there for a year and she&#8217;s agreed to be our &#8220;correspondent&#8221;, bringing us weekly reports on interesting expressions she learns as she interacts with native speakers every day. Sophie will also be providing some cultural input as she gets to know the city, and we&#8217;re really looking forward to finding out more about her experiences in Paris in her weekly videoblog. Find out more and watch the episodes at the <a href="http://radiolingua.com/shows/french/on-location-french/">On Location French</a> page.</p>
<h3>Dutch, Flemish and Arabic</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re delighted to be launching three new courses in our ever-popular One Minute Languages series. One of the most requested languages over the past few years has been Dutch, and we&#8217;ve decided to produce a Dutch and Flemish version of the course. Both languages are very similar &#8211; Flemish is the variety of Dutch spoken in Belgium, and of course Dutch is spoken in the Netherlands and in other countries around the world such as Suriname and Aruba. <a href="http://radiolingua.com/category/shows/oml-dutch/">One Minute Dutch</a> launches on Thursday 20th October and <a href="http://radiolingua.com/category/shows/oml-flemish/">One Minute Flemish</a> will be published on Fridays from 21st October. We&#8217;ve also been asked many times to produce an Arabic version of our One Minute Languages course. <a href="http://radiolingua.com/category/shows/oml-arabic/">One Minute Arabic</a> will run for ten weeks from tomorrow, Wednesday 19th October. We&#8217;re concentrating on Modern Standard Arabic which will ensure that as a learner you&#8217;ll be understood across the Arab world, from Casablanca to Kuwait. With these latest additions to the One Minute Languages series, we now cover 26 languages, from Arabic to Zulu making Radio Lingua your first stop for language-learning on the go, literally from A to Z!</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s coming down the line?</h3>
<p>There may be some of you who are looking forward to a third season of Coffee Break Spanish. We&#8217;re working on this at the moment and by the time the reruns of Show Time Spanish end in January we should be ready to go with <strong>Coffee Break Spanish Season 3</strong>. French learners will be very pleased to know that Pierre-Benoît has been wandering about in the streets of Paris again and a second series of <strong>Walk, Talk and Learn French</strong> is in production. We&#8217;re also very excited about the January launch of our new children&#8217;s French video course, <strong>High Five French</strong>. We&#8217;ll be releasing more information about all of these projects over the next few months, so stay tuned!</p>
<h3>And finally&#8230;</h3>
<p>Finally, a personal note. Five years ago today, as I uploaded the first lesson of Coffee Break Spanish to the internet I had no idea how things would develop. At the time it was really just a personal project &#8211; something to keep me involved in Spanish as my &#8220;day job&#8221; had changed and I was no longer as closely involved in languages. Since then we&#8217;ve seen Radio Lingua grow into a successful company, delivering language lessons to millions of learners from all corners of the globe. I&#8217;d like to say a personal thank you to all of the brilliant people involved in the production of our courses, and to everyone involved in the day-to-day running of Radio Lingua. Most of all, I&#8217;d like to thank you, the listeners, who find our lessons on iTunes, or who come across our videos on YouTube, or who download our ebooks on your iPhones or iPads. Thank you for continuing to use our lessons, and a special thank you to all of our loyal members. Please continue to enjoy our lessons, and we hope you&#8217;re as excited as we are about the new shows we&#8217;re launching today.</p>
<p>We love doing what we&#8217;re doing and we look forward to the next five years, and hopefully many more!</p>

		<itunes:summary>In episode 11, the first episode of 2009, Mark and Alba talk about the holidays and about their New Year's Resolutions. Alba presents a review of the film La Lengua de las Mariposas (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188030/) in the intermedio, and José's topic of the week is paying compliments to people. Grammar points covered include the use of sí que for emphasis, and talking about how long you did things for in the past using both durante and a more simple preterite tense.

However, we&#8217;ve only just started working on this content, so it&#8217;s likely that it will be available later in the year.</p>
<p>We have been asked about the next steps for Coffee Break Spanish listeners and it seems that many listeners have not heard of our intermediate/advanced course Show Time Spanish. We&#8217;ve decided to add the Show Time Spanish episodes on the Coffee Break feed over the next twenty weeks, with two lessons per week. The materials are definitely more challenging, and ideally there would be a bridging course between the two. That&#8217;s exactly what Coffee Break Spanish Season 3 will provide, but in the meantime we hope that you find our Show Time episodes enjoyable.</p>
<p>Show Time on Coffee Break Spanish will begin tomorrow, on Tuesday 7th June and will continue twice-weekly for the next twenty weeks.</p>

In this episode we introduce the concept of the subjunctive, something which often confuses language learners. You&#8217;ll learn how to use the subjunctive with <em>cuando </em>when it refers to the future, eg. &#8220;when I get back from Madrid&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; <em>cuando vuelva de Madrid</em>.</p>

We thought we&#8217;d take this opportunity to update you on a few important news items.</strong></p>
<h3>Festive greetings</h3>
<p>Firstly, we&#8217;d like to take this opportunity to wish all our listeners a very happy festive season. We have listeners all around the world and wherever you are, whatever celebrations you&#8217;re having as we head towards 2011, we hope that you have a peaceful, restful and happy holiday. All through December we&#8217;ve been running our Festive Phrases podcast which has featured daily festive phrases from around the world with the hosts of our various shows. This series has been particularly aimed at schools and we&#8217;ve been delighted that so many young language learners around the world have used our daily podcasts to learn some festive greetings in 24 languages. Each day we&#8217;ve added the number of speakers of the language featured to a map and by the end of the series listeners were able to send festive greetings to over 2.6 billion people around the world. If you&#8217;re a teacher and you&#8217;ve been using Festive Phrases with your classes, <a href="http://radiolingua.com/2010/12/festive-phrases-feedback/">please send us your feedback</a>.</p>
<h3>Coffee Break French Season 3 news</h3>
<p>We introduced season 3 of Coffee Break French in October and this week we&#8217;ll release episode 10. Since we began season 3 we&#8217;ve offered a special introductory price for the premium version of the course which provided 3A (lessons 301-320) and 3B (lessons 321-340) together for a one-off payment of £47 GBP. As of 10th January 2011, season 3A and 3B will cost £37 each, or the complete season 3 will cost £64. This is therefore your last chance to purchase season 3 at the introductory price. Please note that all existing customers who have bought season 3 complete will receive the premium materials for the full season.</p>
<h3>UK VAT charges</h3>
<p>On 4th January 2011, the UK VAT rate increases from 17.5% to 20%. As a result our prices for EU customers will increase. For example, the current price of <em>Coffee Break French</em> Seasons 1 and 2 complete is £89 + VAT. This equates to £104.57. From 4th January 2011 the price will be £106.80 for EU customers. For Coffee Break Spanish Season 1 the current price is £47 + VAT. This equates to £55.23, but from 4th January the price will be £56.40 for EU customers. These changes do not affect the base prices of our products, so non-EU customers will not be affected. We&#8217;ve decided to extend our winter sale until 10th January to help make this transition. This means our sale will now end at midnight GMT on 10th January: continue to use coupon code WINTER2010 until 10th January.</p>
<h3>Plans for 2011</h3>
<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to a new year of language learning with Radio Lingua, and we hope you are too! We&#8217;ve been working on lots of new content and we&#8217;ll be adding to our range of materials in Spanish, French, German and Italian with new materials for learners. We&#8217;ll be extending our One Minute Languages series with Arabic, Dutch, Galician and Hungarian to name but a few, and we&#8217;ll be introducing more video content in the coming year. Make sure you visit our site regularly, that you&#8217;re a <a href="http://facebook.com/radiolingua">friend of Radio Lingua on Facebook</a>, and that you <a href="http://twitter.com/radiolingua">follow us on Twitter</a> to be the first to hear of all our new content. There&#8217;s some very exciting news coming in the next couple of months, so stay tuned!</p>
<p>Finally, we&#8217;d like to wish you once again a very happy holiday season, and best wishes for 2011.</p>

Read on!</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4420" title="christmas-box1" src="http://radiolingua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/christmas-box1.jpg" alt="christmas-box1" width="400" height="80" /></p>

<p>New for 2010: the Radio Lingua Club. We&#8217;ve been listening to comments from our existing premium customers and one of the most common requests is for more help and advice for learning languages. We&#8217;ve decided therefore to create a &#8216;club&#8217; around this. Membership to the club will last 12 months and during this time members will receive the following benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Weekly podcasts</strong> in a brand new &#8220;how to learn a language&#8221; series featuring tips, tricks and advice on learning language. We&#8217;ll also be including interviews with language learners from all walks of life who will share their learning tips. The course will feature tips for beginners and for experienced learners and we&#8217;re sure that everyone will be able to benefit from this course, regardless of the language they are learning.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced prices</strong> on all our content. Members will have access to a special discount rate for any purchases made within the membership period. At certain times we&#8217;ll also offer special discounts on certain products.</li>
<li><strong>Refer-a-friend refunds</strong>. Members of the Radio Lingua club will be able to introduce a friend to Radio Lingua courses at a discounted rate, and receive an affiliate payment. So if you&#8217;re a Coffee Break Spanish Season Pass holder and you introduce your friend to the show and they purchase the show, you&#8217;ll receive a special payment from us to say thanks.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Radio Lingua Club will involve a monthly payment of just £4.00 GBP. Alternatively you can purchase a twelve-month subscription for £36. The club will launch on January 1st 2010 with our first weekly language-learning tips podcast. We&#8217;re offering a special early-bird purchase offer where you can get 25% off the twelve-month subscription: for just £27 you will get access to a full year&#8217;s worth of podcasts, you&#8217;ll access the reduced prices throughout 2010, and you will be able to use the refer-a-friend refund too.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that the Radio Lingua Club is no longer available, as of July 2011. </strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4429" title="christmas-box3" src="http://radiolingua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/christmas-box3.jpg" alt="christmas-box3" width="400" height="80" /></p>
<p>If 2009 has been a big year for Radio Lingua, we&#8217;re really excited about what&#8217;s coming in 2010! Our <em>Coffee Break French</em> listeners will be aware that we&#8217;re moving into lessons 71-80 of <em>Coffee Break French</em>, and we&#8217;re often asked about &#8220;what happens when <em>Coffee Break French</em> finishes?&#8221; Well, we&#8217;re busy planning new content for intermediate learners at the moment, and we&#8217;re sure that everyone will enjoy what will come after our existing course content.</p>
<p>This year we introduced our first experimental video show &#8211; <em>Walk, Talk and Learn French</em>. We were overwhelmed at the response to <em>Walk, Talk and Learn</em>, but as a small company we&#8217;ve been limited in terms of the time required to produce more shows. Fans of the show will be delighted to know that we&#8217;ve filmed a second series and are working on the content at the moment, ready for launch early in 2010.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re a couple of days away from releasing the last ever episode of <em>Show Time Spanish</em>, which has developed into one of our most popular shows. As we&#8217;ve explained to listeners, Show Time took an enormous amount of work to produce each episode and we feel that we can&#8217;t continue the show in its current format. However, we are sure that Show Time Spanish listeners won&#8217;t be disappointed with what we have planned for release in the new year. We&#8217;re working on new content which will continue to feature native-speaker conversations and in-depth study of the language. We can&#8217;t say too much now, but we&#8217;ll be making some announcements early in the New Year.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in languages other than French and Spanish then we&#8217;re very pleased to announce that 2010 will bring more content for Italian and German learners and that we&#8217;ll continue to increase our range of <em>One Minute Languages</em>.</p>
<p>Last, but by no means least, since September we&#8217;ve been working in conjunction with schools in the UK through Radio Lingua Schools, and we&#8217;ve been involved in several projects involving languages and creative technologies. In 2010 we&#8217;re going to be looking more at the resources side of Radio Lingua Schools and have started work on a major new course for children, due to be launched in August 2010.</p>
<p>Of course, as we&#8217;ve said many times, we&#8217;re still a small company and we&#8217;re doing our best to continue to produce high quality, engaging materials. We hope that 2010 will bring further opportunities for new projects, collaboration and new ideas!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4431" title="christmas-box4" src="http://radiolingua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/christmas-box4.jpg" alt="christmas-box4" width="450" height="80" /></p>
<p>Of course we have lots of ideas as to our new developments, but we&#8217;re really interested to hear about your ideas. To this end, we&#8217;re asking for 10 minutes of your time and we hope that you&#8217;ll be willing to share some of your thoughts about language-learning and your next steps as a learner.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve devised a survey and would be very grateful if you would tell us a little about your language-learning and your experience using Radio Lingua materials. You can give as much or as little detail as you wish, but obviously it&#8217;s extremely useful to us if you can provide as much information as possible. There are different sections of the survey, depending on which language(s) you learn with Radio Lingua, and on whether you listen to the free content or use our premium materials. You&#8217;ll be guided through the survey and we&#8217;ll try to explain why we&#8217;re asking what we&#8217;re asking.</p>

If you've been thinking about taking your language-learning more seriously next year, perhaps now is the time to jump on board and purchase one of our Season Passes. We're delighted to be able to offer free language-learning materials to hundreds of thousands of listeners around the world, but you can take your learning to a new level with our premium materials which include lesson guides, extra listening materials and exericses for each of our courses.

To receive your 25% discount, simply use the coupon code holidays09 (lower case) at checkout when you're buying one of our courses. If you've not purchased an item from us before, you can view our full range of products here (https://radiolingua.com/amember/signup.php), or visit the appropriate store front for Coffee Break French (https://radiolingua.com/amember/signup.php?price_group=2), Coffee Break Spanish (https://radiolingua.com/amember/signup.php?price_group=1), Show Time Spanish (https://radiolingua.com/amember/signup.php?price_group=3), One Minute Languages (https://radiolingua.com/amember/signup.php?price_group=8), or School Run French (https://radiolingua.com/amember/signup.php?price_group=700).

Please note that the 25% reduction will be applied at checkout. EU customers should be aware that the prices quoted on our signup pages do not include VAT. If you use the coupon code then the 25% discount will be applied and then 17.5% VAT will be added to the total cost. It's worth also pointing out that as of 1st January 2010, the VAT charges will have to increase to 17.5% in line with the Inland Revenue arrangements in the UK.

Please remember to use the coupon code as you're purchasing: no refunds will be given on any materials purchased at full price if the coupon codes have not been used.

New for 2010: the Radio Lingua Club. We've been listening to comments from our existing premium customers and one of the most common requests is for more help and advice for learning languages. We've decided therefore to create a 'club' around this. Membership to the club will last 12 months and during this time members will receive the following benefits:

	* Weekly podcasts in a brand new "how to learn a language" series featuring tips, tricks and advice on learning language. We'll also be including interviews with language learners from all walks of life who will share their learning tips. The course will feature tips for beginners and for experienced learners and we're sure that everyone will be able to benefit from this course, regardless of the language they are learning.
	* Reduced prices on all our content. Members will have access to a special discount rate for any purchases made within the membership period. At certain times we'll also offer special discounts on certain products.

<p>On 18th October 2006, episode one of a new language-learning podcast called <em>Coffee Break Spanish</em> was released to the world. This show was a bit different from the other Spanish learning shows out there: it was a gradual introduction to basic Spanish presented by teacher Mark, teaching student Kara. At this stage no-one really knew if the idea would work, but <em>Coffee Break Spanish</em> grew to become one of the most popular ways to learn Spanish online. The show quickly climbed the charts on iTunes UK and US, and began to feature in the top podcasts at <a href="http://www.podcastalley.com">Podcast Alley</a> and on <a href="http://www.libsyn.com">Libsyn</a>.</p>
<p>Three years down the line and the Radio Lingua Network now produces twenty-seven language courses in eighteen languages and this week saw the sixty millionth download of our language lessons! That means &#8211; on average &#8211; around 55,000 downloads per day, every day for the last three years.</p>
<h3>It&#8217;s time to celebrate!</h3>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4315" title="3rdbirthday-coupon" src="http://radiolingua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/3rdbirthday-coupon.jpg" alt="3rdbirthday-coupon" width="250" height="150" />To celebrate this milestone in our company&#8217;s development, we&#8217;re reducing everything to 60% of the normal prices, ie. 40% off, for one week only, from noon GMT on 18th October through to midnight GMT on 25th October. There has never been a better time to purchase our lesson guides, enhanced podcasts and extra listening materials. Simply use coupon code <strong>sixty</strong> when you sign up for any of our shows. You can choose between <a href="http://radiolingua.com/shows/spanish/coffee-break-spanish/">Coffee Break Spanish</a>, <a href="http://radiolingua.com/shows/french/">Coffee Break French</a> and <a href="http://radiolingua.com/shows/spanish/show-time-spanish/">Show Time Spanish</a>, or indeed one of our shorter <a href="http://radiolingua.com/shows/other-languages/">One Minute</a> or <a href="http://www.twitterlearn.com">TwitterLearn</a> courses. By purchasing a membership you can access a range of materials including pdf lesson guides featuring the words and phrases included in each lesson, enhanced podcasts which are perfect for listening on the iPod Touch or iPhone where you can see the flashcards synchronised to the audio, and bonus listening materials to help you improve your language skills even more.</p>
<p>Please note that the coupon code can&#8217;t be used in conjunction with any other offer and is limited to one purchase per member. Please note too that in order to qualify for the discount, the coupon code must be used at checkout time. We can&#8217;t offer retrospective discounts if the coupon code was not used.</p>
<h3>Announcing a new development</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve been reading your comments regarding discussion boards and building a community around our lessons. Our previous discussion boards were created before we developed our membership system, so were unfortunately not linked to the system. Today we&#8217;re launching our new <a href="http://radiolingua.com/community/">Community</a> area where listeners can interact with each other, share their language-learning experiences and benefit from collaborative learning with fellow listeners. Accessing the Community is free, but you&#8217;ll need to sign up for an account in our system, so we&#8217;ll hopefully avoid the spam problems we&#8217;ve had in the past.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4320" title="Screen shot 2009-10-17 at 16.46.45" src="http://radiolingua.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Screen-shot-2009-10-17-at-16.46.45-300x126.png" alt="Screen shot 2009-10-17 at 16.46.45" width="300" height="126" />If you&#8217;re already a member of our system then you&#8217;ll be able to access <a href="http://radiolingua.com/community/viewforum.php?f=7">My Courses</a> in the community, where we&#8217;ll lead activities and generate discussions in which you can practise what you&#8217;ve learned in each lesson. My Courses is restricted to our premium members, so if you&#8217;ve purchased a Season Pass to Coffee Break French Level 2, you&#8217;ll see this course in My Courses, allowing you to interact with your fellow learners in the activities and discussions there. And if you&#8217;re not yet a premium member, you can join this week at a hugely discounted price! We&#8217;re looking forward to interacting with all our learners in My Courses.</p>
<p>Any questions? <a href="http://radiolingua.com/support/contact-us/">Get in touch with us</a>, or post your question in our <a href="http://radiolingua.com/community">Community area</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s to many more years of language learning with Radio Lingua!</strong></p>

Coming up on today&#8217;s show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning languages 140 characters at a time with TwitterLearn</li>
<li>Introducing our Community Managers</li>
<li>New features for Radio Lingua premium members</li>
<li>Announcing our Summer Sale</li>
<li>Updates on the latest shows</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TwitterLearn</strong> It seems that in the past few months the entire world has started twittering, helped by the huge number of celebrities using the microblogging service. Some write it off as another banal social media fad, but here at Radio Lingua we&#8217;ve been using Twitter for many months to update listeners on the latest podcast episodes and other news from Radio Lingua. This summer, we&#8217;ve decided to take our twittering a stage further and we&#8217;ve designed a course in French, Italian and Spanish for beginners, delivered in daily tweets of 140 characters, and podcasts of 1 minute 40 seconds. You can join Twitter at  <a href="http://twitter.com/">http://twitter.com</a> and follow <a href="http://twitter.com/learnspanish">@learnspanish</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/learnfrench">@learnfrench</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/learnitalian">@learnitalian</a> to start your micro language-learning course.</p>
<p><strong>Community Managers</strong> This summer we&#8217;re joined by three new members of the Radio Lingua team. Ellie, Katie and Marylou are going to be working over the summer on developing our learning communities on the website and they&#8217;re also working on the TwitterLearn courses. Initially they&#8217;ll be helping to develop the conversations on our Facebook pages. We really hope that Ellie, Katie and Marylou enjoy working with Radio Lingua over the summer months. If you&#8217;re a Facebook user, head over to the Facebook pages for <a href="http://www.facebook.com/coffeebreakspanish">Coffee Break Spanish</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Coffee-Break-French/25593416122?ref=ts">Coffee Break French</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Show-Time-Spanish/48009449677?ref=ts">Show Time Spanish</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Radio-Lingua/91097236722">Radio Lingua</a> where the conversations are increasing daily. Make sure you become a &#8216;fan&#8217; of the shows and tell your friends that you&#8217;re learning with us. <span>We&#8217;re also looking at the longer term plans for the Discussion Forum on our website. Have your say about how this should develop and contribute to the </span><a href="/2009/07/discussions-the-radio-lingua-forum/">discussion on our blog</a><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>New developments for members</strong><span> Until now our premium members have been downloading the bonus materials from our members&#8217; pages, but we&#8217;ve been working on developing premium feeds for all of our podcasts. You can now use our one-click method to download all of the premium materials through iTunes. Find out more on our <a href="/members/help/">members&#8217; pages</a>. Another new development has been the introduction of automatic upgrades. A number of members who have purchased premium memberships have requested upgrades. Until now this has been a manual process, but we&#8217;ve just introduced new automatic upgrades for Coffee Break Spanish and Coffee Break French.

It was actually originally recorded on the streets of Glasgow on the occasion of the UEFA Cup Final a couple of years ago when hundreds of thousands of Spaniards arrived in the city for the match at Hampden Park. Listen in to hear interviews with fans of Español and Sevilla. Sticking with Spanish, we&#8217;ve just launched a </span><a href="/2009/07/lesson-29-show-time-spanish/">special episode of Show Time Spanish</a><span> recorded as Alba and I made a tortilla española, live in the kitchen.

Show Time will continue, nonetheless and episode 30, due out in the middle of next week, will be the sixth instalment of our Spanish soap opera Verano Español. To French, now, and </span><a href="/category/shows/coffee-break-french/">Coffee Break French</a><span>.
