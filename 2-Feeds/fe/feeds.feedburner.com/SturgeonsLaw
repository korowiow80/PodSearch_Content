I seem to have successfully provoked a bunch of messages in my last episode, although admittedly one of these is just coincidence and wasn't directed at Sturgeon's Law specifically but I wanted to pass it along, anyway.  In fact, we'll just start with it.  Richard Jenkins, expat Oklahoman comic artist in Boston -- not to be confused with Jeffrey Rowland, expat Oklahoman cartoonist in Boston, but anyway -- dropped a line to say that he's got a new textbook out.  You see, when Richard isn't doing wacky stuff like the art on the various Sky Ape books, he teaches art, and it turns out he also puts some effort into teaching teachers to teach art, or in this case, more specifically, how to include comics in their teaching.  The name of his new textbook is Comics in Your Curriculum, and it's for sale through http://www.piecesoflearning.com as well as teacher outlet stores, so if you teach or if you know people who do, have a look.  I've seen a few preview pages that he attached to his email, and it has a certain McCloud sort of vibe, even making a reference to Understanding Comics in one of the preview pages, but I think is aimed less at philosophy for those already involved, or at least interested, in comics and more towards getting the word out to students.  Frankly, mainstream comics are in a bad place right now.  I'm not afraid to say it, although it does make me sad.  Sort of.  Because there's no time like the present for reinventing comics -- as Scott McCloud might say -- and this is the way it happens; not by comic fans talking to each other over and over but by bringing in people without our biases and historical baggage.



Moving on, we've got this voicemail from Doug Rapson of Geek Acres.



Thanks for the congratulations, Doug, and the kind comments as well.  You know, a friend who listens to the show compared the last episode to drunk dialing, and I've decided to take that as meaning that I didn't resist speaking my mind about what was nagging at me, in which case I think you can look forward to plenty more of that.  If you want actual drunk dialing, well, just listen to many of your favorite podcasts during the PMEs each year, am I right?  Okay, never mind that.  Thanks again, Doug.



Listener Laura used the Contactify link on the Sturgeon's Law web site to share a list of her favorite web comics, which I'll link in this episode's show notes, but in brief her list includes User Friendly, General Protection Fault, The Devil's Panties, Ctrl Alt Delete, Penny Arcade, Get Medieval, Girl Genius, Sinfest, XKCD and Chasing the Sunset.  Some of those have been mentioned here before, some of them I read regularly, some of them you couldn't pay me to read, and at the end of the day I'll just leave you with Laura's list and let you decide what you enjoy and don't enjoy for yourself, although I encourage you not to judge Jennie Breeden's The Devil's Panties too quickly; while she is crown princess of misspellings and sometimes what she finds funny may leave you wondering why, this is all connected to the vibe of the comic, which is goofing on her own experiences as a nerd artist on the road, and if you give it time it will very likely grow on you like it has for me.  And, as Laura reminds us, it's not satanic porn, so give it a glance.

Listener Chris, while recognizing that I'm not an XBOX 360 owner, which indeed I am not, makes sure I'm aware of the game Braid, which, if I wasn't before, I certainly would be since Tycho of Penny Arcade decided to talk about it at some length.  However, Chris mentions it for a different reason, and one that I had in fact heard elsewhere -- in fact, from John Buckman, founder of Magnatune, and that reason is that Braid uses Magnatune music as its soundtrack in accordance with Magnatune's reasonable and convenient and, I must add, very fair to the artist licensing plans.  Chris also points out that a PC version of Braid is in the works for later this year and I'll be tempted to shell out a few bucks just to support someone who supports the excellent folks at Magnatune.com.  First we had Portal with Jonathan Coulton, and now this; looks like a great time for both innovative game designers and independent recording artists.



And finally, I had a brief email exchange with listener, and I'm not making this up, Peter Sturgeon, who clarifies that he is not the brother of Theodore Sturgeon, who does indeed have a brother named Peter who founded the American branch of Mensa, thank you Wikipedia, and at any rate, Mr. Sturgeon writes to remind me that "90% of everything is crud" is not, in fact, the original Sturgeon's Law; in fact, that was called Sturgeon's Revelation early on to distinguish it from the original Sturgeon's Law, which read "Nothing is always absolutely so," and indeed, Sturgeon himself -- Theodore, not Peter -- referred to THAT quote as Sturgeon's Law, and, as I say, the 90% quote as Sturgeon's Revelation.  So what do I do with this?  Well, to answer that I went context diving, specifically into the Sturgeon story "The Claustrophile" where the quote originated, and I'd like to read you some context:



"Nothing is always absolutely so," he said again.  "Once you know that, know it for sure, you can do things, go places you never thought about before.  Everything there is gives you some place to go, something to think about.  Everything.  Take a -- a brass rivet, say.  It's brass; you start with that.  And what is brass?  An alloy.  How much change of what metal would make it not be brass?  Given enough time, would radioactive decay in one of the metals transmute it enough so it wouldn't be brass any more?  Or take the size.  How big is it?  Well, doesn't that depend?  It's smaller after it's been used than when it was new.  What color is it?  That depends, too.  In other words, if you're going to describe to me exactly what that rivet is, you're going to have to qualify and modify and get up a list of specs half as long as a tide chart and half as wide as Bowditch.  And then all I have to do is sweat one drop of sweat on that rivet and wait twenty-four hours and you'll have to revise your specs."



One of the things I learned early on about online communication, a topic with which I have some 25 years of familiarity back to electronic BBSes in 1983, is that if you state a viewpoint, a belief, or an opinion, someone will be there to make you feel like an idiot for having said it.  What I get from the original Sturgeon's Law is this: there's no reason in the world for you to worry about that, because we're all idiots to one level or another, simplifying a complex universe so we can even begin to talk about it.  We describe things in ways that are good enough, whether we're Archimedes or Newton or even Einstein.  We approximate.  We generalize.  We see things filtered through our own world views so that we have any hope at all of making sense of what we are seeing.  And these are not character flaws; these are how intelligence works.  Sometimes either alone or in concert with diverse others we see things in a new way and that becomes great art, or important science, or maybe nothing that anybody ever cares about but special just the same.  And the underlying mechanism was the realization that you don't have to have all the answers to speak.  You don't have to be 100% sure to comment.  You don't have to fear being wrong or feeling like an idiot because nothing is always absolutely so.  You just need to keep your mind open and accept that you don't have all the answers and that's what makes it worth thinking and talking and learning until the day you die.  It's a statement of optimism, and by the way, so was Sturgeon's Revelation: no matter what you do, you can aspire to do it and do it well, because while 90% of everything is crud, doesn't that imply that 10% of everything isn't?</description>

In fact, we'll just start with it. Richard Jenkins, expat Oklahoman comic artist in Boston -- not to be confused with Jeffrey Rowland, expat Oklahoman cartoonist in Boston, but anyway -- dropped a line to say that he's got a new textbook out. You see, when Richard isn't doing wacky stuff like the art on the various Sky Ape books, he teaches art, and it turns out he also puts some effort into teaching teachers to teach art, or in this case, more specifically, how to include comics in their teaching. The name of his new textbook is Comics in Your Curriculum, and it's for sale through http://www.piecesoflearning.com as well as teacher outlet stores, so if you teach or if you know people who do, have a look. I've seen a few preview pages that he attached to his email, and it has a certain McCloud sort of vibe, even making a reference to Understanding Comics in one of the preview pages, but I think is aimed less at philosophy for those already involved, or at least interested, in comics and more towards getting the word out to students. Frankly, mainstream comics are in a bad place right now. I'm not afraid to say it, although it does make me sad. Sort of. Because there's no time like the present for reinventing comics -- as Scott McCloud might say -- and this is the way it happens; not by comic fans talking to each other over and over but by bringing in people without our biases and historical baggage. Moving on, we've got this voicemail from Doug Rapson of Geek Acres. Thanks for the congratulations, Doug, and the kind comments as well. You know, a friend who listens to the show compared the last episode to drunk dialing, and I've decided to take that as meaning that I didn't resist speaking my mind about what was nagging at me, in which case I think you can look forward to plenty more of that. If you want actual drunk dialing, well, just listen to many of your favorite podcasts during the PMEs each year, am I right? Okay, never mind that. Thanks again, Doug. Listener Laura used the Contactify link on the Sturgeon's Law web site to share a list of her favorite web comics, which I'll link in this episode's show notes, but in brief her list includes User Friendly, General Protection Fault, The Devil's Panties, Ctrl Alt Delete, Penny Arcade, Get Medieval, Girl Genius, Sinfest, XKCD and Chasing the Sunset. Some of those have been mentioned here before, some of them I read regularly, some of them you couldn't pay me to read, and at the end of the day I'll just leave you with Laura's list and let you decide what you enjoy and don't enjoy for yourself, although I encourage you not to judge Jennie Breeden's The Devil's Panties too quickly; while she is crown princess of misspellings and sometimes what she finds funny may leave you wondering why, this is all connected to the vibe of the comic, which is goofing on her own experiences as a nerd artist on the road, and if you give it time it will very likely grow on you like it has for me. And, as Laura reminds us, it's not satanic porn, so give it a glance. http://www.userfriendly.org http://www.gpf-comics.com http://www.thedevilspanties.com http://www.cad-comic.com http://www.penny-arcade.com http://get-medieval.livejournal.com http://www.girl-genius.net http://www.sinfest.net http://www.xkcd.com http://www.fantasycomic.com Listener Chris, while recognizing that I'm not an XBOX 360 owner, which indeed I am not, makes sure I'm aware of the game Braid, which, if I wasn't before, I certainly would be since Tycho of Penny Arcade d</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>movies,tv,music,software,games,organizations,comics,books</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://www.sturgeonslaw.com/stulaw093.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/SturgeonsLaw/~5/85gR4FhH8sE/stulaw093.mp3" length="9315315" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://www.randomcasts.com/law/stulaw093.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

July 30, 2008 is the 3rd anniversary of the first episode of Sturgeon's Law.  In keeping with my low-key podcasting behavior of late, there's no contest, I didn't go panning for emails and voice comments, but instead, I thought I'd take the opportunity to do an utterly self-involved episode talking about two closely related things: new media and this podcast.



Actually, I'm uneasy with the descriptor "new media."  Because, in point of fact, from our day to day perspective the whole point is that there isn't any medium, or at least, that the medium is irrelevant.  You may be listening to this on your portable player, or your desktop PC, or perhaps your phone.  Maybe you burned it to CD and are listening to that.  Seems unlikely, but anything's possible.  Perhaps you're not listening to the podcast at all, but reading the transcript on the website.  Perhaps you're actually listening to a screenreader read that transcript, which seems a bit roundabout, but again, anything's possible.  The point is, I don't know and, for reasons we'll get into, I don't actually care, either.  What I care about is that I have something to communicate, be it a story or an essay or blatant promotion or a song or whatever, and I've recorded it and written it out and set it loose into the wilds.  It's on a website and it's got an RSS feed and the rest is all details I need not concern myself with, hopefully, although iTunes has ever been a counterexample of that.  On the other hand, I've never once tried to contact iTunes because I can't be bothered to wrangle with them, so perhaps not.  Let's stick to my idealized form, at any rate; what I care about is producing the content and making it available in some sufficiently generic form that you can actually have whatever media you see fit.  As a parallel, I have bought music on mp3s from Amazon, because DRM is pure evil and that's the end of that.  In my case, after downloading that music, I burn it to CD because I am paranoid, then perhaps I listen to it at my PC, or copy it to my portable player, or indeed, frequently, I stream it to my desktop PC at work.  Amazon doesn't, or shouldn't, care about any of that, and they'd better not, since they sold it in mp3, which pretty much guarantees they don't get a further say.  As it should be, for the new media, which is either no media or all media.



I have now been doing this show for three years and podcasting for several months beyond that.  One of the things that has occasionally annoyed me has been various fads that have turned into orthodoxies.  I don't care for orthodoxy.  It comes from Greek roots meaning, more or less, "true opinion," an oxymoron if ever I heard one.  The notion that real podcasters were the ones who wanted to monetize their shows and quit their day jobs was an opinion, but it wasn't stupid any more than it was even sensible.  On the flip side, the notion that creative people are obliged to give away their work without restriction is also an opinion; it's just a stupid one.  The beauty of living in the future, as I really believe we do, is not that it'll make each and every one of us rich, or load each and every one of us up with free stuff, but that it permits the creator and the consumer -- in the purest sense of that term -- to meet on whatever ground they feel like, full stop.  It is my pleasure to express my thoughts periodically this way whether or not anyone contributes to my webhosting, or anyone sponsors the show (old listeners will know I did that once, and it wasn't really much fun, nor did it line my pockets deeply), and as long as it is the pleasure of some to meet me in the middle and accept some free blather, then everyone goes home happy and who cares whether it fits a quote model unquote or whatever?  If the quote model unquote I choose is loathsome, then I will find out when nobody meets me halfway.  If it is so nearly vile that only three people stick around, and I'm happy creating for three people, then the quote model unquote is viable and shame on you who think otherwise.  That's what new media is to me: the chance to say "get stuffed" to How Things Must Be Done.



Now, a bit about where I have occasionally gotten turned around and lost my way in regards to that last observation: the final orthodoxy we all must face down is our very own.  Putting it another way, when I started the show, I had an idea of what it would be.  Over three years, I have wrestled horribly with boredom, with lack of ideas, with confusion over what I should do next, and worry over what people would tolerate.  I have fought, and often lost, against my own self-imposed orthodoxy, and it comes in subtle ways, down to the very name of the show.  I told someone the other evening I sort of wished I'd never come up with the name Sturgeon's Law, because now I can't talk about whatever the heck I feel like unless it makes some sort of sense within the framework suggested by the name and its complementary tagline about the 10%.  But really, who cares?  Some of you have tried to tell me that on a number of occasions, and to you I apologize for being so thick.  But orthodoxy is an insidious thing, particularly when it's your own, I think.  And I am by no means the only podcaster I've heard fret about whether they could do something that seemd appealing and, quote, get away with it, unquote.  Why not?  In reality, the worst case is that the more forward of your listeners write or call in to tell you that kind of sucked, and then you know.  Sure, you can sit around and fret that your entire audience will evaporate in one show, but I doubt it, and frankly, if what you're doing doesn't get you charged up, which is better, to labor joylessly or to lose most of your audience?  I'd like to think I'd take the latter.



I am grateful to the wonderful PodcastReady.com for increasing the subscription numbers of this show manyfold.  According to Feedburner, there are now 7,000 subscribers, which took me for a turn because the last I'd looked it'd been more like 4,000 for some time.  Apparently more PodcastReady devices are turning up with us on it, because they're still some 95% of the subscriptions.  How many actually listen to Sturgeon's Law?  I have no idea.  But what I do know is that I cannot be tied up by that number, be it 7,000, or 4,000, or 150 like in the old days, or 30 or 20 or 5, because ultimately, if I don't get into doing the show, either I will stop doing it entirely, which has very nearly happened a number of times, or my lack of interest will become infectious and none of those 7,000 will listen anyway, nor should you.



So in conclusion, this is not an announcement of change.  This is not a proclamation of new format.  Keep subscribed and you'll keep hearing me talk about whatever inspires me to sound off.  I'm still the guy who is more interested in telling you about things that strike me as cool -- MOST of the time -- so you'll still get plenty of that.  And hopefully, in turn, I'll say something so interesting that you'll want to talk back, because the coolest part of new media is that the conversation can happen between content creator and consumer without some idiots blocking the door.  And if you've got something to share, a song or an essay or a play or a story or whatever it may be, share it.  Ask for donations of you want them.  Charge money if you think that works for you.  Give it all away if that suits your style.  Sell t-shirts.  Use Wowio in a couple of days when they come back.  Do whatever make the whole thing worthwhile for you and don't worry about what's internet chic, because the whole point of the internet is not having to be chic.  Woody Allen said that 80% of success is showing up.  Showing up has never been easier.  And whatever you do, wherever you do it, drop me a line, because rumor has it I dig cool stuff.</description>

It is my pleasure to express my thoughts periodically this way whether or not anyone contributes to my webhosting, or anyone sponsors the show (old listeners will know I did that once, and it wasn't really much fun, nor did it line my pockets deeply), and as long as it is the pleasure of some to meet me in the middle and accept some free blather, then everyone goes home happy and who cares whether it fits a quote model unq</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>movies,tv,music,software,games,organizations,comics,books</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://www.sturgeonslaw.com/stulaw092.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/SturgeonsLaw/~5/xqK3TeDaQ3Y/stulaw092.mp3" length="8606972" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://www.randomcasts.com/law/stulaw092.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

Last show I told you about how I was checking out Plurk as an alternative or supplement to Twitter.  Well, I didn't stick with it, mostly because the interface stymied my attempts to casually keep up.  And that's what I want online, to be honest; a way to keep my eye on the river without having to hold my head under it all the time.  Glub glub.  So I dusted off my http://www.friendfeed.com/ account, and lo and behold, it had grown some awesome new features in my absence.



The basic idea of Friendfeed is very good: you make your profile there, then you tell it where to find all sorts of different online instances of yourself, for example Twitter, Flickr, Youtube, Amazon wishlists, blogs, and for that matter anything with an RSS feed.  Then, new posts or whatever to any of those show up as part of your feed, and peope who've friended you see it in their friends feed.  Very nice; one stop shopping for social networking.  But this is not the feature that got me excited about Friendfeed all over again.



The feature I'm talking about is amusing called imaginary friends.  What this means is that I can create a sort of personal virtual profile for someone else that only I see, and associated their online instances as I said before, and get all the benefits of seeing their stuff appear in my friendsfeed... even if they don't sign up!  That's the killer feature, folks -- useful social networking without having to strongarm every friend into trudging over to yet another service.  Now, it's even better if they do, since they can add stuff you didn't know about, and follow you, too, although I should note that you can make your feed available via, you guessed it, RSS.  Very very nice.  Friendsfeed is now exclusively how I follow twitter.  And flickr.  And so on.



However, it's not really useful for posting to services (aside from itself.) It's an aggregator, not a client.  Fortunately, some folks up the road from me in Tulsa, Oklahoma are there for you with the fairly new service http://ping.fm, which fills exactly that need.  Ping gives you a way to post to blogs, send messages to Twitter and Plurk and all those guys, even set your Facebook status, all from one interface.  And not just their web interface!  You can send through ping using a bookmarklet to send URLs, you can use your phone, you can even IM, something I used to do on twitter on the rare occasion it worked.  Hopefully there will start being ping widgets for all kinds of stuff.  You can also set up custom lists with keywords so you can easily send to just select lists of services with one message.



So give these two services a try!  They've made social networking actually fun to use for me.  I'm rfrancis at Friendfeed if you want to catch all my stuff there -- including Sturgeon's Law posts.  Which you can listen to with their flash player now.  But digress.</description>

Music from PMN, Enter the Haggis



Trailer - Vindicatum episode 2



Segment 1:



So I'm a big user of all things Google, right?  Gmail, yes.  Google Calendar, yes.  Google Reader, yes.  Google Docs, absolutely.  Google Notebook... well, no.  Not any more, that is.  Not since Steve of the Wicked Good Podcast turned me on to Evernote on a day where I could land an invite code to their beta.



Not that Evernote is new, exactly.  It's existed as Mac and PC applications, I believe, for some time, but that didn't interest me, as I use several machines and I need to be able to get to my notes from all of them equally well.  That's why the version 3 beta got my attention -- it has a web version as well, and if you use the application versions, which I do, they synchronize with the web hosted central version, giving you something that is and is not a web app, but at any rate is synchronized across multiple locations.  Compare this to Google Notebook, which is a web app and only a web app, which is fine until you're not on a network and want to dig into your notebook.



There are other upsides as well, though.  Evernote handles images very nicely, and, even more impressive, can search text in the images through, one assumes, the magic of OCR or somesuch.  This turns out to be more than just a gimmick; it's darned useful.  You can also encrypt notes, which is pretty cool of course, and of course there's the obligatory tagging, but also saved searches, which I quite like in principle.  You can embed checkboxes in your notes to make, well, checklists, and indeed, this is how I do project lists now and it's a real boon.



Are there downsides?  Yes.  I'm very frustrated by the lack of a Linux application, particularly when I'm on my Asus Eee.  Yes, I can go to the web-based version, IF I'm on a network, but that kind of defeats the whole portability point of using it on the Eee, plus the web interface is... not so great, in my opinion, and it wastes an enormous amount of screen real estate which is of course a scarce commodity on the Asus.  The Windows app has some quirky behavior but nothing you don't get used to... eventually.  But it works very solidly and the features are excellent.  Worth finding someone with an invite.



Final comment: my notes for this show were, of course, typed and stored in Evernote.  Among many, many other things.



Segment 2:



I've discovered plurk.com, and believe me, saying plurk out loud makes it all worthwhile.  plurk plurk plurk.  Anyway, what is plurk, you may ask?  Well, more or less it's a competitor for twitter, I suppose, conveniently rising in prominence about the time twitter's having downtime struggles.  Again.  But it's not just a clone by any means; plurk has a unique presentation of messages, putting abbreviated forms on a scrolling timeline that to be honest I just can't quite describe.  Additionally, it has excellent features twitter lacks, such as a permissions system whereby you can make subgroups of your friends and lock messages to particular groups; for another example, instead of users forming a convention for replying to posts, plurks have comment lists almost like blog posts.



One more thing that really sells it for me is the very simple thing of autoupdating the page title with unread message counts, making it easy to just leave plurk open in a tab and glance at the tab title for new messages, instead of pounding reload on a page all day or whatever.  Sure, this basically means that plurk was made learning from the lessons twitter got the hard way.  So what?  It works.  Will it survive enormous usage in a way twitter hasn't so much?  Time will tell if the question even arises.  It's had occasional downtime due to the speed at which they're developing, but it's been brief and seems to be getting less frequent.  Random says: check it out.  I'm rfrancis there as usual.



Segment 3:



Nick Mamatas, who's been interviewed on here a time or two and whose books Move Under Ground and Under My Roof I continue to whole-heartedly recommend, has a new -- well, publically new -- service available for writers, aspiring and otherwise.  Let me quote you some scanty details from his livejournal post on the subject:



"Anyway, here is how it works . if you have a manuscript, I'll read it for mere $2 a page, mark it up with insightful and hysterical marginal comments, write an extensive editorial letter, and have a conversation with you over phone, IM, or email, about revisions and marketing."



and from his FAQ:



"You email me at nick.mamatas@gmail.com asking for the service -- we talk about your goals and a deadline. I give you my address and you ship to me your ms in standard manuscript format along with half the fee. Then I meet your deadline and send you the ms back, email you the editorial letter, and then we talk about your work some more. Then you send me the rest of the fee."



Some of you might know that Nick is also the editor at Clarkesworld online magazine, and having submitted a story there and gotten his critique back, I have to say it's amongst the most useful I've ever gotten, up there with Gordon van Gelder of F&amp;SF at least.  And I wasn't paying him for that.  Many, many people have reported the same.  So I have to think that Nick is offering something really beneficial here.  Yes, to send him your 500 page fantasy epic you're going to have to cough up a grand, but cripes, getting extensive editorial input from a professional?  That's gold if you're trying to beat the hoi polloi into publication.  Anyway, something that might interest some of you, and if I direct some dollars Nick's way, well, we all go home happy.  Livejournal link's here.

Gmail, yes. Google Calendar, yes. Google Reader, yes. Google Docs, absolutely. Google Notebook... well, no. Not any more, that is. Not since Steve of the Wicked Good Podcast turned me on to Evernote on a day where I could land an invite code to their beta. Not that Evernote is new, exactly. It's existed as Mac and PC applications, I believe, for some time, but that didn't interest me, as I use several machines and I need to be able to get to my notes from all of them equally well. That's why the version 3 beta got my attention -- it has a web version as well, and if you use the application versions, which I do, they synchronize with the web hosted central version, giving you something that is and is not a web app, but at any rate is synchronized across multiple locations. Compare this to Google Notebook, which is a web app and only a web app, which is fine until you're not on a network and want to dig into your notebook. There are other upsides as well, though. Evernote handles images very nicely, and, even more impressive, can search text in the images through, one assumes, the magic of OCR or somesuch. This turns out to be more than just a gimmick; it's darned useful. You can also encrypt notes, which is pretty cool of course, and of course there's the obligatory tagging, but also saved searches, which I quite like in principle. You can embed checkboxes in your notes to make, well, checklists, and indeed, this is how I do project lists now and it's a real boon. Are there downsides? Yes. I'm very frustrated by the lack of a Linux application, particularly when I'm on my Asus Eee. Yes, I can go to the web-based version, IF I'm on a network, but that kind of defeats the whole portability point of using it on the Eee, plus the web interface is... not so great, in my opinion, and it wastes an enormous amount of screen real estate which is of course a scarce commodity on the Asus. The Windows app has some quirky behavior but nothing you don't get used to... eventually. But it works very solidly and the features are excellent. Worth finding someone with an invite. Final comment: my notes for this show were, of course, typed and stored in Evernote. Among many, many other things. Segment 2: I've discovered plurk.com, and believe me, saying plurk out loud makes it all worthwhile. plurk plurk plurk. Anyway, what is plurk, you may ask? Well, more or less it's a competitor for twitter, I suppose, conveniently rising in prominence about the time twitter's having downtime struggles. Again. But it's not just a clone by any means; plurk has a unique presentation of messages, putting abbreviated forms on a scrolling timeline that to be honest I just can't quite describe. Additionally, it has excellent features twitter lacks, such as a permissions system whereby you can make subgroups of your friends and lock messages to particular groups; for another example, instead of users forming a convention for replying to posts, plurks have comment lists almost like blog posts. One more thing that really sells it for me is the very simple thing of autoupdating the page title with unread message counts, making it easy to just leave plurk open in a tab and glance at the tab title for new messages, instead of pounding reload on a page all day or whatever. Sure, this basically means that plurk was made learning from the lessons twitter got the hard way. So what? It works. Will it survive enormous usage in a way twitter hasn't so much? Time will tell if the question even arises. It's had occasional downtime due to the speed at which they're developing, but it's been brief and seems to be getting less frequent. Random says: check it out. I'm rfrancis there as usual.
