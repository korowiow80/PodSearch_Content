<p><font size="2"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">First, let's define a TeleWebinar. A
TeleWebinar is, simply put, a seminar conducted on the telephone and
the web at the same time. A TeleWebinar allows a presenter to use
telephone conferencing to present their material live for all to hear
and at the same time provide visual content for their participants in
the form of a slide presentation.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">A TeleWebinar allows you to conduct your
business more efficiently by sharing your message in your own way. Your
Business, Your Message, Your Way. For more information visit our
website <a href="http://www.telewebinars.com/">http://www.telewebinars.com/</a></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Small Business Financing:</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2"></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2">Business financing and Working Capital can make or break a small business in a competitve market. The selection begins usually with selecting type of financing or finance company (lender). Some business will choose a business loan provider based on requirements or interest rates/fess. Other businesses, like merchants that <a href="http://www.processusa.com">process credit cards</a> can apply for an alternative loan product based on credit card sales: merchant cash advance. business cash advances for merchants are a unique financing opportunity that allows merchants to borrow against future sales. It depends totally on credit card processing volume and is not available to business that do not process even if revenue is based on <a href="http://www.techchecks.net">business checks for Quickbooks</a>.  </font></p>

<img src="images/pulsorlogo.jpg" align="left" width="182" height="50"></strong>Have
you ever attended a motivational seminar, got all hyped up, came home
with the best of intentions only to have that little voice in the back
of your head remind you of all the reasons why you can't reach that
higher Purpose?<br>
Let's face it, if attending a seminar or reading a book could take you
to a higher level, chances are you would already be there.<br>
The problem is your mind. Your mind was taught from early childhood the
phrase "You Can't". You can't fly, You can't win, You can't do it. So
when you try and reach your higher purpose, your mind screams "You
Can't".<br>

Have we got a show for you!&nbsp; And we truly do.&nbsp; This is The
Turning Point, a brand spanking new podcast program that showcases
IBI-ers; who they are, what they do, how IBI has made a difference for
them and what they are doing to give back to IBI and the people who
attend.&nbsp; Rick Stewart (with an amazing voice and high energy) is
the host of this program and on this, the premier episode, his guest is
Kelly Hammett of LuxCents, Inc. (<strong><a href="http://www.luxcents.com/">Luxcents.com</a></strong>).&nbsp;
Kelly is just as high energy as Rick so the two have a wonderful,
upbeat conversation that makes the listener feel just as
optimistic.&nbsp; Kelly is the founder and president of LuxCents, a
company that shows people how to live a life of luxury on a budget- and
wouldn't we all like to be able to do that!<br>
<strong><a href="http://www.businesstobusinessradio.com/audiofiles/khammett060911.mp3"><font color="#ba9830">Click here to listen to Kelly and Rick</font></a></strong>
as they explore the power of networking in a cooperative instead of a
competitive milieu.&nbsp; And ‘stay tuned' for the next "The Turning
Point" program where Rick will be interviewing another successful
IBI-er.</div>
