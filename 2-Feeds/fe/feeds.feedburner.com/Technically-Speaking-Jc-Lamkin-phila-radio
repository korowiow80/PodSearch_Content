EncryptaKey
Identity protection, anytime, anywhere
Each year over 10 million Americans discover that their personal information has been used to open fraudulent accounts. With identity theft costs estimated to be tens of billions annually, it is no wonder that this has become a major issue for both individuals and organizations. The EncryptaKey solution is specifically designed to protect user identity anytime, anywhere. Its two implementations include protection for both online and in-person transactions across multiple markets and industries. The end result is a solution that effectively eliminates the risk of identity theft and fraud for both individuals and participating organizations.

The principle of Net Neutrality and regulations designed to support the neutrality of the internet have been subject to vociferous debate in various forums. Since the early 2000s, advocates of Net Neutrality rules have warned of the danger that broadband providers will use their power over the last mile to block applications they do not favor, and also to discriminate between content providers (i.e. websites, services, protocols), particularly competitors. Neutrality proponents also claim that telecom companies seek to impose the tiered service model more for the purpose of profiting from their control of the pipeline rather than for any demand for their content or services.[4] Others have stated that they believe net neutrality to be primarily important as a preservation of current freedoms.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Technically-Speaking-Jc-Lamkin-phila-radio/~4/lKhTC2FYAI4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>
