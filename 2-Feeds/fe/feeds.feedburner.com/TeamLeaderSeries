      <title>Team Leader: a dark office comedy</title>
      <description>Team Leader is a dark comedy about two hipster office slackers who show up late (as usual) only to find their overworked team leader dead, with a big annual client presentation right around the corner. As the deadline approaches like a noose lightening around their necks, they lay everything on the line, including their friendship, in a ridiculously brilliant scheme to save the company. 12 part video series.</description>
