<p><em>If you do a lot of your work on a computer, I don&#8217;t have to tell you how hard it is to stay focused on your tasks. Too much distraction and lack of focus may often lead to procrastination and loss of motivation&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>In this guest post by Ashlee McCullen (of <a href="http://apronaddicts.com">ApronAddicts.com</a>), you may find out about computer applications that can help you stay focused on your work by eliminating distractions.</em> <small>(Photo by <a title="(Tom's Flickr photostream)" href="http://www.flickr.com/people/thomasjoy/">Tom Joy</a>)</small></p>
<p><a title="11 Computer Apps that Eliminate Distractions" href="http://energyandmotivation.com/6041/apps-to-stay-focused/"> <img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6058" src="http://energyandmotivation.com/wp-content/uploads/iphone.jpg" alt="iphone" width="350" height="233" /></a>Because of their efficiencies, computers make tasks ranging from communication to number-crunching lightning-fast&#8230;</p>
<p>But they also make checking social networks, looking at <a href="http://www.videobash.com/photos">awesome pics</a>, and browsing Reddit.com just as easy. All you need to do in a modern browser is type “f,” and it’ll likely fill in “acebook.com,” adding to your temptations.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, I wanted to share a few apps that are designed to eliminate distractions while you work, or at least help you achieve better focus. (That said, it is important to take strategic breaks.) This list is admittedly Mac-centric, but I’ll point out options for Windows users, as well. <span id="more-6041"></span></p>
<h3>Isolator and ClutterCloak</h3>
<p>Isolator is a simple Mac program that offers a measure of peace among what is normally a sea of overlapping windows. Install this <a href="http://willmore.eu/software/isolator/">free program</a>, and turn it on to darken your entire screen except for the window you’re currently working on. You’ll still see your menu bar, but at least your dock and other open programs are out of sight. You’ll be able to think better with a clear working space, and you’ll be less tempted to absent-mindedly open your browser or check your e-mail.</p>
<p>For the same functionality on Windows, try <a href="http://tomcooke.me.uk/?page_id=5">ClutterCloak</a>.</p>
<h3>WriteRoom and DarkRoom</h3>
<p>Released well before the Mac offered full-screen apps, <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">WriteRoom</a> was a pioneer and has spawned imitators. This extremely simple word processor offers the ability to write on a plain black background that takes up your entire screen.</p>
<p>No bouncing e-mail programs. No distracting formatting buttons. Just you and the text. I find WriteRoom fantastic for penning first drafts, as it helps me devote my focus to my writing. Later, I can jazz up an article in Word, but it’s nice having an option as simple as WriteRoom.</p>
<p>Windows users can check out <a href="http://bestuff.com/stuff/darkroom">DarkRoom</a>.</p>
<h3>E-Mail and Social Media Tips and Tools</h3>
<p>As central as e-mail is to what I do, it can be a time-suck as much as a productivity tool.</p>
<p>To keep my account from nagging me, I turned off desktop alerts in Outlook. Then, I created an <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2323494_create-email-rules-microsoft-outlook.html">email rule</a> that alerts me if e-mails arrive from a small group of co-workers. This way I can have the best of both worlds: Not being distracted by unhelpful messages, but still knowing when important ones arrive.</p>
<p>On a related note, I highly recommend you turn off all social media account e-mail notifications and instead use<a href="http://nutshellmail.com/"> NutshellMail</a> to keep up with your accounts. This free service provides a daily e-mail with updates for my Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn accounts, including new followers and private messages.</p>
<p>Finally, I recommend the excellent <a href="http://hootsuite.com/">Hootsuite social media dashboard</a>. Instead of breaking up your workday to tweet or post on Facebook, schedule posts in advance with this online and app-based tool.</p>
<h3>Browser Plugins: Safari, Chrome, and Firefox</h3>
<p>These days, web browsers are just as important productivity and creation tools as the MS Office Suite, if not more so. That said, it’s easy to get distracted when you’re trying to get serious things done on one.</p>
<p>For Safari users, I strongly recommend “<a href="http://www.mindfulbrowsing.com/">Mindful Browsing</a>.” Once I installed the program and inputted sites to block, I was surprised at how often I would see the plugin’s gateway screen. It turns out my visiting these sites was almost an instinct, just like smoking and overeating are for many people.</p>
<p>Google Chrome users should check out <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji">StayFocused</a> and Firefox users have an excellent option in <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/">LeechBlock</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Wunderlist</strong></h4>
<p>Without a good system for capturing tasks, organizing them, and reviewing them, you may feel a sense of uncertainty. At least, that’s the premise behind the <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done">Getting Things Done</a> system, which I find to be excellent.</p>
<p>By using a task manager like <a href="http://www.wunderlist.com">Wunderlist</a>, you can take out the uncertainty of knowing what you need to do now and what you need to do next. That in turn will give you an in-the-moment focus that will make you more productive and less likely to be distracted.</p>
<p>I choose Wunderlist because it’s multi-platform and lies within the mid-range between simple and complex to-do programs. (I recommend staying away from to-do programs that are too simple. It’s vital to be able to create a list for what you’re doing now and to keep unrelated tasks out of sight.)</p>

<p style="font-size: small; font-weight: bold;">(by Susan Smith Johns, PhD)</p>
<p>If you often feel like the demands of your everyday lifestyle exceed your ability to handle them, you’re absolutely not alone, as I pointed out in many places in the pages of my new book <a href="http://www.susansmithjones.com/joy-factor-10-sacred-practices-radiant-health"><em><strong>The Joy Factor: 10 Sacred Practices for Radiant Health</strong></em></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevenpepple/4236801741/" title="Stressed out by Steve Pepple, on Flickr"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4068/4236801741_d8f9f274da.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="Stressed out"></a>The state of feeling “stressed out” and “over-committed” is a developing difficulty among hundreds of thousands of Americans&#8230;<br />
<em></em></p>
<p><em>Time</em> magazine may have identified stress as the “Epidemic of the Eighties,” but that was far prior to the Net and social media considerably sped up the activity of most people’s lives, and the extended wars and global economic troubles at the turn of the 21st century piled on further woes.</p>
<p>Today, over one million people in America are absentees on any given workday owing to stress and stress-related illnesses and 79%-90% of all visits to primary health-care professionals in The USA are due to stress-related illnesses or complaints.</p>
<p><span id="more-5778"></span></p>
<p>As I have stated in my new booklet/CD combo, <em><strong>Natural Stress Solutions</strong></em>, a convenient pocket guide to <a href="http://www.susansmithjones.com/natural-stress-solutions" target="_blank">natural stress relief</a>, in mankind’s prehistoric days roaming the plains and living in caves, the stress response was actually a a good thing&#8230;</p>
<p>Our built-in “fight or flight” instinct offered our bodies with the energy necessary to avert hazard or procure scarce food and other essentials. However that form of high-intensity, short-term stress was useful for our survival, our bodies were not intended to stand up to the variety of continual, long-term stress which is so common today.</p>
<p>The same release of human hormones launched for the duration of a physically stressful situation (such as fleeing away from a lion) is additionally launched when we undergo a emotional stressor such as conflict in marriage, unreasonable work demands, and financial worries.</p>
<p>The distinction is that we typically don&#8217;t react to these sorts of chronic stressors with vigorous physical activity (e.g. fighting or running away), and they do not possess a clear end point. Thus, our bodies may be ceaselessly exposed to stress hormones, particularly cortisol, and over time, this can add up to serious health problems.</p>
<p>How does persistent stress affect our lives? Keep reading&#8230;</p>
<h3>The Effects of Chronic Stress</h3>
<p>Continual stress has an effect on every single aspect of our physical and mental well-being. Research studies have shown that being under extended stress can lead to weight gain, exhaustion, fluctuations in blood sugar, bone loss, a reduced immune response, and anxiety/ depression symptoms.</p>
<p>Possessing steadily raised ranges of the stress hormone cortisol has been connected to the advancement of inflammatory diseases, insulin resistance, diabetes, excessive weight gain, and heart disease.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that due to the challenges of lifestyle in the twenty first century, we&#8217;re not likely to see a decrease in Americans&#8217; total stress load anytime soon. And of course, there&#8217;s no magic &#8220;pill&#8221; which one can swallow to fully eliminate stress and protect his or her body from its damaging results.</p>
<p>In fact, &#8220;self-medicating&#8221; with substances like tobacco and alcohol, though supplying short-term feelings of relaxation, can worsen negative health outcomes.</p>
<h3>Stress Management</h3>
<p>Health professionals generally recommend patients to discover approaches to lessen stressors in their lives and apply stress-management methods.</p>
<p>In my booklet<em> Stress Solutions: Discover Nature&#8217;s Secret to Inner Calm, Restful Sleep &amp; Newfound Energy</em>, I assess some of the most effective stress-reducing strategies, such as eating a nutritious diet, receiving enough rest, working out regularly, and incorporating relaxation routines for example, meditation and yoga.</p>
<p>However, the irony of recommending stress-management methods is that quite a few of individuals who endure most from chronic stress don&#8217;t have the time or wherewithal to apply them&#8230;</p>
<p>If you are stressed to your breaking point, you may ask, how could you ever have time to incorporate yoga or additional hours of rest into your everyday way of life?</p>
<h3>Natural Relief from Stress</h3>
<p>That&#8217;s where herbs appear in. The aim of any stress-reducing plan is to diminish the body&#8217;s exposure to constantly high quantities of the stress hormone Cortisol.</p>
<p>Though that can be attained through way of life adjustments, it can also be hastened by music, foods, natural herbs, spices, drinking water and a wide variety of other adjustments that I specify in my new publications <em>The Joy Factor</em> and <em>Walking on Air</em>,<em> </em>in my Natural Remedy booklets, and additionally in my popular-around-the-globe, complete compendium package deal <em>Renew Your Life</em>.</p>
<p>The cornucopia of stress-busting suggestions discussed in all of these titles can assist you to maintain cortisol ranges in an optimal range, even when a individual is experiencing stress. That can appreciably help mitigate the adverse health impacts of stressors in our lives that we simply cannot set aside.</p>
<p>Best of all, when you change to nature&#8217;s medication chest and simplify your life, you can find relief naturally and with no dangerous side effects associated with recreational drugs and many prescription drugs.</p>

<p style="font-size: small;">(by Barrie St John of <a href="http://www.hypnoshop.com/">HypnoShop.com</a>)</p>
<p>We all know that positive thinking and being optimistic  about life is better for us than being a bad tempered misery guts; it’s better  for our health, and optimists generally have a happier time of it… but saying  and doing are very different things, aren’t they?!</p>
<p>It’s not as though just sitting there saying,  “Oh, everything will be fine!” is enough to actually change the thoughts in  your head which are probably closer to, “What if I fail? What if it all goes  wrong? What if he thinks I’m boring? What if she doesn’t like me? What if  something awful happens?”</p>
<p>And you’ve probably already come across the idea of positive  affirmations&#8230;</p>
<p>They may well have their place in an attempt to think positively.  But can just telling yourself in the mirror each morning, “I am a confident,  positive person” really change anything all by itself? In reality, no.</p>
<p><span id="more-5741"></span></p>
<p>It’s  true that positive affirmations like this can be helpful as part of an overall  strategy, and whether or not we really believe them, simply hearing them often  enough can begin to shift the focus of how we feel and think, but there are  definitely more efficient ways to create a positive and productive outlook on  life, and hypnosis is one of the most effective ones.</p>
<h4>So how can hypnosis help to create and maintain a positive  mental attitude?</h4>
<p>By counteracting the things that create and maintain negative,  pessimistic attitudes!</p>
<p><strong>The biggest contributor to a negative attitude is  negative self-talk.</strong> We often spend so much time and energy doing ourselves  down, criticising and complaining, that there’s no room left for positive  thoughts!</p>
<p>If you imagine the thoughts that busily rampage through your mind  most of the time… aren’t many of them to do with how stupid you are, what a  mess you always make of things, how awful the world is, how things never work  out right, how difficult it is going to be to solve the problems you’re dealing  with…</p>
<p>So one of the fundamental things that <a href="http://www.hypnoshop.com/">hypnosis</a> can do is to  slow down our thoughts, clear our minds and give them some quiet breathing  space. Then hypnosis can proceed to fill that space with calm, relaxing,  positive images and thoughts.</p>
<p>One of the core aspects of almost all hypnosis sessions or recordings  is the development of <strong>calmness, relaxation and confidence&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Think about it – if  you feel calm, relaxed and confident, how can you possibly feel negative,  anxious or worried at the same time?</p>
<p>Even the simplest of hypnosis sessions  will help to engender this feeling of calmness, relaxation and confidence. Programming yourself in this way at the beginning of each day or last thing  before sleep will help you maintain a calm, confident and unruffled approach  towards whatever life might throw at you&#8230;</p>
<p>Somehow things that would normally  bother you just don’t bother you as much as they have before. Things that have  worried you just don’t worry you as much as before. People don’t annoy or upset  you as much as before. And the more this happens, the easier it is to be  positive and relaxed about life in general.</p>
<p>If there are particular aspects of life, or specific events  which cause you deep anxiety, a hypnosis session can be tailored to also focus  on this particular thing, giving you tools and techniques that you can  immediately tap into when you need them.</p>
<p>But you might be amazed at how the  regular use of a simple calmness, relaxation and confidence session or  recording can change how you function on a day to day basis.</p>
<p>At worst, you’ll  experience a deep level of relaxation and tranquillity during the session that  hasn’t been present in your life before.</p>
<p>At best, your whole attitude to life  will improve and you’ll find yourself coping with the problems life throws at  you in a calm, confident and positive way.</p>
<p>So what’s to lose? Why not give it a  try, and discover the positive mental attitude that therapeutic hypnosis can bring  to your life?</p>
<p>So if you’re stuck in negative patterns, if you keep trying to change, but don’t seem to be able to, you might want to let hypnosis be the catalyst for you too.</p>

<p><a title="Visit AbundanceTapestry.com " href="http://www.abundancetapestry.com/how-to-be-positive-all-the-time/">How to be Positive All the Time »</a></p>
<p>If you ask me, the most important skill you should develop (mentioned in the article) in order to stay positive almost all the time is the skill of <strong><em>awareness</em></strong>&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-5698"></span>When you&#8217;re constantly aware of your thoughts, emotions and actions you can be in control. You can change your perspective on things and you can constantly improve your thought patterns, your habits and what Tony Robbins calls your &#8220;Emotional Fitness&#8221;.</p>
<p>In my comment on the article I mention a technique I learned from one of Tony Robbin&#8217;s seminar recordings (that I&#8217;ve listened to several times). He calls it <strong>&#8220;turning frustration into fascination&#8221;</strong>. I use it a lot.</p>
<p>At first it feels a bit unnatural, but once you get the hang of it, you can automatically see obstacles, problems and failures in a sense of intense curiosity, like&#8230;</p>
<p><em>&#8220;wow, isn&#8217;t it interesting how it didn&#8217;t work&#8230; I wonder why this happened&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p>instead of:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;damn, why isn&#8217;t it working for me?!&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em></em>I suggest that you try it a few times (and tell me how it worked for you&#8230;)</p>
