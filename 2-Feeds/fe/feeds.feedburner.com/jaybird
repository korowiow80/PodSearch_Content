			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry guys, yes I am saying sorry been so busy the past week that I have not been able to update my details for you guys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Night Rating:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since my last posting I let you guys know of my night adventure over Gauteng and being able to see the night skies, the bustling cars on the streets below, and the city lights mapping its way over the scenery. This was the last step on my way to getting my rating, I did my prep test on the Tuesday where we spent nearly two hours in the General flying area practicing steep turns, descending turns, limited panel, unusual attitudes all with those evil <a href="http://www.jaybird.co.za/?p=328">foggles</a> I told you about in the very beginning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the test came and we pretty much did everything that I did in the test prep and passed with flying colours, I am now rated to fly at night and give you guys pictures to everything I see from the air. What took me nearly 5 months, of which not all the time waiting was my fault, R30 000 +-, and nearly 20 odd hours I can officially have my piece of paper printed saying Night Rating as seen below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So here I am sitting at 06:00am updating my blog, and yawning from left to right. Today my leave is over and it is back to work, something has to pay for this expensive hobby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Any way, I think you guys want to know how the night flight went rather than me sitting here talking gibberish. Well the whole thing happened on Thursday, I rocked up to the flying school early so that I could get in the mind set. On getting there I learned the Internet was down so no exams, and then my instructor sent me an <span>sms</span> telling me to change one of my legs that I was flying, not the coolest thing in the world but it had to be done.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I changed my leg from Pilansberg to Lanseria, instead of routing back to Harties like we had planned, we would route directly to Lanseria. In the meantime while waiting, we had to come up with a plan to write my exam. One of the ladies had a USB speed stick, so we purchased some data and I got to write my Night Rating exam which I passed with 82%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thereafter I got ready for my night flight, I prepped the plane and made sure it was refueled, windscreen cleaned and the oil topped-up. All the lights were working as they should, and instruments checked. This was going to be a good flight, now to wait for sunset. During the time I filled in our ground speed we would have expected en route and calculated the time for the flight. My instructor phoned <span>Pilansburg</span> for weather conditions and our hearts dropped, their systems had crashed to their automatic landing light system was not working, dammit. So we decided to wait while they rebooted and checked the problem. Lucky for us, 15 minutes later we phoned and presto the lights were once again working.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We taxied down to the holding point for runway 11, after departure clearance given as routing along the magalies ridge to Rosslyn, climbing to 6000 feet. Carried out the power checks for the plane and finally we were rolling away 10 minutes later, eyes in the cockpit <img src='http://www.jaybird.co.za/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jaybird.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/flight.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-505" title="flight" src="http://www.jaybird.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/flight.jpg" alt="" width="1161" height="743" /></a></p>
<p><span>So we routed along the ridge and soon enough said goodbye to <span>Wonderboom</span>, overhead <span>Rosslyn</span> we tuned into the VOR HBV, basically it&#8217;s a radio device on the ground that sends out a frequency, you are able to fly a certain heading to the station and actually track your deviation either left or right of the track you selected. So we flew our track to <span>harties</span> and on the way the lights of the city slowly started to fade into the distance. We got to the VOR and set our new track to <span>Pilansberg</span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>On the way to <span>Pilansberg</span>, everything started fading away. Instead of the sprawling suburbs of Pretoria you now had townships spaced every 5km apart from each other and in between you had these large expanses of complete darkness. We got to FAPN and thankfully the lights were working, this is one field I have lots of respect for when landing. Because there are no lights in the vicinity your judgement of height varies, and you can come in much shallower than expected. The key to fighting this is to rely on a light system to the left of the runway, which indicates your <span>glideslope</span>, or your descent onto the field.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We then flew our way onto Lanseria, again tracking a VOR in the distance. Nothing spectacular happened except for having to make way for the bigger planes, especially when you hear over the radio, Comair on finale for runway and you know they operate a nice set of Boeing 737&#8242;s. We did a touch and go at Lanseria with no problems and headed over to the west for a short 7 minute flight to Grand Central. FAGC was not a problem either, we established circuit and came in for a nice landing. This runway being a bit screwed up because in the middle of the runway is a hill, so you cannot see the end threshold. Once over the hill you know you have to put full power and start climbing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We got up safely and started routing back to <span>Wonderboom</span>. We routed through <span>Waterkloof</span> AFB and followed the N1 back to Pretoria. One thing I will admit is Pretoria is very pretty from the Air, it has rows and rows of little lights, with these bright lights zooming among them. We also saw a major accident on the N1, in the distance a whole set of red flashing lights, probably 8 ambulances at least.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We got to <span>Wonderboom</span> overhead the field, set up for a left circuit onto runway 11, and landed her like a dream, Taxied back to the flying school and <span>Booya</span> <span>Ja</span>, I just did my Night Navigation flight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next in line for me is my test prep tomorrow night, and then Thursday I will be doing my Night Test, so wish me luck. I will take pictures after the show and will definitely write up on it, until then and as always, Many happy landings !!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well my cross country flight for my school reunion kind of died a very quick death, I was supposed to fly a 5 hour Navigation flight from Wonderboom, through to Bloemfontein and then on the Queenstown. This didn&#8217;t happen because all the planes are in the shop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lucky for me as one of the planes is flying again and I can finally carry on with my night rating. What is even better is the fact that I took some leave from work so that I could sit down and hit the books, you see the Civil Aviation Authority requires me to write an online exam at the flying school. These exams are multiple choice with one answer obviously being the correct one and the pass rate for the whole thing is 75%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I owe my gratitude and thanks to Ray Swales who provides mock exams for Pilots to practice these multiple choice questions, it helped me through my Private Pilot exams and now I am using the same thing to get through my night rating, visit his site at <a title="Swales" href="http://swales.co.za/" target="_blank">Swales Mock Exams</a> and be sure to find it helpful. I am soon going to be relying on the same thing for my Commercial exams in the near future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the exams I am also going to be doing my cross country night flight, which will be from Wonderboom, Pilanesberg, Lanseria, Grand Central and then back to Wonderboom, I will post pictures if possible and be sure to check back for an update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until then Happy Landings !!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mugg &amp; Bean Monte Casino, well where do I start with this one. I carried out a nice little experiment, I am not extremelly rich but I enjoy M&amp;B because I can get cheap bottomless coffee and use the internet at the same time so that I can update my various pages and blogs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I walked in to the shop and ordered my first coffee and started my laptop up, I know if I drink to much coffee I will get a buzz and start climbing up the walls speaking pig Latin almost. So I just sat, one waiter after the next walked past, my cup was bone dry. At one point I even turned the cup over and to my surprise I still got no reaction. And just so you know I do not believe in flagging down a waiter, I was taught to create a relationship with my customers from the word go, and I believe this to stand at any establishment I visit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally flagged a waiter down and asked for the manager but not a minute to late where I was nearly convulsing at the mouth. But I guess that is the service you get as a crew cut, blue eyed boy who sits with his laptop in the corner. Even though I might not have a lot of money I sure do tip well sometimes. I have been a waiter before, so look after me and I will look after you, it is called investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was offered food on the house, but it is not the point I don&#8217;t want free food, I just want basic service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the pics, 1) The time I waited before I flagged down the manager, 2) What they do in the morning when they tend to be waking up from the slumber.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ok so quick update on my flying, well nothing much actually. I am still waiting for both night planes to come back into working order so that I can carry on with my Night Rating, something that should have only taken 5 weeks max !! So in the meantime I have been keeping current by carrying out my circuits, and also taking Lloyd up for a quick cross country to Bela Bela and then onto Brits where we diverted back to Wonderboom due to weather build up in the area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for my website, it seems it is slowly getting more coverage on google search engine as I am getting more and more emails from students regarding the use of my flight establishment, unbeknownst to them is that my site is a blog. But who am I to turn them away, sent them some emails to try and get them on the right track. That is the whole purpose of my website is to educate and show people what flying is all about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However until some major flying gets under way I wish you a wonderful Easter Weekend with the family and hope you all make the best of it, till then happy landings !!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South African Airways has publicly announced that they will be introducing a flight academy to supplement the shortage of pilots currently faced within the company. They will be aiming at training between 150 to 200 pilots per year for this very reason, you can read the article <a href="http://www.fin24.com/Companies/TravelAndLeisure/SAA-reopens-pilot-academy-20120319">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course this has stirred the fruit bowl here in South Africa where the current aviation employment is very stagnant, and people have very mixed reactions. These reactions range from an understanding for the need of change, something to compliment the aviation industry with intellectual African lads, to people who feel that this programme is very one sided and does not support everybody in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am probably one of those young people, I understand the need for transformation in our country, the need to &#8220;equal&#8221; the playing fields and to bring the previously disadvantaged up to par with the country. However the one thing that really saddens me is this grudge seems to be dragging on, each and every time we keep referring and looking back on apartheid. I was born in 1988 and still in diapers to have any significant contribution to apartheid, my parents although white under the regime did not benefit from any hand-me-outs, my father built his workshop from the ground up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To this day the tables have definitely turned, and the playing fields no longer support proper development of this country. The elite become richer by the day, the middle class keep rolling along each day and the poor become poorer with each passing day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I struggle to see past the lines, I live in a student area rich in culture and racial differences, and each day I see more and more people of colour living the life of luxury. If you don&#8217;t believe me go and see for yourself, from BMX X1s to Ipad2s, not to mention DSTV - satellite TV for every commune in the area. I drive to work these days and every person of colour I see is driving the latest Audi or Merc, or they are able to go and eat lunch at News Cafe each day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here I stand as the minority who is unable to see one cent of any educational fund provided in this country, I phoned to query about TETA funding and was blatantly asked if i was a white lad, of which the answer was that I would never get the funding. Let us try scholarships, nope same answer. So my question is how will SAA flight academy assist in this transformation ?? What are my chances ??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I have the most amazing black mates you could ever ask for, and I have had the most of the best conversations with some black guys out there who have worked for every cent that they have earned. But the current program is a vicious cycle that only helps people who are in the program, and if we are going to build a better country we must consider that any person who needs help regardless of colour should be an ideal candidate, and after aptitude tests and interviews the best person should get the foot in the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we will have to see what happens in the next year or two, and I must applaud SAA for starting the program it is a good initiative but they must consider fair intake of students, current pilots looking for employment, and the general aviation industry as a whole. I will apply towards the programme as I did last year, and once again I will hold my thumbs, but I do have my doubts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check <a href="http://www.avcom.co.za/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=92651">Avcom</a> for the list of the whole dog fight regarding people&#8217;s views on the program.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So this Sunday I had nothing better to do so I decided to head over to the Monte Casino Bird Gardens to go visit our feathery friends of nature. I did not walk among the whole park but managed to catch a glimpse of the different enclosures with the variety of different animals the have, their motto all implies this: &#8220;Inspired to Conserve&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to<a href="http://www.montecasino.co.za/entertainment/family/Bird%20Gardens/Pages/flight_of_fantasy.aspx"> Flight of Fantasy</a> show which takes place in their Tuscan Amphitheater which shows their colourful and talented show birds with breathtaking displays of unrestrained flight. Be sure to visit the show and have an educational experience of these birds and their behaviors, you won&#8217;t be disappointed !!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was driving to Monte Casino with a friend at around 06:00 on Sunday morning and came across a lovely cloud formation, and yes as a Pilot I am also fascinated by the formation of weather. The clouds on top are Cirrus clouds, and the ones underneath are Stratus of some kind, but due to the wind blowing at the cloud front it was almost forming a carpet with bubbles, very interesting to see.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As promised an update of my flying to this date, you guys have to excuse me unfortunately because it is pretty difficult trying to explain all these things and write it down on paper, so just work with me while we go along.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started the night rating during February and in the last letter you saw that I had to wear the evil foggles of doom. They are not actually that bad to tell you the truth and they had taught me a valuable lesson in flying. Even though it is such a small amount of instrument flying you learn to trust what your instruments are telling you. The last season we did with foggles was abnormal attitudes, in simple terms the aircraft has a high nose pitch or a low nose pitch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With entry into these attitudes I had to close my eyes with the instructor doing a serious of steep turns, climbs and descends, it literally felt like you were doing a barrel roll, or you were flying inverted. It is probably the weirdest feeling you will ever feel. Then she shouts open your eyes, you glaze over at the airspeed 160knots and climbing !! You close the power, ease out of the dive and as you cross the vertical horizon you add power and climb out. Aaah yes very scary if you don&#8217;t watch your instruments, and good experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next was for the circuit training <img src='http://www.jaybird.co.za/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  I pre-checked the plane, made sure everything that should work is working, and of course both landing and taxi lights were fully functional according to the law. We pushed back just after sunset and started her up, making sure to switch on the Nav lights (coloured lights on wing tips, and rudder indicating aircraft direction in the air at night), and landing lights. We taxied to the holding point for runway 11 and carried out all our checks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cleared for take-off, we taxied onto the runway and was told to make a mental note of where the lights cut the windscreen, check. Add full power and start rolling down the runway, 55knots start rotating. Climbing away, eyes in the cockpit watching the instruments. Ha Ha this is so much fun !! We reached circuit altitude and turned onto crosswind and then on downwind. (Both reporting positions in the circuit)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first landing was touch and go, I came down on the glide path and as we reach the runway eyes went to the end of the runway and checked the lights rising, just before cutting the windscreen, throttle closed and flare the aircraft and hold her off until she touch down. Booya, touch down, flaps up and full throttle, heading around for the next one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next few landings were uneventful and the next circuit I did abnormal approaches, these consisted of full flaps &#8211; much steeper approach onto the runway with near full throttle added to prevent stalling, no flaps &#8211; much shallower approach coming in at a high speed for crosswind landings, and then the fun one, landing with no landing lights. I carried out my normal checks on downwind and did not turn on the landing lights. You come in for a normal approach, flaps 20 degrees, approach speed 65knots, and on the glide slope. Upon reaching the runway you have no idea how high you are, the only reference you have is your edge lights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you come in at your normal glide slope, and just as you reach the runway you let the edge lights cut your windscreen, as they get to the point you visually marked you start to flare, holding her off. Still you cannot see the ground, and then suddenly you feeling this soft thud, you add brakes and keep the pressure off the nose wheel, Yes !! Managed to land a plane with landing light !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So got some night circuits under my belt, and some night flying experience. Next on my list of things to do, one more circuit, a nav flight across Jo-burg at night, test prep and then my night flying test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also before I leave you I managed to get some circuits in on Saturday morning. Four to be exact on JVH. Unfortunately JVH is not my favorite plane and her movements are very quick which does not allow the plane time to stabilize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My circuits were also shocking to say the least, every time I came over the threshold to land, my plane would catch a tailwind even though the surface wind indicated a headwind. This would cause me to float along the runway without landing, or I would come in at a nice 65 knot glide and then my speed would jump all of a sudden to 75 knots and then decrease to a dangerous speed of 55knots. So yes it was a very fun day in the circuits, very valuable lesson learnt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any way enough from me, hope you enjoy the post, if you did not feel free to tell me otherwise below, till next time happy flying !!!</p>
