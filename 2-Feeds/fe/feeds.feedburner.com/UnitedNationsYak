The foundation made the announcement today on International Women’s Day to acknowledge the invisible role of older women in maintaining the welfare of families, communities and food production across the developing world.</p>
<p>“The world is aging.  By 2015, nearly 900 million people will be older than age 60, which is close to three times the population of the United States. Nearly 190 million older people live in poverty with more than 100 million living on less than $1 a day,” said Steven M. Hilton, CEO and president of the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation.  “As the world prepares for this monumental demographic shift, HelpAge is showing us that it is important to recognize and support older people so they can continue to be contributing and productive members of society.”</p>
<p>Richard Blewitt, chief executive officer of HelpAge International, said, “Receiving the Hilton Prize is a great honor.  It is especially meaningful to draw the world’s attention to the historic transformation being brought about by global aging and the plight of millions of older people who face overwhelming financial, social and health hurdles every day.  HelpAge believes the whole world benefits when we tap the substantial wisdom and talents of older people and enable them to lead dignified, active, healthy and secure lives.”</p>
<p>Women make up the majority of older people around the world—nearly two thirds of those over age 80 are women.  Many older women in developing countries are not only the economic providers for families, but frequently they are the sole caregivers of AIDS-orphaned grandchildren.  In Kenya alone, there are 1.1 million children orphaned by HIV/AIDS, in a country where more than half of those over age 60 already live in absolute poverty. </p>
<p>“Older women are responsible for much of the farming and food production in developing countries, a critical function as food insecurity grows,” notes Catherine A. Bertini, Hilton Prize juror, Syracuse University professor, and former executive director of the United Nations World Food Program.  “They are the key contributors to families and communities.”<br />
HelpAge International believes a critical component to making lasting changes for this population is the engagement of older people themselves in efforts to claim their rights to health care, social services and economic and physical security.  It has shown that older people are their own best advocates and make valuable contributions to society as caregivers, advisors, mentors, mediators and breadwinners.</p>
<p>HelpAge was formed in 1983 by organizations in Canada, Colombia, Kenya, India and the United Kingdom that had similar missions to support older people. Today it encompasses 94 HelpAge Affiliates in 70 countries and more than 3,000 independent partner groups and older people’s organizations.  HelpAge has trained 25,000 professionals and 16,000 community members—including older people themselves—to provide health care, legal advice and financial support for older people.</p>
<p>Viewed as the world’s leading authority on global aging, HelpAge is actively engaging with the United Nations, European Union, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, bilateral donor governments, the World Economic Forum and other influential organizations to ensure there is a strong understanding of the critical need to support the human rights of older people.<br />
Both an advocacy and development organization, in 2002 HelpAge was instrumental in shaping the United Nations Madrid International Plan of Action on Aging, adopted by 57 countries, which pledged to include aging in all social and economic development policies.  2012 is being recognized as the Year of Global Aging, triggered by the 10th anniversary of the Madrid Plan of Action when world leaders will again convene to review what has been accomplished in the past decade to extend rights for older people.  HelpAge is collaborating with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) on The World’s Older Persons Report—to launch on October 1st— that will assess the progress made since 2002. </p>
<p>The Hilton Prize receives more than 200 nominations from throughout the world each year, and a prestigious, independent international jury makes the final selection.  </p>

<p><strong>Mr Jack  Ling </strong>was a reporter for a few years including a short stint as a United Nations-accredited war correspondent in Korea.  From 1951-1962 (with a study leave interruption), he served as Public Information Officer in Bangkok for UNICEF&#8217;s Asia Regional Office, after which he was transferred to UNICEF, HQ first as Chief, Radio/TV and Film Service, then as Deputy Director before becoming Director, Information Division, 1972-82.  He was seconded to the World Health Organization (WHO) as Director, Public Information and Health Education, in Geneva, 1982-1986.<span id="more-1458"></span> </p>
<p>He introduced the concept of creative fundraising with communication products, promoted and executed the joint/collaborative venture and co-production with television networks, as well as influenced policy as regards communication for development with, for and about the bottom billions whom the UN system serves.</p>
<p>After early retirement from the United Nations, he began an 18-year academic career with short stints at University of Louisiana at Lafayette, Columbia University Teachers College, CUNY Lehman College, and a 15-year tenure at Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.  He was Director of Tulane SPHTM’s International Communication Center and Clinical Professor of International Health and Development. In 2004, he was appointed Professor Emeritus by Tulane.  </p>
<p>He also served as Chair, International Council for the Control of Iodine Disease Deficiency (ICCIDD), for two terms 2001-2006.</p>
<p> Jack Ling wrote articles for WHO and UNICEF about communication, but they were not &#8216;books.&#8217; Some of them are available on the web. He was chief editor for a series of school health education books for WHO&#8217;s Middle East region; published a book about social mobilization in Chinese, Peking University Medical Press, which was a collaboration with a team of Chinese scholars; co-authored with Cynthia Reader a communication manual for iodine deficiency elimination which was translated into French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Portuguese.   His book, The Memorial Dozen, in English and Chinese, which described some  UNICEF colleagues  (Keeny, Grant, Eve Labouissee, Brando, Lord Ritchie Calder) was published by Peking University two years ago. He is now working on his memoir for the Commercial Press of China, &#8220;which I hope to finish before I start losing gradually my marbles, a common occurrence for people in their 80s!&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Mr Ling is one of two stalwarts of UNICEF for whom the University of Tulane has established awards, the other being the late Mr James Grant, former UNICEF Executive Director.</p>

<p><strong>LOVE LEADERSHIP:</strong> The New Way to Lead in a Fear-Based World </p>
<p> <iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=wwwmgassociin-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=8&#038;l=as1&#038;asins=0470428783&#038;ref=qf_sp_asin_til&#038;fc1=000000&#038;IS2=1&#038;lt1=_blank&#038;m=amazon&#038;lc1=0000FF&#038;bc1=000000&#038;bg1=FFFFFF&#038;f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
Business best-seller LOVE LEADERSHIP (Jossey-Bass) bridges the gap between solid business advice and pure inspiration. It outlines the five laws of love-based leadership: Loss Creates Leaders (there can be no strength without legitimate suffering), Fear Fails (only respect and love leads to success), Love Makes Money (love is at the core of true wealth), Vulnerability is Power (when you open up to people they open up to you), and Giving is Getting (the more you offer to others, the more they will give back to you). The book’s principles are illustrated through interviews with 30 love-based leaders including former U.S. President Bill Clinton, Harvard Business School Professor, former Medtronic CEO and bestselling author Bill George, HRH Crown Prince Haakon of Norway, Civil Rights legend and HOPE Global Spokesman and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young, and some of the last book interviews with the late Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp and civil rights icon Dr. Dorothy I.

<p>Many of the countries under his responsibility are confronting different and varying degrees of challenges;  viz., the earthquake in Haiti and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan.</p>
<p>Ambassador Cheick Sidi Diarra of Mali is Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs and Small Island Developing States (SIDs).</p>
<p>For the more than 800 million people in these groups of countries, it is a <span id="more-1427"></span>struggle against many odds, ranging from the natural hazards (earthquake, tsunami, hurricanes, floods, droughts) to man-made crises, such as climate change and the global financial and economic crisis.</p>
<p>Amb. Diarra obtained Masters&#8217; Degrees in international public law and international relations from Dakar University in Senegal and has over 25 years of professional experience in international relations, law and development. He has been an active advocate for the cause of Africa, the least developed countries and landlocked developing countries as his country uniquely represents two of these three groups of countries. </p>
<p>In 2011 Mr. Diarra served as the Secretary-General of the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which took place in Istanbul, Turkey. </p>
<p>For more on the challenges affecting these three groups of countries the hardest – the food, fuel and financial crises…and the SIDS which are extremely vulnerable to sudden sea rise which also affects availability of potable water, and to learn more about the work of the Office of the Under-Secretary-General and High Representative, </p>

Given the challenges they are facing with climate change, the fuel and energy crisis, shaky economies, globalization and its effects on trade and agriculture, as well as their entry into the digital age, the impact of the internet and technology on productivity, all the while grappling with other social entanglements regarding their children and families.  Given this sea of challenges, Dr. Swaminathan brings words of hope and encouragement to this group on whom our food security rests and whose role in assuring this food security is threatened.

<p>Professor M. S. Swaminathan has been acclaimed by TIME magazine as one of the twenty most influential Asians of the 20th century and one of the only three from India, the other two being Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore. He has been described by the United Nations Environment Program as “the Father of Economic Ecology” and by Javier Perez de Cuellar, past Secretary General of the United Nations, as “a living legend who will go into the annals of history as a world scientist of rare distinction”.<br />
A plant geneticist by training, Professor Swaminathan’s contributions to the agricultural renaissance of India have led to his being widely referred to as the scientific leader of the green revolution movement. His advocacy of sustainable agriculture leading to an ever-green revolution makes him an acknowledged world leader in the field of sustainable food security. The International Association of Women and Development conferred on him the first international award for significant contributions to promoting the knowledge, skill, and technological empowerment of women in agriculture and for his pioneering role in mainstreaming gender considerations in agriculture and rural development. Professor Swaminathan was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Community Leadership in 1971, the Albert Einstein World Science Award in 1986, and the first World Food Prize in 1987.<br />
Professor Swaminathan is a Fellow of many of the leading scientific academies of India and the world, including the Royal Society of London and the U S National Academy of Sciences. He has received 58 honorary doctorate degrees from universities around the world.
