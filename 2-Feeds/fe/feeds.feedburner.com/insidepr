<p>This week, Inside PR and <a href="http://prsa.org/" target="_blank">PRSA</a> present the second of two special episodes featuring Martin’s interviews with <a href="http://www.prsa.org/awards/silveranvil" target="_blank">Silver Anvil Awards</a> finalists.</p>
<p>Adrienne Hayes is the general manager of consumer marketing at <a href="http://edelman.com/" target="_blank">Edelman</a> in New York. She led the team on its campaign for <a href="http://www.churchdwight.com/brands-and-products/brand-browser.aspx" target="_blank">Church and Dwight</a> called ‘Trojan Pulls Back the Sheets on Sexy Tech’.</p>
<p>Focusing their strategy on making the subject matter more approachable, they leveraged ‘adjacency categories’, that is industries that were also known for product breakthroughs.  They decided to treat the new Trojan products as cool ‘tech gadgets’ and launch them at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show" target="_blank">Consumer Electronics Show</a> in Las Vegas. And while some media were red-faced when presented with the story, they quickly understood the tie in; it appealed to media who wanted something new and fresh to write about.</p>
<p>They continued their creative approach during the second part of the year when they took the show on the road and launched the ‘Good Vibrations Truck Tour’ around Manhattan to give people an opportunity to ‘see, touch and feel’ the different products. They used social media to drive awareness of where the trucks would be and encouraged consumers to talk openly about what has traditionally been a taboo subject.</p>
<p>Doug Piwinski, senior vice president of marketing and communications at <a href="http://www.toms.com/" target="_blank">Toms</a>, tells us about the company’s <a href="http://www.toms.com/onedaywithoutshoes" target="_blank">‘One Day Without Shoes’</a> initiative, which began as an April Fool’s gag and developed into a global campaign. Tom’s is unique as a business because they don’t rely on traditional advertising and instead build relationships with customers through social media and word of mouth. Each year the company activates its community by asking them to give up wearing shoes for one day in order to experience what life is like for children who don’t have shoes.</p>
<p>The program comes to life through a series of grassroots events in cities around the world and is promoted via a microsite which encourages people to plan and post events.</p>
<p>They worked with <a href="http://www.ketchum.com/" target="_blank">Ketchum PR</a> in LA to craft a phased strategy and weren’t expecting the snowball effect that took place this year including stories on the home page of AOL and MSN and becoming number one trending topic on Twitter.  Toms effectively uses an influencer strategy to inspire people to engage, raise awareness for an important cause and think about social entrepreneurship in a new way.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s Silver Anvil awards will be presented in New York City on June 7, 2012. Inside PR will be there.</p>

<p><a title="Gini Dietrich on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/ginidietrich" target="_blank">Gini Dietrich</a> caught up with Marcus after his keynote speech at the PRSA Conference last month in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Marcus shared an in-your-face and engaging presentation at the conference about content marketing. Marcus made a name for himself when he started a blog about fiber glass pools. His goal was to drive traffic to the website and eventually lead potential customers to his front door. To accomplish this, he answered common questions he had heard relating to installing or buying a fiber glass pool on his blog. Long story short, the traffic to his website blew up. He and his partners became “the guys that knew about fiber glass pools”.</p>

<p>This week, Inside PR and <a href="http://prsa.org" target="_blank">PRSA</a> present a special show where Martin interviews two <a href="http://www.prsa.org/awards/silveranvil" target="_blank">Silver Anvil Awards</a> finalists.</p>
<p>Scott Brooks is vice president, marketing and communications for<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/" target="_blank"> IBM Research</a>. He talks to us about <a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/index.html" target="_blank">Watson</a>, the computer-contestant on <a href="http://www.jeopardy.com/" target="_blank">Jeopardy</a> that defeated two of the show&#8217;s best players. Watson&#8217;s technology is based on the concept of  ‘automatic question answering’.  A team of 25 people worked for years to improve the ability of computers to answer questions.  When the communications folks saw the initial results, they realized the PR potential to build awareness and contacted Jeopardy to see if they might be interested in a man-machine competition.</p>
<p>Getting an early start and narrowly targeting their prelaunch outreach was one of the strategies the communications group used  to tell the complex story in long form. About 18 months before the matches, they approached three media influencers, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/magazine/20Computer-t.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">New York Times magazine</a> to write a feature, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/smartest-machine-on-earth.html" target="_blank">PBS TV&#8217;s Nova</a> to produce a documentary, and author <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Final-Jeopardy-Watson-Computer-Transform/dp/0547747195/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1338006116&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">Stephen Baker</a> to write a book.  The three had open access to Watson throughout its development.</p>
<p>The biggest communications risk IBM faced was presenting Watson live on television and not knowing what the outcome would be. Brooks said they made big decisions early on that were game changers including what to name the computer, what kind of voice it would have and what it would look like on stage.  Watson was actually named for for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)" target="_blank">first president of IBM</a>.</p>
<p>Their strategy paid off and Watson garnered prelaunch awareness and much traditional and social media coverage during the matches and after the win.</p>
<p>Kari Mather works as a senior communications consultant in corporate communications at <a href="http://www.allstate.com/" target="_blank">Allstate Insurance Company</a>. (Disclosure Allstate Canada is a Thornley Fallis client though we don&#8217;t work with Allstate U.S.)</p>
<p>The company created the <a href="http://www.allstatefoundation.org/" target="_blank">Allstate Foundation</a>, a not-for-profit organization, to fund cause-related programs in support of safe and vital communities, safe driving and ending domestic violence.</p>

		<itunes:summary>This week, Inside PR and PRSA present a special show where Martin interviews two Silver Anvil Awards finalists.

Scott Brooks is vice president, marketing and communications for IBM Research. He talks to us about Watson, the computer-contestant on Jeopardy that defeated two of the show's best players. Watson's technology is based on the concept of  ‘automatic question answering’.  A team of 25 people worked for years to improve the ability of computers to answer questions.  When the communications folks saw the initial results, they realized the PR potential to build awareness and contacted Jeopardy to see if they might be interested in a man-machine competition.

Getting an early start and narrowly targeting their prelaunch outreach was one of the strategies the communications group used  to tell the complex story in long form. About 18 months before the matches, they approached three media influencers, New York Times magazine to write a feature, PBS TV's Nova to produce a documentary, and author Stephen Baker to write a book.  The three had open access to Watson throughout its development.

The biggest communications risk IBM faced was presenting Watson live on television and not knowing what the outcome would be. Brooks said they made big decisions early on that were game changers including what to name the computer, what kind of voice it would have and what it would look like on stage.  Watson was actually named for for first president of IBM.

Their strategy paid off and Watson garnered prelaunch awareness and much traditional and social media coverage during the matches and after the win.

Kari Mather works as a senior communications consultant in corporate communications at Allstate Insurance Company. (Disclosure Allstate Canada is a Thornley Fallis client though we don't work with Allstate U.S.)

The company created the Allstate Foundation, a not-for-profit organization, to fund cause-related programs in support of safe and vital communities, safe driving and ending domestic violence.

In this case, they helped the community of Tuscon Arizona build a playground in honor of Christina-Taylor Green, the young girl born on 9/11, who, along with 10 others sadly lost their lives during the shooting that injured Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Not long after the tragedy, the Allstate Foundation learned the community wanted to commemorate Christina's short life, stepped forward and granted funding to build a playground at Christina’s elementary school and ensuring her classmates were involved throughout the project.

In addition to the funds, Allstate Foundation was active throughout the design and build, brought in more than 100 volunteers and stood side by side with the community to help bring the Christina-Taylor Green Little Hands playground to life.

What could have been a local story was picked up by local and national media and it became an important milestone in the company’s history as they were able to involve the community, agencies and employees in a cause they really believed in.

This year's Silver Anvil awards will be presented in New York City on June 7, 2012. Inside PR will be there.

<p>This week, Gini, Joe and I are all together at <a href="http://www.counselorsacademy.org" target="_blank">PRSA Counselors Academy’s</a> annual conference for agency owners/leaders in New Orleans (and we all had our parts to play&#8230;). The theme is ‘Jazz Up Your Agency: Stylings from the Best in the Biz’ and we thought we’d recap our first day and a half.</p>
<p>Joe talks about the opening keynote – a one-two punch featuring Gini and <a href="http://twitter.com/jaybaer" target="_self">Jay Baer</a>. They interviewed each other and offered a primer in content marketing and how agency owners can build trust and their businesses by integrating certain aspects of their personal and professional lives. We may think otherwise, but we get clients based on people and not the company name.</p>
<p>In addition to an engaging talk, the attendees all received a copy of Gini and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/geoffliving" target="_blank">Geoff Livingston’s</a> new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Round-Integrated-Campaign-Biz-Tech/dp/0789749173" target="_blank">Marketing in the Round</a>.</p>
<p>We continued our focus on content marketing with our second keynote, <a href="http://twitter.com/thesaleslion" target="_blank">Marcus Sheridan</a>, a hilarious, in your face presenter, who transformed his pool business into a content marketing powerhouse that used the long tail of search to generate sales results. His takeaway is to think about all the questions your customers are asking and write content that offers helpful answers.</p>
<p>As an event geared to business owners,  Counselors’ other focus is to provide practical sessions that improve the way you run your agency. These range from profitability and processes to understanding and managing people and creating a culture. Joe did a roundtable on how to get your staff thinking about the business of the business and turning them into an army of entrepreneurs, based on <a href="http://www.armyofentrepreneurs.com/" target="_blank">Jen Prozek’s book</a> and her 2011 keynote.</p>
<p>Next year, the conference will be in June 2013 in Austin Texas and <a href="http://twitter.com/blah2voila">Dana Hughens</a> is the chair.  If you’re an agency owner or leader, we think you’ll find a lot of value and encourage you to check it out.  In the meantime, you can get a flavor of Counselors Academy from the <a href="http://sharypic.com/caprsa/photowall" target="_blank">Sharypic photowall</a>.</p>

<p>At the recent <a href="http://www.prsa.org/conferences/digitalimpact" target="_blank">Digital Impact Conference</a> in New York, roving reporter, <a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman" target="_blank">Martin Waxman</a>, caught up with <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/lee-odden/" target="_blank">Lee Odden</a>. Lee, as most of you know, is the CEO of <a href="http://www.toprankmarketing.com/" target="_blank">TopRank</a> and the author of new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Optimize-Attract-Customers-Integrating-Marketing/dp/1118167775" target="_blank">Optimize</a>.</p>
<p>Lee has been talking to PR professionals for a long time about how to diversify not only their thinking, but also their skill sets.</p>
<p>As a side note: I (Gini) met Lee for the first time in Orlando at the PRSA conference last year. And he described to me how, many years ago, he was talking about search engine optimization at PR conferences and everyone looked at him with blank stares. He said this past year was the first time many were jumping out of their seats to ask questions about how to incorporate SEO into their content and storytelling.</p>
<p>During his interview with Martin, he discusses how he&#8217;s now pushing our industry to think about the <em>why</em> instead of the <em>how</em>.</p>
<p>He begins by discussing his content marketing trilogy, which is: Where do your audiences look for things, how is it that they consume content, and what are their preferences for sharing.</p>
<p>He goes on to say, of course, sales is part of every objective, but when it&#8217;s a content program, your goals should also include gaining a social share or a referral, which leads to new audiences who buy.</p>
<p>Optimize is about how to approach reaching particular audiences by thinking about what they care about, their pain points, and their goals. This forms an editorial approach that ties together marketing and public relations.</p>
<p>Listen to Lee talk more about this&#8230;and his soothing voice that will make you a fan for life.</p>

<p>This week <a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman">Martin Waxman</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ginidietrich">Gini Dietrich</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/thornley">Joseph Thornley</a> speak with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/richardatdell">Richard Binhammer</a> at Dell about social business, moving forward and the roll of PR firms. We want to thank all those who send in their comments. Last week, Petra Opelova <a href="http://www.insidepr.ca/index.php/2012/04/19/inside-pr-2-94-matthias-lufkens-on-davos-and-social-media/#comments">commented on last week&#8217;s episode</a>. She agrees with Gini that webpages are still very significant. She also liked Matthias Lufkens’ approach of treating our customers as your friends. Adapting this approach not only humanizes your customers but also humanizes your company in the eyes of your customer.</p>
<p>As an early pioneer of social media, Richard was at Dell six years ago when Dell first came alive to social media. Today he is a director of Dell social media campaigns. Richard Binhammer was the second keynote at the <a href="http://www.prsa.org/Conferences/DigitalImpact">PRSA&#8217;s Digital Conference</a>. Joe caught up with Richard just before he went on stage to discuss social business and the role of PR firms in corporate social media accounts. </p>
<p>After the interview, Joe mentions that the relationship between business and PR firm is more than just tactical, the businesses are smarter and know how to use social media. As PR firms we need to support businesses from a strategy perspective. </p>
<p>Gini mentions that PR firms are being hired for different reasons today compared to five years ago. PR firms used to own relationships, especially with reporters. Today, we no longer own that relationship and we now have to redefine ourselves. With the social web, crisis is an emerging threat to businesses. PR agencies should be able to help on strategic crisis management. </p>
<p>Martin thinks that PR professionals need to acquire new skills. For example: amature video production, audio production for podcasting, and more. This will help us create, tell and distribute stories. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p>This week we feature an interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/luefkens" target="_blank">Matthias Lufkens</a>, former social media director for the <a href="http://www.weforum.org/" target="_blank">World Economic Forum in Davos</a>, who tells us about the organization’s use of social media.  We caught up with him at <a href="http://www.prsa.org/Conferences/DigitalImpact" target="_blank">PRSA’s Digital Impact</a>, where he was one of the keynote presenters.  Over the next few week’s we’ll be sharing more interviews from the conference.</p>
<p>Matthias has several takeaways from his presentation:</p>
<p>1. The number of visitors to your own website is less and less important; organizations now have to be everywhere, on all the social sites.</p>
<p>2. Start by sharing riveting content.</p>
<p>3. Being active in social media means ceding control and letting people comment and share your content.</p>
<p>4. Create communities and then engage and lead them.</p>
<p>He has an additional piece of advice for communicators: look at online communities as your friends and that will change the way you build relationships with them.</p>
<p>Joe cites a <a href="http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/press-releases/pages/wef-news.aspx" target="_blank">KPMG study</a> on how much social engagement activity emanated from Davos this year and how social media really opened the gathering to the world.</p>
<p>Gini calls out Matthias’ comment about having a small team and says with social media, a few people who know what they’re doing can accomplish a lot.  She doesn’t agree with his point about traffic your site being less relevant and believes social channels should drive people back to your site.</p>
<p>Martin mentions Matthias’ point about thinking of customers as friends and having that inform the way we communicate with them by avoiding the hard sell.</p>
<p>Want to meet us in person? Gini, Joe and I are going to be attending the <a href="http://www.prsa.org/Conferences/CounselorsAcademy/" target="_blank">PRSA Counselors Academy</a> conference in New Orleans – Gini’s a keynote presenter, Joe’s doing a roundtable and I’m conference chair. We’re recording a show at the conference and doing more interviews with some of the smartest entrepreneurs in PR.  And everyone who attends gets a copy of Gini’s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Marketing-Round-Integrated-Campaign-Biz-Tech/dp/0789749173" target="_blank"><em>Marketing in the Round</em></a>.  Hope to see you there.</p>

<p>We start with some exciting news about Inside PR’s new partnership with <a href="http://prsa.org" target="_blank">PRSA</a>.  We’re heading to New York in early April to join them as the official podcaster of the <a href="http://www.prsa.org/Conferences/DigitalImpact" target="_blank">PRSA Digital Impact conference</a>.  They’ve got a great line-up of speakers and we’re planning to record a number of interviews with social media influencers that we’ll use on future shows.  Stay tuned for more details…</p>
<p>This week, we feature an interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/giorodriguez" target="_blank">Giovanni Rodriguez</a> that roving reporter Martin conducted at <a href="http://sxsw.com" target="_blank">SXSW</a>.  Giovanni is the person who introduced both Joe and Martin to social media at <a href="http://www.counselorsacademy.org" target="_blank">Counselors Academy</a> in 2005. He’s been the managing partner at his own agency and is currently a consultant at <a href="http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_US/us/index.htm" target="_blank">Deloitte</a>. And he’ll be presenting at the Digital Impact conference.</p>
<p>Giovanni talks about social business and what differentiates it from social media.  He believes social media as a term was always limiting because it forced the discipline into a marketing corner.</p>
<p>He goes on to say that social business is more inclusive in that it asks the question, how can people use these technologies and best practices to engage and empower their constituencies? These could include anyone in your network, your customers, employees, partners in your ecosystem.</p>
<p>He’s seeing new type of professional emerging; one that will offer offers a suite of services similar in scope to management consulting: strategy, discovery, benchmarks and road-mapping.</p>
<p>And Giovanni wonders whether or not intermediaries &#8211; that is, the role played by agents – will be eclipsed by trusted counselors and advisors.</p>
<p>Gini agrees the role of PR agencies is changing and that we need to move beyond impressions, understand an organization’s goals and develop programs that drive business results.</p>
<p>Joe thinks PR people are well positioned for the change Giovanni describes as we’ve been involved in monitoring and measurement, analysis, insight and strategy for quite some time and have a good understanding of the landscape and how to navigate in it.</p>

<p>This week, <a title="Gini Dietrich on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/ginidietrich" target="_blank">Gini Dietrich</a>, <a title="Martin Waxman on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/martinwaxman" target="_blank">Martin Waxman</a> and <a title="Joseph Thornley is @thornley on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/thornley" target="_self">Joseph Thornley</a> talk about new social management tool Jugnoo, tablet computers, Facebook timelines for pages and a new feature in social media measurement tool Sysomos.</p>
<p>Last week we reported that <a title="Jugnoo.me" href="http://me.jugnoo.com/" target="_blank">Jugnoo</a>, a new social media management console service had launched in open beta. We received a comment from <a title="Danny Brown" href="http://dannybrown.me/" target="_blank">Danny Brown</a> telling us we pronounced it wrong. Oops. And Gini and I talk about when a service like Jugnoo should ask potential users to install a plug in or open access to a user&#8217;s Website data.</p>
<p>We also talk about the rapid adoption of tablets in the workplace. Two years ago, we considered our notebook computers to be the go-to mobile devices. Today, we each use a tablet computer. We wonder how long it will be before we will be able to reduce the number of devices. The limiting factor on this is the evolution of tablets to include both the hardware and software to support all the content creation we want to do.</p>
<p>Timelines for pages is being rolled out to all users at the end of the month. Gini is keen on timelines. She&#8217;s watched as content that she had long ago posted to the <a title="Arment Dietrich on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/ArmentDietrich" target="_blank">Arment Dietrich</a> page had resurfaced. Old content becomes more accessible. Joe is skeptical of the value of timelines for small businesses. Many small businesses have limited resources to devote to social media. And it seems to him that corporate page owners will have to devote considerable energy and resources to keep their content fresh. And this may not be a priority for may businesses.</p>
<p>Finally, we talk about the integration of Google Analytics into <a title="Sysomos Heartbeat" href="http://www.sysomos.com/products/overview/heartbeat/" target="_blank">Sysomos&#8217; Heartbeat</a> social media monitoring service. A nice addition that makes a good service better.</p>
<p>What do you think? Are we on the right track? Missing something? Do you have a different view?</p>

<p>First we mention for a new startup out of Toronto now in public beta. <a href="http://me.jugnoo.com/" target="_blank">JugnooMe</a> is a dashboard that helps small business owners figure out which messages to use on various platforms, how to schedule them and how to measure the results.  It also has a Social Advisor tool that acts like a virtual consultant and answers the question: what do you do next?</p>
<p>Jugnoo offers social search monitoring, reputation management, engagement, video creation from inside the platform, social commerce and analytics all under one roof. And there’s more to come.  Good luck to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/DannyBrown" target="_blank">Danny Brown</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/hessiejones" target="_blank">Hessie Jones</a>, who are both involved.</p>
<p>Martin kicks off the next segment by introducing a comment about <a href="http://pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> from listener <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/opelova" target="_blank">Petra Opelova</a>.</p>
<p>Gini talks about Pinterest’s copyright issues and how the company’s terms of service puts the onus on the user. As a result, people need to be careful about the items they’re pinning, because all the liability could fall on them.</p>
<p>Joe believes adhering to copyright is important and buys the images he uses on his blog and other sites. However, he says unless a person makes a concerted effort to ensure they own the items they’re sharing online, they’re at risk of violating copyright.  Joe compares Pinterest’s terms of service to the indemnity clause many large corporations add to their contracts, thereby shifting the risk from the company that has the resources to the small business it’s working with.</p>
<p>Do you adhere to copyright when you&#8217;re sharing online? What do you think about Pinterest&#8217;s terms of service and indemnity deflection? We&#8217;d love to hear from you.</p>

<p>This week on Inside PR, we discuss Tony Clement&#8217;s visit during Third Tuesday. We also chat about the pros and cons of Pinterest and begin to touch on the copyright issues (which we&#8217;ll focus on in a subsequent episode).</p>
<p><strong>Open Government and Social Media</strong></p>
<p>If you know <a href="http://twitter.com/thornley" target="_blank">Joe Thornley</a>, even peripherally, you know his life&#8217;s work has been dedicated to open government and Canadian politics. Because of that passion, he was able to secure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Clement" target="_blank">Tony Clement</a> for <a href="http://propr.ca/" target="_blank">Third Tuesday</a> last month (which I discovered rarely happens on the third Tuesday of each month).</p>
<p>Tony, for those of you non-Canadians, is a federal politician, president of the Treasury Board, Minister for the Federal Economic Initiative for Northern Ontario (FedNor), and Member of Parliament of the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>He discussed open government, social media, and transparency for politicians.</p>
<p>Joe, who doesn&#8217;t agree with Clement&#8217;s policies, found himself really respecting the conservative politician, whose methods he admires.</p>
<p>And Martin Waxman added how Clement talked about how he&#8217;s using social media to be human, authentic&#8230;and himself. He has a plea for all citizens as other politicians get on the social bandwagon.</p>
<p><strong>Pinterest</strong></p>
<p>I LOVE <a href="http://pinterest.com" target="_blank">PINTEREST</a>!</p>
<p>A tool with endless possibilities, it reminds Joe of the early days of Twitter, when the platform left it to us to make it what we wanted it to be instead of trying to cram us into something they wanted it to be (cough, <a href="http://plus.google.com" target="_blank">Google+</a>, cough).</p>
<p>We discuss how to use it both personally and professionally, as well as a couple of case studies that show sales conversions early on.</p>

<p><strong>Are you struggling to keep up with all the email you receive? Is email totally broken as a productivity tool?</strong></p>

Two recent posts by Fred Wilson and MG Siegler about their frustration with email glut serve as a jumping off point for Martin Waxman, Gini Dietrich and Joseph Thornley to discuss the challenge of making email serve our needs.

Also noted this week: Shel Israel, co-author of Naked Conversations, has a new book, Stellar Presentations: An Entrepreneur's Guide to Giving Great Talks, published via Amazon's publishing program. It's a useful book with lots of practical tips for anyone who has to pitch a business or convey a new idea to an audience.

And this was also the podcast we recorded on Gini Dietrich's birthday. If you want to join in her birthday greetings, check out this happy birthday post from Jack Bauer, Gini's dog. Happy birthday Gini!

<p>It’s been an interesting week around the web with lessons about good and not-so-good communications.  Gini mentions the <a href="http://spinsucks.com/communication/komen-provides-excellent-crisis-management-case-study/" target="_blank">blog post</a> she wrote about the Susan G. Komen Foundation and how its decision to unplug their funding from Planned Parenthood’s breast cancer screenings created a huge outpouring of support for Planned Parenthood and a reputation issue for Komen.</p>
<p>She talks about how poorly Komen handled communications around the issue including deleting comments from its Facebook page. She and a few people tried a test where they posted comments – from benign to negative – and took screen captures of their posts.  The organization removed them all. She wonders why Komen didn’t consult with its communications advisors in advance to develop scenarios, messages and a crisis plan.</p>
<p>By now most of us have heard that based on the outcry, Komen reversed its decision.</p>
<p>We all agree deleting comments after the fact is one of the worst things organizations can do and they should decide at the outset whether or not they’ll accept comments and build trust via an open conversation.</p>
<p>Joe talks about <a href="http://radioroyalyork.ca/" target="_blank">Radio Royal York’s</a> public video welcome to Blissdom organizers who were visiting Toronto.  He hasn’t decided if it’s a mistake or a good way to engage with a customer and asks if anyone else had seen something similar.  However, the situation is somewhat moot. At the time of writing, the video has been removed.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, our last topic is the upcoming Facebook IPO and the company&#8217;s disclosure that the majority of its revenue comes from ad dollars.</p>
<p>In fact, the big three social media players &#8211; Facebook, Twitter and Google+ &#8211; are all media companies of sorts and have finally figured out now they monetize their innovations &#8211; by selling us (and our data). There’s no doubt they’re great networks that extend the scope of our relationships, but we are still the product.</p>
<p>Martin wonders how they’ll deal with large policy issues like freedom of speech and feels governments should monitor the situation to ensure we keep the Internet open.  Joe isn’t happy with that type of intervention – he’d rather see governments focus on education and standards.</p>
<p>Next week is Social Media Week in various cities around the world.  Here’s where to get a <a href="http://socialmediaweek.org/">full list of events</a>.  And if you’re in Toronto on February 17, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/third-tuesday-toronto/events/50230502/" target="_blank">Third Tuesday Toronto</a> is hosting a breakfast event on open government featuring <a href="https://twitter.com/tonyclementcpc" target="_blank">Tony Clement</a>, M.P., President of the Treasury Board of Canada. It should be a lively discussion.</p>
<p>And that’s a wrap! We’ll talk to you next week.</p>

<p>Right now the United States are in the middle of GOP Presidential race and it&#8217;s an interesting time, to be sure.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why our interview with <a href="https://plus.google.com/113389818367313424853/posts" target="_blank">Mary Barber</a> is so timely.</p>
<p>Mary, if you don&#8217;t know, is the founder of <a href="http://barbergp.com/" target="_blank">The Barber Group</a>, which is headquartered in Anchorage, Alaska. As a side note: Alaska is having its coldest and most snowy winter on record. While it&#8217;s scary for the residents, some of us (who love snow) are living vicariously through Mary&#8217;s Facebook updates.</p>
<p>Last year, Mary worked with a team of communication professionals to mobilize around a candidate.</p>
<p>But not just any candidate&#8230;a write-in candidate who won.</p>
<p>It was the first time a write-in candidate has won anywhere since 1954.</p>
<p>We won&#8217;t ruin the interview for you, but you&#8217;ll want to listen to see how they mobilized many people to get out the message, had a message of the day, and how they were each responsible for one platform and one audience.</p>
<p>She also discusses how they integrated online conversations with tried and true offline tactics, such as walking a district.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t miss the announcement of <a href="https://plus.google.com/110720576611232766643/posts" target="_blank">Jay Baer</a> and me keynoting <a href="http://counselorsacademy.org" target="_blank">Counselor&#8217;s Academy</a> this year. We discuss the topic during the podcast. What we didn&#8217;t discuss is Jay will provide the expertise and I&#8217;ll provide the color commentary. And you&#8217;ll receive a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0789749173/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_g14_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0D5FQ4E5BFFNYP632QH8&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938631&amp;pf_rd_i=507846" target="_blank">Marketing in the Round</a>!</p>

<p>Search is changing.</p>
<p>This week was a big week for social media, especially Google. <a href="http://twitter.com/ginidietrich" target="_blank">Gini Dietrich</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/thornley" target="_blank">Joe Thornley</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman">Martin Waxman</a> start the episode with talking about Google&#8217;s new search algorithm. Google has changed in search algorithm to make it personalized to the person logged on. Twitter and Facebook are not too happy about this change and believe that Google is not giving an accurate search result. The gang talks about how consumers are being affect and how we are stuck in the middle of a feud between two big corporations. </p>
<p>The pull between personalization and standardization increases with this new search algorithm, pushing standardization further and further outside of the picture. We will no longer all get the same search results. The team talks about what this means for consumers and communicators. </p>
<p>This issue also invokes change for communicators and marketers and how we promote our company&#8217;s online, the key words we use and how we publish content. </p>
<p>What do you think? Will Google continue to be the number one choice for search? </p>

This week was a big week for social media, especially Google. Gini Dietrich, Joe Thornley, and Martin Waxman start the episode with talking about Google's new search algorithm. Google has changed in search algorithm to make it personalized to the person logged on.

<p>This week, we feature another interview from the <a href="http://www.prsa.org" target="_blank">PRSA</a> International Conference.  We talk to our good friend <a href="http://twitter.com/shonali" target="_blank">Shonali Burke</a>, communications strategist and author of the <a href="http://www.waxingunlyrical.com/" target="_blank">Waxing Unlyrical</a> blog, about PR and social media measurement, a subject all PR people should pay attention to because it demonstrates the value of our work and whether or not we’ve achieved our goals.</p>
<p>Shonali calls out three problems in the way we approach measurement:</p>
<ol>
<li>The concept of measurable objectives has been lost – our objectives must be quantifiable and time-bound.</li>
<li>Buzz is not a goal – because people don’t know what they’re trying to achieve, they’re not approaching communications strategically.</li>
<li>People overcomplicate. Don’t focus on the tools but on what you’re trying to track and how.</li>
</ol>
<p>Shonali mentions the <a href="http://thebluekey.org/" target="_blank">Blue Key campaign</a>, which asks Americans to donate $5 to raise awareness and support for refugee issues and how they track the program using custom URLs, Google Analytics and other tools to identify emerging trends.</p>
<p>She’s tired of PR professionals saying they’re not good at numbers and advises us to, ‘stop getting freaked out by math!&#8217;</p>
<p>Gini mentions that it’s not impressions or ad equivalencies that are important, but how we deliver the kinds of results that mean something to a client’s business.  Joe adds that being in PR, we’re dealing with digital data all the time and need to get good at that.  Martin suggests that as professional communicators we are all in business and, as such, should learn and understand the fundamentals of business.</p>
<p>Are you measuring your programs effectively and in a way that demonstrates real value to your clients or organizations?  Do you have any thoughts or cases to add? We’d love to hear from you.</p>
<p>And thanks Shonali.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>We hope you had great holidays spent with family and friends.</p>
<p>After a short break, we&#8217;re back and ready to rock a new year.</p>
<p>And speaking of a new year, we discuss what we&#8217;re looking forward to in the first half of this year.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman" target="_blank">Martin Waxman</a> is attending <a href="http://sxsw.com/" target="_blank">SxSW</a> and speaking at <a href="http://2012.podcamptoronto.com/" target="_blank">Podcamp</a>. <a href="http://twitter.com/thornley" target="_blank">Joe Thornley</a> is co-hosting (with <a href="http://twitter.com/shelholtz" target="_blank">Shel Holtz</a>) an <a href="http://propr.ca/2012/iabc-launches-online-social-media-workshop-for-communications-professionals/" target="_blank">online social media workshop</a> for IABC and its members.

<p>This is the last show of 2011 for Inside PR. It has been another great year with <a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman">Martin Waxman</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/thornley" target="_blank">Joe Thornley</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/ginidietrich" target="_blank">Gini Dietrich</a>. </p>
<p>The group has recorded 82 episodes. However, Inside PR has been around for over five years with other hosts such as <a href="https://twitter.com/TerryFallis">Terry Fallis</a>.</p>
<p>This week Martin, Gini and Martin talk about their social media resolution.</p>
<p>Joe’s resolution is to be present, publish more often, and try to increase comments and engagement online. He will start by posting on Google+ and if there is more substance he will do a blog post and make people aware of his ideas on Twitter. To measure success, Joe will measure the amount of engagement he experiences on all his social platforms. He is looking for people to come back more than just once.</p>
<p>Martin’s resolution is to make the right choices. He has a hunger for a lot of things, but he can’t do all of it, and needs to focus. To measure success, Martin will measure engagement, meaningful interactions and meeting more great people. </p>
<p>Gini’s resolution is to take all that she has learned from her clients, all the digital tools and implement them for <a href="http://www.armentdietrich.com/">Arment Dietrich </a>to drive sales. Gini will determine success by measuring good ol’ profit margins. </p>
<p>We&#8217;d love to hear from you. Send us your social media resolutions.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p>First:<br />
Listener comments responding to our discussion on <a href="http://www.insidepr.ca/index.php/2011/12/07/inside-pr-2-80-relevance-drives-influence/" target="_blank">‘mean girls in PR’</a>… Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/TheChangePR" target="_blank">Jessica Suter</a> from The Change PR, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/lizanor-barrera/a/507/658" target="_blank">Lizanor Barrera</a> and our own producer, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kristinesimpson" target="_blank">Kristine Simpson</a>, who submitted an audio comment (and graciously edited it in). The consensus from everyone is there are a lot of good, honest and ethical women and men working in the profession (and yes, there are a few stinkers, too…).</p>
<p>Next:<br />
We officially announce <a href="http://twitter.com/ginidietrich" target="_blank">Gini’s</a> new book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Marketing-Round-Multichannel-Approaches-Post-Social/dp/0789749173/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323873489&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Marketing in the Round</a></em>, co-authored with <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffliving" target="_blank">Geoff Livingston</a>. The publication date is May 2012, but it&#8217;s available to pre-order on Amazon and other sites (just in time for the holidays).  It will be launched in Canada at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/third-tuesday-toronto/" target="_blank">Third Tuesday</a> (Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary and Vancouver).  Congratulations, Gini!</p>
<p>Then:<br />
We move on to talk about some recent changes to <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://plus.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>.</p>
<p>Joe sees the new features/updates as an example of how innovation is still occurring rapidly in social media; Twitter is looking more and more like a user friendly service.  Martin admits he still likes the Twitter.com platform because he feels at home there.</p>
<p>Joe is disappointed by the changes to <a href="http://tweetdeck.com" target="_blank">Tweetdeck</a>, because it has fewer features and will now carry only Twitter and none of his other social feeds. He’s going to revisit <a href="http://hootsuite.com" target="_blank">Hootsuite</a>.</p>
<p>Gini mentions <a href="http://marketmesuite.com/" target="_blank">Market Me Suite</a> as another alternative.</p>
<p>Martin says he’s been a Hootsuite user for a while and likes the functionality. He wishes they would let users customize column width in order to see more streams at a glance.</p>
<p>Google introduced <a href="http://www.google.com/producer/currents" target="_blank">Currents</a>, a magazine reader (not yet available in Canada) and is integrating Gmail with the Google+ platform.</p>
<p>Joe likes the quality of the interaction on Google+. He says you can describe Google+ as a place you go for ideas, Facebook, as a place to interact with friends and Twitter where you find out what’s going on. Within that model there’s lots of room for each platform to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>But what about <a href="http://linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>?  Martin believes many LinkedIn features could be integrated into Google+ to make it a good business networking and information resource.</p>
<p>Joe feels too many people on LinkedIn are promoting themselves as they look for jobs; what’s missing is the culture of generosity.</p>

		<itunes:summary>First:
Listener comments responding to our discussion on ‘mean girls in PR’… Thanks to Jessica Suter from The Change PR, Lizanor Barrera and our own producer, Kristine Simpson, who submitted an audio comment (and graciously edited it in). The consensus from everyone is there are a lot of good, honest and ethical women and men working in the profession (and yes, there are a few stinkers, too…).

Next:
We officially announce Gini’s new book, Marketing in the Round, co-authored with Geoff Livingston. The publication date is May 2012, but it's available to pre-order on Amazon and other sites (just in time for the holidays).  It will be launched in Canada at Third Tuesday (Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary and Vancouver).  Congratulations, Gini!

Then:
We move on to talk about some recent changes to Twitter and Google.

Joe sees the new features/updates as an example of how innovation is still occurring rapidly in social media; Twitter is looking more and more like a user friendly service.  Martin admits he still likes the Twitter.com platform because he feels at home there.

Joe is disappointed by the changes to Tweetdeck, because it has fewer features and will now carry only Twitter and none of his other social feeds. He’s going to revisit Hootsuite.

Gini mentions Market Me Suite as another alternative.

Martin says he’s been a Hootsuite user for a while and likes the functionality. He wishes they would let users customize column width in order to see more streams at a glance.

Google introduced Currents, a magazine reader (not yet available in Canada) and is integrating Gmail with the Google+ platform.

Joe likes the quality of the interaction on Google+. He says you can describe Google+ as a place you go for ideas, Facebook, as a place to interact with friends and Twitter where you find out what’s going on. Within that model there’s lots of room for each platform to survive and thrive.

But what about LinkedIn?  Martin believes many LinkedIn features could be integrated into Google+ to make it a good business networking and information resource.

Joe feels too many people on LinkedIn are promoting themselves as they look for jobs; what’s missing is the culture of generosity.

<p>We had so much fun at the <a href="http://prsa.org" target="_blank">PRSA International Conference</a> in Orlando because we got to talk to so many smart people.</p>
<p>This week we have another smart person to share with you: <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/pierreloic" target="_blank">Pierre-Loic Assayag</a>, the founder and CEO of <a href="http://traackr.com" target="_blank">Traackr</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman" target="_blank">Martin Waxman</a> had a chance to chat with him in the Traackr booth about what they&#8217;re doing, how relevance drives influence, and what types of analytics are now offered through the tool.</p>
<p>During the conversation, Martin asked Pierre-Loic what three pieces of advice he had to offer to PR professionals.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>1. Be open-minded</strong>. The new media list looks a little like the old media list, but it&#8217;s not. Be open to the new influencers you aren&#8217;t used to seeing and welcome surprises.</li>
<li><strong>2. Nothing replaces hard work</strong>. This is one we really like because he talks about how what they do makes the repetitive process easier, but they&#8217;re not replacing good PR.</li>
<li><strong>3. There is no silver bullet</strong>. As easy as it is to want to rely on some of these tools to automate our jobs, there is no silver bullet to online influence. In order to engage people in a meaningful way, you have to rely on good old relationship-building skills.</li>
</ol>
<p>He also talks for a few minutes about the alpha list they just launched, which is a way to give control to influencers so they can define their own lists.</p>
<p>At the end of the episode, Martin, <a href="http://twitter.com/thornley" target="_blank">Joe Thornley</a>, and I discuss a blog post that is making the rounds right now, &#8220;<a href="http://thegrindstone.com/career-management/are-women-in-pr-just-grown-up-mean-girls-661/" target="_blank">Are Women In PR Just Grown-Up Mean Girls?</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought it would be interesting to get the opinion from my male counterparts, but Joe was too chicken to say anything beyond, &#8220;No! That&#8217;s not true!&#8221;</p>
<p>The point we all agreed on, though, is our industry is so focused on media relations, which is just a tool and not everything that we do, that it&#8217;s hard to escape that notion.</p>
<p>Enjoy the show!</p>

<p><a title="Gini Dietrich on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/ginidietrich" target="_self">Gini Dietrich</a>, <a title="Martin Waxman on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/martinwaxman" target="_blank">Martin Waxman</a> and <a title="Joseph Thornley on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/thornley" target="_blank">Joseph Thornley</a> talk about the <a title="Public Relations Society of America" href="http://www.prsa.org/" target="_blank">PRSA&#8217;s </a>initiative to develop a <a title="PR Defined" href="http://prdefinition.prsa.org/" target="_blank">new definition of public relations</a> on this week&#8217;s Inside PR.</p>
<p>The PRSA&#8217;s current definition: &#8220;Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other.&#8221; The public is invited to suggest the elements of a new definition using a &#8221; fill in the blanks&#8221;  form on the PRSA Website.</p>
<p>Joe isn&#8217;t sure that the PRSA&#8217;s &#8220;fill in the blanks&#8221; crowd-sourcing approach will yield the type of definition that truly reflects the enhanced role of PR in the era of social media.</p>
<p>Gini Dietrich suggests that whatever definition is adopted, it will only be useful if it can be readily understood by the general public. And she believes that right now most people believe that PR amounts to little more than media relations.</p>
<p>Martin argues that the public relations profession should define itself through the lense applied by Jeff Jarvis when he asserts that &#8220;In a world of publicness which allows us to connect to each other, to information to actions and to transactions, links, i.e. linking up, help us organize new societies and redefine our publics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also in this week&#8217;s podcast, we continue to experiment with Google+. Gini Dietrich has set up the <a title="Spins Sucks company page on Google+" href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/112773673585032183566/posts" target="_blank">Spin Sucks page on Google+</a>.

The PRSA's current definition: "Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other." The public is invited to suggest the elements of a new definition using a " fill in the blanks"  form on the PRSA Website.

<p>We recorded <a href="http://www.insidepr.ca/index.php/2011/11/15/inside-pr-2-76-the-world-of-global-pr/" target="_blank">Inside PR 2.76</a> on the day <a href="http://plus.google.com" target="_blank">Google+</a> opened its pages to businesses and watched as companies developed their G+ presence in real time.</p>
<p>Now it’s a couple of weeks later, and we thought we’d take a closer look. Gini kicks it off by referencing her <a href="http://spinsucks.com/social-media/the-future-of-google-social-network-or-search-enhancer/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the topic.  She calls out Google’s transparency in admitting they helped several companies build their brand pages in advance of the launch.  However, she’s noticed some of those organizations haven’t grown their followings or done much posting.</p>
<p>She goes on to say while the social media bubble may have wanted G+ to be a <a href="http://facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> slayer,  that’s not likely <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google’s</a> intent. She believes it’s to give us a social reason for using Google and that will provide them with more data.</p>
<p>Martin likes the interface, that you can share directly from Google Reader and that Google docs, calendar and Gmail are all there. He wonders if there’s more of a business application to the platform because G+ is so open and when you’re with friends you want to be in a less public environment – a private room with the doors closed, like FB.</p>
<p>Joe calls out the ability to organize circles by interest. And in his circles for journalists, marketers, web design and PR, people continue to publish interesting discussions. Joe uses the platform to follow posts on an industry by industry basis.</p>
<p>Martin suggests it could be a mini-blogging platform without the constraint of 140 characters; a place for companies to start a larger discussion.</p>
<p>Some recent updates: G+ can be managed by third-party apps like <a href="http://hootsuite.com" target="_blank">Hootsuite</a>. Right now, there’s only one administrator allowed for business pages – that’s going to change in the new year, but currently it’s a drawback.</p>
<p>And finally, we want to wish all our American friends and listeners a Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p>This week, <a href="http://twitter.com/jaybaer" target="_blank">Jay Baer</a>, of <a href="http://convinceandconvert.com" target="_blank">Convince and Convert</a> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/NOW-Revolution-Shifts-Business-Smarter/dp/047092327X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321471374&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">The Now Revolution</a></em> fame, is our guest.</p>
<p>We interviewed him at the <a href="http://prsa.org" target="_blank">PRSA</a> International Conference in Orlando last month and thought now was a great time to run it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s 2012 planning time so we discuss with him the things people ought to remember when using the social tools, trends to watch, and what to consider for next year.</p>
<p>A few things you want to pay particular attention to while you listen:</p>
<p>- His keynote topic at the conference was the goal of corporate culture in speed, authenticity, and response, not about social media.<br />
- He talks about how social media success isn&#8217;t about the tools and technology. It&#8217;s about corporate culture and being social instead of doing social.<br />
- He wants you to remember that the tools always change. If you focus on the tools, when they die, go public, or get bought out, you&#8217;re going to be left with the smoking wreckage of a plan not focused on strategy.<br />
- He says the goal is not to be good at social media. The goal is to be good at business, using social media.</p>
<p>We ask him what are the three things he wants you to take away and he outlines them for us.</p>
<p>We also discuss how, as consumers we have so much more information about at our fingertips, it&#8217;s important for companies to be sustainable, human, approachable, and engage to help us make our decisions.</p>
<p>Ending with what&#8217;s next for Jay Baer and the four words Martin takes away every time he hears Jay speak.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been said multiple times during the podcast, but if you&#8217;ve never heard Jay speak, you&#8217;ll quickly understand why he&#8217;s one of the industry&#8217;s most sought-after experts.</p>
<p>He walks the walk, is highly engaging, and is really, really smart.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

		<itunes:summary>This week, Jay Baer, of Convince and Convert and The Now Revolution fame, is our guest.

We interviewed him at the PRSA International Conference in Orlando last month and thought now was a great time to run it.

It's 2012 planning time so we discuss with him the things people ought to remember when using the social tools, trends to watch, and what to consider for next year.

A few things you want to pay particular attention to while you listen:

- His keynote topic at the conference was the goal of corporate culture in speed, authenticity, and response, not about social media.

<p>This week <a href="http://twitter.com/ginidietrich" target="_blank">Gini Dietrich</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/thornley" target="_blank">Joe Thornley</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman" target="_blank">Martin Waxman</a> talk about the new Plus in Google+, <a href="https://plus.google.com/pages/create" target="_blank">Google+ Pages</a> for businesses. The team watches this breaking news as it unfolds. Gini checks out the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/118177189004466545044/posts" target="_blank">Muppets page</a>, Martin checks out the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/111883881632877146615/posts" target="_blank">Pepsi page</a>, and Joe checks out the <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/110937137992985950150/posts" target="_blank">Toyota page</a>. The team looks forward to following the world Google+ pages and how it will develop. </p>
<p>But first, Joe starts off by sharing with everyone his adventures over in sunny, snowing Whistler, BC at the <a href="http://cwr.iabc.com/" target="_blank">IABC’s Western Canada Regional Conference</a>. Joe was very lucky because he actually won his pass to the conference, and he thanks the folks at <a href="http://toronto.iabc.com/" target="_blank">IABC Toronto</a> for that. </p>
<p>Then, Joe introduces an interviews from the <a href="http://www.prsa.org/Conferences/InternationalConference/" target="_blank">Public Relations Society of America Conference</a> with Dan Tisch, incoming chair of the <a href="http://www.globalalliancepr.org/" target="_blank">Global Alliance</a>. The Global Alliance is the confederation of the world&#8217;s major PR and communication management associations and institutions, representing 160,000 practitioners and educators around the world. The Global Alliance&#8217;s mission is to unify the public relations profession, raise professional standards all over the world, share knowledge for the benefit of its members and be the global voice for public relations in the public interest.</p>
<p>The Global Alliance is something Martin, Gini and Joe think will become very important very soon, so, make sure to check it out and listen to the full interview with Dan Tisch. </p>
<p>We would love to hear your opinion on the Global Alliance, or if you have any comments, insights or opinions on Google+ Pages.

Then, Joe introduces an interviews from the Public Relations Society of America Conference with Dan Tisch, incoming chair of the Global Alliance. The Global Alliance is the confederation of the world's major PR and communication management associations and institutions, representing 160,000 practitioners and educators around the world. The Global Alliance's mission is to unify the public relations profession, raise professional standards all over the world, share knowledge for the benefit of its members and be the global voice for public relations in the public interest.

The Global Alliance is something Martin, Gini and Joe think will become very important very soon, so, make sure to check it out and listen to the full interview with Dan Tisch. 

We would love to hear your opinion on the Global Alliance, or if you have any comments, insights or opinions on Google+ Pages.

<p>This week on Inside PR, <a title="Gini Dietrich blogs at spinsucks.com" href="http://www.spinsucks.com/" target="_self">Gini Dietrich</a>, <a title="Martin Waxman's eponymous blog" href="http://martinwaxman.com/" target="_blank">Martin Waxman</a> and <a title="Joseph Thornley blogs at propr.ca" href="http://www.propr.ca" target="_blank">Joseph Thornley</a> interview <a title="Abbie Fink on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/abbief" target="_blank">Abbie Fink</a> about the PRSA <a title="Counselors Academy Conference" href="http://www.prsa.org/Conferences/CounselorsAcademy/" target="_blank">Counselors Academy Conference </a>and what makes it special.</p>
<p>If you run a PR agency, you know that it can be hard to find expert advice that relates directly to our business. One conference fills this gap. The <a title="Counselors Academy Conference" href="http://www.prsa.org/Network/Communities/CounselorsAcademy" target="_blank">PRSA Counselors Academy Conference</a> brings together owners and managers of public realtions agencies across North America for two days of sessions focusing on the business of PR.</p>
<p>Abbie says the Counselors Academy conference is about &#8220;being a better owner, a better manager, discovering new ways to do business development and revenue streams &#8230; the management side of running a public relations practice.&#8221; The magic of this gathering, according to Abbie, is that business owners come together and share their experiences and knowledge freely with one another on business issues. How do they set billable hours? How do they determine when to bring on another employee? How do they deal with problematic clients? Under what circumstances would they fire a client?</p>
<p>At Counselors Academy, business leaders set aside their status as competitors in order to advance the collective whole, the public relations consulting industry. Says Abbie, &#8220;If I can help another PR agency owner look at or do something in a different way and they become better at what they do, that&#8217;s good for our industry as a whole.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next <a title="Counselors Academy Conference" href="http://www.prsa.org/Conferences/CounselorsAcademy/" target="_blank">Counselors Academy Conference</a> will take place May 6 to 8, 2012 in New Orleans. And Inside PR&#8217;s Martin Waxman is co-chairing this year&#8217;s conference with Dana Hughens. You can be sure that I&#8217;ll be there along with the senior leaders of my company.</p>

		<itunes:summary>This week on Inside PR, Gini Dietrich, Martin Waxman and Joseph Thornley interview Abbie Fink about the PRSA Counselors Academy Conference and what makes it special.

If you run a PR agency, you know that it can be hard to find expert advice that relates directly to our business. One conference fills this gap. The PRSA Counselors Academy Conference brings together owners and managers of public realtions agencies across North America for two days of sessions focusing on the business of PR.

Abbie says the Counselors Academy conference is about "being a better owner, a better manager, discovering new ways to do business development and revenue streams ... the management side of running a public relations practice." The magic of this gathering, according to Abbie, is that business owners come together and share their experiences and knowledge freely with one another on business issues. How do they set billable hours? How do they determine when to bring on another employee? How do they deal with problematic clients? Under what circumstances would they fire a client?

At Counselors Academy, business leaders set aside their status as competitors in order to advance the collective whole, the public relations consulting industry. Says Abbie, "If I can help another PR agency owner look at or do something in a different way and they become better at what they do, that's good for our industry as a whole."

The next Counselors Academy Conference will take place May 6 to 8, 2012 in New Orleans. And Inside PR's Martin Waxman is co-chairing this year's conference with Dana Hughens. You can be sure that I'll be there along with the senior leaders of my company.

<p>We’re on the trade show of <a href="http://www.prsa.org/Conferences/InternationalConference/" target="_blank">PRSA International Conference</a> in Orlando talking with <a href="http://twitter.com/ericschwartzman" target="_blank">Eric Schwartzman</a> – on a special joint episode with <a href="http://ontherecordpodcast.com/pr/otro/default.aspx" target="_blank">On the Record Online</a> and Inside PR.</p>
<p>Like us, Eric also records his podcasts over Skype but prefers face to face interviews when he can. And he’s a veteran, who started in April 2005, just after <a href="http://www.forimmediaterelease.biz/" target="_blank">For Immediate Release</a> and around the same time <a href="http://twitter.com/terryfallis" target="_blank">Terry Fallis</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/doctorjones" target="_blank">David Jones</a> began Inside PR.</p>
<p>Gini, Joe, Eric and I discuss the state of podcasting and Eric talks about his approach:</p>
<p>- He’s feature-oriented, as opposed to news focused, so his shows have a longer shelf-life.<br />
- He continues podcasting because he likes to learn and finds when there’s a mic and recorder, he gets the best answers from experts.<br />
- He sees which shows people love based on the stats, but doesn’t chase the audience; he does what interests him.<br />
- He spends a good deal of time – about eight hours per episode &#8211; preparing, conducting interviews, editing and producing, writing and publishing show notes and publishing. It is a time commitment, but he gets nearly 1,000,000 downloads a year.</p>
<p>The discussion ends when a band starts up in the booth behind us.</p>

<p>Coming to you, live, from the <a href="http://prsa.org" target="_blank">PRSA International Conference</a>&#8230;and we&#8217;re all in Orlando together.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a far better experience to record in person than with <a href="http://plus.google.com/hangouts" target="_blank">Google Hangouts</a> and our <a href="http://www.zoom.co.jp/english/products/h4/" target="_blank">Zoom recorders</a>. Body language is easier to read, even though we use video, and we can play off one another better.</p>
<p>We hope you agree!</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soledad_O'Brien" target="_blank">Soledad O&#8217;Brien</a> was the conference opening keynote where she talked about diversity and media relations.</p>
<p>She, as she says, is a &#8220;mixed race person.&#8221; Her dad is Irish and Australian and her mother is black and Cuban. During her keynote she describes systemic racism and how far we&#8217;ve come, but that we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>Her parents were at Johns Hopkins and living in Baltimore as an engaged couple. They couldn&#8217;t get married in Baltimore because, in 1958, it was illegal. So they got married in DC and lived illegally in Baltimore as an interracial couple.</p>
<p>You may be wondering what this has to do with the communication industry.</p>
<p>The PRSA conferences have always had programming that drives toward a greater purpose. Our job is about serving more than the master; it&#8217;s our job to not accept things as they are, but to communicate views in order to move things forward.</p>
<p>The keynote Soledad set the right tone for the conference and for any kind of organization&#8230;that is: communications should serve as a higher purpose.</p>
<p>She also talked about storytelling being the foundation of everything. She said, as PR professionals, we have to tell her stories and then trust her to take our stories and create something useful for her audiences.</p>
<p>It really bothers her when she is pitched by people who haven&#8217;t bothered to watch what she does. She says it&#8217;s offensive to receive those kinds of pitches and this is something the three of us discuss at length during the podcast.</p>
<p>Also some news for Joe and Martin at the end&#8230;so don&#8217;t tune out early!</p>
<p>Coming soon: Interviews from old friends and new, including <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/pierreloic" target="_blank">Pierre-Loic Assyag</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/DanTisch" target="_blank">Dan Tisch</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/shonali" target="_blank">Shonali Burke</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/abbief" target="_blank">Abbie Fink</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jaybaer" target="_blank">Jay Baer</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mdbarber" target="_blank">Mary Barber</a>, John Devaney, <a href="https://twitter.com/ericschwartzman" target="_blank">Eric Schwartzman</a>, and more!</p>

		<itunes:summary>Coming to you, live, from the PRSA International Conference...and we're all in Orlando together.

It's a far better experience to record in person than with Google Hangouts and our Zoom recorders. Body language is easier to read, even though we use video, and we can play off one another better.

We hope you agree!

Soledad O'Brien was the conference opening keynote where she talked about diversity and media relations.

She, as she says, is a "mixed race person." Her dad is Irish and Australian and her mother is black and Cuban. During her keynote she describes systemic racism and how far we've come, but that we still have a long way to go.

Her parents were at Johns Hopkins and living in Baltimore as an engaged couple. They couldn't get married in Baltimore because, in 1958, it was illegal. So they got married in DC and lived illegally in Baltimore as an interracial couple.

You may be wondering what this has to do with the communication industry.

The PRSA conferences have always had programming that drives toward a greater purpose. Our job is about serving more than the master; it's our job to not accept things as they are, but to communicate views in order to move things forward.

The keynote Soledad set the right tone for the conference and for any kind of organization...that is: communications should serve as a higher purpose.

She also talked about storytelling being the foundation of everything. She said, as PR professionals, we have to tell her stories and then trust her to take our stories and create something useful for her audiences.

It really bothers her when she is pitched by people who haven't bothered to watch what she does. She says it's offensive to receive those kinds of pitches and this is something the three of us discuss at length during the podcast.

Also some news for Joe and Martin at the end...so don't tune out early!

Coming soon: Interviews from old friends and new, including Pierre-Loic Assyag, Dan Tisch, Shonali Burke, Abbie Fink, Jay Baer, Mary Barber, John Devaney, Eric Schwartzman, and more!

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman" target="_blank">Martin Waxman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/thornley" target="_blank">Joseph Thornley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ginidietrich" target="_blank">Gini Dietrich</a> start off by remembering the great figure and true visionary, <a href="http://allaboutstevejobs.com/" target="_blank">Steve Jobs</a>.</p>
<p>Joe encourages everyone to watch the infamous and powerful Steve Jobs <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA" target="_blank">commence speech</a> done at Stanford University in 2005. Jobs end his speech with the words “stay hungry, stay foolish.” Words that inspire us all.</p>
<p>Martin reminds listeners that the Inside PR team will be at the <a href="http://www.prsa.org/Conferences/InternationalConference/" target="_blank">PRSA Conference in Orlando, Florida</a> from October 15 to 18<sup>th</sup>. He also invites listeners to check out his conversation with with conference co-chair, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BONNIEUPRIGHT" target="_blank">Bonnie Upright</a>, APR, and PRSA chair and CEO, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/fiskey" target="_blank">Rosanna Fiske</a>, APR, about what to expect. Check out the special Inside PR episode <a href="http://www.insidepr.ca/index.php/2011/10/08/inside-pr-special-edition-spotlight-on-the-prsa-international-conference/" target="_blank">here</a>. Gini also remind anyone who is planning on attending the conference to RSVP for the <a href="http://twtvite.com/pooltweetup" target="_blank">Inside PR Tweet Up</a> on Monday night where your first drink is on the Inside PR team.</p>
<p>Then the team jumps in to a discussion sparked by a comment by David:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I’m currently a first year public relations student at Algonquin College. I’ve been listening in on your podcasts for a while now and the amount of information that flies around can sometimes be staggering.</p>
<p>The program has been great. It’s exhilarating to be involved in something with people who are as passionate as I am about PR.</p>
<p>But onto my question: Does a college diploma suffice as post-secondary background for jobs in this field? Most successful PR people I’ve spoken to have backgrounds in communications and university degrees. It worries me that my graduation from this program will not be enough.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate it if you could speak about this on your next show.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Joe asks: what kind of education do we see coming through the door of the successful candidates we hire or we see others hire these days.</p>
<p>Martin believes any education is fine, but one should supplement that education with communications work. It is important to have a general background and understanding of communications and PR.</p>
<p>Gini says she doesn’t necessarily look at what the degree is in, just as long as there is a degree. She really pays attention to the internships a student has had before they graduated. She also mentions <a href="http://www.armentdietrich.com/" target="_blank">Arment Dietrich</a> will not hire someone without that person completing and internship with them.</p>
<p>Joe echoes Gini’s point and talks about the importance of internships and encourages students to find a program with a co-op option. Joe mentions that an internship can be a ticket to a job offer.</p>
<p>However, all agree that networking and building a network using social media tools are very important</p>
<p>They finish off the episode with a discussion on a blog posts Gini posted <a href="http://www.spinsucks.com/social-media/eight-tools-for-social-media-listening/" target="_blank">social media tools for listening</a>.</p>
<p>Gini talks about:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://twendz.waggeneredstrom.com/" target="_blank">Twendz</a>: reputation management tool<br />
2. <a href="http://technorati.com/" target="_blank">Technorati</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/blogsearch">Google Blog Search</a>: blog tracking tools to find out who is talking about your services, your brand, your competition, etc.<br />
3. <a href="http://www.delicious.com/" target="_blank">Delicious</a> and <a href="http://www.diigo.com/">Diigo</a>: social bookmarking tools<br />
4. <a href="http://search.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter Search</a>: search Twitter exclusively for your company key words and see what people are saying<br />
5. <a href="http://websitegrader.com/" target="_blank">Website grader</a> and <a href="http://bloggrader.com/">Blog grader</a>: get a basic understanding of where your web property stands<br />
6. <a href="http://compete.com/" target="_blank">Compete</a>: compare your traffic to your competitions traffic.<br />
7. Web analytics: Gini says everyone should be looking at their web analytics.</p>
<p>Joe compares paid tools versus free tools. Sometimes the paid tools don’t always catch everything, and it is sometimes a good thing to step back and see what other free tools can pick up. It may surprise you.</p>
<p>Martin adds to the list, blogrolls, see who the influential people are following. It can be a great way to expand your network.</p>
<p>Gini ends the show with a shout out to the guys over at <a href="http://quietnewsday.co.uk/" target="_blank">Quiet News Day</a>, <a href="http://scottdouglas.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Scott Douglas</a> and <a href="http://milnemedia.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Shaun Milne</a> for mentioning Inside PR.

Joe encourages everyone to watch the infamous and powerful Steve Jobs commence speech done at Stanford University in 2005. Jobs end his speech with the words “stay hungry, stay foolish.” Words that inspire us all.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p>Last week we had a really good comment from <a href="http://totalinsights.co.uk/" target="_blank">Yasin Akgun</a>.</p>
<p>He asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi guys. I was wondering whether you could answer my question in your next show:</p>
<p>I’m managing the Twitter presence for a B2B company and was wondering whether I am being naive in thinking that Tweets praising or being positive about other brands’ products is OK and good BR (business relations) as well as PR. For example “just seen the Incentive range from Rival Company, stunning stuff!”</p>
<p>I hope the question isn’t one of these where I go back and think “wow how naive was I”. I just believe in fostering good relations with other organisations regardless of the stereotypical negative business attitude of “us and them, theyre our rivals”.</p></blockquote>
<p>So <a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman" target="_blank">Martin Waxman </a>begins the discussion by asking, &#8221;Should you be tweeting positively about your competition?&#8221;</p>
<p>The discussion is lively as we don&#8217;t all agree.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/thornley" target="_blank">Joe Thornley </a>has a point about the early days of social media and how we all shared freely&#8230;until we realized we could make money from teaching companies how to incorporate the social tools into their larger marketing programs.</p>
<p>He goes on to say the business world doesn&#8217;t see competitors as friendly and, when you give away too much information, they consider you naive. He said he&#8217;d rather be silent than compliment <em>or </em>diss them.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/ginidietrich" target="_blank">Gini Dietrich</a> disagrees and says, while social has allowed her to gain credibility and thought leadership in order for <a href="http://armentdietrich.com" target="_blank">Arment Dietrich</a> to compete with the global PR firms, it was <a href="http://counselorsacademy.org" target="_blank">Counselor&#8217;s Academy</a> that made her realize there are benefits in working with your competition, instead of against it.</p>
<p>And Martin balances the two by discussing the difference between friendly and cutthroat competition.</p>
<p>He also suggests that complimenting your competition online is really a business decision your company leaders need to make and not something you can do without discussing with them first.</p>
<p>We also touch on the <a href="http://www.spinsucks.com/communication/the-lesson-brands-can-learn-from-ragu/" target="_blank">Ragu &#8220;crisis,&#8221;</a> which was created by some spam tweets and a few upset daddy bloggers. And we discuss the features and benefits of the new <a href="http://delicious.com" target="_blank">Delicious</a>.</p>
<p>We also learned some very sad news. <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/barbaranixon" target="_blank">Barbara Nixon</a>, a friend to all three of us, and long-time Inside PR listener, learned last week that her 22 year old son, <a href="http://www.theplainsman.com/view/full_story/15917308/article-Community-mourns-student-death?instance=home_news_lead_story" target="_blank">Kyle, passed away unexpectedly</a>. Our hearts go out to her and her family right now.</p>
<p>——————–</p>
<p><strong>Reminder</strong>: Inside PR will be recording live from the <a title="PRSA International Conference" href="http://www.prsa.org/Conferences/InternationalConference/" target="_blank">PRSA International Conference</a> in Orlando on October 16 and 17. We’ll also be interviewing speakers and participants. So, if you’re planning to be there, let us know and we will grab a sound bite with you.</p>
<p>And, RSVP for the <a href="http://twtvite.com/PRSAICon" target="_blank">TweetUp</a> on Monday, Oct. 18. The first drink is on us!</p>

		<itunes:summary>Last week we had a really good comment from Yasin Akgun.

He asked:
Hi guys. I was wondering whether you could answer my question in your next show:

I’m managing the Twitter presence for a B2B company and was wondering whether I am being naive in thinking that Tweets praising or being positive about other brands’ products is OK and good BR (business relations) as well as PR. For example “just seen the Incentive range from Rival Company, stunning stuff!”

I hope the question isn’t one of these where I go back and think “wow how naive was I”. I just believe in fostering good relations with other organisations regardless of the stereotypical negative business attitude of “us and them, theyre our rivals”.
So Martin Waxman begins the discussion by asking, "Should you be tweeting positively about your competition?"

The discussion is lively as we don't all agree.

Joe Thornley has a point about the early days of social media and how we all shared freely...until we realized we could make money from teaching companies how to incorporate the social tools into their larger marketing programs.

He goes on to say the business world doesn't see competitors as friendly and, when you give away too much information, they consider you naive. He said he'd rather be silent than compliment or diss them.

Gini Dietrich disagrees and says, while social has allowed her to gain credibility and thought leadership in order for Arment Dietrich to compete with the global PR firms, it was Counselor's Academy that made her realize there are benefits in working with your competition, instead of against it.

And Martin balances the two by discussing the difference between friendly and cutthroat competition.

He also suggests that complimenting your competition online is really a business decision your company leaders need to make and not something you can do without discussing with them first.

We also touch on the Ragu "crisis," which was created by some spam tweets and a few upset daddy bloggers. And we discuss the features and benefits of the new Delicious.

We also learned some very sad news. Barbara Nixon, a friend to all three of us, and long-time Inside PR listener, learned last week that her 22 year old son, Kyle, passed away unexpectedly. Our hearts go out to her and her family right now.

<p>In this week&#8217;s Inside PR, <a title="Martin Waxman on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Martin Waxman</a>, <a title="Gini Dietrich on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/ginidietrich" target="_blank">Gini Dietrich</a> and <a title="Joseph Thornley on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/thornley">Joseph Thornley</a> talk about Intranets and the recent changes to Facebook.</p>
<p>Joe&#8217;s <a title="Thornley Fallis Communications" href="http://www.thornleyfallis.ca/" target="_blank">company&#8217;s</a> Intranet is built around a <a title="Our Wiki is built on MediaWiki" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki" target="_blank">Wiki </a>to host content, <a title="Present.ly" href="http://www.presently.com/" target="_blank">Present.ly</a> to support publishing and linking to content and Windows Live Messenger to enable one to one video calls. He encourages people to use these three tools to divert content from emails (we all suffer from inbox glut) and to channel communications from broad publishing through to one to one communications via video.</p>
<p>Martin points out that we have so many &#8220;places to go,&#8221; so many channels of communication, that managing these different channels can become a challenge unto itself.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s Facebook. We received a comment from <a title="Liza Butcher on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/lizabutcher" target="_blank">Liza Butcher</a>, who suggested that, &#8220;With the changes made this past week, I believe facebook it is trying to be too many things in one space, and ostracizing generations of people that may not be as tech savvy as others. &#8230; Facebook was a place for everyone, and now it is becoming too technical for the masses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gini and Martin talk about their impressions of the most recent Facebook changes. Gini points out that it will be important to decide what you want to include in your timeline. Sharing everything won&#8217;t be for everyone. And it&#8217;s important to be aware of what the timeline automatically shares so that you can filter out the info you wouldn&#8217;t want to see there. Martin suggests that we all should become familiar with the &#8220;view activity&#8221; panel that will enable us to remove content from our timeline. Other neat features: the cover photo we can add to our Facebook profile and the ability to add &#8220;milestones&#8221; to fill in our timeline.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p><strong>Reminder</strong>: Inside PR will be recording live from the <a title="PRSA International Conference" href="http://www.prsa.org/Conferences/InternationalConference/" target="_blank">PRSA International Conference</a> in Orlando on October 16 and 17.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/ginidietrich" target="_blank">Gini</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/thornley" target="_blank">Joe</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman" target="_blank">Martin</a> start off by announcing they’ll be attending the <a href="http://www.prsa.org/Conferences/InternationalConference/" target="_blank">PRSA International Conference</a> in Orlando, Florida, October 15 to 18 as ‘roving reporters’ roaming the halls and recording episodes of Inside PR.  If you have any suggestions for topics or would like to do an interview, please let us know.</p>
<p>Inside PR is also sponsoring a tweetup at the conference on Monday, October 17 – details to follow.  We hope to see you there.</p>
<p>Joe then talks about a post on the Niemen Journalism Lab blog, <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/09/a-vast-wasteland-revisited-a-berkman-center-discussion-on-the-state-of-television-and-media/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NiemanJournalismLab+%28Nieman+Journalism+Lab%29" target="_blank">‘A Vast Wasteland Revisited’</a>, to mark the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of FCC Chair Newton Minnow’s speech about television’s potential for greatness&#8230; or garbage (i.e. the wasteland).</p>
<p>He feels the ideas resonate more than ever today with social media and especially <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, which can be seen as another ‘vast wasteland’.</p>
<p>Martin segues into some of the changes Facebook has made recently including the ability to subscribe to feeds from people you’re not friends with and its new lists function. Gini thinks the change is an interesting play on privacy and if you just want to communicate with friends, you should turn off the subscription option.  Gini uses Facebook for business publicly and is more private about her personal profile.</p>
<p>Joe thinks this could be the week Facebook lost it by overcomplicating things and introducing too many features.  He believes <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> is a great news feed; <a href="https://plus.google.com/" target="_blank">Google+</a> is the place to have conversations with smart people and blogs are where you go to read and comment on long-form ideas.</p>
<p>Martin mentions the fact that you now have lists on the left side between groups and pages and the defaults aren’t working well for him. For example, the college default is a random group of friends who happened to go to the same university he did at some point and doesn’t have any cohesiveness beyond place.</p>
<p>For our second topic, Gini talks about <a href="http://www.spinsucks.com/communication/netflix-a-lesson-in-communication-and-what-not-to-do/" target="_blank">Netflix CEO Reed Hastings</a> saying how the company &#8216;messed up&#8217; the way it handled the price increase. She believes he shows some humility because, while Netflix had moved away from listening to its customers and made the decision in a boardroom, a customer uproar caused them to admit they were wrong.</p>
<p>Gini goes on to say it’s clear Netflix wants to shed its DVD service and move to streaming, but from a communication perspective, they should have had better counsel.  Joe discloses that one of his clients works in a similar space – but as an outside observer, he’s impressed when any company is honest with its customers.  It will be interesting to see if their actions are enough for people to give them another chance.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Gini, Joe and Martin start off by announcing they’ll be attending the PRSA International Conference in Orlando, Florida, October 15 to 18 as ‘roving reporters’ roaming the halls and recording episodes of Inside PR.  If you have any suggestions for topics or would like to do an interview, please let us know.

Inside PR is also sponsoring a tweetup at the conference on Monday, October 17 – details to follow.  We hope to see you there.

Joe then talks about a post on the Niemen Journalism Lab blog, ‘A Vast Wasteland Revisited’, to mark the 50th anniversary of FCC Chair Newton Minnow’s speech about television’s potential for greatness... or garbage (i.e. the wasteland).

He feels the ideas resonate more than ever today with social media and especially Facebook, which can be seen as another ‘vast wasteland’.

Martin segues into some of the changes Facebook has made recently including the ability to subscribe to feeds from people you’re not friends with and its new lists function. Gini thinks the change is an interesting play on privacy and if you just want to communicate with friends, you should turn off the subscription option.  Gini uses Facebook for business publicly and is more private about her personal profile.

Joe thinks this could be the week Facebook lost it by overcomplicating things and introducing too many features.  He believes Twitter is a great news feed; Google+ is the place to have conversations with smart people and blogs are where you go to read and comment on long-form ideas.

Martin mentions the fact that you now have lists on the left side between groups and pages and the defaults aren’t working well for him. For example, the college default is a random group of friends who happened to go to the same university he did at some point and doesn’t have any cohesiveness beyond place.

For our second topic, Gini talks about Netflix CEO Reed Hastings saying how the company 'messed up' the way it handled the price increase. She believes he shows some humility because, while Netflix had moved away from listening to its customers and made the decision in a boardroom, a customer uproar caused them to admit they were wrong.

Gini goes on to say it’s clear Netflix wants to shed its DVD service and move to streaming, but from a communication perspective, they should have had better counsel.  Joe discloses that one of his clients works in a similar space – but as an outside observer, he’s impressed when any company is honest with its customers.  It will be interesting to see if their actions are enough for people to give them another chance.

<p>This week on Inside PR, <a href="http://twitter.com/thornley">Joe Thornley</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman">Martin Waxman</a>, and I discuss how two interesting studies –<a href="http://www.diigo.com/bookmark/http%3A%2F%2Fblog.twitter.com%2F2011%2F09%2Fone-hundred-million-voices.html?tab=people&amp;uname=thornley" target="_blank"> Twitter active users</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/09/bit-ly-quantifies-internet-impatience-old-links-get-no-love" target="_blank">bit.ly link active length of time</a> – intersect with the departure of <a href="http://technorati.com/technology/article/michael-arrington-wars-with-aol-fired/" target="_blank">Michael Arrington from TechCrunch</a> and the evolution of journalism.</p>
<p>The interesting thing to note is that Twitter shows they have 100 million active users. But, as <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/09/the-logged-out-user-continued.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AVc+%28A+VC%29" target="_blank">Fred Wilson points out</a>, there are 400 million monthly unique visitors on Twitter.</p>
<p>Four hundred million monthly uniques.</p>
<p>This statistic, alone, demonstrates the value of Twitter as a newsfeed and we discuss the implications of this on both the fourth and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Welcome-Fifth-Estate-Sustain-Strategy/dp/0910155860/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1316050769&amp;sr=8-7" target="_blank">fifth estates</a>.</p>
<p>Then to add a layer, Michael Arrington, who infamously has said he doesn’t care if he’s right, he just wants to be first, was publicly fired from TechCrunch because of ethical concerns around his <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2011/09/02/arringtons-crunchfund-stirs-debate.html" target="_blank">newly created CrunchFund</a>.</p>
<p>We discuss what this means both for social media and journalism, as we know it.</p>
<p>And to add one more layer, <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/09/01/its-not-just-nice-for-media-to-be-social-its-imperative/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+OmMalik+%28GigaOM%3A+Tech%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">Matthew Ingram blogs that it’s not just nice for media to be social</a>, it’s imperative. He says journalists have become complacent and stopped engaging, assuming their readers will come to them.</p>
<p>In response to Ingram, <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/09/02/mikeArringtonIsTheFutureOf.html" target="_blank">Dave Weiner argues that journalism is becoming obsolete</a> because it was a response to publishing and it was, but now we can all be distributors. And Ingram<a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/09/02/is-journalism-as-we-know-it-becoming-obsolete/" target="_blank"> responds with saying that it’s not becoming obsolete</a>, but rather, evolving rapidly.</p>
<p>The point of all this back and forth is that, as communications professionals, we need to understand there are profound implications to the way we’re getting our news, how content is being created, and what is being published and distributed.</p>
<p>We discuss how journalism (the fourth estate) is about providing context and expertise and citizen journalists (the fifth estate, or citizen witnesses, as Joe calls them) provide quick information without that context.</p>
<p>And these wonderful discussions are all wrapped up with some exciting news that you’ll want to hang around to hear!</p>

		<itunes:summary>This week on Inside PR, Joe Thornley, Martin Waxman, and I discuss how two interesting studies – Twitter active users and bit.ly link active length of time – intersect with the departure of Michael Arrington from TechCrunch and the evolution of journalism.

The interesting thing to note is that Twitter shows they have 100 million active users. But, as Fred Wilson points out, there are 400 million monthly unique visitors on Twitter.

Four hundred million monthly uniques.

This statistic, alone, demonstrates the value of Twitter as a newsfeed and we discuss the implications of this on both the fourth and fifth estates.

<p>We&#8217;re back. Ready for another year of Inside PR. And we hope you&#8217;ll be joining us again for a discussion of communication, technology, community and the impact they are having on us.</p>
<p>We start off today&#8217;s podcast with a discussion of corporate social responsibility &#8211; an issue <a title="Liza Butcher on Twitter" href="http://www.twitter.com/lizabutcher" target="_blank">Liza Butcher</a> raised in a <a title="Liza Butcher's comment" href="http://www.insidepr.ca/index.php/2011/08/30/one-more-week-ipr-2-67-available-september-7/#comment-663083" target="_blank">comment</a> last week. Gini talks about the preference people have to work with a company that gives back. Joe cites <a title="Guy Kawasaki on Google+" href="https://plus.google.com/112374836634096795698/about" target="_blank">Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s</a> suggestion in <a title="Enchantment: The art of changing hearts, minds and actions" href="http://www.guykawasaki.com/enchantment/" target="_blank">Enchantment</a> that you &#8220;should be a mensch.&#8221; Among other things, this means that you should &#8220;help someone who can be of absolutely no use to you.&#8221; Martin underlines this point with an example of a company that risked appearing self serving and self congratulatory in acting upon their social responsibility.</p>
<p>We also talk about the <a title="We the People" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/wethepeople" target="_blank">We the People</a> site that is being launched by the White House. Joe compares it to the British Prime Minister&#8217;s <a title="Number10 - Website of the UK Prime Minister" href="http://www.number10.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Number10</a> Website, which also has a petition function as well as links to policy consultations. Gini argues that the site falls short of its potential by making the culmination of the process a response from policy makers in the White House. Martin wonders about the requirement for 5,000 expressions of support as the threshold at which petitions will receive a reply. Is it an arbitrary number? Or is there some rationale for this?</p>
<p>Finally, we talk about the recent news that monitoring service <a title="VMS closes" href="http://www.odwyerpr.com/blog/index.php?/archives/3149-VMS-Closes-its-Doors.html" target="_blank">VMS shut its doors</a> recently. Katie Paine published a <a title="Why VMS failed" href="http://kdpaine.blogs.com/themeasurementstandard/2011/09/social-media-a-meteorite-for-dinosaurs.html" target="_blank">thoughtful post</a> on why the service failed. One of her arguments is that some longstanding suppliers are focused on giving their customers what they feel comfortable with. Newer entrants like Radian6 and Sysomos are innovating to provide the marketplace with new insights. Services that don&#8217;t match them will fall by the wayside.</p>

We start off today's podcast with a discussion of corporate social responsibility - an issue Liza Butcher raised in a comment last week. Gini talks about the preference people have to work with a company that gives back. Joe cites Guy Kawasaki's suggestion in Enchantment that you "should be a mensch." Among other things, this means that you should "help someone who can be of absolutely no use to you." Martin underlines this point with an example of a company that risked appearing self serving and self congratulatory in acting upon their social responsibility.

We also talk about the We the People site that is being launched by the White House. Joe compares it to the British Prime Minister's Number10 Website, which also has a petition function as well as links to policy consultations. Gini argues that the site falls short of its potential by making the culmination of the process a response from policy makers in the White House. Martin wonders about the requirement for 5,000 expressions of support as the threshold at which petitions will receive a reply. Is it an arbitrary number? Or is there some rationale for this?

Finally, we talk about the recent news that monitoring service VMS shut its doors recently. Katie Paine published a thoughtful post on why the service failed. One of her arguments is that some longstanding suppliers are focused on giving their customers what they feel comfortable with.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p>For those of you who don’t know, Inside PR is not just the voices you hear every week, but there is a hard working producer behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Every week, <a href="http://twitter.com/ginidietrich" target="_blank">Gini Dietrich</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman" target="_blank">Martin Waxman</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/thornley" target="_blank">Joe Thornley</a> drop their files off in <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> and patiently wait as an episode magically appears before them. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the Inside PR producer, <a href="http://twitter.com/kristinesimpson" target="_blank">Kristine Simpson</a>, works her own magic and produces the show.</p>
<p>This week, Gini, Martin, Joe and Kristine &#8220;hung-out&#8221; on Goggle+ to talk about the behind the scenes of the Inside PR podcast and Kristine gives tips on how to produce your own podcast.</p>
<p>Here is Kristine&#8217;s 5 step guide to creating your own podcast:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Upload and edit</strong></p>
<p>First you need your voice files – the file that includes your recording. If you are multiple people, use separate microphones to create separate files. This makes it easier to edit out background noise. Upload all files in to an audio editing software, I use <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>.<br />
Then edit the content. Take out bloopers, add in intro and outro music, take out background noise, and remove barking sounds from Gini’s dog.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Export and level</strong></p>
<p>Now time to export the file. Export it as a WAV. file so you can drop the file in <a href="http://www.conversationsnetwork.org/levelator" target="_blank">Levelator</a>. Levalator automatically makes all voices the same volume. When you record with two or more microphones, someone is always louder than the other. And some people just naturally have a louder voice. Levalator ensures everyone speaks at the same volume.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Export the MP3</strong></p>
<p>Although a WAV. file is a popular audio file, convert your file to a MP3. It is very easy to do with Audacity and it shrinks the file to be more manageable and it makes it easier to download. MP3 files are also more popular and can play in various audio and video players.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Upload to Libsyn.com</strong></p>
<p>If you make your podcast available through <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" target="_blank">iTunes</a>, your podcast can easily be made available to your followers. Followers can also subscribe and receive new podcasts instantly to their iTunes library.</p>
<p>Once you have created an iTunes account for your podcast, you simply need to upload your finished MP3 on to <a href="http://libsyn.com/3/alt-index.php" target="_blank">Liberated Syndication (or Libsyn)</a>. Libsyn then makes the podcast available on iTunes. Libsyn also provides you with links (embedded and direct), which you can use to share through social media (i.e. a blog post).</p>
<p>5. <strong>Share</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways to share your podcast. <a href="http://www.insidepr.ca/" target="_blank">Inside PR writes a blog post</a> every week to accompany the podcast. Each week a different host writes the show notes and I push it live on the blog.</p>
<p>The Inside PR blog is a <a href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress blog</a>, which makes it easy to add plugins that allow followers to listen to the podcast directly on the blog post.</p>
<p>Follow those five steps and with a flick of the wrist, magic! The podcast is created.</p>
<p>Listen to this week’s episode of <a href="http://www.insidepr.ca/" target="_blank">Inside PR</a> to hear more about producing a podcast. Kristine also talks about the intricacies of being a producer – i.e. She can tell Gini, Martin and Joe apart, just by looking at their vocal waves.</p>
<p>If you want to connect with Kristine or ask her more questions about producing a podcast, you can find her on <a href="http://twitter.com/kristinesimpson" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, or catch her blogging at <a href="http://lovensmile.wordpress.com/">Running a PR life</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p>We start this week with a question from a listener, <a href="http://twitter.com/QuickCatchUp" target="_blank">LaBrandon Dates</a>: How do you know when it’s time to search for a new job and can a person stay positive in a company with a negative or non team-oriented culture?</p>
<p>Thanks LaBrandon &#8211; great question! We&#8217;re going to answer from the perspective of employers and employees.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/thornley" target="_blank">Joe Thornley</a> left a company after 11 years when he realized the people he’d come to work with &#8211; the ones who shared his values &#8211; had all gone. The company had been acquired, the culture changed and he was no longer happy.  If you’re not happy, he says, you shouldn’t spend 20 seconds at a place because life is too short.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/ginidietrich" target="_blank">Gini Dietrich</a> left Fleishman because she wanted a change from the city where she was based, though she liked the people and the firm.  At another agency, she had philosophical differences with colleagues and left because she realized there was no common ground.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman">Martin Waxman</a> was at a Canadian firm that was acquired by a multinational. And because some of the senior leadership couldn’t accept the change, it felt like individuals were working for different entities rather than a single company and that hurt morale. He stayed about a year longer than he should have and says it’s important to ask yourself the tough questions early and then decide whether or not to leave.</p>
<p>Joe comments that talented people who are miserable make others miserable but they can always get a position at a place where they’d be happy.  But before you start looking, be honest with your supervisor and share what you feel and why.</p>
<p>We don’t know anyone who was fired for admitting they weren’t happy in a job.</p>
<p>Gini introduces our second topic. She recently noticed that large companies are looking to smaller, more nimble, boutique firms when they’re conducting an agency search and wonders if this is a trend or possibly an economic shift.</p>
<p>Joe remarks that it’s the slowest recovery he can remember.  People are being careful where they spend money and need to show results.  On the other hand, he’s seen more businesses coming into Canada with consolidated budgets that are going with multinational AORs rather than a Canadian firm.</p>
<p>Martin says he’s been working more closely with U.S. agencies and adapting their initiatives. He feels PR budgets haven’t grown – a good client is one that comes back flat.  Which leads to the question, how can we accomplish more with less?</p>
<p>Gini believes PR people should acquire more marketing skills. And unless we do that, our industry may become extinct&#8230;</p>
<p>What do you think?  Can PR successfully adapt?  We&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts.</p>

Thanks LaBrandon - great question! We're going to answer from the perspective of employers and employees.

Joe Thornley left a company after 11 years when he realized the people he’d come to work with - the ones who shared his values - had all gone. The company had been acquired, the culture changed and he was no longer happy.  If you’re not happy, he says, you shouldn’t spend 20 seconds at a place because life is too short.

Gini Dietrich left Fleishman because she wanted a change from the city where she was based, though she liked the people and the firm.  At another agency, she had philosophical differences with colleagues and left because she realized there was no common ground.

Martin Waxman was at a Canadian firm that was acquired by a multinational. And because some of the senior leadership couldn’t accept the change, it felt like individuals were working for different entities rather than a single company and that hurt morale. He stayed about a year longer than he should have and says it’s important to ask yourself the tough questions early and then decide whether or not to leave.

Joe comments that talented people who are miserable make others miserable but they can always get a position at a place where they’d be happy.  But before you start looking, be honest with your supervisor and share what you feel and why.

We don’t know anyone who was fired for admitting they weren’t happy in a job.

Gini introduces our second topic. She recently noticed that large companies are looking to smaller, more nimble, boutique firms when they’re conducting an agency search and wonders if this is a trend or possibly an economic shift.

Joe remarks that it’s the slowest recovery he can remember.  People are being careful where they spend money and need to show results.  On the other hand, he’s seen more businesses coming into Canada with consolidated budgets that are going with multinational AORs rather than a Canadian firm.

Martin says he’s been working more closely with U.S. agencies and adapting their initiatives. He feels PR budgets haven’t grown – a good client is one that comes back flat.  Which leads to the question, how can we accomplish more with less?

Gini believes PR people should acquire more marketing skills. And unless we do that, our industry may become extinct...

What do you think?  Can PR successfully adapt?  We'd love to hear your thoughts.

<p>Jeff Jarvis unloaded a real <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/2011/07/19/pr-and-corruption-theater/" target="_blank">roundhouse on PR and the News of the World affair</a> and Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s appearance in front of Parliament.</p>
<p>The blog post discusses how coached Murdoch seemed during his appearance and how he completely missed transparency in his answers.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/thornley" target="_blank">Joe Thornley</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman" target="_blank">Martin Waxman</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/ginidietrich" target="_blank">Gini Dietrich</a> set the stage for PR and the Murdoch affair and discuss who we, as PR professionals, are responsible to.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting topic, to begin with, because it seems impossible for people to disconnect how we (as a generalization) feel about a personality and the reality of what&#8217;s really going on. How the news media portrays a man and how we, as a society, condem him for something his employees he did.</p>
<p>But we all agree that, as leaders, it&#8217;s our jobs to take responsibility for the mistakes our employees make&#8230;even if we weren&#8217;t aware they were going on. The communication is something such as, &#8220;I don&#8217;t condone what my employees did. I take responsibility for their actions. And this is what I&#8217;m going to do about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conversation then turns to true PR, just like marketing, should be in the best interest of the customer. Not in the best interest of the company. Not in the best interest of the stakeholders. Not in the best interest of the employees. But in the best interest of the customer.</p>
<p>We all need to ask ourselves: Are we helping our clients spin a story (as you know, <a href="http://spinsucks.com" target="_blank">Spin Sucks</a>) that makes them look better or are we helping them effectively communicate with their customers?</p>
<p>And the last point was one raised first by <a href="http://davidweinberger.sys-con.com/node/1910647" target="_blank">David Weinberger</a> where he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I were Edelman PR, I would probably agree to take on NewsCorp, but only if I were satisfied to a reasonable degree (yes, them’s fudge words) that NewsCorp was ready to tell the truth. (Clients do lie to their PR companies. The first time Edelman catches NewsCorp lying to them, Edelman should quite publicly drop them.)</p></blockquote>
<p>From there we discuss how our jobs, as PR professionals, is to be there for the public interest and to tell the truth.</p>
<p>Joe raises the question of hubris of the super rich. He wonders, aloud, if they feel like they&#8217;re above the law and don&#8217;t have to be honest with anyone, including their agency.</p>
<p>All three of us hope that is the case with Rupert Murdoch. We hope the industry isn&#8217;t shady enough that our peers would suggest their client lie and blame his or her employees without taking any responsibility. But maybe we&#8217;re all really naive.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>

The blog post discusses how coached Murdoch seemed during his appearance and how he completely missed transparency in his answers.

Joe Thornley, Martin Waxman, and Gini Dietrich set the stage for PR and the Murdoch affair and discuss who we, as PR professionals, are responsible to.

It's an interesting topic, to begin with, because it seems impossible for people to disconnect how we (as a generalization) feel about a personality and the reality of what's really going on. How the news media portrays a man and how we, as a society, condem him for something his employees he did.

But we all agree that, as leaders, it's our jobs to take responsibility for the mistakes our employees make...even if we weren't aware they were going on. The communication is something such as, "I don't condone what my employees did. I take responsibility for their actions. And this is what I'm going to do about it."

The conversation then turns to true PR, just like marketing, should be in the best interest of the customer. Not in the best interest of the company. Not in the best interest of the stakeholders. Not in the best interest of the employees. But in the best interest of the customer.

We all need to ask ourselves: Are we helping our clients spin a story (as you know, Spin Sucks) that makes them look better or are we helping them effectively communicate with their customers?

From there we discuss how our jobs, as PR professionals, is to be there for the public interest and to tell the truth.

<p>Martin, still hesitant, tries to bring Gini and Joe back to the show by suggesting topic ideas. But with nothing but Google+ and the same old news, Martin admits defeat.</p>
<p>And the Inside PR team skips out early to enjoy the beautiful weather.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p></p>
<p>It&#8217;s two weeks since <a title="Google +" href="https://plus.google.com" target="_blank">Google+</a> launched and the Inside PR hosts, <a title="Gini Dietrich blogs at Spins Sucks" href="http://www.spinsucks.com" target="_blank">Gini Dietrich</a>, <a title="Martin Waxman" href="http://www.martinwaxman.com" target="_blank">Martin Waxman</a> and <a title="ProPR.ca" href="http://www.propr.ca" target="_blank">Joseph Thornley</a>, have been testing it for its strengths and weaknesses. This week we  talk about our experience so far.</p>
<p>One of the things that has caught most people&#8217;s attention is Google Hangouts, the feature that lets Google+ users set up video conference calls with up to ten users. So we thought that we&#8217;d use this feature for our recording. Well, as you&#8217;ll hear in this episode, there&#8217;s a reason why Google+ is still in the &#8220;test&#8221; period. Not everything works the way that you&#8217;d like it to. We lose Gini part of the way through. But she rejoins us by the end. We also experienced the same problem that <a title="Shel Holtz" href="http://holtz.com/blog/" target="_blank">Shel Holtz</a> noticed when he and <a title="Neville Hobson" href="http://www.nevillehobson.com/" target="_blank">Neville Hobson</a> recorded a <a title="For Immediate Release tests Google Hangouts" href="http://www.forimmediaterelease.biz/index.php?/weblog/comments/fir_plus_a_test_drive_of_google_hangout/" target="_blank">special episode of the FIR podcast</a> using Google Hangouts with Camtasia studio. The video recording had several defects &#8211; frozen screens and video that lagged behind the audio. Hangouts is quite ready for this use. But we&#8217;re hoping that Google will keep improving this feature and we&#8217;ll keep testing it. Eventually, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be able to produce a video version of Inside PR to accompany the audio version.</p>
<p>Have you ever sat down with a long time partner and said, if we could do it over again, what would we do differently? So far, I think that Google+ is the Social Network that&#8217;s doing it over and is doing it right.</p>
<p>For me, Facebook started as a place that suggested we could have private conversations with friends and family. But as Facebook developed its business model, it broke the faith with us on that. Bit by bit, it pushed our information onto public feeds &#8211; and it wasn&#8217;t always up front about what it was doing and didn&#8217;t provide us with easy control over how we could control our information.</p>
<p>Martin has been focused on rebuilding his network on Google+. And he&#8217;s found that it feels like the early days of Twitter, before the celebrities invaded it and the network became obsessed with numbers of followers. Martin&#8217;s finding that he can connect with his real community of interest on Google+ and have much higher quality conversations than he&#8217;s experienced on the other networks.</p>
<p>So far, I&#8217;ve had an experience similar to Martin. I&#8217;ve found that I share the interests of most of the people who have followed me. And by using the Circles feature to sort people by topic, I can dip into different areas just as I would if I were choosing between sections of a newspaper.

		<itunes:summary>It's two weeks since Google+ launched and the Inside PR hosts, Gini Dietrich, Martin Waxman and Joseph Thornley, have been testing it for its strengths and weaknesses. This week we  talk about our experience so far.

One of the things that has caught most people's attention is Google Hangouts, the feature that lets Google+ users set up video conference calls with up to ten users. So we thought that we'd use this feature for our recording. Well, as you'll hear in this episode, there's a reason why Google+ is still in the "test" period. Not everything works the way that you'd like it to. We lose Gini part of the way through. But she rejoins us by the end. We also experienced the same problem that Shel Holtz noticed when he and Neville Hobson recorded a special episode of the FIR podcast using Google Hangouts with Camtasia studio. The video recording had several defects - frozen screens and video that lagged behind the audio. Hangouts is quite ready for this use. But we're hoping that Google will keep improving this feature and we'll keep testing it. Eventually, I'm sure we'll be able to produce a video version of Inside PR to accompany the audio version.

Have you ever sat down with a long time partner and said, if we could do it over again, what would we do differently? So far, I think that Google+ is the Social Network that's doing it over and is doing it right.

For me, Facebook started as a place that suggested we could have private conversations with friends and family. But as Facebook developed its business model, it broke the faith with us on that. Bit by bit, it pushed our information onto public feeds - and it wasn't always up front about what it was doing and didn't provide us with easy control over how we could control our information.

Martin has been focused on rebuilding his network on Google+. And he's found that it feels like the early days of Twitter, before the celebrities invaded it and the network became obsessed with numbers of followers. Martin's finding that he can connect with his real community of interest on Google+ and have much higher quality conversations than he's experienced on the other networks.

So far, I've had an experience similar to Martin. I've found that I share the interests of most of the people who have followed me. And by using the Circles feature to sort people by topic, I can dip into different areas just as I would if I were choosing between sections of a newspaper. A great way to increase the signal to noise ratio.

Martin also finds that a strength of Google+ is the ease with which users can adjust their privacy settings - on a general basis and on a post by post basis. It's intuitive and clear.

Gini also points out that the Circles approach is different from the asymmetrical following on Twitter and the symmetrical friending on Facebook. And this means that we'll have to develop a different way of figuring out how to manage ourselves in a way that takes full advantage of the unique properties of Google+

So, that's our Google+ discussion this week. It's the biggest thing that's happened in social media in the past couple years. We'll continue to test it and share our experiences in future weeks.

And what about you? Are you using Google+? What do you think of it? It's strengths? Its weaknesses?

<p>This week we received lots of comments, and we just want to say thank you again for the wonderful comments. Keep them coming.</p>
<p>We want to especially thank <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jodykoehler" target="_blank">Jody Koehler</a> for sending out a tweet telling everyone to listen to Inside PR. We truly appreciate the support.</p>
<p>We also received a comment from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/lizabutcher" target="_blank">Liza Butcher</a>, a recent PR grad, who shares her thoughts on <a href="http://www.insidepr.ca/index.php/2011/06/22/inside-pr-2-59-interns-and-restructuring/" target="_blank">last week’s tips for interns</a> show.</p>
<p>And we received a question from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/dempseycm" target="_blank">Kristina Dempsy</a> who works for <a href="http://www.sarabradypr.com/index.html" target="_blank">Sara Brady Public Relations</a> in Florida. Christina wanted to know the background of the Inside PR podcast. So we take a walk down memory lane and share the story of Inside PR.</p>
<p>Joe, Gini and Martin then go on to talk about the new social network, <a href="https://plus.google.com/up/start/?continue=https://plus.google.com/&amp;type=st&amp;gpcaz=2532985a" target="_blank">Google+ Project</a>.</p>
<p>Joe is excited about Google+. He has started to distance himself from Facebook, because he feels Facebook has become a platform he cannot trust. However, Joe worries that as we explore Google Plus we will all be blind men in a cave discovering fire for the first time.</p>
<p>With Google+ Circles, +Hangouts, +Huddles, +Mobile, +1, Gini, although she doesn’t say this often, is just overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Martin compares Google+ to <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=wave&amp;passive=1209600&amp;continue=https://wave.google.com/wave/&amp;followup=https://wave.google.com/wave/&amp;ltmpl=tempopensignups2" target="_blank">Wave</a>, complexity was the problem with Wave, and Wave eventually died out.</p>
<p>We will be following Google+ very closely to see if it catches on or not. If you have started using Google+ and have a comment, send it to us.</p>
<p>Gini had the opportunity to interview <a href="http://www.steverubel.me/post/5927623609/a-home-where-the-buffalo-roam" target="_blank">Steve Rubell</a> and posted <a href="http://www.spinsucks.com/social-media/thinking-about-moving-to-tumblr-dont./#more-6791" target="_blank">the interview on Spin Sucks</a> and she shares some interesting parts of the interview with us.</p>
<p>Stay tuned to next week when we talk about some summer PR reading suggestions.</p>

And we received a question from Kristina Dempsy who works for Sara Brady Public Relations in Florida. Christina wanted to know the background of the Inside PR podcast. So we take a walk down memory lane and share the story of Inside PR.

Joe, Gini and Martin then go on to talk about the new social network, Google+ Project.

Joe is excited about Google+. He has started to distance himself from Facebook, because he feels Facebook has become a platform he cannot trust. However, Joe worries that as we explore Google Plus we will all be blind men in a cave discovering fire for the first time.

With Google+ Circles, +Hangouts, +Huddles, +Mobile, +1, Gini, although she doesn’t say this often, is just overwhelmed.

Martin compares Google+ to Wave, complexity was the problem with Wave, and Wave eventually died out.

We will be following Google+ very closely to see if it catches on or not. If you have started using Google+ and have a comment, send it to us.

Gini had the opportunity to interview Steve Rubell and posted the interview on Spin Sucks and she shares some interesting parts of the interview with us.

Stay tuned to next week when we talk about some summer PR reading suggestions.

<p>One of our listeners, <a href="http://totalinsights.co.uk/" target="_blank">Yasin Akgun</a>, asks,</p>
<blockquote><p>As a final year marketing student about to embark on a summer internship I would be grateful if you could discuss what you guys think makes a good intern, examples of good students you’ve had and common mistakes that you’ve seen them make.</p></blockquote>
<p>We thought this was a great question, and really well timed, as most of us are in the beginning of the summer intern season.</p>
<p>Because of that, we spend a few minutes talking about, from our perspectives, the qualities that make a great intern.</p>
<p>They include:</p>
<p>* Act as though you&#8217;re auditioning for a full-time job</p>
<p>* Take initiative and always go the extra mile</p>
<p>* Show that you have the ability to reach out and meet other people</p>
<p>* Show a  thirst for work</p>
<p>* Ask questions</p>
<p>* Learn how to negotiate</p>
<p>* Learn the gentle art of persuasion</p>
<p>* Really begin to understand where you best fit</p>
<p>* Have a &#8220;let me figure that out&#8221; attitude</p>
<p>* Be creative</p>
<p>* Find a project that you can see from beginning to end</p>
<p>And, while we&#8217;re talking about interns and their roles within the PR industry, we saw some interesting news about a global agency changing the titles of their staff and restructuring to fit the changing times.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.golinharris.com/#!/" target="_blank">GolinHarris</a> is moving from generalists to specialists to adapt to the way consumer behavior is changing&#8230;and changing quickly.</p>
<p>The <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/business/media/15adco.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a></em> broke the story a day before the announcement and details what the agency is doing.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>The four specialties are strategists, who analyze a client’s business; creators, people like writers, designers and producers who generate ideas and tell brand stories; connectors, people who reach target audiences through traditional and social media as well as other channels; and catalysts, account leaders overseeing relationships with clients.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman" target="_blank">Martin Waxman</a> makes a great point: It seems like they&#8217;re borrowing from Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tipping-Point-Little-Things-Difference/dp/0316346624" target="_blank">&#8220;The Tipping Point.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>But, in this case, their creators are his mavens, their catalysts are his salespeople, and their connectors are, well, his connectors.</p>
<p>This really is a sign of the times, but Joe Thornley wonders if GolinHarris simply is responding to the smaller, more nimble agencies that are already well down the road of adding specialists to their teams.</p>
<p>What do you think? What qualities make for a great intern? And what are your thoughts on the GolinHarris restructuring?</p>

		<itunes:summary>One of our listeners, Yasin Akgun, asks,
As a final year marketing student about to embark on a summer internship I would be grateful if you could discuss what you guys think makes a good intern, examples of good students you’ve had and common mistakes that you’ve seen them make.
We thought this was a great question, and really well timed, as most of us are in the beginning of the summer intern season.

Because of that, we spend a few minutes talking about, from our perspectives, the qualities that make a great intern.

They include:

* Act as though you're auditioning for a full-time job

* Take initiative and always go the extra mile

* Show that you have the ability to reach out and meet other people

* Show a  thirst for work

* Ask questions

* Learn how to negotiate

* Learn the gentle art of persuasion

* Really begin to understand where you best fit

* Have a "let me figure that out" attitude

* Be creative

* Find a project that you can see from beginning to end

And, while we're talking about interns and their roles within the PR industry, we saw some interesting news about a global agency changing the titles of their staff and restructuring to fit the changing times.

GolinHarris is moving from generalists to specialists to adapt to the way consumer behavior is changing...and changing quickly.

The New York Times broke the story a day before the announcement and details what the agency is doing.

From the article:
The four specialties are strategists, who analyze a client’s business; creators, people like writers, designers and producers who generate ideas and tell brand stories; connectors, people who reach target audiences through traditional and social media as well as other channels; and catalysts, account leaders overseeing relationships with clients.
Martin Waxman makes a great point: It seems like they're borrowing from Malcolm Gladwell's "The Tipping Point."

But, in this case, their creators are his mavens, their catalysts are his salespeople, and their connectors are, well, his connectors.

This really is a sign of the times, but Joe Thornley wonders if GolinHarris simply is responding to the smaller, more nimble agencies that are already well down the road of adding specialists to their teams.

What do you think? What qualities make for a great intern? And what are your thoughts on the GolinHarris restructuring?

<p>Just before we recorded the show, I had lunch with <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/guy-skipworth/7/783/895" target="_blank">Guy Skipworth</a>, a friend, colleague and long-time listener.  He had an in-person comment for us: that we should talk about PR more…</p>
<p>Thanks Guy, good point.</p>
<p>So… in the spirit of the comment and the fact that summer movies are being released, we thought we’d look at a few films that depict PR.  And while most of them deal with stereotypes and preconceived notions, they shed light on why so many people have a negative perception about our profession.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the list:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051036/" target="_blank">Sweet Smell of Success</a> – a brooding black and white drama about the darker side of PR with Tony Curtis as a sleazy press agent who will do anything to curry favour with a powerful columnist.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055895/" target="_blank">Days of Wine and Roses</a> starring Jack Lemmon as a burnt out, former reporter and current alcoholic, whose job is less about messages and more about procuring women for corrupt businessmen. Billable hours anyone?</li>
<li>A more contemporary PR film is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120885/" target="_blank">Wag the Dog</a>, which features Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman.  The comedy revolves around a fabricated war that’s presented as a real event to take the heat off a president’s personal issue.</li>
<li>Other movies about PR include <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427944/" target="_blank">Thank You for Smoking</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265029/" target="_blank">America’s Sweethearts</a>.</li>
<li>Martin predicts the next big PR movie will be based on <a href="http://terryfallis.com/" target="_blank">The Best Laid Plans by Terry Fallis</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What movies would you add? Please let us know.</p>
<p>In the second half of the podcast, we talk about <a href="http://www.steverubel.me/post/5927623609/a-home-where-the-buffalo-roam" target="_blank">Steve Rubel’s</a> &#8216;scorched-earth&#8217; approach to his blogs: he deleted all his content opting instead for a new online presence on <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/dashboard" target="_blank">Tumblr</a>.</p>
<p>Gini starts by talking about the strong community she’s built at <a href="http://www.spinsucks.com/" target="_blank">SpinSucks</a> and why she wouldn’t want to leave it. She goes on to say that you can always recreate the content but not the community.</p>
<p>Joe advises everyone whose name is NOT Rubel – not to try this at home.  He feels Steve can do it because of his leadership position in PR and social media.</p>
<p>Martin asks about the notion of creation and the implications of deleting what is, in essence, a public record.</p>
<p>Joe says the nature of community is that we don’t own what we’ve created once it’s public-it belongs to the community. However, he also commends Steve Rubel and other thought-leaders who experiment and try the extraordinary.</p>
<p>Steve Rubel – do you have anything to add?  And, we&#8217;re interested to hear from all our listeners, too.</p>
<p>Do you have an idea for a topic you would like us to discuss?

Thanks Guy, good point.

So… in the spirit of the comment and the fact that summer movies are being released, we thought we’d look at a few films that depict PR.  And while most of them deal with stereotypes and preconceived notions, they shed light on why so many people have a negative perception about our profession.

Here's the list:

	Sweet Smell of Success – a brooding black and white drama about the darker side of PR with Tony Curtis as a sleazy press agent who will do anything to curry favour with a powerful columnist.
	Days of Wine and Roses starring Jack Lemmon as a burnt out, former reporter and current alcoholic, whose job is less about messages and more about procuring women for corrupt businessmen. Billable hours anyone?
	A more contemporary PR film is Wag the Dog, which features Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman.  The comedy revolves around a fabricated war that’s presented as a real event to take the heat off a president’s personal issue.
	Other movies about PR include Thank You for Smoking and America’s Sweethearts.
	Martin predicts the next big PR movie will be based on The Best Laid Plans by Terry Fallis.

What movies would you add? Please let us know.

In the second half of the podcast, we talk about Steve Rubel’s 'scorched-earth' approach to his blogs: he deleted all his content opting instead for a new online presence on Tumblr.

Gini starts by talking about the strong community she’s built at SpinSucks and why she wouldn’t want to leave it. She goes on to say that you can always recreate the content but not the community.

		<itunes:summary>It was a busy week in social media: the roll-out of Google +1 and the Twitter Follow button. But even bigger news for people who have been measuring online engagement was the acquisition by Google of PostRank. Of course, we have views. And we share them with you.

We also close out our discussion of the big spring conference season with our perspective on Blog World Expo East and Mesh.

Enjoy.

<p>The spring conference season has ended so we&#8217;re all back in our offices, podcasting from our desks, and talking about what we&#8217;ve learned the past couple of months.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, though, a HUGE congratulations to <a href="http://twitter.com/shelholtz" target="_blank">Shel Holtz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jangles" target="_blank">Neville Hobson</a>. They just recorded their 600th episode. I did the math. If they recorded once a week, that would take 11 years to achieve. But they&#8217;ve cut that in half&#8230;six years; 600 episodes; twice weekly podcasts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no easy feat, either. They use <a href="http://wave.google.com" target="_blank">Google Wave</a> to begin brainstorming each session, adding commentary, links, and other information to enhance the story. They spend a lot of time bringing you relevant and valuable information. And that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s one of the most respected and highest listened to podcast in our industry.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not already subscribed, do it now by <a href="http://www.forimmediaterelease.biz" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>If you missed it, there was a <a href="http://www.insidepr.ca/index.php/2011/05/18/inside-pr-2-54-live-from-counselors-academy-talking-about-a-pr-imbroglio/" target="_blank">really good comment</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/keithtrivitt" target="_blank">Keith Trivitt</a>, associate director of public relations at <a href="http://prsa.org" target="_blank">PRSA</a>, on the <a href="http://www.spinsucks.com/communication/the-ethics-of-whisper-campaigns/" target="_blank">Burson-Marsteller/Facebook issue</a>.</p>
<p>We talked for a couple of minutes about Keith&#8217;s response and the responsibility of all PR professionals, no matter their PRSA membership.</p>
<p>And on to the show!</p>
<p>A few things each of us learned throughout conference season:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.toiletpaperentrepreneur.com/" target="_blank"><em>Toilet Paper Entrepreneur</em></a>, <a href="http://www.toiletpaperentrepreneur.com/author/biography" target="_blank">Mike Michalowicz</a>, talks about not calling yourself a PR firm, but to focus on what makes you special. That allows you to take yourself out of the rate discount discussion and get paid for your expertise.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.catalystpublicrelations.com/bio-bret-werner.php" target="_blank">Bret Werner</a> talks about really understanding your niche, figure out which companies you really want to work with, and which clients you need to take to get you to those gold star companies in the next three to five years.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/jaybaer" target="_blank">Jay Baer</a> is a <em>great</em> speaker, who also knows how to speak in tweets, he said the goal is not to be good at social media, but to be good at business using social media.</li>
<li>Jay also said, if you suck, Twitter is not your problem.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.cjpcom.com/4-prosek.html" target="_blank">Jen Prosek</a>, author of <em><a href="http://www.armyofentrepreneurs.com/" target="_blank">Army of Entrepreneurs</a></em>, has a great philosophy on training and onboarding new consultants.</li>
</ul>
<p>One more thing: <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/barbaranixon" target="_blank">Barbara Nixon</a>, we talk about the difference between Facebook groups and Facebook pages for you!</p>

If you missed it, there was a really good comment from Keith Trivitt, associate director of public relations at PRSA, on the Burson-Marsteller/Facebook issue.

We talked for a couple of minutes about Keith's response and the responsibility of all PR professionals, no matter their PRSA membership.

And on to the show!

A few things each of us learned throughout conference season:

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/ginidietrich" target="_blank">Gini</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/thornley" target="_blank">Joe</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/martinwaxman" target="_blank">Martin</a> are back at <a href="http://www.bluetoad.com/publication/?i=65886" target="_blank">PRSA’s Counselors Academy Conference</a> in Lake Las Vegas for the second of our two shows.</p>
<p>For those who may not be familiar with the conference, Martin tells us the annual conference is all about the business of PR and invites PR agency leaders across the globe to join the conversation. </p>
<p>Joe says if you run an agency, there are many great reasons to attend and then turns the mic over to some of our colleagues in attendance for their perspectives.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/lisagerber" target="_blank">Lisa Gerber</a> says she got into PR with no clue about the business and Counselors helped her raise the bar on her own performance.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/gojohnab" target="_blank">Johna Burke</a> finds value because it helps people evolve beyond tactics like managing accounts. This shift is what’s going to propel the profession forward.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/tom_garrity" target="_blank">Tom Garrity</a> enjoys peer to peer conversation and gaining business insights.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/jwalcher" target="_blank">Jean Walcher</a> came first to learn, but this year wants to be reinvigorated by the open and intelligent conversations.</p>
<p>Joe mentions that 3-am feeling when you’re thinking about your agency, you can’t sleep and wonder what you’re going to do next. You may be facing one of those difficult situations where it’s tough to talk to the team. Counselors can be a remarkable source of advice. Meet other smart people who freely share their learnings.</p>
<p>Martin says that when he started at Counselors, there were a lot more multinational agencies but now the organization is geared to independents and entrepreneurs.  He references first learning about social media from <a href="http://twitter.com/giorodriguez" target="_blank">Giovanni Rodriguez</a> at Counselors at a session both he and Joe attended. But they didn’t get to know each other until a year or so later when both realized how much of a seminal moment that was.</p>
<p>Gini talks about the networking and how you can have open conversations with your competitors and discuss issues like profitability and margins and other things PR folks don’t learn in school.</p>
<p>At this point, Jean poses a question: Do you reward employees for bringing in new business?</p>
<p>Gini says she’s tried many types of incentives. She recently hired someone by incenting them to create their own job; the person is responsible for developing proposals, closing the business and she has goals based on profitability.</p>
<p>Joe attended a CA session led by <a href="http://twitter.com/robadler" target="_blank">Rob Adler</a> on motivating employees and says the same question came up.  One agency gives 5 per cent of a new client’s fee revenue to the staff person that brought it in – for as long as they have the client.</p>
<p>Martin says it can be difficult to figure out the right kind of incentive, because if new business is being generated by the agency leadership and you&#8217;re not paying it out, the incentive becomes like an empty promise.</p>
<p>That brings us to an end for this show. <a href="http://www.counselorsacademy.org" target="_blank">Counselors Academy’s</a> next conference is May 6 to 8, 2012 in New Orleans. Disclosure: Martin is conference chair.  You may want to check out the website for an overview of the other programs they offer throughout the year.</p>
