			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year and welcome to 2007.</p>
<p>Is Capital enough in and of itself to grow your business successfully? The key word here is &#8220;successfully&#8221;. A successful business is one where the growth is sustainable and manageable over the long term. </p>
<p>The answer obviously is &#8216;No&#8217;; Capital alone is not enough. Is it important? You better believe it but Cash alone is not the Holy Grail. There are things you need to do in order to attract capital in the first instance and then there are things you need to do with that capital once you have it in order to create sustainable growth.</p>
<p>The key component I am talking about in all this is people. People make things happen. The right people, in the right place at the right time; DOING THE RIGHT THINGS, will make an incredible difference on your business and its success. This is not an easy task but it is critical. Here are just three of the many rules that you need to consider:</p>
<p>1. Don&#8217;t be a one person band.<br />
You simply won&#8217;t raise capital or grow a business as a team of one. If you are a team of one then get ready to change. If you are not a natural leader of others then find someone who is and take your position next to them. I would personally be happy to have a portion of a business run by a successful business leader than all of a business that is worth nothing and going nowhere.</p>
<p>2. Know your limits, skills and experience.<br />
Unless you have successfully run a business and you can show this clearly then don&#8217;t try and raise capital. Investors want Proven Business Acumen. Remember investors have the choice of over 1700 listed investments and more than 1000 Share Funds managed by some of the most experienced and intelligent people on this planet. (Not all of them, mind you, but the cream does rise to the top). So this is the market you are competing in for investment funds.</p>
<p>3. Be ready, willing and able to take sound advice.<br />
The key here is knowing when you are actually on the receiving end of sound advice. Everyone has an opinion. Be careful to sift through the information and hone in the right advice. When you are comfortable that you have the right people around you giving you sound advice then ACT ON IT! If there is an already proven system and all you need to do is follow it. Then follow it.</p>
<p>Some of the most successful people in the world today understand these 3 rules (there are others of course). Don&#8217;t be fooled into thinking that successful people somehow broke all the rules. They might have bent the rules or made some variations on the theme, but when you dig deeper you&#8217;ll discover that they applied fundamentals and logic to their creativity and came out with a successful business. That is what investors want and if you want to attract them then stick to the rules.</p>
<p>All the best for 2007. We hope that you achieve the success you desire, and perhaps you could be the next Wotif or Oakton. Good luck and if you have any questions about the pathway to successful Capital Raising then drop us a line.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We get alot of feedback and questions wanting to know more about this very subject. Sorry to say that it isnt one of our specific areas of expertise. So finally we have teamed up with David Craker at Invent Connect. InventConnect is a new Australian Business that helps inventors and developers submit their new product ideas and inventions to industry and also provides promotional services for manufacturers and distributors wanting to announce a new release to the market place.</p>
<p>There are many methods used for evaluating an Invention, New Product or Innovation and at InventConnect the starting process is an invitation to to have your idea objectively assessed.</p>
<p>The initial meeting is always aimed at focusing on the idea, invention or product. The creator is often seeking clarification, advice, direction, techinical ability or indications of the competence of the product. In addition many questions will be asked by inventors and creators such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can I trust this individual or this business to work for me?</li>
<li>Will they work with me and will they reflect what I want to do?</li>
<li>Do they understand what I need to get from this relationship?</li>
<li>Will they fit into my ideas of what I can do?</li>
<li>Will they take advantage of me or rip me off?</li>
<li>Can I afford to do anything they want to do?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have these types of questions then drop into the File Cabinet and check out some of the articles that David has contributed and stay tuned. More strong content from InventConnect is on the way.</p>
<p>Our goal is to work with our clients on assisting then to raise capital to grow their business. But before this happens many people need other forms of assistance to turn their project into an investor friendly business opportunity. Why not check out InventConnect and see if they can help you.</p>
<p>Kind Regards &#038; Good Luck</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well I cant believe its been so long since I posted an article on the site. We are still getting heaps of enquiry, questions and feedback so please keep it coming. In response to some of that enquiry I have posted another web site that is managed by the Federal Govt and it is called <a href="http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/">www.ipaustralia.gov.au</a> .</p>
<p>There are a lot of questions that we field about Intellectual Property and how best to protect it so please go and have a visit to this site and start the learning curve.</p>
<p>So what have we been up to? Well we have recently completed two successful Round 1 Capital Raisings for two new business start-ups and both of these businesses are now moving ahead into Round 2 and beyond. Today’s article is a result of something that happened during the activities surrounding those Capital Raising projects.</p>
<p>On more than one occasion the process and valuation base of the Offer that was being marketed by the Business Owners was questioned by the supposed Professionals. Statements like: “Oh I don’t think you are doing it right” and “There is no way you will get people to invest based on your offer” and “How can you justify the pricing of your business model” etc etc. I was completely stunned and realized that given the supposed professional advice being dished out, is it any wonder that we still end up taking much of our Intellectual Property overseas to be Commercialised only to import it back into Australia.</p>
<p>The fact is; that contrary to the professional advice provided both of these businesses went into the market and between them raised over half a million dollars in just over two months and are on their way to another half a million dollars in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Let’s get something straight. There is no right way or wrong way to raise capital! There is legally compliant ways and there are illegal ways and the Corporations Act 2001 and ASIC exist to ensure that fund raising is a legally compliant process that minimizes risks to the individual investor.</p>
<p>So long as you are compliant with the law then the only body that exists to define whether or not you are “Doing it Right” is: THE MARKET. Yes we actually live in a market driven economy and I want everyone to right this down so you can recall it when confronted by the doomsayers, the bureaucrats and the suits in their ivory towers: THE ONLY TRUE MARKETING GENIUS IS THE MARKET ITSELF. Thank you to Alan Stewart, one of the most outstanding marketers I have ever met for drumming that statement into me as a mentor to a student should.<br />
 <br />
By all means get good advice and ensure that your T’s are crossed and your I’s are dotted. Consider your long term strategy and consider the realistic value of your business opportunity. But truly there is only one final decision maker and that is out there in the market place. If you cannot convince the market that your business has the potential and underpins the value that you are suggesting then the response will be simple: NO ONE WILL INVEST. This is called true market research.</p>
<p>If this occurs then you must listen to the market and if it is aligned with other advice then it might in fact be the right advice. But beware the lazy opinion. Every one has an opinion and some people have more than one on any given subject. Facts are market based. If you are too stubborn to listen to the market then you have no business being out there trying to raise capital. But do the research, find out if it has legs and then go and plan accordingly.</p>
<p>Failure to listen to the market will result in your peril. Taking heed of so called Professional Opinions before going to the market can be equally perilous.</p>
<p>Good Luck and Best Wishes</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sorry to disappoint if you thought this was going to be a piece on something of a more romantic nature. I am sure if you look hard enough on the internet you can find material of this nature.</p>
<p>When we talk about going all the way its about asking this question:<br />
Do you have a vision and desire to see your company capitalised, liquid and your investors (including yourself) having the ability to undertake unrestricted buyer offers and sales of securities in your company? In other words do you see yourself achieving a listing of your business on an exchange?</p>
<p>YES or NO?</p>
<p>The answer to that question alone can singularly determine the success or failure of your ability to raise capital. As I have mentioned before there are, at any one time, over 10,000 businesses seeking some form of capital from the market. Less than 500 accomplish this successfully. One of the reasons a Small or Medium Sized Enterprise (SME) will fail is that they are not prepared to go all the way.</p>
<p>Let me explain: Investors are in the box seat. They are inundated with requests for potential investment. What do they have to choose from:<br />
Managed Funds; Locally and Globally representing every possible asset and risk class.<br />
Property: Directly or Indirectly.<br />
Own Business<br />
Other Businesses through Private Equity Placement<br />
Other Large Businesses through Local and Global Sharemarkets</p>
<p>The list goes on and the spruikers are hard at work trying to lure investment in all manner of opportunities. So as an SME you are competing against each of these investment types. In order to attract investment you then need to be prepared to do whatever it takes to attract that investment and one of those is planning for &#8216;going all the way&#8217;. You might never get there, you might build a successful business for you and your investors without having to list but you should plan for it none the less.</p>
<p><strong>Why? </strong>Because if an investor is asked to choose between a closed option with no exit strategy and an open ended plan that wants to go all the way then 98 times out of a 100 the open ended plan that goes all the way will attract the investor.</p>
<p>There are key fundamentals to raising capital. If you avoid the fundamentals, like most things in life, then you are setting yourself up for a more difficult task. Bear in mind that you are already facing an uphill battle by deciding to go to the market to raise funds in the first place. So be prepared to be open, transparent and have a plan to go all the way.</p>
<p>On another matter I would like to thank all those people that email in their questions and ask for more information. Obviously we try to respond to as many as we can but we are by no means the experts on every subject. That is why we have added another two web sites to our links for you to get some value. The first is a site Catapult and is run by ABC Australia and has a great Q&#038;A section for innovators and inventors. The second is an American site called Entrepreneur.com and is a good resource centre for all manner of starting and growing a business.</p>
<p>We keep looking for great material all the time. Australian Anthill Magazine have even started contributing and their first article is now in the File Cabinet. If you have any ideas on where we might find good content and links to quality sites then please send them to us and we will continue our commitment to education and information through this site.</p>
<p>Good Luck and Good Business</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No not the 80/20 Rule but the 95/5 rule. In the world of capital raising this is what the statistics will tell you: 95% of all businesses that are seeking to raise capital will fail to do so and ultimately suffer at the hands of desperate decision making.</p>
<p>At any given time there are as many as 10,000 businesses out in the market place seeking capital. These are solid numbers based on statistics provided by the Australian Venture Capital industry. Of these less than 500 successfully raise any capital to grow the business opportunity that exists.</p>
<p>I was asked recently how much investment capital there was available in the market today. The answer is Billions of Dollars. And that is just in Australia. So the next obvious question was : Why doesnt this money get invested? It is not a lack of funds that holds back private capital investment. It is a fundamental lack of quality offers. The two golden rules simply fail to materialise consistently and professionally:<br />
BE INVESTOR READY<br />
BE INVESTOR FRIENDLY</p>
<p>In Marketing we teach people to sell benefits. We teach this because everyday business owners fail to do it time and again. If you are going to raise capital to expand your business or develop a new business then you must first create the benefits to the potential investors then sell them professionally. What are some of the benefits that an investor is looking for: <br />
<strong>1. Going all the way:</strong> If you do not have a plan to undertake multiple rounds of capital raising and continue to broaden your shareholder base then this will fail to excite investors. Investors want a growth business that will one day list on an exchange: Either ASX or NSX. Start planning with that in mind. You may end up in a Trade Sale before then but the goal must be to continue to raise capital and grow as fast as you possibly can.<br />
<strong>2. Have a Management Team:</strong> It has been said time and time again by the investment community that they would rather invest in an A Grade Team with a B Grade Idea than an A Grade Idea with a B Grade Team. The majority of start-ups fail due to a lack of management professionalism. Build good management and if it doesnt exist then raise more capital in order to pay for the management team to come on board.<br />
<strong>3. Think Big:</strong> Similar to my first point. Investors want to know that you have a BHAG. A Big Hairy Audacious Goal. That you are prepared to do whatever it takes to implement that goal is a huge benefit to the potential investor. Too often the business owners and entrepreneurs are too conservative and moderate and so fail to excite the investor into parting with their funds.</p>
<p>If you are seeking investment capital in your business then start creating the benefits to your investors and then start learning how to sell your benefits to them. It is a highly competitive environment and you do not get too many chances. Would you rather be one of the 5% or one of the 95%?<br />
The question I most often ask people who are seeking to raise capital is; &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; It is a very simple question with no mixed signals. The surprising thing is that most people simply dont know. We live in a country where complacency and choice abound. That is truly a blessing but it is also a curse. Ask yourself what it is you truly want. What would satisfy and content you, your family and your lifestyle. Control is not the most important thing in the world. Outcomes are and sometimes if you set a BHAG and only get 80% there then most people would be satisfied with the outcome.</p>
<p><strong>The purpose of starting any business is to sell it.</strong> In the words of Steven Covey you must therefore start with the end in mind. If more businesses were started with this in mind then more businesses would succeed. Forget about control and start thinking about lifestyle. If you can become one of the 5% and are prepared to do what it takes then your chances of success are already exponentially better than they were previously.</p>
<p>There are alot of people out there who are most definately looking to feather their own nest. Be wary and cautious! But dont be so wary that you miss out on taking good advice. Some of the links on this site will lead you to independent sources of advice and that is something that I am a strong advocate of. But please take the advice that is given. A client of ours was a part time security guard 4 years ago earning $15 per hour. Now he has a net worth of over $40Million. Mainly because he was willing to take good advice and focus on the fundamentals of raising capital successfully. He is one of the 5%&#8217;ers.</p>
<p>Good Luck with Raising Your Capital and Your Entrepreneurial Endeavour.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was recently sent an old copy of a publication called:</p>
<p>A Better Mousetrap; A Guide for Inventors by Peter Bissell and Graham Barker</p>
<p>I would like to thank one of our avid followers for doing me the courtesy of sending this along. Well done Roc, you know who you are. It is a fantastic resource and after reading it I thought about how I could perhaps make some attempt to publish it on the site.</p>
<p>My very quick online research led me to the site: <a href="http://www.abettermousetrap.co.uk/">http://www.abettermousetrap.co.uk/</a> </p>
<p>This is the site managed by the authors of the original publication and through it there is now a comprehensive book that they published in 1998 called The Business of Invention - a step by step guide to turning an idea into a commercial product.</p>
<p>Now as we field many enquiries about various ideas here at AccessToCapital I am a big believer in making available any signpost or piece of information that will help people out there commercialise their Intellectual Property. Having read the 32 page Second Edition of this publication from 1990 I can only imagine then how good the book would be. OK so its a UK publication and some of the information will be UK centric but the fundamentals are the same all over the world and if you dont pay attention to the fundamentals then you are better to pass your idea onto those that know how to commercialise products.</p>
<p>Remember its all about education. So whether you get this publication or use the resources on offer at many of the places we have recommended on this site then keep getting the information you need to make smarter decisions.</p>
<p>Best Wishes</p>
