<p>by Lola (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/eltweetdeLola">@eltweetdelola</a>)</p>
<p>Life can take us by surprise<br />
can come in a sudden moment and face us<br />
Life doesn’t wait<br />
She always knows where we stand<br />
and where are we walking to</p>
<p>When Life confronts us<br />
We have only two possibilities<br />
We bow to her with respect and honor her with silence<br />
We then listen to her with open heart and honest will<br />
We wait<br />
We think<br />
We walk together and learn from that unique moment<br />
We accept the revelation and face our new constructed self<br />
We welcome the newness and walk away as an orphan when she finds her providence<br />
<span id="more-448"></span><br />
If we decide not to stop and let Life teach us what she came for<br />
We then fight her<br />
We play the role of the angry boxer that close the eyes and jabs fast hoping that the Adversary stays still<br />
Receiving the violent frustration of the awakening.<br />
We decide not to see her then<br />
Not to follow her<br />
We turn back and greet Death<br />
With honest touch we salute our dark decline as followers,<br />
as empty consumers of power and greed.</p>
<p>I saw Death once<br />
We had a deep discussion<br />
and she kissed me more than once<br />
She has a lovely kiss, a beautiful touch</p>
<p>I didn’t follow<br />
I stood up<br />
I waited<br />
years</p>
<p>Life came and made me who I am<br />
My people says that Life made us out of maize<br />
We are not the clay beings<br />
We are dough<br />
We are organic compost<br />
We are made out of life<br />
We are the seedlings, the companion plants<br />
And we face reality walking the talk<br />
talking while we walk.</p>

<p></a>By Amy Goodman with Denis Moynihan</p>
<p>Gen. John Allen, commander, U.S. Forces Afghanistan, spoke Wednesday at the Pentagon, four stars on each shoulder, his chest bedecked with medals. Allen said the NATO summit in Chicago, which left him feeling “heartened,” “was a powerful signal of international support for the Afghan-led process of reconciliation.” Unlike Allen, many decorated U.S. military veterans left the streets of Chicago after the NATOsummit without their medals. They marched on the paramilitarized convention center where the generals and heads of state had gathered and threw their medals at the high fence surrounding the summit. They were joined by women from Afghans for Peace, and an American mother whose son killed himself after his second deployment to Iraq.<span id="more-440"></span></p>
<p>Leading thousands of protesters in a peaceful march against NATO’s wars, each veteran climbed to the makeshift stage outside the fenced summit, made a brief statement and threw his or her medals at the gate.</p>
<p>As taps was played, veterans folded an American flag that had flown over NATO military operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia, Afghanistan and Libya and handed it to Mary Kirkland. Her son, Derrick, joined the Army in January 2007, since he was not earning enough to support his wife and child as a cook at an IHOP restaurant. During his second deployment, Mary told me, “he ended up putting a shotgun in his mouth over there in Iraq, and one of his buddies stopped him.” He was transferred to Germany then back to his home base of Fort Lewis, Wash.</p>
<p>“He came back on a Monday after two failed suicide attempts in a three-week period. They kept him overnight at Madigan Army Medical Center at Fort Lewis. He met with a psychiatrist the next day who deemed him to be low to moderate risk for suicide.” Five days later, on Friday, March 19, 2010, he hanged himself. Said his mother, “Derrick was not killed in action; he was killed because of failed mental health care at Fort Lewis.”</p>
<p>On stage, Lance Cpl. Scott Olsen declared: “Today I have with me my Global War on Terror Medal, Operation Iraqi Freedom Medal, National Defense Medal and Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal. These medals, once upon a time, made me feel good about what I was doing. &#8230; I came back to reality, and I don’t want these anymore.” Like the riot police flanking the stage, many on horseback, Olsen also wore a helmet. He is recovering from a fractured skull after being shot in the head at close range by a beanbag projectile. He wasn’t shot in Iraq, but by Oakland, Calif., police at Occupy Oakland last fall, where he was protesting.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bees are the most important part of the food chain that keeps the human race alive. Almost nobody notice how relevant is their job and many times we see bees as enemies, as dangerous creatures. Bees are actually very friendly and they are the masters of efficiency. There is so much we can learn from them&#8230; if we stop and contemplate.</p>
<p>When we read that 80% of the bees population in North America was disappearing and that Einstein said the human race will disappear 30 years after the bees are extinct, we decided to get bee hives and promote their conservation, as part of our plan to survival until old age.</p>
<p>Today in IICD Michigan we have 3 bee hives and we had learn by doing, reading and watching. In a visit to St. Vincent, where we have a partner organization (<a href="http://www.richmondvale.org">Richmond Vale Academy</a>), we found a swarm of bees that had come from the wild. We decided to give them a home at the institution and this is the video we film.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>&#8230; preserve life &amp; share.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>market |ˈmärkit|</h2>
<p>noun<br />
1.- a regular gathering of people for the purchase and sale of provisions, livestock, and other commodities : <em>farmers</em> <strong><em>going to market.</em></strong></p>
<p>It sounds to easy to say that a market is just that. A market, in many cultures, is the beginning of the week, the starting point of something. Before the calendar was created, the communities where organizing around the market day. Still today in countries in Africa, Latin America and may be everywhere in the world, the market days mean a celebration for the children and a smile for the mothers able to go an get the supplies for the meals of the week. It&#8217;s also a great day for the farmers and fishermen&#8230;<br />
<span id="more-424"></span><br />
It is quite difficult to identify everything that happens around an african market, where there is also a place for trafficking drugs, prostitution and street fights.</p>
<p>No doubts that the experience is unique&#8230; here we share with you a small window to that world.</p>

<h3>The Stars Say We Belong</h3>
<p>by James C. Henderson</p>
<p>The stars are pinned in their places.<br />
Not a single one has been lost or added.<br />
Orion glitters in his belt of jewels.<br />
The Big Dipper spills her mouth of black sky<br />
into the never-ending river of black sky.<br />
The earth still spins on its axis<br />
through the vastness of space around the sun.<br />
All the planets dutifully follow their orbits<br />
and occasionally line up to vibrate<br />
as a mysterious, harmonic force<br />
then break up and drift home, like after a really good concert.<br />
<img title="More..." src="http://www.fightpoverty.info/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt="" /><span id="more-410"></span>Spring still turns to summer, then fades to autumn, winter.<br />
The moon goes through its phases<br />
as the snake sheds its skin, swallows its tail.<br />
But tonight I feel things are different.<br />
It’s not the earth that has changed direction.<br />
Time still ages, I’m going to die—it all ends badly.<br />
But tonight, here in our encampment<br />
as we try to keep warm, feed ourselves<br />
go to the bathroom, clean our clothes, dry our bedding<br />
organize, organize, organize<br />
when I look up at the stars<br />
I don’t curse them for not allowing me to fall amongst them<br />
or for leaving me behind, finite.<br />
In the constellations I don’t see the old myths<br />
but make new connections.<br />
Our circles around the sun, our cosmic cycles<br />
are no longer a monotonous, boring routine to me.<br />
Tonight, gravity has a purpose.<br />
It holds me to a place I want to occupy.</p>

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, is a political-military alliance made up of 28 member countries, including the United States. Formed in 1949, NATO has played a unique and essential role in maintaining security and stability throughout the past six decades. It has grown and adapted to changing political environments and security challenges and, with enlargements, partnerships, and peacekeeping missions, has proven itself to be a continuingly effective Alliance. (<a href="http://www.chicagonato.org">source</a>)</p>
<p>What is G8? The Group of Eight (G8) is a forum for the governments of eight of the world&#8217;s largest economies. The forum originated with a 1975 summit hosted by France that brought together representatives of six governments: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, thus leading to the name Group of Six or G6. (<a href="http://www.wikipedia.com">source</a>)</p>
<p><span id="more-403"></span>The controversy with the G8/NATO Summit it has always been because many people are against the military regimes and wars. The present time is asking people to rise in protest and demonstrate to make their voice hear by the many. As the occupy movement and others have been mobilizing the awakening in the USA, Chicago, hometown of Obama, it is not a “safe” place to have the meeting of the 8 most important leaders of the world. Of course it will never look good in the media that people fight against police just to get a chance to speak their mind and demand such leaders to stop war and take actions to important issues that concerns the many. So out of this inconvenience, the White House said in a statement that it had been decided to move the G8 summit to Camp David, which features plush cabins nestling in the Catoctin Mountains “to facilitate a free-flowing discussion with our close G8 partners.” (<a href="http://therawstory.com/">The Raw Story</a>).</p>
<p>This change of plans will prevent the already common abuse from police and will not provoke the media to talk about police brutality, instead there will be surprising headlines of how much fun the summit was and how many good decisions the heads of the world took in order to keep the balance and democracy in the world, even if this means to kill people and to destroy nature. It just doesn’t sounds right that ‘our leaders’ need to hide in the mountains. What they don’t know is that the awakening is just starting and it will come to a point when hiding will not be enough.</p>
<p>We The People will follow and will know the exact moment to act, to fight, to stop the brutality and abuse, to put our demands on the table and to practice freedom.</p>

<p>“What people do in their own homes is their business and you can choose to love whoever you love. That’s their business. It is no different than discriminating against blacks. It’s discrimination plain and simple.”</p>
<p>Jay-Z supports what Barack Obama recently said about the right to same sex couples to get married. Jay-Z thinks &#8220;it’s really not about votes, it’s about people. I think it was the right thing to do as a human being.&#8221;</p>
<p><span id="more-394"></span>&#8230; and this is a big step for a fight for equality. The public figures know the power they have in people and with a small declaration they can change mindsets. This examples of empathy will push forward the necessary changes for a more equal and free world.</p>
<p>In the same line Democracy Now re-post a interview with a 12 years old girl, daughter of a lesbian couple from Vermont. This girl spoke openly in the congress to demand marriage equality and some of the congressmen accepted that thanks to the speech of the girl they had change their vote. Today, the citizens of Vermont have the same rights to marry (See the interview <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2009/4/8/testimony_of_12_year_old_with ">here</a>)</p>

It&#8217;s pious Pius, the god loves Pius<br />
Socrates asks, &#8220;Whose bias do y&#8217;all seek?&#8221;<br />
Or for Plato, the screech<br />
I&#8217;m out chere ballin&#8217;, I know you hear my sneaks<br />
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy, he lay beats<br />
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats<br />
Preach</p>
<p>Human beings in a mob<br />
What&#8217;s a mob to a king?<br />
What&#8217;s a king to a god?<br />
What&#8217;s a god to a non-believer?<br />
Who don&#8217;t believe in anything?</p>
<p>We make it out alive<br />
All right, all right<br />
No church in the wild<br />
Let me buy you<br />
Desire<br />
I stand by you<br />
Walk through the fire<br />
Your life<br />
Is my Scripture<br />
And I need it<br />
Through your encryption<br />
Yeah, yeah</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.fightpoverty.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Charlotte.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-372" title="Charlotte" src="http://www.fightpoverty.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Charlotte-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></a>There are 4,467 people invited to the facebook event call “Spring Is Coming”. I know it sounds like a school festival, but is actually one of the must important moments for the 99% movement in the USA.</p>
<p>Today hundreds of  thousands will meet and demand not just outside the doors of the Bank of America’s annual shareholder meeting, but also inside, facing the bank leaders. Bank of America is the biggest foreclosure profiteer, is one of the main actors in the economic crisis and <strong>they finance destructive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountaintop_removal_mining" target="_blank">mountaintop removal</a> that perpetuates deadly coal mining in the Appalachian regions.<span id="more-371"></span></strong></p>
<p>One of the active organizations fighting against the mountaintop removal and the coal mining in USA is the Rainforest Action Network, who declare that “as the largest financier of the US coal industry, Bank of America should be called the &#8220;Bank of Coal&#8221;. So we decided to rename it, whether the bank likes it or not.”</p>
<p>The demonstration has clear demands</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop profiting from the crisis you caused.</li>
<li>Uphold the right to stay.</li>
<li>Respect rights at work.</li>
<li>Divest from dirty coal, invest in impacted communities.</li>
</ol>
<p>The “Showdown in Charlotte” will be a non-violent event with a lot of activities plan and with the 99% as the host. Events and visuals will include: Marches from three sites in at 8:30am, converging on shareholder meeting at 9am. Protests inside from BofA shareholder members of UNITY, outside by hundreds of affected people and supporters. “Bank vs. America” boxing match outside meeting site at 9:30am. Press conference outside meeting site with UNITY spokespeople and allies after shareholder meeting.</p>
<p>This is a historic movement that shows how the future of this country is changing and how the awakening of the 99% is bringing change and a powerful fight for freedom and equal rights.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-352" title="occupy_album-cover" src="http://www.fightpoverty.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/occupy_album-cover-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>Yes, there will be an album dedicated to the Occupy Movement! Yes, because they need the money, but also because music is one of the best tools to mobilize people, to get into the core of the conflicts and open the dialog with those that still believe that the ones on power are looking for the common good caring for us.</p>
<p>The album is a compilation of 99 songs (of course) featuring 50 artists including Yoko Ono, David Crosby &amp; Graham Nash, Steve Earle, Tom Morello, Willie Nelson, Ani DiFranco, Third Eye Blind and many more. One really cool collaboration is Michael&#8217;s Moore, as he is not a musician they asked him to record a poem or make a music video, but he said &#8220;I could just sing a song.&#8221; And today he send out the sound cloud link with his song. Enjoy it!</p>
<p>Wait for the album on May 15th.</p>
