You can Skype me, My skype name is nigelkillick or e-mail me at peopletalkpost@hotmail.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interview with Katherine Schellenberg &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katherine was born in 1932, to second generation emigrant farmers in Aberdeen Saskatchewan Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Katherine the iconic images of the great depression are more than just old black and white photographs of men waiting in bread lines, working in relief camps and protesting against their dreadful destitution.  She remembers the poverty and great dust storms sweeping across the Western prairies, making it impossible for her family to feed themselves, these are real memories for her not just something you read about in history books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extracts from e-mail's from Kathy, talking about living in Saskatchewan Canada, as a young girl.&lt;br /&gt;" I also realize people do not understand how new this area was to the pioneers. There had just been Indian wars with Louis Reil a few years before and there was nothing but open prairies.  You cannot imagine standing in the middle of a field and looking from horizon to horizon and not seeing a tree or hill for a hundred miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been brought up in country that has been civilized for hundreds of years as you have, it is hard to understand that people my age and just a few years older, were the first people in these parts of the country; and the only people there were, were people from all the European countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having been brought up in country that has been civilized for hundreds of years as you have, it is hard to understand that people my age and just a few years older, were the first people in these parts of the country; and the only people there were, were people from all the European countries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew up with people from Germany, Russia, Holland, France and the Slavic countries. You see when I talk about the old days to my kids they laugh and say,”&lt;br /&gt; ‘Yes mother we know the sun never shone and the snow drifts were six feet high’&lt;br /&gt;“ When we lived in the house by the river and when the real cold weather came we had to go to my older sisters house and sleep in their attic as we could not afford fuel. Her husband had a steady job in the flourmill so they had a fairly good income. Their house though was very small. And in the summer time  people used to hang their milk and meat etc., in the well to keep it cool.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://peopletalk.mx5.org.uk/KS/ peopletalk interview 8- Katherine Schellenberg talks about growing up in the Depression years..mp3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Click here for the whole of Katherine Schellenberg audio&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Other stories at www.peopletalk.org. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To hear the audio interview click on file link below. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://peopletalk.mx5.org.uk/TB/peopletalk interview 5 with Terry an Ex British Bomb disposal soldier..mp3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Click here for the whole of Terry Buzby interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry Buzby's Story. Running time 25:00 minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry Buzby is the Sub-Postmaster at Woodingdean Post Office in East Sussex about 3 miles east of Brighton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first met Terry, Nickname (Buzby) about a year ago, and soon recognized that he was an interesting person. It was not so much what he said but his over all demeanor, he seemed to have a very alert personality, in other words he was a bit of a live wire. After a few visits to the Post Office I slowly realized that there was a story behind the post office counter, and its name was Terry.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old saying, says.  You cannot judge a book by its cover came to mind.  Terry is a fit looking lean man in his late thirties, who has bright blue eyes which have a sparkle of mischief in them. He can come across as being frank and not suffering fools gladly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Part 2 Terry Buzby talks about joining the British Royal Navy's Marines as a boy soldier at the tender age of sixteen. How he was then transfered to a commando unit, which supported the special Boats service. How he then went on to serve in a Bomb disposal unit, who's principle job was to clear and disarm bombs remaining from World War I &amp; II.</description>

  <description>Interview with Gareth Goldthorpe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gareth Goldthorpe is a very fit and young looking sixty one year old, who has been a bookbinder for the last twenty years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his interview, he talks about his  unconventional and somewhat eccentric childhood, being sent off to boarding school at the tender  age of five, and how he ran away, travelling some fifteen miles back to his parent’s home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He then goes on to tell us about a golden time, when childhood seemed more adventurous while being carefree and relaxed:  How he and his brothers cycled some thirty five miles to see the new Gatwick airport, at the age of eight years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://peopletalk.mx5.org.uk/GG/ peopletalk interview No. 7 Gareth talks about his eccentric English childhood..mp3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Click here is for the whole of Gareth Goldthorpe interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Running time 44 minutes.</description>

Originally from the Midlands of England, he has for over two decades been living and working in the South coast of the UK.  Because his father spent long periods in prison, his mother, a respectable woman and a good catholic, had the difficult task of bringing up their two small boys on her own.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To cover the sense of shame she felt at her husband’s criminal career, Malcolm and his little brother were told that, their father was a serving soldier in the British army. Even his own friends and the rest of the respectable people who lived in his road, knew about his fathers criminal activities before Malcolm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malcolm found out the brutal truth from two Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Police Officers, who visiting his home, informed his mother that her husband had been arrested and was facing a long prison sentence. His mother broke down under this latest blow and though her tears told Malcolm that he was now ‘the man of the house’. The stress and shame of his father’s criminal career had a detrimental effect on his mother’s health over the years. Her attention mainly focused on Malcolm’s little brother, who suffered badly from epilepsy and Malcolm was left to do much as he pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He admits that his character begun to change in his teens when he started to hang around with the wrong sort of people, like most young men, he craved to belong. In this group of misfits he found a camaraderie, which manifested itself in fighting other gangs and being a football hooligan. He was soon in trouble with the police; his anti-social behaviour taking an ever-downward spiralling direction towards bigger and worsening acts of criminal behaviour. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He finally made the big mistake of trying to half heartily hold up a Post Office while under the influence of alcohol. After a Police car chase he was arrested. It was at this low point in his life that he met a girl, that would become the love of his life; altering him forever, when she made him realise that she would not stay with him unless he changed. The rest of the story is history; the courts and the magistrate were told that he had had a change of heart while in prison awaiting trial, amazingly they gave him one last chance to turn his life around and set him free with a suspended sentence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malcolm and his girl got married and settled down to a normal lawful life together and he has been a good hard working citizen for the last twenty-five years in very happy marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interview with Neville Glazier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neville Glazier is a bright eyed seventy four year old pensioner who has lead a rich life of travel and adventure, who talks about emigrating with his small family to South Africa in the late fifties just after WW II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neville worked across  Africa, in South Africa, Botswana, and Rhodesia now called Zimbabwe.  Doing all sorts of jobs, from selling Pepsi Cola in South Africa  to working on the railways in Botswana. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He went on to sell Hoovers, WV's cars and then to run a shirt factor in Rhodesia. Later on because of the political situation in Rhodesia ( Zimbabwe) he  returned to Britain. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://peopletalk.mx5.org.uk/podcast/ peopletalk interview 4 with Neville, talking about emigrating to South Africa in the late fifties just after WW II..mp3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Click here is  Neville Glazier audio interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interview with Jemma Robinson  Running Time 26.00 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jemma Robinson is about  5' 4" has grey eyes and short fair hair and is slim. She has an open, friendly smile which helps to emphasize her warm character. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She genuinely seems to like people; in other words, she is a people person. This has come in handy over the years as she has lived in some very different cultures from ours in the West. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She will talk about living in different and sometimes strange places. And how she moved to Japan just after leaving University, to work there. When she first arrived, she was fascinated by what she saw about her and how difficult it was sometimes to understand the Japanese way of doing things. Finally, she talks about moving to live in Italy with her new husband, Paolo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://peopletalk.mx5.org.uk/podcast/peopletalk.org interview 6 Jemma talks about living in Japan just after leaving University in England..mp3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Click here for Jemma Robinson audio interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interview with Ward Sister Maria Smailes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This  interview is with Ward Sister Maria Smailes who works in the Renal Dialysis unit, at the Royal Sussex Hospital in Brighton, on the South coast of England. Ward Sister Maria Smails is a modest  woman in her forties, with bright blue eyes and a contagious laugh. She  is the acting head of the unit and runs an nine nurse team that looks after more than forty long term  Dialysis patients.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her unit has a large catchment area, covering one of the most highly densely populated areas in the united kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;Maria  has worked in other departments when she first became a nurse, more than twenty two years ago. But has been in the very specialised Renal Dialysis unit for the last eighteen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In that time she has developed a very close working professional relationship with her long stay patiens. Some of whom have been looked after by Maria for over eighteen years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://peopletalk.mx5.org.uk/podcast/peopletalk interview 2   Ward Sister Maria Smailes runs a Renal Dialysis unit in a UK hospital..mp3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Click here for  Ward Sister Maria Smailes audio interview&lt;/a&gt;</description>
