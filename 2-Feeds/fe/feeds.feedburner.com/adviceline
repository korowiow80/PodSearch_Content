Wonder what causes panic attacks, and what you can do to prevent them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the United States alone, there are an estimated 40 million people who suffer from &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;anxiety disorders&lt;/span&gt;. While many claim to cure panic attacks through medication, hypnotherapy, and other complex treatments, most end up merely covering up your symptoms. To completely overcome anxiety, one must deal with the &lt;strong&gt;root causes of anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as treating symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this free podcast episode, Derrick is discussing how his panic disorder destroyed a fulfilling career in firefighting.&lt;br /&gt;“Panic attacks have taken my life away from me,” Derrick explains. Roy Masters, a radio counselor who has worked in the field of anxiety management for over fifty years, shows Derrick how simple the solution to panic attacks truly is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for simple yet private way to control panic attacks once and for all, you MUST listen to this podcast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To find out what happens to Derrick after Roy walks him through the &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Be Still &amp; Know&lt;/span&gt; technique, be sure to hear “Tips for Panic Attacks Part 2.” It will be available soon at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://roymasters.blogspot.com"&gt;http://roymasters.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quotes regarding &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;panic and anxiety&lt;/span&gt; from Roy Masters’ books:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“In close places, or in crowds, panic can develop because movement is limited and there is no way of escape when our reaction to the presence of so many people increases our uneasiness. Animals that are cornered will panic. Timid creatures who normally run may become vicious under these conditions, as the feeling-to-run changes into the feeling-to-fight... After a while, the very presence of people can cause discomfort, irritation and even panic.”&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fhu.com/books/mind_well/"&gt;How Your Mind Can Keep You Well&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You are probably not aware of the role hypnosis is playing in your own life, but take a good look at your reactions under stress, or in anticipation of a danger or pressure that is bigger than you are. Watch what happens the next time you know you must stand up to your boss or your child's teacher. The very thought of it causes your heart to race and throws you into a panic. There you are, back in your hypnotic state. The mere expectation of danger triggers a hypnotic condition that duplicates your response to the actual stress.”&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;a target="_blank" href=http://www.fhu.com/books/known/&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Beyond the Known&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The hypnotic state of mind takes a stronger grip on you with each succeeding stress because of the panic you feel as you struggle in vain to find answers on the mental level. As a result, you learn to lose awareness at the first sighting of stress, and to start fumbling around in your imagination for ways of feeling superior and 'above it all,' ways that exist only in your head.

Wonder what causes panic attacks, and what you can do to prevent them? In the United States alone, there are an estimated 40 million people who suffer from anxiety disorders. While many claim to cure panic attacks through medication, hypnotherapy, and other complex treatments, most end up merely covering up your symptoms. To completely overcome anxiety, one must deal with the root causes of anxiety, as well as treating symptoms. In this free podcast episode, Derrick is discussing how his panic disorder destroyed a fulfilling career in firefighting. “Panic attacks have taken my life away from me,” Derrick explains. Roy Masters, a radio counselor who has worked in the field of anxiety management for over fifty years, shows Derrick how simple the solution to panic attacks truly is. If you are looking for simple yet private way to control panic attacks once and for all, you MUST listen to this podcast! To find out what happens to Derrick after Roy walks him through the Be Still &amp; Know technique, be sure to hear “Tips for Panic Attacks Part 2.” It will be available soon at http://roymasters.blogspot.com. Quotes regarding panic and anxiety from Roy Masters’ books: “In close places, or in crowds, panic can develop because movement is limited and there is no way of escape when our reaction to the presence of so many people increases our uneasiness. Animals that are cornered will panic. Timid creatures who normally run may become vicious under these conditions, as the feeling-to-run changes into the feeling-to-fight... After a while, the very presence of people can cause discomfort, irritation and even panic.” - How Your Mind Can Keep You Well “You are probably not aware of the role hypnosis is playing in your own life, but take a good look at your reactions under stress, or in anticipation of a danger or pressure that is bigger than you are. Watch what happens the next time you know you must stand up to your boss or your child's teacher. The very thought of it causes your heart to race and throws you into a panic. There you are, back in your hypnotic state. The mere expectation of danger triggers a hypnotic condition that duplicates your response to the actual stress.” - Beyond the Known “The hypnotic state of mind takes a stronger grip on you with each succeeding stress because of the panic you feel as you struggle in vain to find answers on the mental level. As a result, you learn to lose awareness at the first sighting of stress, and to start fumbling around in your imagination for ways of feeling superior and 'above it all,' ways that exist only in your head. You know, but you really don't know, so you think you know, and that's all that matters to you.” - Beyond the Known LISTEN: ----- If you suffer deeply from the effects of stress, fear or pain, we recommend the Overcoming Stress, Fear, and Pain Pack.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>anger,pain,stress,fear,health,philosophy,spirituality,God,sex,fhu,anxiety,roymasters,resentment,roy</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://roymasters.blogspot.com/2008/08/tips-for-panic-attacks-part-1.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/adviceline/~5/RexJ9HqcJvM/v01e019.mp3" length="6264863" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://www.fhu.com/podcasts/media/v01e019.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>OCD Help Part 2: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Self Help</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/adviceline/~3/GGTtzH7RSYs/ocd-help-part-2-obsessive-compulsive.html</link><category>obsessive_compulsive_disorder</category><category>compulsive_behavior</category><category>guilt</category><category>fear</category><category>roy_masters</category><category>obsession</category><category>suicide</category><category>psychological_projection</category><category>OCD</category><category>depression</category><category>resentment</category><category>doubt</category><category>roy</category><category>phobia</category><category>free_podcast</category><author>noreply@blogger.com (Roy Masters)</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2008 15:29:22 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5234531870358811545.post-5520149909663913764</guid><description>&lt;a href="http://www.fhu.com/podcasts/media/v01e018.mp3"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w243/roymasters/listen_on_iphone2.gif" alt="Download Podcast Here"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Podcast Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Clip from episode: K4535)&lt;br /&gt;This podcast is brought to you by the Foundation of Human Understanding: &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fhu.com"&gt;http://www.fhu.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can people with &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Obsessive Compulsive Disorder&lt;/span&gt; cure themselves of their behavior? In this free podcast, radio counselor Roy Masters explores the possibility of overcoming all the effects of OCD. This is &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Part 2&lt;/span&gt; in a podcast series on "OCD Help." &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Part 1&lt;/span&gt; can be found at &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://roymasters.blogspot.com"&gt;http://roymasters.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris has been dealing with OCD for over 10 years. Roy explains that obsessive compulsive behavior and thoughts are usually preceded by depression and guilt. OCD, in effect, is a form of psychological projection. While some people project their guilt onto other people, those suffering from OCD project guilt onto an idea that can then be &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;obsessed &lt;/span&gt;over. By getting resentfully tied up with this idea or repetitive action, the obsessive compulsive mind is distracted away from the pain that guilt causes their conscience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would you like to discover true self help, and be free of your obsessive compulsive thoughts for good? Listen to this podcast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quotes regarding &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt; obsessive compulsive behavior&lt;/span&gt; from Roy Masters’ books:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Even when you believe in the worst that is about to befall you-and you do so compulsively-you cannot make yourself disbelieve it. After all, you have become a creature who relies on proof, not faith, and all you can see is proof staring you in the face. Thanks to your misguided faith, you can believe only as the result of being deceived, so that even when you believe positively that all will be well, it's a lie, and you know it, but you have to cling to it.”&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;a target="_blank" href=http://www.fhu.com/books/known/&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Beyond the Known&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Whenever you think through a problem in the conventional, subjective way—by trying to analyze it and figure out a solution—that thinking process acts in the same way as did the temptation that caused your problem, first by upsetting you and then by conditioning you to be wrong. By thinking about your problems, you tighten their hold over you; you become a part of the very problem you are trying to solve. Unless you yearn to know what is right and to be objective, thinking becomes an escape that triggers irrational and &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;compulsive behavior&lt;/span&gt; and a morbid feeling of hopelessness. The belief that thinking about your problems can solve them is the underlying principle behind many forms of compulsion. Only when you realize the truth about your problems, not when you think about them, will these compulsions be eliminated. All you ever accomplish by taking thought is to stir yourself up needlessly; you achieve nothing positive.”&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fhu.com/books/emotions/"&gt;How to Conquer Negative Emotions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Hypnosis affects your ordinary, conscious thinking, because your soul comes out of its compulsive experiences with all sorts of &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;guilt and anxiety&lt;/span&gt;. Stained with sin, your soul now consciously repels truth, both in the spirit and in the thinking about it; it reaches back, beyond the hypnotic state, for the means to persuade other people to give you the delusion of reality you need if you are to preserve your prideful nature.”&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;a target="_blank" href=http://www.fhu.com/books/known/&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Beyond the Known&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The meditation exercise will never become a habit.

Are you looking for a way to resolve the symptoms of OCD without the use of pharmaceutical drugs? Do you know what causes your compulsive thoughts and habits to repeat in an endless loop?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this free podcast episode, Chris has been suffering with severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, (also referred to as OCD) for the last ten years. He has an intense fear of getting blood or other bodily fluid on him that could lead him to being wrongly accused of rape or murder. Radio host Roy Masters shows how understanding the causes of OCD, is the key to overcoming its debilitating grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cause and prolonging of all OCD is resentment. Getting upset with an action or thought can often times cause your brain to repeat it. Every time the idea is introduced, a feeling of resentment is attached to it, causing an endless cycle. Eventually, many with this form of compulsive disorder give-in completely to the thought pattern as being true, no matter how absurd or illogical it is. This internal conflict can often lead to &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;thoughts of suicide&lt;/span&gt;; as in Chris’s situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want free help with your compulsive behavior, listen to “OCD Help Part 1” of this podcast. For a more in-depth conversation with Chris on the subject of obsessive compulsive disorder, hear “OCD Help Part 2.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quotes regarding &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt; obsessive compulsive behavior&lt;/span&gt; from Roy Masters’ books :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The more you tremble with fear or resentment, the further you are from the source of good, and the more subject you are to the subtle intimidations and manipulations of the wicked.” &lt;br /&gt;- &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.fhu.com/books/adam_eve/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Adam and Eve Sindrome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We are compulsive because of the proclivity of our souls to cling desperately to whatever we have been tricked into believing. And that fact holds true as far as you care to take it – in religion, politics, medicine – from the false heights of 'spiritual' cures to the lowest perversions imaginable.”&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;a target="_blank" href=http://www.fhu.com/books/known/&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Beyond the Known&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I do not intend to dwell at length on the other forms of compulsive behavior, except to say that the hypnoidal state leads to all of them by virtue of the pain and fear it produces. The victim is always driven to remove his pain.

Are you looking for a way to resolve the symptoms of OCD without the use of pharmaceutical drugs? Do you know what causes your compulsive thoughts and habits to repeat in an endless loop? In this free podcast episode, Chris has been suffering with severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, (also referred to as OCD) for the last ten years. He has an intense fear of getting blood or other bodily fluid on him that could lead him to being wrongly accused of rape or murder. Radio host Roy Masters shows how understanding the causes of OCD, is the key to overcoming its debilitating grip. The cause and prolonging of all OCD is resentment. Getting upset with an action or thought can often times cause your brain to repeat it. Every time the idea is introduced, a feeling of resentment is attached to it, causing an endless cycle. Eventually, many with this form of compulsive disorder give-in completely to the thought pattern as being true, no matter how absurd or illogical it is. This internal conflict can often lead to thoughts of suicide; as in Chris’s situation. If you want free help with your compulsive behavior, listen to “OCD Help Part 1” of this podcast. For a more in-depth conversation with Chris on the subject of obsessive compulsive disorder, hear “OCD Help Part 2.” Quotes regarding obsessive compulsive behavior from Roy Masters’ books : “The more you tremble with fear or resentment, the further you are from the source of good, and the more subject you are to the subtle intimidations and manipulations of the wicked.” - Adam and Eve Sindrome “We are compulsive because of the proclivity of our souls to cling desperately to whatever we have been tricked into believing. And that fact holds true as far as you care to take it – in religion, politics, medicine – from the false heights of 'spiritual' cures to the lowest perversions imaginable.” - Beyond the Known “I do not intend to dwell at length on the other forms of compulsive behavior, except to say that the hypnoidal state leads to all of them by virtue of the pain and fear it produces. The victim is always driven to remove his pain. Left to himself, he experiments; otherwise, still in his trance, he is led down the garden path to the permissible, tried, proven, and accepted forms of pleasure. His trance state deepens as those unhealthy practices debilitate him physically.” - Beyond the Known “You may use the activity of resentment to escape the guilt, as though the thing of beauty, or even God himself, had suckered you into believing a lie. Of course, by believing in your false innocence, you perpetuate the guilt that began when you first rejected truth in favor of illusion. You lock yourself in more tightly to the hypnotic cycle of identification, feeling ever more guilty for escaping (again) into a lie and then needing more lies to diminish your awareness of the new guilt.

No one would argue that the act of giving gifts is an immoral practice. Conflicts arise, however, when a person is overwhelmed by a &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;feeling&lt;/span&gt; when giving or receiving. Roy explains that feeling good over getting a gift, or feeling resentful because you are being pressured to give one, represents the “dark side of giving.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne in California has a chronic issue of giving and “giving in” to her 40-year-old son. The subject of spoiling children, though seemingly far removed from obligated gift-giving, function off of the same principles, and have similar results. Due to her overly generous behavior, which she does for a selfish feeling of appreciation, her son has become both entitled and resentful. When faced with the choice of acting out his frustrations or holding it in, he chooses the latter and covers up his repression with alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a people pleaser, or feel captive to one, you must hear this podcast!&lt;br /&gt;(Clip from episodes: K4480 and K4481)&lt;br /&gt;This podcast is brought to you by the Foundation of Human Understanding: &lt;a href=http://www.fhu.com /&gt;http://www.fhu.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quotes regarding compulsive giving from books by Roy Masters:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“If the express purpose of the gift is to do you honor, and your pride falls for that, you will become enslaved both by the gift and the resentment you will feel when you discover the donor’s real motivation.” &lt;br /&gt;– &lt;a href=http://fhu.com/books/power_of_words/index.html /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Secret Power of Words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Serving&lt;/span&gt; seems so innocent that it is never suspected for what it is.

Do you experience more worry and pressure during the holidays than happiness and contentment? Would you rather receive a gift that was sincerely given or compelled because it is your birthday or a holiday that requires it? In this free podcast episode, radio host Roy Masters explores the difference between compulsive and healthy giving. No one would argue that the act of giving gifts is an immoral practice. Conflicts arise, however, when a person is overwhelmed by a feeling when giving or receiving. Roy explains that feeling good over getting a gift, or feeling resentful because you are being pressured to give one, represents the “dark side of giving.” Anne in California has a chronic issue of giving and “giving in” to her 40-year-old son. The subject of spoiling children, though seemingly far removed from obligated gift-giving, function off of the same principles, and have similar results. Due to her overly generous behavior, which she does for a selfish feeling of appreciation, her son has become both entitled and resentful. When faced with the choice of acting out his frustrations or holding it in, he chooses the latter and covers up his repression with alcohol. If you are a people pleaser, or feel captive to one, you must hear this podcast! (Clip from episodes: K4480 and K4481) This podcast is brought to you by the Foundation of Human Understanding: http://www.fhu.com Quotes regarding compulsive giving from books by Roy Masters: “If the express purpose of the gift is to do you honor, and your pride falls for that, you will become enslaved both by the gift and the resentment you will feel when you discover the donor’s real motivation.” – Secret Power of Words “Serving seems so innocent that it is never suspected for what it is. Indeed, any gift offering can create a powerful obligation, even if it is just a 'free' flower at the airport in exchange for a donation. Under the circumstances, the victim cannot refuse the hidden demand to part with a portion of his soul along with his money. The taker is taken.” – Eat No Evil “The greatest of all gifts (especially appropriate at Christmas time) is choosing not to give, which frees others from the obligation to give something in return for what you’ve given them.

We move only when we are upset, but that is the wrong time. We worry about what we have not done and resent what we must do, which grows increasingly difficult. Now we worry because we are afraid of making another mistake. Or we seek a reason to motivate us or excuse our inactivity. Now we have more to do and less time to do it—more worry!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Worry over the situation only makes it worse, and an outsider’s attempt to ease the tension by being polite only releases a greater flood of anger and reactivates the cycle.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The problem-solving activity of the foolish ego is called worry. Blind worry adds impetus to the problem and often draws to us the very thing we fear. Nagging thoughts caused by our upsets can cause us to do the very thing we dread or detest, just to get it off our minds. But it does not succeed.

We just had to worry to ennoble ourselves. It seemed quite normal to worry; but worry is really the compulsive activity of the mind without faith, in the dark, priding itself on solving the problems that worry itself created.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Worry is a counterfeit virtue. Guilty of failing to be creatively concerned, we needed to fill our minds with something, even when we didn’t have anything to be concerned about. It did seem the natural thing to do. Could we admit to our failings? Of course not! If we didn’t have such busy minds we would be forced to see our faults. So we worried about the war and about the kids. Worry made us industrious busybodies who meddled in every kind of affair for its great pride value. But then we got involved and created problems so enormous that our inability to solve them with worry became apparent—even to ourselves.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Again, worry is the action of a mind in the dark, forgetting the truth, proudly trying to fix what it did in the dark. We couldn’t stop worrying before because we didn’t want to stop; it had an ego value for us. It always seemed like love for others. It made us forget our empty, faulty, meaningless existence. It won us badges of honor for this or that cause. Had we a grain of true concern, we would never have had anything to worry about—no great activity of mind to testify to our ego’s greatness.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“In fact, our mind becomes so empty of worry and planning that we have virtually nothing to do, except to understand more, appreciate more, wonder more and see more clearly to avoid problems. As we become more adept at avoiding problems, things become easier, so we worry even less.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer deeply from the effects of stress, fear or pain, we recommend the &lt;a href="http://www.fhu.com/anger_management.html" /&gt;Overcoming Stress Fear and Pain Pack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5234531870358811545-8001931660382569350?l=roymasters.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

(Clip from episode: K3682) This podcast is brought to you by the Foundation of Human Understanding: http://www.fhu.com Quotes regarding constant worry from the book How Your Mind Can Keep You Well by Roy Masters: “Worry has been our substitute for the natural concern we should have had. We just had to worry to ennoble ourselves. It seemed quite normal to worry; but worry is really the compulsive activity of the mind without faith, in the dark, priding itself on solving the problems that worry itself created.” “Worry is a counterfeit virtue. Guilty of failing to be creatively concerned, we needed to fill our minds with something, even when we didn’t have anything to be concerned about. It did seem the natural thing to do. Could we admit to our failings? Of course not! If we didn’t have such busy minds we would be forced to see our faults. So we worried about the war and about the kids. Worry made us industrious busybodies who meddled in every kind of affair for its great pride value. But then we got involved and created problems so enormous that our inability to solve them with worry became apparent—even to ourselves.” “Again, worry is the action of a mind in the dark, forgetting the truth, proudly trying to fix what it did in the dark. We couldn’t stop worrying before because we didn’t want to stop; it had an ego value for us. It always seemed like love for others. It made us forget our empty, faulty, meaningless existence. It won us badges of honor for this or that cause. Had we a grain of true concern, we would never have had anything to worry about—no great activity of mind to testify to our ego’s greatness.” “In fact, our mind becomes so empty of worry and planning that we have virtually nothing to do, except to understand more, appreciate more, wonder more and see more clearly to avoid problems. As we become more adept at avoiding problems, things become easier, so we worry even less.” ----- If you suffer deeply from the effects of stress, fear or pain, we recommend the Overcoming Stress Fear and Pain Pack.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>anger,pain,stress,fear,health,philosophy,spirituality,God,sex,fhu,anxiety,roymasters,resentment,roy</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://roymasters.blogspot.com/2007/10/stop-worrying-breaking-free-from.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/adviceline/~5/Z2x4WCkL2Bo/v01e013.mp3" length="4001767" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://www.fhu.com/podcasts/media/v01e013.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Cause of Glaucoma and Hysterical Blindness: Anger and Stress</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/adviceline/~3/_gLmEramOA0/cause-of-glaucoma-and-hysterical.html</link><category>glaucoma</category><category>roy</category><category>anger_management</category><category>roy_masters</category><category>hysterical_blindness</category><category>glaucoma_cause</category><category>free_podcast</category><category>blindness</category><category>anger</category><author>noreply@blogger.com (Roy Masters)</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2007 11:16:34 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5234531870358811545.post-6787009020163727180</guid><description>&lt;a href="http://www.fhu.com/podcasts/media/v01e012.mp3"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i178.photobucket.com/albums/w243/roymasters/listen_on_iphone2.gif" alt="Download Podcast Here"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Podcast Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you suffer from blindness caused by glaucoma?

But then blindness can occur from the transference of blood pressure to eye pressure, translating from one level to the other until it reaches the eye—or any other weak point in the body.

The problem-solving activity of the foolish ego is called worry. Blind worry adds impetus to the problem and often draws to us the very thing we fear.

Are you tied down with asthma medication and nebulizers? Are you looking for a home remedy or natural asthma cure? Is there a cure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe it a not, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a link between asthma, bronchitis, and allergy-based diseases. Whether you suffer from childhood or adult asthma, asthmatic symptoms all have a similar cause. Burt is wondering if his asthma is related to his &lt;strong&gt;emotions&lt;/strong&gt; or is it merely a physical malady. In this free podcast episode, Roy Masters discusses not only prevention treatment, but a long-term asthma cure. Roy explains what situations cause asthma and how your body’s supply of adrenaline is affected. By dealing with the true cause of asthma, &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; can remedy all your asthmatic allergies and symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Clip from episode: K4487)&lt;br /&gt;This free podcast is brought to you by the Foundation of Human Understanding: &lt;a href="http://www.fhu.com"&gt;http://www.fhu.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quotes regarding asthma and other emotion-driven diseases from Roy Masters’ books:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “Asthma: a disease caused by the draining away of life and breath by the hovering temptation, usually a parent.”&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;a href=http://www.fhu.com/books/doctors/index.html&gt; How to Conquer Suffering Without Doctors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Fully 80 percent of all illnesses—mental, emotional, and physical—are believed to be emotion-based, including some forms of cancer.

Are you tied down with asthma medication and nebulizers? Are you looking for a home remedy or natural asthma cure? Is there a cure? Believe it a not, there is a link between asthma, bronchitis, and allergy-based diseases. Whether you suffer from childhood or adult asthma, asthmatic symptoms all have a similar cause. Burt is wondering if his asthma is related to his emotions or is it merely a physical malady. In this free podcast episode, Roy Masters discusses not only prevention treatment, but a long-term asthma cure. Roy explains what situations cause asthma and how your body’s supply of adrenaline is affected. By dealing with the true cause of asthma, you can remedy all your asthmatic allergies and symptoms. (Clip from episode: K4487) This free podcast is brought to you by the Foundation of Human Understanding: http://www.fhu.com Quotes regarding asthma and other emotion-driven diseases from Roy Masters’ books: “Asthma: a disease caused by the draining away of life and breath by the hovering temptation, usually a parent.” - How to Conquer Suffering Without Doctors “Fully 80 percent of all illnesses—mental, emotional, and physical—are believed to be emotion-based, including some forms of cancer. Science is certainly on to something, but they are missing a piece of the puzzle that they can never find, simply because the answer lies beyond psychology.” - How Your Mind Can Keep You Well “Many diseases and so-called “inherited” illnesses are transferred in a similar way through an emotionally-charged climate in the home. In these cases, there is no genetic transference, although, perhaps, the same genetic weakness may exist. Rather, we select or else we are overwhelmed by the dominant personality—through emotion—and we assume the same identity and habit patterns, thereby setting the stage for the same kind of illness.” - How to Control Your Negative Emotions “In the absence of a real fatherly authority, the central characters of a man's life are his mother and his wife—yes, even his sisters. God help the poor little fellow who has too many sisters, grandmothers or aunts. Asthma, bronchitis or leukemia are his miserable lot. If he is "lucky," he gets out of that den of iniquity with homosexuality. Mother, empowered by the energy of father's failing, passes on the spore of original corruption to the male child's ego; he grows up stress-sensitive and pressure-needful.

But vain egos will not and cannot reach up for illumination because of pride's need to be "right" the way it finds itself. Until that proud ego is awakened the painful way by reaching down to corrupt and be corrupted, there is no hope, until, through sheer agony (at any point along the way) it becomes willing to face the truth. “&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“You see, don't you, that the problems posed by homosexuality, like those posed by sexuality, are rooted in an unrecognized quest for identity? There is an attempt to recover the lost role, or to obtain the needed essence (in the way a female emasculates a male), to support a faulty existence by establishing a relationship with another weak and corrupted person.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We are all latent or dormant homosexuals.

We see gross manifestations of this in anorexia [anorexia nervosa—‘pathological fear of weight gain’] and bulimia [‘the abnormal and constant craving for food’]…”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Food can corrupt and change us to need food. One of the peculiarities of hate is that it produces in us a wrong kind of need which we see as love—in this case, for food. If you hate it, you’re going to love it; and we allow ourselves to be ruled by that love.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Anorexia has something to do with the recognition of food as being somehow connected to guilt—growing a guilt. Food first ‘saves’ the ego as a friend in need and then is seen for what it is, a cause of guilt. The faulty logic is, if eating (to reject conscience) equals guilt, then, surely, not eating is the path to redemption.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Food sets us free from conscience, and keeps us free from conscience, but enslaved to the spirit of food—a state we call love. Food can induce, post hypnotically, an altered state of consciousness that assures you all is well because you feel so good. It is like an evil salvation for the preservation of your ego.  Eventually you must realize that conflict, guilt, anxiety, and feelings of aloneness and uncertainty are simply the whimperings of a tormented conscience, and there are only two ways to handle a bad case of conscience, and one way is to face the truth, admit your error and take your licks. It is not always the food, drink, dope, sex, or whatever, that reduces you to a state of utter dependency, but rather, it is the spirit of the lie that lures you into a false sense of self-worth with rebellion objects of consolation.

Hold your ground as the pain of conflict increases to a point where you surrender to the inner pressure, in much the same way you have done with outer pressures when the heat is on.

You feel resentment against everyone for having to prove yourself, which pressure festers into gargantuan feats of kindness and devotion toward lesser gods than you in a desperate attempt to make them acknowledge you until you can't any more.

Because of our decreasing understanding and failure to overcome our emotional response, we develop the increasing ability to compensate by analyzing and rationalizing, which we call worry.” -How Your Mind Can Keep You Well Podcast Here</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>anger,pain,stress,fear,health,philosophy,spirituality,God,sex,fhu,anxiety,roymasters,resentment,roy</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://roymasters.blogspot.com/2007/03/anxiety-and-depression-anger-turned_31.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/adviceline/~5/Z9BIo8Ofe6g/v01e005.mp3" length="3857044" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://www.fhu.com/podcasts/media/v01e005.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Sympathy for Saddam: Attraction Through Abuse</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/adviceline/~3/5gxRe-P9LKE/sympathy-for-saddam-attraction-through.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Roy Masters)</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Apr 2007 10:08:02 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5234531870358811545.post-1663488774864371226</guid><description>Mike admits that as he watched the Saddam Hussein hanging, he imagined the rope around his own neck.&lt;br /&gt;(Clip from episode: K4497) &lt;br /&gt;Read and hear more at the Foundation of Human Understanding: &lt;a href="http://www.fhu.com/"&gt;http://www.fhu.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quotes regarding abuse and abusers from Roy Masters’ books:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Dictators "love" people and people "love" their "female" dictators. We see here a case of mutual abuse. Tyrants love the weakness of the people for the sake of the power it gives them, and the vast masses of people love the deception (hypnosis) that is practiced on them by those to whom they have given power. It follows that when people become thoroughly degenerate, they will dig up dictators out of Hell and bestow upon them the power to rule the world with their peculiar madness. How gladly do the utterly demoralized souls accept the exquisite tortures inflicted upon them by the damned of their own making and choosing. So it is with the ego of man; he brings tragedy down about his ears through the very woman he craves-and elects to power.”&lt;br /&gt; -Beyond the Known&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Soon the tyrant personality begins to suffer feelings of guilt and anxiety for the demon role he feels obliged to play, while his hapless slave feels guilty for his weakness and his growing inferiority. Then, by adding resentment to his fear, the coward is compelled to go on giving power to the bully, thus enabling him to go on being more of a beast. &lt;br /&gt;Sensing deep down that the way in which the victim is responding to him is largely responsible for the agonizing pain of his own power trip, the bully soon develops contempt for the sniveling coward. The underdog, not seeing his part in the creation of the evil that is lording it over him, simply dodges all responsibility for the situation and clings instead to the booby prize of judgment. So they continue to respond to each other in a deepening&lt;br /&gt;hypnotist-subject, vampire-zombie relationship.”&lt;br /&gt; -Beyond the Known&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fhu.com/podcasts/media/v01e004.mp3"&gt;Podcast Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5234531870358811545-1663488774864371226?l=roymasters.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;
