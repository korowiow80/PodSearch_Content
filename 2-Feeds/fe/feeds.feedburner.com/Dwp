            <description>Do the “Time Warp” when Marley’s Ghost and the ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW headline the next “Dave White Presents”!
For 25 years, Marley’s Ghost has been a roots band playing bagpipes, blues, reggae, country and folk. Their 10th album, JUBILEE, has just been released, and celebration is the right word! For one thing, JUBILEE was produced by 81 year old Cowboy Jack Clement. He worked with Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Roy Orbison and Carl Perkins back at Sun Records. In fact Clemen was the guy who told Jerry Lee Lewis to come back with something rock ‘n roll. So credit Clement with inspiring “Great Balls of Fire.”
On Tuesday June 5, singer and multi-instrumentalist Dan Wheatman will tell you other stories about JUBILEE including the other heavy-hitters who joined in the fun including Emmylou Harris, John Prine, Old Crow Medicine Show, and Marty Stuart. Wheatman will get inside the two clever songs we’ll play for you including one co-written by Levon Helm about a cotton farmer who, ah, had to plant an alternate crop. “Hank and Audrey” is all about the wild relationship between Hank and Audrey Williams. Wild is the right word, alright . . .
Speaking of wild, why is THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW such a phenomena? Forty years after its debut, it’s still the longest running movie being shown in theatres, usually at those famous midnight matinees. Why does it inspire grown men to dress up in fish-net stockings and prompt viewers to throw food at the screen?
Dave Thompson, author of a new ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW history, has some ideas about the whys of RHPS along with many stories behind the production. Did you know it all started when Richard O'Brien wrote the play because he wasn’t permitted to play Herod as Elvis in a production of Jesus Christ Superstar? Did you know there have been 118 “Original Cast” soundtrack recordings from countries as diverse as Peru, Iceland, the Philippines, Panama, and Germany? Thompson covers it all, including the "The Rocky Horror Picture Show Audience Participation Survival Kit" which lists everything you must bring to any screening. 
On top of all that, Dave White chats with a new KSAV host named Mark Silverman. His upcoming show is called “Talking Time Share.” What is it all about? Find out Tuesday, June 5 at 7:30 p.m. Eastern, then 7:30 Pacific over--

            <description>Bernie Kopell Helps DAVE WHITE PRESENTS Go Ape For Our 100th Broadcast!
He was Siegfried on GET SMART. He was Doc on THE LOVE BOAT. Would you believe—he was also the voice of Baron Von Butcher on LANCELOT LINK, SECRET CHIMP?
On Tuesday, May 22, Bernie Kopell headlines DWP to showcase the new DVD collector’s edition of LANCELOT LINK, SECRET CHIMP. LANCELOT LINK was a spy parody that ran on Saturday mornings on ABC from 1970 to 1972. Very much in the spirit of GET SMART, live chimpanzees from A.P.E. (Agency to Prevent Evil) battled Von Butcher’s C.H.U.M.P. (Criminal Headquarters for Underworld Master Plan) in between performing rock songs as the Evolution Revolution.
In a very lively and laugh-filled conversation with Wes Britton, Bernie discusses everything A.P.E. and talks about how proceeds from the DVD will help the actual Lance Link who’s alive and well and retired at the Wildlife Way Station in LA! Bernie also talks about working in series television in the ‘60s, his role as Siegfried, his memories of his friend Don Adams, and, of course, many, many stories about his nine years on THE LOVE BOAT.
Just as LANCELOT LINK was going off the air, a new blues rock band was hitting the road, the Washington D.C. based The Nighthawks. Forty years later, harp player Mark Wenner and his hard-driving group are still at it with a 40th anniversary collection called DAMN GOOD TIME! Think Carl Perkins, Eddie Cochran, Jimmy Reed, and Willie Dixon all jamming together. That’s what The Nighthawks would call a hot gig, and Mark will tell you his rockin’ tales on the next DWP. Naturally, we’ll heat up the joint with two samples from the album!
For 100 blockbuster episodes, DAVE WHITE PRESENTS has offered Variety with a capital V over KSAV.org. For our anniversary show, we’re delighted to highlight another KSAV program that’s especially unique. It’s called THE HIGH STREET BROADCAST and brings back old time radio, but we’re not talking playing the old shows. Each hour, HSB offers their own zany character sketches, original and classic songs, and a half-hour serial. Just like the old days, they perform it all live on stage. Host/Writer/Director Devlin Conners will tell you what its all about and we think you’ll add HSB to your entertainment menu when DWP isn’t around with our own, well, some call it comedy—
So that’s live chimps, GET SMART, THE LOVE BOAT, The Nighthawks, and the new/old time radio of THE HIGH STREET BROADCASTS all on a very special edition of DWp! It debuts Tuesday, May 22nd at 7:30 p.m. Eastern, then 7:30 Pacific over—

            <title>Dave White Presents</title>
            <description>We’re going behind the scenes in Hollywood and on the road with the Beat Generation on the next “Dave white Presents”! 

On April 23, the folks behind World Book Day called MAKE YOUR MOVIE: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE BUSINESS AND POLITICS OF FILMMAKING a new Film Bible. Author Barbara Freedman Doyle, with 20 years experience with studios like Tri-Star and Disney, knows what aspiring directors, writers, and producers need to know to get their projects off the ground the right way. But you don’t have to be inside show biz to be interested in how and why some movies are made and others not. So next Tuesday, May 8, Barbara’s conversation with Dave White will be one for all film buffs!

The same is true of Dave’s interview with Sai Achath, author of HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES: BASIC THINGS YOU’VE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW. What’s different about this collection of stories about 55 living actors is that each short bio is accompanied by a unique caricature by the author. In fact, Sai Achath is a well-known cartoonist, ventriloquist, and hand shadow artist. He’ll tell you all about these arcane arts with everything but pictures on DWP!

Then, just in time for the May 23 release of Jack Kerouac’s ON THE ROAD starring Garrett Hedlund, Sam Riley, and Kristen Stewart, Wes Britton chats with Barry Gifford, co-author of the newly re-issued JACK’S BOOK: AN ORAL BIOGRAPHY OF JACK KEROUAC. When Barry’s book first came out in 1978, it became a classic and inspired many “oral histories” to follow. It’s never been out of print and remains an essential window into the world of Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, and their circle. Find out why—where else?--on the next edition of “Dave White Presents”!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Dwp/~4/OYIoDPk0jho" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Dave White Presents</title>
            <description>James Brown, Batman, Rick Nelson, and The Spiral Starecase feature on the next “Dave White Presents”!

In January 1969, Pat Upton and The Spiral Starecase had a million-selling hit called “More Today Than Yesterday.” Back then, folks like Frank Sinatra and Jose Feliciano stopped by to see their act. A few years later, Pat had a meeting with Col. Tom Parker and ran into Rick Nelson. This led to Upton recording and touring with Nelson for three years.

 Then, after retiring from the road, Upton opened a nightclub in Guntersville, Alabama. It was there where Rick Nelson performed his final gig, with Upton on guitar one last time, before the tragic plane crash on New year’s Eve, 1985.  

On Tuesday, April 24, Upton remembers The Spiral Starecase and shares memories of Rick Nelson on DWP. We’ll play “More Today Than Yesterday” for you, as well as one hot Nelson/Upton rocker.

Speaking of hot, did they get much hotter than James Brown? “The Hardest Working Man in Show Business” gave us unforgettable hits and decades of dynamic showmanship. He was no stranger to controversy, to put it mildly.

No one knows more about the many facets of “Mr. Dynamite than author RJ Smith. His new THE ONE: THE LIFE AND MUSIC OF JAMES BROWN digs deep into Brown’s influences, rags-to-riches battles, and his importance in American music. For DWP, RJ shares highlights from his surprising biography and, of course, we’ll play some hot wax from “The One” himself.

After his 1939 debut, Batman has also been very hot, a lucrative property in movie serials, on radio, and as the “Bright Knight of TV’s Adam West to the “Dark Knight” of Keaton, Bale, etc. On the next DWP, past guest Bruce Scivally returns, this time to talk about his hot off the press BILLION DOLLAR BATMAN. Believe us, it’s a book that belongs on everyone’s Bat-shelf. Why?

            <title>Dave White Presents</title>
            <description>Take a ride on a Blues Cruise with “Dave White Presents”—and get a hot free DVD!
For over 30 years, film maker Robert Mugge has been producing very high-quality documentaries on music, especially blues, jazz, bluegrass, Zydeco, and roots music. He’s been funded by Channel 4 in England, Dave Stewart (Eurythmics), and featured Morgan Freeman as a narrator for multi-part projects like LAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI JUKES and HELLHOUNDS ON MY TRAIL: THE AFTERLIFE OF ROBERT JOHNSON. 
On Tues. April 10, Mugge comes to DWP and chats with Wes Britton about his career and especially his new documentary, ALL JAMS ON DECK. Originally available as a souvenir for voyagers on the legendary Blues Cruises, ALL JAMS ON DECK is becoming known as a film all blues lovers in general should enjoy and a primer for blues performers looking for some tips from the pros. Shot on the October 2010 Rhythm &amp; Blues Cruise to the Mexican Riviera, the 96 minutes features Johnny and Edgar Winter, Kim Wilson, Marsha Ball, Tommy Castro, Commander Cody, past DWP guest Elvin Bishop . . . how can you go wrong? Especially since we’re going to tell you how you can get the jams for free?
“There is no tale so tall I cannot tell it, nor song so sweet I cannot sing it” - Guy Davis
Here’s something else very special. Since 1994, bluesman Guy Davis has been polishing his one-man audioplay called THE ADVENTURES OF FISHY WATERS: IN BED WITH THE BLUES. It’s now available as a double CD featuring Davis playing Waters, a train jumping hobo on the road back in the segregated South. It’s about half Delta blues songs, half Waters telling his stories and sharing hilarious tall tales in all manner of voices. We hear Davis’s guitar, harp, and an assortment of sound effects to help bring the era he’s singing about to life. On the next DWP, we’ll not only play you some samples, Davis will share some of his whoppers with you.
What happens when your son is falsely accused of murder and looking at life in prison? Georgia mother, Jackie Carpenter, knows first-hand this true-life story. In 2008, her son Jason apprehended thieves who’d been stealing copper from his work site. On the advice of a deputy, he was armed and trying to keep the men on the premises until the police arrived when the gun accidentally fired, killing one of the men. Jackie revealed what happened next in two books, THE BRIDGE: BETWEEN CELL BLOCK A AND A MIRACLE IS PSALM 91 and GEORGIA JUSTICE which is now being made into a motion picture starring Francine Locke.
You can hear Jackie’s story, learn about the “Blues Cruise” jams, and go back in time with Fishy Waters Tuesday, April 10 at 7:30 p.m. Eastern, then 7:30 Pacific over--

            <description>The Ladies Rule When Melissa Manchester, Suzi Quatro, and author Tricia Goyer Guest on the Next “Dave White Presents”!

“You Should Hear About How She Talks About You.” “Don’t Cry Out Loud.” “Through the Eyes of Love.” Since 1973, the elegant singer/songwriter Melissa Manchester has had more than her share of hits, Grammy nominations and wins, and has co-written songs with the likes of Carole Bayer Sager and Kenny Loggins. Fourteen of her most loved songs are collected on the new PLAYLIST: THE VERY BEST OF MELISSA MANCHESTER, and she’ll talk about this release with Wes Britton on the Tues. March 27 edition of DWP. She discusses her friendships with Barry Manilow, Bette Midler, learning about writing songs from Paul Simon, and being the only performer to ever sing two Academy Award nominated songs on the same night at the Oscar ceremonies. And she’ll share the stories behind two of her classics that we’ll play for you.

The 1970s also saw the debut of another popular singer/songwriter, but Suzi Quatro came from the other side of the tracks. Before The Runaways, before The Go-Gos, Suzi was a rock pioneer. She belted out “The Wild One” playing her signature bass, clad in her signature leather, and became a major influence on every lady rocker to follow. Along the way, she starred as Leather Tuskadaro on HAPPY DAYS and—gasp—broke Alice Cooper’s nose!

On the next DWP, Suzi will share these stories and go behind the scenes of her new 15th solo album, IN THE SPOTLIGHT. We’ll play two nuggets for you including “Singing with Angels” featuring Elvis’s original guitarist James Burton and The King’s own backing vocalists, The Jordanaires.

Then, Dave White talks with award winning Tricia Goyer, author of the just published historical novel, BY THE LIGHT OF THE SILVERY MOON. Her 26th book is the story of a shipboard romance, a family reunion, hope and redemption—on the Titanic.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Dwp/~4/OYIoDPk0jho" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Dave White Presents</title>
            <description>Fans of Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company have some special treats coming this month!

On Tues. March 13, Sony Legacy will release Big Brother and the Holding Company featuring Janis Joplin’s LIVE AT THE CAROUSEL BALLROOM. Recorded June 23, 1968 just two months before Janis left the band, the show was captured on tape by the legendary Owsley “Bear” Stanley using the most advanced technology of the time. Now digitally re-mastered from the original tapes, listeners can hear Big Brother and the Holding Company at the peak of their powers in a very memorable concert.

Also on March 13, Big Brother guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter Sam Andrew comes to “Dave White Presents” to discuss the concert and how the new release came to be. In an extensive 40 minute conversation with Wes Britton, Sam talks about what made the Carousel Ballroom such an interesting venue, just who this “Bear” was, and what it was like to be Janis Joplin’s musical partner. Why did Sam leave Big Brother to join Janis in her short-lived Kosmic Blues Band? What was Big Brother like after Janis left us and how did it come about that Sam joined Moby Grape in the 1990s? What else is coming for Big Brother fans? Of course, we’ll play you two samples from the Carousel gig. You’ve probably never heard “Call On Me” or “Piece Of My Heart” quite this way before—unless you were there on that June night in San Francisco.

            <title>Dave White Presents</title>
            <description>Tippi Hedron, the SuperSeven, and the Son of Boris Badenov headline the next “Dave White Presents”!

The Birds are Coming!
That was the tagline for Alfred Hitchcock’s 1962 thriller introducing his newest blonde bombshell, Tippi Hedron. She starred alongside Sean Connery in another Hitchcock classic, Marni, before working with Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren in Charlie Chaplin’s 1969 A Countess From Hong Kong—becoming the only actress to ever work for both these esteemed British directors. 
On Tuesday February 28, Tippi Hedron comes to DWP and talks about a forthcoming BBC film about her legendary time with Hitchcock. It’s called “The Girl” and stars Sienna Miller as Hedron. What happened when these two actresses met to discuss the film and the script? How did Hitchcock and Chaplin compare as directors? What was Sean Connery like when he wasn’t playing 007? How does it feel to be Melanie Griffith’s Mom? We’ll answer all these questions and, of course, Tippi wants you to know about her current activism to pass a bill outlawing the domesticating of dangerous cats.
 
Who is SuperSeven?
Well, he’s the world's greatest masked superspy, an agent for the mysterious T.H.E.M. “The Adventures Of SuperSeven”  is “an action packed,  tongue in cheek homage to the spy films, TV shows and masked hero adventures of the 1960's and
1970's.” Find out more about this new series when Olivia Dunkley, who plays Sandra West, the hero’s reluctant partner, goes behind-the-scenes with Dave White.  (Hmm, a double entendre there?)

Who was the voice of Ludwig Von Drake, Boris Badenov, Morocco Mole, and the Little Green Sprout?
That was the legendary voice actor, Paul Frees. Along with his colleague Mel Blanc, Freez was the “Man of a Thousand Voices” for films, television, and even rides and the “Haunted Mansion” at Disneyland. Now, his son Fred Frees has moved into the family business and is also providing voices for commercials and even doing some of the characters his Father created. He’s also helping BearManor Media publish some interesting audio projects he’ll share on, where else?—the next “Dave White Presents”!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Dwp/~4/OYIoDPk0jho" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Dave White Presents</title>
            <description>THE X-Files and Ernie Kovacs on the Feb. 14 Edition of Dave White Presents!

For 9 seasons, from Sept. 10, 1993 to May 19, 2002, THE X-Files was a cultural phenomena. One reason was the cast of supporting players like William B. Davis who became a fan favorite playing “cigarette smoking man.” Of course, Davis enjoyed a long career before and after Scully and Muldar, beginning as a child star on Canadian radio. For DWP, he’ll share stories about his stage and film work in 3 countries and get behind the scenes of THE X-Files with some surprising new stories. And William will let you know what you’ll find in his lively new memoir, Where There's Smoke...: Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man.

Before his premature death at age 42, TV pioneer Ernie Kovacs was known for his innovative, experimental breed of comedy. His visual gags and improvisation influenced folks like David Letterman, Craig Ferguson, George Carlin, and Rowan and Martin. He’s also remembered for his performances with his Tony-winning wife, Edie Adams.

In a fascinating conversation with Dave White, Josh Mills (son of Adams) shares some very funny anecdotes about Kovacs and his Mom. Did you know they appeared on the very last Lucy/Desi Comedy Hour where Edie sang “The Last Time”—even though no one knew this was the end for that legendary couple? Josh also tells what you can find in the ongoing series of DVD and CD releases coming from the vaults of the Kovacs/Adams Estate.

Into the blues? KSAV.org will shortly debut a new program of music called “Eight to the Bar.” Show host Les Tarr will stop by to let you know what he has planned and give a sample of what his program is all about.
    
All this, and the “predictably unpredictable” comedy of DWP, comes your way Tues. Feb. 14 at 7:30 p.m. Eastern, then 7:30 Pacific over--

Josh also tells what you can find in the ongoing series of DVD and CD releases coming from the vaults of the Kovacs/Adams Estate. Into the blues? KSAV.org will shortly debut a new program of music called “Eight to the Bar.” Show host Les Tarr will stop by to let you know what he has planned and give a sample of what his program is all about. All this, and the “predictably unpredictable” comedy of DWP, comes your way Tues. Feb. 14 at 7:30 p.m. Eastern, then 7:30 Pacific over-- www.KSAV.org</itunes:summary><feedburner:origLink>http://www.ksav.org</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Dwp/~5/6Yrft0r-wq8/DWP021412.mp3" length="90" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://www.audioentertainment.org/ksav/Programs/DWP021412.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

            <description>The Beach Boys, My Three Sons, and a Musical Mystery on the Next “Dave White Presents”!

While never an official Beach Boy himself, past Dino, Desi, and Billy member Billy Hinsche was part of their touring outfit as keyboardist, guitarist, and backing vocalist from the 1970s through the 1990s. Billy became part of the extended Wilson family when his sister Annie married Carl Wilson in February 1966. Currently, he’s Al Jardine’s musical director. Who could know the Beach Boys better?

On Tuesday, January 31, Billy Hinsche returns to online radio’s “Dave White Presents” to discuss his new DVD documentary, Carl Wilson—Then and Now. The film is an affectionate tribute to the late singer of hits like “Good Vibrations” and “God Only Knows.” Family members and fellow musicians remember Carl as the leader of the group when it was a touring unit and as a steadying force in a family struggling with rock and roll excesses. In his interview with Wes Britton, Billy shares what you can see and hear in his three-hour, two-disc film based on very exclusive and intimate insights into one of the greatest American bands of them all!
             
“I spent my entire life playing nerds.” So says Barry Livingston, most famous for playing Ernie Douglas on My Three Sons. In a lively conversation with Dave White, Barry talks about being a child star and how he joined a successful show starring his older brother Stanley who played his older brother Chip in the series. But his career didn’t end there—he played on Room 222, The Streets of San Francisco, Police Woman, and most recently in Zodiac, Two and a Half Men, and Mad Men.     His films include You Don't Mess with the Zohan and The Social Network. On DWP, he’ll share some great stories and tell you what’s in his 2011 memoir, The Importance of Being Ernie: From My Three Sons to Mad Men, a Hollywood Survivor Tells All! 

In the mid-70s, songwriter Eric Beam was a member of a Pittsburgh band called Felix Harp. Despite the fact the group released three albums, you never heard them because their record company never intended to sell them. Why not? One of Eric’s songs, “Shoes,” was re-recorded by singer Reparata after she left the Delrons. But, while climbing the charts and becoming an international hit, Polydor Records pulled it off the shelves. Why? To deepen the mystery, only last year did Eric learn their were four versions of his song recorded and released by bands in England, Germany, France, and Greece. We’ll dig into what happened, play you the Reparata classic and, for the first time anywhere, play you a medley of Eric’s song in three languages.

            <title>Dave White Presents</title>
            <description>Rose Marie, Mitch Ryder, and Jules Verne on the next Dave White Presents!
 Yes, for five years, Rose Marie was Sally Rogers on THE DICK VAN DYKE SHOW. But did you know the 88 year old singer/actress began her career in vaudeville as “Baby Rose Marie” back in 1926? Her extensive resume also includes co-starring on THE DORIS DAY SHOW and HOLLYWOOD SQUARES, not to mention guest appearances on everything from THE MONKEES to MURPHY BROWN!

 On Tues. Jan. 17, Rose Marie joins Dave White in a lively conversation with more stories than we can tease you with here. How about her having the brass to demand an $11.00 refund from gangster Bugsy Siegel? But that’s not all . . .

 “Devil With a Blue Dress On.” “Sock It To Me, Baby!” “C. C. Rider.” These were only a few of the hits from Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels during the 1960s. If that’s all you know about Mitch, then Wes Britton’s interview with the Detroit legend will tell you about Mitch’s 25 releases over the years, many only available in Europe.     Did you know Jimi Hendrix wanted Mitch to join him in a new band? Did you know Mitch just published his candid memoir, DEVILS AND BLUE DRESSES: MY WILD RIDE AS A ROCK LEGEND? Or that he has a new album coming in Feb. called THE PROMISE produced by Don Was? We’ll play you two selections and share some inside stories about what Mitch will be doing in 2012. But that’s not all either . . .

In our last broadcast, Brian Taves of the North American Jules Verne Society talked about a paperback series of Verne’s books now being translated into English for the first time.  What can you discover in these brand-new collections?  Expect some surprises in part two of this revealing look back at a father of science fiction . . .&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Dwp/~4/OYIoDPk0jho" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <description>Comedy with The Firesign Theatre, New Rock from Nils Lofgren, and Part 2 of John McAdams on the JFK Assassination on the Next Dave White Presents!

Don’t crush that dwarf, hand me the pliers! We’re all Bozos on this bus. Everything you know is wrong! Firesign Theatre fans know these phrases well as they were titles of very popular comedy albums of the ‘60s and ‘70s. As founding member David Ossman shares with Wes Britton on the Dec. 6 edition of DWP, the Firesign Theatre is alive and well and still kicking! Their latest project is the Shakespeare parody, ANYTHINGE YOU WANT TO, which is both an audio and literary endeavor. David has so much to share about the Firesigns then and now that this will be a two-part conversation, making our December shows very special indeed!

December 6 is also a big date for another DWP guest, guitarist, singer, and songwriter Nils Lofgren. Not only does Nils talk about his work with Neil Young, Ringo Starr, and his 25 years with Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band, he shares the inside story of his brand-new album, OLD SCHOOL, which will be released just hours before his appearance on DWP! We’ll play you two samples that demonstrate being “Old School” is still the best education in rock!

Proving once again that DWP puts the V in Variety, Dave White also offers part two of his very insightful conversation with Kennedy assassination expert, John McAdams. As with part one aired on our last broadcast, expect perspectives that might surprise you, even after all these years.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Dwp/~4/OYIoDPk0jho" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <description>Next Week’s “Dave White Presents” Serves Up Memories, Music, and Hope.

For The Drifters, he was the lead voice on songs like “Save the Last Dance for Me," “This Magic Moment," and "I Count the Tears." On his own, Ben E. King had hits like "Spanish Harlem" and “Stand by Me".”

On Tuesday, Nov. 22, Ben E. King will be the very special guest on “Dave White Presents.” Not only will he share musical memories with Wes Britton, Ben will discuss a current project he’s involved in, Pioneers For a Cure: the American Collection
Songs to Fight Cancer. Along with folks like Suzanne Vega, Tom Chapin, Randy Brecker, and Tom Verlaine, Ben E. King has leant his voice to this unique program helping to raise money for cancer research. We’ll play you a sample from this very worthy project and tell you how you can participate.

Next, we offer more musical memories with Jeff March and Marti Smiley Childs, co-authors of WHERE HAVE ALL THE POP STARS GONE? Volume One of this new series includes interviews with members of The Association, Kingston Trio, Zombies, Herman’s Hermits, The Spiral Staircase as well as Bobby Vee and Chris Montez. Jeff and Marti will go behind-the-scenes of this nostalgic romp and tell stories that wil surprise you!
     
Then, in a change of pace conversation, Dave White talks with scholar, author, and historian John McAdams about the Kennedy assassination that took place Nov. 22, 1963. Dave and John discuss why, almost 50 years later, many still think a mystery was never solved and why some think it never will. And why others are certain the case was closed convincingly a long, long time ago.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Dwp/~4/OYIoDPk0jho" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

And why others are certain the case was closed convincingly a long, long time ago.</itunes:summary><feedburner:origLink>http://www.ksav.org</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Dwp/~5/_r0pwefXkeI/DWP112211.mp3" length="90" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://www.audioentertainment.org/ksav/Programs/DWP112211.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item>

            <title>Dave White Presents</title>
            <description>“Along Comes Mary.” “Windy.” “Cherish.” "Never My Love"-- the second most broadcast song in the 20th century. The man who sang lead on these hits from The Association, Russ Giguere, is coming to the next edition of Dave White Presents! He’ll share the saga of this hard to categorize band and has some surprising stories to tell. Need we say more?
Author David J. Hogan discusses his book about Samuel, Moses and Jerome Horwitz and their friend Louis Feinstein.  If you don't know who these folks are tune in and find out.  If you do know who they are then tune in and find out more about them.
Finally, Beale Street blues and soul is featured in the words and music of Sandy Carroll, who has a hot new roots album out, JUST AS I AM. Produced by her husband, Grammy-winner Jim Gaines, this is a contemporary Memphis brew with old-fashioned grooves. We’ll play two samples to prove it.
All this, plus a new sponsor and the return of Dr. Ezekiel Hope with a brand new Moral Compass&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Dwp/~4/OYIoDPk0jho" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Dave White Presents</title>
            <description>When we say the stars come out for “Dave White Presents,” our next show really proves we mean it!

On Tues. Oct. 25, DWP celebrates The Kingston Trio with founding member Bob Shane. Without question, this group was one of the most influential ensembles in music history. We’ll explore why. Bob, long noted for his humor, is also a great story teller with more anecdotes than we could squeeze into a half-hour conversation. This means you’ll hear 30 minutes of some lively, engaging, and informative music history and surprises. Did you know the author of “Tom Dooley” was Tom Dooley himself?

Then, how about Clint Eastwood,  Garrison Keillor, Vince Gill, Emmylou Harris, Sheryl Crow, Brad Paisley, Ricky Skaggs, and Jimmy Buffett? All these performers joined producer Carl Jackson for a superb 2 CD set called MARK TWAIN: WORDS AND MUSIC. It’s the story of Samuel Langhorne Clemens told in words by Eastwood, Keillor, and Buffett along with a batch of new songs from a ton of Nashville stars. Carl Jackson joins Wes Britton to share how this project came to be. We’ll feature some of the words and of course some choice music!

We didn’t forget Hollywood as Dave White interviews PBS radio host Gene Arceri, author of BROOKLYN’S SCARLETT SUSAN HAYWARD: FIRE IN THE WIND. While she didn’t get the role of Ms. O’Hara in gone with the wind, there seems to have been a lot of Scarlett in an actress who went   on to have multiple Academy Award nominations for playing troubled women. We’ll take you behind the scenes of a story that mixed the bitter with the sweet.    

All this debuts next Tues. Oct. 25 at 7:30 p.m. Eastern, then 7:30 Pacific over—

On Wed. Oct. 26, the 90 minutes of variety entertainment will become available as a podcast, mp3 download, from itunes and through TEVO, or on the player at:

            <title>Dave White Presents</title>
            <description>It’s a Roots Music Fest when Maria Muldaur and Peter Daltry headline the next Dave White Presents!

Back in the early 1970s, Maria Muldaur hit the charts with songs like “Midnight at the Oasis,” “Three Dollar Bill, “and “Don’t You Feel My Leg.” This fall, after a series of acoustic roots albums, she gets electric, down-and-dirty, and soulful with her “Red -Hot Bluesiana band” playing on her new album, STEADY LOVE. It’s red hot alright with a New Orleans feel , and Maria tells you the full story about her past, present, and what STEADY Love offers in this very lively conversation with Wes Britton.    

Across the trans-Atlantic pond, back in the late 1960s, Peter Daltry was the main motor in the British band Kaleidoscope, a group often confused with the California outfit with the same name. Since then, while Daltry hasn’t toured in over 39 years, he has been putting out a stream of self-produced masterpieces. His new release hints at what he’s been doing--King of Thieves: The Best of Peter Daltry Volume 2 includes songs inspired by Celtic folk music, other tracks draw from late-‘60s psychedelia. Some melodies are simple tunes performed on guitar and piano, some are very layered and experimental indeed. We’ll play you two samples and perhaps you’ll wonder why Peter Daltry didn’t get on your radar screen before. We bet he will be now.

This edition of DWP will also include a batch of new comedy bits organized by Master of Ceremonies, Mr. Dave White himself! To say more would spoil the “predictably unpredictable” enjoyment you’ll hear Tues. oct. 11 at 7:30 p.m. Eastern, then 7:30 Pacific over—

            <description>What the world needs now is Jackie Deshannon and some legendary detectives!

On Sept. 27, online Radio’s “Dave White Presents” welcomes singer/songwriter Jackie Deshannon! She has a new album out, When You Walk in the Room, where  she re-visits songs that made her famous, both those she sang and those she wrote. “What the World Needs Now,” “Put a Little Love in Your Heart,” “Needles and Pins,” “Bette Davis Eyes,” and “When You Walk in the Room” are among the melodies we’ll discuss, both the original hits and her new interpretations. We’ll play two samples as well!

Then, Dave White talks with author Michael Hoey about his new book, Sherlock Holmes &amp; the Fabulous Faces - The Universal Pictures Repertory Company. Two of the faces are, of course, Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. But what about the 68 players whose names appeared in small print in the titles under the names of the stars?

Lastly, COLUMBO co-creator William Link returns to DWP in the second part of his interview remembering his friend, Peter Falk. In this anecdote fest, Link talks about what happens when a TV star wants to try his hand at directing with very comic results. What did the two men share after the end of the series?

            <description>TV and Movie Nostalgia on Next Week’s “Dave White Presents”!

On Tues. Sept. 13, the very gracious Patty Duke talks with Wes Britton about her life both on and off-screen beginning with her work as a child star. We go behind the scenes of THE PATTY DUKE SHOW, talk about her favorite TV movies, and her long-time involvement with THE MIRACLE WORKER. (She’s played both Helen Keller and Ann Sullivan and, this year, directed a stage production.) We also discuss the future—this fall, she’ll be seen in episodes of THE PROTECTOR and HAWAII 5-O and appear at the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention.

Next, Dave White talks with Peter Ford, son of Glenn Ford and Eleanor Powell. Peter grew up knowing them all—his personal swimming coach was Johnny Weissmuller. Rock fans owe Peter a huge debt—for his father’s 1955 film, Blackboard jungle, Peter suggested “Rock Around the Clock” for the theme—ushering in the rock and roll revolution. (He had a minor hit of his own, “Blue Ribbons,” written by upcoming DWP guest Jackie Deshannon.) So Peter has many stories to tell about growing up in Hollywood in a very famous family.

Finally, COLUMBO co-creator William Link returns to DWP, this time to remember his friend, Peter Falk who died this June. We’ll be celebrating Peter just three days before his birthday (Sept. 16, 1927) in part 1 of a two-part discussion of Falk on screen, off, his one attempt at directing television, and his notable achievements in art.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Dwp/~4/OYIoDPk0jho" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Dave White Presents SPECIAL</title>
            <description>At 7:30 p.m.  PDT, 10:30 EDT, Paul Bishop and Mary Hanlon Stone, co-stars of Bertram Van Munster and Jerry Bruckheimer’sTake The Money And Run, will join co-hosts Dave White and Wes Britton to discuss their hit ABC reality series. During the 90 minute broadcast, aired on KSAV.org, listeners will be encouraged to call in or E-mail their own questions for the interrogators.

            <title>Dave White Presents</title>
            <description>The Aug. 30 edition of “Dave White Presents” offers a fictional sexy masked vigilante, a real Hollywood temptress, and classic folk/rock!

back in 1965, We Five had a Top 10 hit with “You Were On My Mind.” Then and now, the main motor of We Five is Jerry Bergan, and he has a brand-new solo album out on Global Recording Artists. REFLECTIONS, SONGS, AND STORIES is a disc that should grab lovers of the Kingston Trio, Peter, Paul, and Mary and of course We Five. One track, “Young Man Go Your Own Way,” was intended for release along with “You Were On My Mind,” but it took 40 years for it to be recorded. We’ll play it for you on DWP!

Then, former 007 continuation novelist Raymond Benson returns to DWP, but this time around, he has a new character to talk about—THE BLACK STILETTO. She’s a mysterious costumed figure who battled crime in New York City back in the 1950s but disappeared without a trace. Who was she, where is she now, and what did she do to become such a legend? What happens when a gangster she put away 50 years ago is released and comes looking for revenge? 

Speaking of sexy ladies, voluptuous singer/actress Linda Lawson had a distinguished career working with the likes of Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Henry Fonda, Audie Murphy, and Dennis Hopper in films like the cult classic, NIGHT TIDE (1961). She appeared in TV series like PERRY MASON, SEA HUNT, MAVERICK, THE VIRGINIAN, ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS and ER. She has many stories to share about the folks she knew very well indeed, and you’ll hear them on the next DWP!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Dwp/~4/OYIoDPk0jho" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Dave White Presents</title>
            <description>When we began contacting old friends to join us for the 3rd Anniversary Special for “Dave White Presents,” we had no idea just how special the show would become!

Back in Aug. 2008, our very first guest was 007 guitarist Vic Flick. Yep, the guy who played the original James Bond theme and performed on hit records for everyone from Peter and Gordon to Petula Clark to the soundtrack of A HARD DAY’S NIGHT. A few months later, DWP’s most popular guest to date talked with Wes Britton about his starring role in ON HER MAJESTY’S SECRET SERVICE—James Bond himself, George Lazenby.

On Aug. 16, 2011, Vic Flick and George Lazenby will appear together for the first time anywhere on our anniversary show. It’s quite a ride! In fact, the conversation quickly becomes the “Vic Flick interviews George Lazenby” feature with these two gents swapping memories, anecdotes, stories and jokes. No Bond fan should miss this one!

Another guest on our debut broadcast in 2008 was crime novelist Paul Bishop.        He returned to DWP on our last show to plug his new co-starring role on the hit ABC series, TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN. But we also wanted him for this historic reunion, so he’s coming back again and will talk with Dave White about his latest thrillers. (TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN airs Tuesdays at 9:00 EST, right after DWP!)

Still another DWP alum, Bill Mumy, will be joining us for the third time! Our first conversation covered it all—his role as Will Robinson on LOST IN SPACE, his work on BABYLON 5 and STAR TREK, his comedy music with Barnes and Barnes, and his then brand-new CD, CARNIVAL SKY.   He later stopped by for one edition of “Britton’s Beat” to showcase his blues album, GLORIOUS IN DEFEAT. Well, he has new music to talk about once again, and it’s “real good stuff.” Find out why--

And, what would a DWP outing be without comedy music? Dave White brings back Tom Blackwell, a parody songwriter and co-founder of the FUMP (Funny Music Project). Tom has now recorded 500 parody tunes and currently is the mastermind of “Devo Spice.” Called "the red-headed stepson of Weird Al Yankovic and Eminem," Tom has been a popular contributor to Dr. Demento.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Dwp/~4/OYIoDPk0jho" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Dave White Presents</title>
            <description>On Tues. Aug 2, a new series from Jerry Bruckheimer will premiere on ABC called TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN. It’s “real people vs. real detectives” in which contestants are given a briefcase full of cash, time to hide it, and then are “arrested” by cops looking for the loot.   If the detectives find the cash, they keep it. If they don’t, the “real people” do. 

Well, one of the stars is an old friend of DWP—police officer and crime novelist Paul Bishop. In fact, he talked about his books on our very first show back in Aug. 2008.  This time around, we’ll do a two-parter with Paul—part 1 focusing on his acting debut which will air on ABC television immediately after the broadcast of DWP!  Can’t be more up-to-the-minute than that—

Then, Wes Britton talks with the legendary music producer Kim Fowley. Yep, the guy who produced “They’re Coming to Take Me Away” for Napoleon XIV and was the mastermind behind The Runaways—a story told in a 2010 biopic with Michael Shannon playing Fowley.
 
This year, Fowley collaborated with ex-Byrds axeman John York to create a new type of “audiobook”—WEST COAST REVELATION. It’s a collection of driving folk/rock tunes by York and Fowley interspersed with conversations between the two about the glory days on the West Coast during the 1960s. We’ll play you two samples from a very hot disc for the summer—

In 1951, after working with the likes of Abbott and Costello, actor Billie Gray co-starred in the SF classic, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  But he’s best known for playing “Bud” Anderson from 1954-1960 in 193 episodes of FATHER KNOWS BEST with Robert Young and Jane Wyatt. He kept working until it all ended—back in the days when a pot bust could end a career.

For DWP, Bill talks about his times on the large and small screen and about his upcoming appearance (Sept. 22-24) at the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention where he’ll re-unite with FATHER KNOWS BEST co-star, Lauren Chapin. (Davy Jones, Patty Duke, and Karen Valentine will also be there.)
  
Last but not least, we get into literature with Jack Salem, author of Pausing For a Backward Glance: A work of historical fiction. It’s a complex novel about a B-movie screenwriter in 1950 enthralled with French history before she’s hauled before the House Un-American Activities Committee in Hollywood. Just in time for your summer reading--&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Dwp/~4/OYIoDPk0jho" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

June 21, “Dave White Presents” features Elvin Bishop who’s most famous for his time with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, his 1975 FM anthem “Travelin’ Shoes,” and his 1976 hit “Fooled Around and Fell in Love.” He has a brand-new CD to plug, The Raising Hell Review, and we’ll play you a sample in between Elvin’s stories of the past, present, and upcoming projects. Yep, he’s still raising hell alright . . .
 
We’ll also share new music from Patrick Campbell-Lyons, a past DWP guest who talked about his days with the 1960s psychedelic band, Nirvana, on our April 13, 2010 show. This time around, Patrick shares what’s going on with his new release from GRA Records called The 13 Dalis. And we’ll offer comedy music as well with insights into stand-up routines from a Dave White personal favorite, comic Rick Cormier.

All this and the usual unusual “predictably unpredictable” humor of DWP debuts Tues. June 21 at 7:30 p.m. Eastern, then 7:30 Pacific over—

            <description>Dr. Who, Super Spies, and Hot New Music coming on the next Dave White Presents!

On Tues. May 10, hop in the Tardis and travel in time and space with Don Krouskop, author of the hot-off-the press Dr. Who trivia book—The Wibbly-Wobbly, Timey-Wimey Trivia Guide. He’ll talk about the Doctor then, now, and what’s coming—lively fun for all fans and those who haven’t yet discovered this 47 year old phenomena.

Then, we go behind the scenes of making spy spoofs with stunt co-coordinator, fight choreographer, writer, and film maker Scott Rhodes. He will be discussing his comedy short "Super Seven: Triple Cross," a parody of all those action films of the 1960s and 1970s. He’ll also chat about what makes for good movie stunts and what’s wrong with what Hollywood is doing these days.

Music Maestro Wes Britton then talks with Richard X. Heyman, a songwriter and Power Pop performer with an impressive new, two CD set called “Tiers/ And Other Stories.” Richard talks about his years working with Brian Wilson, Link (“Rumble”) Wray, Peter Noone of Herman’s Hermits, his band The Doughboys, and how the over two hours of “Tiers” came out on one generous new release. We’ll play two samples to whet your appetite.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Dwp/~4/OYIoDPk0jho" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <title>Dave White Presents</title>
            <description>On April 26, Dave White Presents returns with more Variety with a capital V!

First up, film maker Steve Keyser talks about his limited edition 3 DVD set commemorating the life and legacy of the late, legendary guitarist for Quicksilver Messenger Service, John Cipollina.   Recoil is a collector’s item indispensible for fans of the San Francisco sound, and Steve will go behind-the-scenes to tell the story of this impressive rock-umentary with interviews from everyone from Jerry Garcia to Paul Kantner.
 
Then, Dave White chats with Rory Leighton Aronsky on his book, What If They Lived? It’s a fascinating look into what might have happened if stars like Fatty Arbuckle, John Garfield, James Dean, Marilyn Monroe, and Heath Ledger had not died. Some interesting speculations . . . 

Next, we get into the music business from a new angle with Roy Kohn, author of the memoir Songplugger: Or, How Much is That Doggie in the Window? Roy shares his memories of being a “songplugger” back in the days when sheet music was the mainstay of the business, then through payola and radio play, and his working with everyone from Al Jolson, Patti Page, Ray Charles, and Donovan Leitch. We promise you’ll learn about a side of the industry you’ve heard no where else!

Don’t forget—you can now hear KSAV on your smartphone using the TuneIn app—
