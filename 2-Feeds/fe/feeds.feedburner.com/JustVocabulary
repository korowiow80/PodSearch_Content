			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>INDIGENT (adjective)<br />
</strong>extremely poor, Experiencing want or need; impoverished, lacking the necessities of life, e.g. food, clothing, and shelter</p>
<p><strong>Synonyms:</strong> destitute, impoverished, needy</p>
<p><strong>Antonyms:</strong> affluent, wealthy</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> Indigent is derived from the Latin indigere, literally meaning “to lack in,” which comes from egere, “to need.” Indigent is used to describe a person or group of people who are so poor they can&#8217;t help themselves and need the help and support of others.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:<br />
</strong>- The United Nations has a history of helping indigent countries through humanitarian and economic programs.<br />
- Those who are indigent can often receive help at their local shelter.<br />
- The charity was formed to help feed the indigent people starving in Africa.<br />
- The once-indigent young man worked his way from living on the streets to being one of the most affluent people in the community.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SAVORY (adjective)<br />
</strong>1. pleasant to taste or smell; 2. salty or sharp-tasting rather than sweet 3. respectable and socially acceptable</p>
<p><strong>Synonyms:</strong> pleasing, tasty, delectable, delicious, scrumptious, palatable, respectable</p>
<p><strong>Antonyms:</strong> inedible, disgusting, yucky</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong> The related verb, to savor, means &#8220;to greatly enjoy and fully appreciate.&#8221; Savory foods are ones you want to savor. Something that is sweet and savory is sweet and spicy or salty. Some people like to dip their bacon into their maple syrup because they enjoy the sweet and savory combination.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:<br />
</strong>All the dishes at the party were savory; I couldn&#8217;t pick just one favorite.<br />
After his arrest for embezzlement, his reputation became anything but savory.<br />
The dinner was so delicious I savored every bite.<br />
The combination of cheese and apples made for a sweet and savory flavor.</p>

Synonyms: pure, clean, unsullied, untarnished, perfect<br />

Examples:<br />
- John bought the landrover because it was in pristine condition.<br />
- Because of his pristine credit, John was pre-approved for car finance.<br />
- The once-pristine mountainside is now covered with hotels and cabins.<br />
- Margo’s house was always in pristine condition, and she hated to have company in fear of creating a mess.</p>
