Laurie is a truly inspiring person who has dedicated her professional life to the education of youths over the last 30 years.</p>
<p>She co-founded Chat The Planet and has gained national acclaim with features on CNN and MTV. In our talk she details how Chat is using ground-breaking technology to link young people in Baghdad and the States, and how these connections are enabling the human element to shine through and trump all prejudice, war and terror:<br />
<strong><br />
</strong><strong><a href="http://www.wethechange.com/podcast/Chat_Planet.mp3" title="Laurie Meadoff Interview">Laurie Meadoff Interview </a></strong></p>
<p>Technology is certainly making our world smaller, and when used in this manner it inspires me greatly. I was speaking with another colleague who hails the internet (or what I like to call “the great web of interconnectedness) as a manifestation of the light of consciousness itself.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>I think we have a ways to go before we realize the true possibilities of the internet and technology. When we look on the web, we still see so much propaganda, gossip and nonsense. Organizations like Chat are changing things and making us realize the potential.</p>
<p>I will continue to broadcast a <a target="_blank" href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/WeTheChangePodcast">Conversation for Change </a>every other Wednesday. There are SO many people and groups doing wonderful work that I feel I would be doing a disservice by not providing as much information as I can. We The Change does not mean “Todd Goldfarb knows everything and you should listen to him”.</p>
<p>No, the goal is to be a platform for change and spread awareness. The goal is to act as a spark in your life and help you realize that the time for real changes, transcending changes, is upon us. The goal is to provide tools that increase your consciousness, and when you listen to Laurie it is hard <em>not</em> to feel the increased vibrational frequency of intention on her voice. Enjoy it!<br />

Recommended Books</strong></p>
<p>OK, now its time to get off my butt and make some solid book recommendations that will motivate you. And I have some good ones, some real good ones:</p>
<p>1. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0452011876?tag=wethch-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0452011876&amp;adid=0XNCYWJ2ZAF5DTGPJT6Y&amp;">Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand</a></p>
<p>Quite simply one of my favorite books of ALL time, and those of you yet to read Ayn Rand’s work simply must pick Atlas up.</p>
<p>Ayn was way ahead of her time, and she describes humanity’s deepest problems so beautifully with metaphor that it is almost impossible not to be drawn into her stories. This book hits all the right chords in terms of the non-sustainable ways of humanity and offers wonderful hope and insight.</p>
<p>Yes, the book is long. Make it a month-long read and really get into it. I actually can’t believe I have not recommended this book yet, it eloquently states We The Change from the perspective of early 1900’s. Enjoy!</p>
<p>2. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0385262183?tag=wethch-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0385262183&amp;adid=16JHF5WRWPQJ43F4NGZ8&amp;">A Gradual Awakening, Stephen Levine</a></p>
<p>Well before Eckhart Tolle was around, Stephen Levine published this wonderful work on meditation and finding internal purpose.</p>
<p>I actually just finished reading the text, and it is one of the best books on inner awareness I have come across. It is told beautifully with personal insights and transparency.</p>
<p>Believe me, it is hard to write about the things Mr. Levine talks about: the true nature of the mind, the genesis of thought, and ultimate surrender. Pick this one up, it is fantastic!</p>
<p>3. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1585425923?tag=wethch-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=1585425923&amp;adid=0392BAWJXV7BWCQRSB6M&amp;">2012 The Return of Quetzalcoatl, Daniel Pinchbeck</a></p>
<p>For those of you who are more adventurous, give this extraordinary tale a whirl. Wow! Told with so much history, mysticism and depth this book is one of those you read and wonder “how the heck did the author find all this information and think of this”!</p>
<p>Yes, it talks about the 2012 prophecy, but from a myriad of different and controversial angles. If you are intrigued by 2012, this is a MUST read.</p>
<p>There you have it, 3 great books and a terrific podcast. Not bad for a Wednesday, huh? As always let me know what you think!</p>

-<em>Zig Ziglar</em></p>
<p>How do you define success, and what methods do you follow to achieve it? In today’s article I explore the mysterious nature of success, and provide a few excellent tools for having it manifest in your life more readily.</p>
<p><strong>Secret to Success Podcast</strong></p>
<p>First, please listen to an amazing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wethechange.com/podcast/Steve_Little.mp3">podcast interview I did with Steve Little</a>. Steve is one of the most successful people I have ever encountered and you will be inspired to hear his philosophy:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wethechange.com/podcast/Steve_Little.mp3" title="Steve Little Interview">Steve Little Interview </a></p>
<p>Because he has enjoyed a very lucrative career in the software business over the last 20 years, Steve shares with us some of his secrets for attaining financial success.</p>
<p>He is also a champion athlete and bodybuilder and has created a health, wellness, and fitness business that services everyone from overweight executives to competitive athletes.</p>
<p>If this wasn’t enough, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.championsuccess.com">Steve </a>is also an accomplished artist, musician, author and family man!  Don&#8217;t you ever wonder how someone like Steve is able to accomplish so much? </p>
<p>I know I do, and if you have not caught an episode of &#8220;Conversations to Change the World&#8221;, this is a great one to hear.</p>
<p><strong>Success is a Present-Moment Thing</strong></p>
<p>Success is an ever-evolving phenomenon in our lives that each person judges differently. One individual’s version of achievement is not necessarily another’s.</p>
<p>We must also be aware that the experience of success shifts periodically within our <em>own</em> lives. What makes you feel accomplished at this present moment may mean nothing 10 years from now.</p>
<p>It is easier to understand this by analyzing what your greatest ambitions were in the past. More often than not, how you defined success during your college years is a whole lot different than how you define it mid-career.</p>
<p>This realization is actually very freeing, and ignites awareness that the only thing that really matters is your <em>present moment</em> concept. ‘Success’ is just a word, a fleeting perception that has no universal meaning.</p>
<p>So when gauging your success in life, there is no need to look behind or ahead. Instead, look right here, right now and bring your attention to your current situation.</p>
<p><strong>Success Magazine Re-launch</strong></p>
<p>With all this said about success…it is still necessary to go for it! Once you become present to the things that make you feel fulfilled, action is required to make them a reality in your life. To use another fantastic quote:</p>
<p>&#8220;The person who gets the farthest is generally the one who is willing to do and dare. The sure-thing boat never gets far from shore.&#8221;<br />
–<em>Dale Carnegie</em></p>
<p>I decided to write this article to coincide with the recent re-launch of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.successmagazine.com">Success Magazine</a>! Success is a fantastic platform that solely focuses its content on all aspects of achievement.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you checking it out, and they have chosen their ultimate <a target="_blank" href="http://www.successmagazine.com/article?articleId=141&amp;taxonomyId=15">list of the 25 must-read books </a>for achievers. I have read most of these…all great stuff!</p>
<p>Woody Allen is quoted as saying &#8220;seventy percent of success in life is showing up&#8221;, and I whole-heartedly agree with the sentiment. You have to be in the ballgame in order to get a hit!</p>
<p>So get yourself into the game and listen to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wethechange.com/podcast/Steve_Little.mp3">Steve Little Podcast </a>and check out Success Magazine! I look forward to hearing your comments.</p>
<p>Lastly, please visit Steve&#8217;s wonderful coaching website at <a target="_blank" href="http://championsuccess.com">Champion&#8217;s Success</a>. </p>

<p>Sometimes this reality scares me (as it does many people) but my fear quickly turns to hope as I realize there is a whole movement of people, organizations, websites, etc. that are working diligently to create a more sustainable and peaceful future for all of us.</p>
<p>The emergence of the internet is playing a huge role in this shift in awareness, and today’s post provides a few excellent examples of how the ‘world wide web’ is becoming the world wide “lets band together and save ourselves”:</p>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldwidetippingpoint.com">Worldwide Tipping Point</a> Launches (<em>And a Favor From YOU</em>)!</strong></p>
<p>You will notice on the top left of We The Change a new widget (image), which says <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldwidetippingpoint.com">Worldwide Tipping Point</a>:<br />
<iframe height="82" scrolling="no" width="131" frameBorder="0" src="http://worldwidetippingpoint.com/count.php" style="width: 130px; height: 82px"></iframe></p>
<p>This website recently launched, and it is nothing more than an aggregator (and counter) of people who wish to see the types of cultural changes I mention above take place. The concept is straightforward, and serves as a very simple umbrella-like tool which quantifies the larger movement.</p>
<p>Since I do some work for the group which came up with this concept I would really, really appreciate it if all readers of We The Change could take 2 minutes and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldwidetippingpoint.com">sign on to the counter</a>. It is free, easy, and the only thing you will receive is one email every month from the site.</p>
<p>This is the first favor I am asking of readers…and hope you guys can take a moment and check out the site.</p>
<p>One of the great features of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldwidetippingpoint.com">Worldwide Tipping Point</a> is the ability for any website owner to put the counter on their site (like I did). So if you have a blog or site, and believe in this movement, throw it up there. I believe the counter updates the number every 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Today’s Podcast: <em>Gaia Director Siona</em></strong></p>
<p>In today’s podcast, I interview Siona van Dijk who is one of the directors of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gaia.com/community">Gaia Community </a>(formerly Zaadz.com), one of the largest conscious social networking platforms on the internet. You can hear the pod here:</p>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wethechange.com/podcast/Siona.mp3">Interview with Siona Van Dijk</a></strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gaia.com/community">Gaia </a>is one of the leading organizations in the “new earth”. The community is 100% mission driven and has a membership of over 150,000 people who are passionate about making positive changes in the world.</p>
<p>I have been a member for over a year and have made some meaningful connections with like-minded people. When used in this realm, the internet becomes truly, truly amazing.</p>
<p>Speaking with Siona was inspiring. After hearing our talk you will feel encouraged that there are hundreds of thousands (and millions more) of people out there who are working hard to make the world a better place. I hope you enjoy the interview.</p>
<p>You can also find my podcast, and subscribe to it, on i-tunes.  Do a keyword search &#8220;we the change&#8221; and you will find it!</p>
<p>As I say on my home page, We ARE The Change…so I hope you have the chance to join both Worldwide Tipping Point and the Gaia Community. </p>

Do you wish for a better life, but are too scared to take a risk? Are you stuck, and do you procrastinate?</p>
<p>If any of these sentiments ring true for you, then listen to today&#8217;s podcast. I interview one of the most impressive women I have met in some time: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.daylle.com">Daylle Deanna Schwartz</a>.</p>
<p><img align="left" width="105" src="http://www.wethechange.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/photocropped.jpg" alt="photocropped.jpg" height="130" style="width: 105px; height: 130px" title="photocropped.jpg" />Once a typical school teacher, Daylle accepted a challenge from her students to create a rap record. She hates stereotypes, and it bothered her when the kids told her that a white woman could never be a successful rapper.</p>
<p>So she set out to prove them wrong, and taught herself the skill. In no time she became known as the &#8220;rappin teach&#8221;, and her life would be changed forever:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.wethechange.com/podcast/Daylle.mp3">Daylle Deanna Schwartz Interview</a></strong><strong>Daylle’s story is one of true inspiration, and she is an excellent example of how anything is possible once you have belief and passion.</p>
<p></strong>The interview takes you through her incredible ride starting a record label, becoming a best selling author, appearing on Oprah and Howard Stern, and eventual her journey into the world of self-empowerment. And yes, you will also hear her rap a bit!</p>
<p>In all, I found Daylle&#8217;s stories highly motivational for my own life. I know I can make this blog as big and meaningful as I dream, for example, and can attract anyone I want to interview on my podcast &#8220;Conversations to Change the World&#8221;.</p>
<p>Creating the ideal life for yourself is worth the risk! I hope you find Daylle’s experiences as meaningful as I do.</p>
<p>I also highly recommend you check out Daylle&#8217;s blog <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lessonsfromarecoveringdoormat.com"><strong>Lessons From a Recovering Doormat </strong></a>where she talks about her experiences and gives advice.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday, we did the first show with best-selling author <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wethechange.com/podcast/guyfinley.mp3">Guy Finley </a>and it went great. So much so, that i-tunes has accepted my podcast!</p>
<p>This is fantastic news, and also means that you can now subscribe to the pods (can you tell I am excited about this)!</p>
<p>In today’s episode I interview Jeff McIntire-Strasburg, senior editor for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.greenoptions.com">Green Options</a> and the author of the popular <a target="_blank" href="http://sustainablog.org">Sustainablog</a>.</p>
<p>Jeff was thoughtful enough to spend some time and explain the latest developments in the Green Revolution, and share his wealth of knowledge regarding everything environment:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wethechange.com/podcast/Strasburg.mp3"><strong>Jeff McIntire-Strasburg Interview</strong></a></p>
<p>I ask Jeff straight out whether the issue has lost momentum since An Inconvenient Truth spawned mass interest. You may be surprised to hear his answer (and I learned of a new term: “Green Fatigue”).</p>
<p>We also talked at length about alternative energy sources, and how viable things like nuclear energy might be for long term solutions.</p>
<p>The most enlightening part to the conversation, at least to me, comes when I ask Jeff about green cars. Listen in to hear about the future of driving!</p>
<p><strong>Why ‘Conversations to Change The World’</strong></p>
<p>If you did not see my first post regarding the podcast launch, let me re-state my intention:</p>
<p>Every Wednesday I will interview top thought leaders across the mind-body-spirit continuum with the sole purpose to spread awareness of all the positive activities occurring in our world today!</p>
<p>Furthermore (and I say this with a big smile), <em>my intention is to become the Larry King of the blogosphere and help initiate transcending changes</em>. Hey, I dream big <img src='http://www.wethechange.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>There are already several subscribers to this Podcast (somewhat surprisingly) and I really appreciate all the support of We The Change readers. You guys are awesome!</p>
<p><strong>New Monthly Books</strong></p>
<p>I am recommending three new books for the next 30 days. I highly recommend you checking out the following texts. They have all been highly impactful in my life, and will almost assuredly serve as a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wethechange.com/4-pillars-of-effective-personal-growth/">meaningful pillar in your personal growth</a>:</p>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0874777984?tag=wethch-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0874777984&amp;adid=0XFQQWK7TAX52FQWD9ZP&amp;">The Self Aware Universe: How Consciousness Creates The Material World</a></strong></p>
<p>Wow, wow and wow. Written by Amit Goswani, PhD, this book explores why nothing in the universe seems to exist without consciousness. This book gave me a whole new perspective of the old proverb “if a tree falls in the woods, and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound”?</p>
<p>If you are at all “into” consciousness and spirituality, and how it relates to modern science, then this is a must read!</p>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0452289963?tag=wethch-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0452289963&amp;adid=0BV4JP3849F1DDPN85MN&amp;">A New Earth: Awakening To Your Life’s Purpose</a></strong></p>
<p>Last month I recommended Eckhart Tolle’s first book, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1577314808?tag=wethch-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=1577314808&amp;adid=10959JRCV2MPEYSEEYCW&amp;">The Power of Now</a>, and now I am recommending his latest text.</p>
<p>I am well aware that Oprah has recently praised this book, and that she is holding online seminars with Mr. Tolle to discuss this book’s implications…and I think this is fantastic!</p>
<p>Oprah seems to be a very spiritual person, and she is bringing this kind of content to the mainstream…and that is great news. Give this book a read through, you will not look at life the same way.</p>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/072253955X?tag=wethch-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=072253955X&amp;adid=1EQW43GF492E28V1ZF4K&amp;">The Book of Wisdom</a></strong></p>
<p>Have you ever read any of the Dalai Lama’s books? They are incredibly inspiring, and are littered with ancient knowledge as told by a modern scholar.</p>
<p>It is almost as if you get the collective knowledge of all previous Dalai Lama’s in his books. I found The Book of Wisdom to be one of this best…so give it a read!</p>
<p>That’s all for now my friends. I hope you have the chance to subscribe to my podcast, and feel free to email or comment on anything that is going on at We The Change…</p>

Today is the launch of We The Change&#8217;s podcast, which I am calling &#8220;Conversations to Change The World&#8221;!</p>
<p><strong>Each Wednesday</strong> I will interview one expert from somewhere across the mind-body-spirit continuum and pick their brain. The goal is pretty straight-forward: to spread greater awareness of all the fantastic people and organizations which are doing meaningful work to improve people&#8217;s lives and make the word a better place!</p>
<p>Today I have with me Guy Finley, best-selling author of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.beunstoppable.org/?refsrc=CD818">The Secret of Letting Go</a> and more than 30 other books and audio albums that have sold over a million copies in 16 languages worldwide.</p>
<p>I loved speaking with Guy because he has a flair for entertainment (his father was Larry Finley, late night TV pioneer) and his message is clear and concise. In today&#8217;s show, Guy provides us with two prime elements for maintaining long-term happiness&#8230;here is the link to the pod:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wethechange.com/podcast/GuyFinley.mp3"><strong>Guy Finley Interview</strong></a></p>
<p><img align="left" width="79" src="http://www.wethechange.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/guy-redshirt-icon.thumbnail.jpg" alt="guy-redshirt-icon.jpg" height="95" style="width: 79px; height: 95px" title="guy-redshirt-icon.jpg" />Guy has been a guest on over 400 television and radio shows, including national appearances on ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, NPR, Wisdom Network, and many others&#8230;so its a real pleasure to have him here.</p>
<p><strong>   </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why a Podcast!</strong></p>
<p>The spark for creating this podcast came to me upon the following realization: I am only one guy! Because my intention for this website is to be a platform for change, it makes a whole lot of sense to enlist the knowledge of outside experts.</p>
<p>My goal is to have the podcasts serve as a learning experience for all the readers of this blog. My ultimate objective is the following:</p>
<p><em>To become the Larry King of the blogosphere, where only positive improvement methods are explored.</em></p>
<p>I simply have no interest in interviewing people unless they are involved with bringing sustainable and helpful solutions into the world. AND, isn&#8217;t it time to have a &#8220;talk show&#8221; that <em>only</em> discusses all of the positive things going on all over the globe?</p>
<p><strong>Next Week&#8217;s Show</strong></p>
<p>Next Wednesday we have a real treat. I will interview Jeff McIntire-Strasburg, Senior Editor and Content Director at Green Options. He&#8217;s also the writer/publisher of <a href="http://sustainablog.org/"><font color="#137a98">sustainablog</font></a>, and a former writer at <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/"><font color="#137a98">Treehugger</font></a>.</p>
<p>You may be shocked, and excited, to hear some of the environmentally sound products currently being developed (someone say electric cars&#8230;)?</p>
<p>Starting next week these pods will be available on i-tunes, where you will be able to subscribe to the show download episodes onto your i-pod. Since this is my first pod, I have to wait for i-tunes to approve the podcast.</p>
<p>Again, here is the link to my interview with Guy Finley&#8230;Enjoy!</p>
