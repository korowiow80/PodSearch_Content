        <description>&amp;nbsp;The Downs FM is an exciting ICT project, which is run by children at our school. The team produce a podcast, which is broadcast to other children at school, and to others around the world, containing a fantastic mix of music, news, chat, messages, competitions and much more.You can listen to the shows online, or subscribe to our podcast using&amp;nbsp;RSS&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;iTunes.We get lots of questions from our listeners, who want to find out more about our shows, so we’ve tried to answer most of these questions here.What equipment do we use?    Most of the show is created using an Apple Macbook. This runs most of the software, and our team learn how to use it really quickly. We connect a USB microphone into this laptop so that our listeners can hear us!    We also use PCs (and our interactive whiteboard) to do our research, to find podsafe music, and to write scripts.    We use an iPod and an iRiver to record features of the show in advance, or when we’re out and about “on location”.Which software do we use?    iTunes - This is one of the most important programs, as it collects all of the audio which we use in each show. We set up a special playlist, and put all of the audio needed for each show into it. iTunes also downloads the audio which we have recorded on the iPod.    Garageband - We like using Garageband! We use Garageband to record our podcast. It’s really easy. We also use it to record the jingles which you hear on the show. These are used to introduce different parts of the show, and to remind listeners to send us an email, or visit our website.Which websites do we use?    The Podsafe Music Network - This site has a huge collection of wonderful music, which we can use in our shows. We’re not allowed to use commercial music, so we have to use special music which the artists allow podcasters to use in their shows. Our team browse through the collection, and download the tracks which we would like to use on The Downs FM. Once we’ve played a track, we also use the site to let the artists know that we’ve played their song. Sometimes they send us a nice email back saying “Thanks!”    BBC Newsround - The Newsround team have kindly allowed us to use some of their news articles in our shows. We find suitable pieces of news to broadcast, and then record this with the iPod to play in the show later.    Feedburner - We use Feedburner for our podcast feed. Those people who subscribe to our show, use our Feedburner feed to download the latest shows automatically. Feedburner then tell us how many subscribers we have, and tell us a little more about the software they’re using.Who is involved? What are our jobs?The Downs FM consists of a team of children who are responsible for the show. The main team decide what goes into each show. They then ask other children to record features, prepare scripts, or present the show. Our teacher, Mr. Warner then puts our shows online and updates our website for us.How do we make the shows?We begin each week by deciding what we’re going to put into each show, and organising who is going to make the different parts of it. Some of us might find and record jokes, others might research and record a news article, whilst another group might prepare and record an interview with a member of staff, or with a special guest.When we’re ready, our computer experts and DJs sit down to record the show. We open Garageband and get everything ready to record. We record each show as carefully as we can, adding in the jingles, clips and features which we recorded earlier. Sometimes we make mistakes, but we can usually record small sections again. Mr. Warner then puts the shows onto our website, and updates our podcast feed.When do we make the shows?It’s really difficult trying to make The Downs FM in our usual lesson time because there are so many children in the class, and it’s not very easy giving them all a job to do. So, we usually prepare for our shows during our lunchtimes. Sometimes we record the show in front of our class, as this gives us an audience (who can also get involved in the show), but that makes things a little more nerve-wracking!We try to record a show regularly, but this isn’t always possible. School is a very busy place, and there are sometimes other things which take up our time instead!What do we learn by doing this?Our teacher says that we learn the following things:    “Literacy skills&amp;nbsp;- although each show only lasts about 15 minutes, many hours of work go into the preparation and production of The Downs FM. The children have to research jokes, news articles and other features. They also have to think of questions to ask their interviewees, as well as writing the scripts for each show. This covers a huge range of literacy objectives.    Speaking and listening skills&amp;nbsp;- presenting a podcast requires the development of clear speaking skills. The children are aware that their voices will be broadcast to a huge number people around the world, and listen to other podcasters to discover the best ways to use their voices. As they gain experience, it is always possible to see their skills and confidence develop.    ICT skills&amp;nbsp;- I never fail to be impressed with how quickly the children learn these new and incredibly sophisticated ICT skills. They become confident and incredibly proficient at using a wide variety of equipment and software within a short space of time. The entire show is genuinely created by the children. As the teacher, I do very basic editing of the show once it has been recorded, and then distribute it via our website and podcast feed.    Team work skills&amp;nbsp;- A project like this requires a considerable team effort. The children all need to work closely together to create an entertaining podcast in a short space of time.    Confidence and Dedication&amp;nbsp;- The children who work on The Downs FM are all volunteers. They are all incredibly motivated young people, who give up their own free time to work on the project. As a result of their efforts, their confidence develops considerably. They all become increasingly valued and recognised members of our school community, and their dedication to the project always amazes me.”But, we just think that making The Downs FM is great fun!</description>
