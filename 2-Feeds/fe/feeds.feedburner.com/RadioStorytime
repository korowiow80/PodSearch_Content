			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Stair lifts come in all shapes and sizes, as <a href="http://thecci.org/are-products-targeting-an-older-population-set-for-a-boom/">stairlift producers</a> understand the ever varying shapes and sizes of the household staircase. If you&#8217;re looking for a stair lift, then you should not be put off by concerns over your staircase.</strong></p>
<p>Nearly every staircase is suitable, as stair lifts are highly adaptable options. With various forms and models of lifts on the market, there is usually something to suit your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Fitting the stair lift</strong></p>
<p>Stair lifts are designed to fit on the staircase without getting in the way. The rail is the primary part of the lift, and will skirt along the side. If there are any corners in the stairs, such as a typical right angled corner, the rail can be curved around to allow the chair to move over this.</p>
<p>Likewise, the chair itself simply sits on the rail, and is often collapsible. This ensures less space is used when the chair is not in use. With narrow chairs designed to save extra space, the combination of chair and rail do not actually get in the way.</p>
<p>When not in use, the stairs can still be used as a normal stair case. It’s understandable that not everyone in a given household may need to use the lift, so allowing for both parties is a huge priority.</p>
<p><strong>Usage and continual support</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, stairlifts are easy to use, designed to be highly usable. The simple controls mean there isn&#8217;t a rulebook to learn, just deciding whether you want to go up or down is usually enough. The stairlift itself will most commonly run on battery power.</p>
<p>This can be charged up when not in use, but the battery usually lasts for a few hours usage; this ensures that the lift will still work in the event of a power cut, so that you&#8217;re not stuck upstairs or on the chair in an emergency.</p>
<p>Additionally, you don&#8217;t need to worry about anything going wrong or any maintenance issues. <a href="http://thecci.org/are-products-targeting-an-older-population-set-for-a-boom/">Stannah stair lifts</a> provide excellent and continual customer support; if you have any stair lift issues, they will be happy to help.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://c713371.r71.cf2.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000013861844XSmall_hundreddays-e1304882627658.jpg" alt="Problems with home economics could contribute to poor health" align="left" style="padding-right:5px" width="200"/>Economic concerns, responsibilities at work, family commitments and the need to make ends meet making ends meet, may be putting your health at risk. This was highlighted by a recent study developed by U.S. researchers. Here we have more details and some tips to manage stress related to the household economy.</p>
<p>Some people work to live and others live to work. Those that follow the second case, sometimes they do by vocation but many actually do under pressure. Daily expenses, taxes and services, food, school for boys, clothes, let alone outputs whether to pay the rent or the rent. All these things increase the amount of money needed to bring the desired lifestyle. So many people end up immersed in work, getting obsessed with money and quiet come to meet, or simply make ends meet and fulfill.</p>
<p>But this situation is stressful for anyone and if it continues over time can be harmful to health. In this regard, a study by researchers at the Center for Advancing Health, located in Washington, USA, analyzed the response of more than 10 000 respondents in Pennsylvania in 2008 and found that more than a quarter of those who declared having a bad economic situation described their health as poor or fair.<span id="more-1369"></span></p>
<p>Moreover, among people who had difficulty paying for housing had more cases of high blood pressure and arthritis, and the difference was noticeable among people who had to pay rent and those who owned the property.</p>
<p>In this modern society where time is money and the priority is to be productive is easy to fall into the oblivion of our vital needs, including rest, leisure time and entertainment.</p>
<p>The body needs to be safe and it is necessary to maintain a balanced life, accompanied with a healthy diet and, if possible, an exercise routine (and if outdoors, better, and they say that being in contact with the nature and see the green plants, is good for lowering stress and maintain high self-esteem).</p>
<p>But in the rush to meet and do everything, whether at work or at home, they often lose sight of the fact that along with the duties and responsibilities also increases the level of stress and productivity plummets: Stress can destroy your ability to concentrate, getting angry, depressed and even affect your personal and professional relationships.</p>
<p>In addition, stress can weaken your immune system, which increases your vulnerability to getting a wide variety of diseases, from allergies, colds and back pain to depression, heart problems and other chronic conditions. Therefore, it is important to recognize if they have a situation of prolonged stress that never ends, so you can take charge of the problem and find a solution. And if you do not succeed on your own, it is important that you seek professional help.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here are some recommendations that could help control stress related to money and your home economics:</p>
<p>- Try to take a five minute break for tea and be sure to take breaks to relax and replenish energy.<br />
- Do not panic at the negative stories you hear every day in newspapers and on television. Try to think positive and look for opportunities.<br />
- Try to change the way things once and find opportunities for growth and real change in the challenges. We know the old saying that in every crisis there is always a chance, try to find it and take it.<br />
Identify the things that create stress related to finances and evaluates the ways in which you and your family can reduce expenses or manage finances more efficiently.<br />
- Pay attention to how you choose to control your stress and look for healthier ways. Many people are inclined to unhealthy behaviors like smoking, drinking alcohol, gambling money or eat in large quantities, others also tend to argue with their partners or other members of the family environment. If this is your case, do not let it get worse and consider seeking professional help.<br />
- Look for ways you can motivate economic difficulties in finding healthy ways to cope with stress. For example, try taking a walk (it&#8217;s a cheap way to exercise), dinner at home with your family (estrecharás save money and bonds), take a course or find activities sponsored low-cost or free in your area.</p>
<p>The key is to use the time to be creative and try new strategies to manage your life, and avoid despair. Think that all you can do today will be like seeds that will eventually bear fruit. And the crisis may go faster than you think.</p>
<p>Remember that work is only one of the important aspects of your life and above all you must stay strong and healthy to meet all your responsibilities. Do not forget to take care of your health and your emotions are essential when thinking about a life in balance and harmony.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://c713371.r71.cf2.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000017016138XSmall_-clu-2.jpg" alt="The excuses you away from the gym and how to combat them" align="left" style="padding-right:5px" width="200"/>Some people love sports and have not lost an opportunity to be active. On the contrary, many people do not consider this possibility even though the doctor has recommended them exercise and there are many others who would start but never find the right time and use any excuse &#8211; to groundless fears &#8211; to postpone the time. That may be your case. Here are some myths to be down, so nothing you away from the gym.</p>
<p>From small, Gonzalo always liked reading and getting lost in bookstores. Always kept his mind active but your body spent many hours sitting. He saw no problems with that and he even seemed to spend an hour a gym was a waste of time, it made no sense, he was not born to be a sportsman and was not able to make a single abdominal. Until he fell in love with a hyperactive woman who loved to dance and go biking outdoors whenever he had time and responsibilities allow.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how Gonzalo bought a bike and set out to shoot, first once a week, then two and then whenever I had a moment. And so began taking salsa lessons to accompany the girl of his dreams!</p>
<p>That relationship did not last long, but enough to establish a link to Gonzalo for life with exercise. He realized that he could do more than sit-ups, it was not as boring as he thought, or that was not necessary to be a sportsman to keep moving. Moreover, the more exercised, slept better and felt more lucid reading and incorporate new knowledge.</p>
<p>As Gonzalo, many people have misconceptions or fears related to exercise. You can be one of them and you can also spend the same once you achieve incorporate these habits into your life.<span id="more-1367"></span></p>
<p>Marcela was quite active until she had her second child and got a lot of weight. Coupled with the time that he should devote to the baby and her eldest daughter, those extra kilos or pounds was enough to never resume an exercise routine. However, everyone knows that exercise can help you lose weight, which further appreciate your effort. Do not let shame you win!</p>
<p>Pamela, however, is afraid of everything. Want to look better but think that the treadmill can be hurt or in the bathrooms will give an infection. Someone told him to do some outdoor activity, which had no such risk, but not convinced, she&#8217;s already thinking that if it comes to riding a bike around the neighborhood may have a traffic accident and who knows how many other &#8220;dangers&#8221; but not allow you to start a healthy change in your life.</p>
<p>If any of these fears has come over you, remember that while these risks exist, are minimal. In any case, you can seek counseling with a coach to me explain how to use each machine in the gym and talk to your doctor if for any health reason there is any movement that you should avoid. Do not let this limit. Infections can also be prevented. Asesórate and cheer up!</p>
<p>Jose Luis, however, wants to resume his basketball weekends to keep busy after his divorce, but as he has abandoned many years ago, feels old and fears become the laughing stock of the group can not make those plays awesome he did in his youth.</p>
<p>There is nothing further from reality. If you do not exercise much, before starting to play the overnight is important to begin with gentle exercise and little by little, until you&#8217;re in shape. Moreover, if you are 40 years or older and you have not done a medical check and get an advantage before an intense workout. May initially not be as fast as your companions, but you may be surprised after a while, seeing the progress you achieve with your body.</p>
<p>In conclusion, unless you have a serious health problem, in which case it is important that you consult your doctor for advice, nothing is as an excuse to avoid an activity that will give you a better quality of life. Do not let your physical appearance stop you, nor shame, nor the lack of time, do not need to do one hour of daily exercise to feel the effects. Start with short routines of 15 to 30 minutes, anywhere: exercising at home, dedicating to gardening, replacing the car by walking to nearby places. Any excuse is good to keep your body moving, kicking butt!</p>
<p>Of course, it may hurt, but if you&#8217;re careful you will find it easy to avoid or detect them quickly. In this article we give you some guidelines to differentiate whether the pain is with exercise or whether it is an injury. And of course, if you have any particular health condition such as heart problems or joint, be sure to consult your doctor before starting any exercise routine.</p>
<p>Finally, try to have fun. Choose a physical activity that you like. There are many and varied! There are no excuses for not choosing a healthier lifestyle. And if you still can not decide, make sure you read this article in which we tell you how to establish an exercise routine without abandoning the attempt.</p>

Unfortunately, currently no known cause nor is there any way to prevent its occurrence. What is known is that some people are more likely to have it than others. Among them:</p>
<p>- Diabetics<br />
- Those with a significant injury to the eye.<br />
- People who use steroids.<br />
- Those with relatively thin corneas.<br />
- Those with myopia<br />
- Women, African Americans, the elderly and those with family history of glaucoma.<span id="more-1363"></span></p>
<p>If you have been diagnosed with glaucoma, be sure to go regularly to the ophthalmologist to make you all the necessary studies and follows exactly the treatment that you have specified. Many people do not follow the treatment because they feel good and do not realize that they lose sight gradually. With proper medication, it is possible to stop this progress and keep a good look longer.</p>
<p>And whatever your situation, do not forget to make some kind of physical activity. According to researchers, this is the first time a study shows the association between exercise and eye pressure (other previous research examined the effect of physical activity on the two components of the pressure in the eye: intraocular pressure and blood pressure), and the results appear promising. Take action to feel better and look better!</p>

A recent study found that keep moving could help keep in check the development of this condition that affects the eyes and one of the leading causes of blindness. In this article we tell you more details on these findings and other things you can do to protect the health of your eyes.</p>
<p>Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world and, according to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that by 2020 there will be 80 million people with glaucoma. That is one of the main concerns about the health of eyes.</p>
<p>In search of new data on a group of researchers from the Institute of Ophthalmology at University College London in England, found that physical activity may help protect the eyes of glaucoma.<span id="more-1362"></span></p>
<p>To reach these results, which were published in the journal Investigative Ophthalmology &#038; Visual Science, experts looked at the relationship between physical activity and eye pressure in 5,650 men and women between 48 and 90 years of age in Britain.</p>
<p>According to information provided by participants about their physical activity at work and in his spare time, they were described as inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active or active. The pressure in the eye of the members of each group was controlled according to its variation with the passage of time were evaluated between 1993 and 1997, first, and then between 2006 and 2010.</p>
<p>Thus, researchers found that those who performed moderate exercise for about fifteen years, were 25 percent less likely to have high eye pressure. This is important because the eye pressure is one of the main risk factors for glaucoma.</p>
<p>Glaucoma causes progressive damage to the optic nerve and causes loss of vision because the optic nerve is responsible for transmitting visual signals from eye to brain. The most common form of glaucoma, known as primary open angle glaucoma is associated with increased fluid pressure within the eye, when the pressure is too high for the optic nerve.</p>
<p>This does not mean that everyone with high blood pressure in one eye or both develop the disease. Similarly, the damage to the eye related to glaucoma can occur even when the pressure in the eye is normal, and worst of all is that most people know they have this condition because it causes no symptoms. It is therefore important to see an ophthalmologist, who is the specialist who deals with the health of the eyes, at least once a year.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://c713371.r71.cf2.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000014158831XSmall_-Stockphoto4u.jpg" alt="Aerobic exercise is more effective in reducing belly fat" align="left" style="padding-right:5px" width="200"/>To remove those extra kilos or pounds that have accumulated in your body, aerobic exercise have proved more effective than resistance. Here&#8217;s what we found a group of U.S. researchers about it, and why reduce abdominal fat is more than a cosmetic issue.</p>
<p>At that aerobic exercise appear to be more effective when looking for a flat stomach and intestine. That had been shown in some studies (we informed you earlier in this article vidaysalud.com other), and return it to confirm a new research by specialists Medical Center Duke University in the United States, which was published in the August 25 issue of the American Journal of Physiology.</p>
<p>According to the latter work, aerobic exercise can burn 67 percent more calories than resistance training. To reach these results, the researchers compared the efficacy of aerobic exercise (like jogging) with resistance training (weight lifting) or a combination of both activities in 196 overweight, sedentary adults, aged 18 to 70 years age, for eight months.<span id="more-1360"></span></p>
<p>Participants in the aerobic group trotted the equivalent of 19 kilometers or 12 miles per week, 80 percent of maximum heart rate, while members of the resistance group did three sets of twelve repetitions, three times a week.</p>
<p>Thus, researchers looked at how these types of exercise reduced the fat found deep in the abdomen and fills the spaces between the internal organs, called visceral fat and liver, which is associated with an increased risk of developing heart disease, diabetes and some cancers.</p>
<p>After analyzing the data, found that aerobic exercise significantly reduced visceral fat and liver and improved risk factors for heart disease and diabetes and insulin resistance, liver enzymes and triglycerides. By contrast, resistance training did not confer these benefits but the combination of both years did achieve similar results.</p>
<p>Thus, aerobic exercise or a combination of both, as Paul and Rocio are doing, not only can help you lose those extra kilos or pounds but also to combat all the health problems that are associated with excess abdominal fat .</p>
<p>The exercises are an important part of your health, and if you accompany a healthy diet appropriate for your height and activity level will be much more effective. Supplement your exercise routine with proper diet: rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lowfat dairy, fish, poultry, lean meats, etc.. that is not too low in calories so you have enough energy and strength to exercise. Remember to drink plenty of water to stay well hydrated. Alongside all this, do not forget to rest enough. You see how your body shows the difference, not only more energy but with a much flatter stomach, which also is healthier.</p>

<p>Yoga is an ancient system of exercise, healing and relaxation. Yoga has been the subject of many scientific studies that have suggested various psychological and physical theories. In research done in humans has shown that yoga reduces heart rate and blood pressure, increases lung capacity and time during which you can hold your breath, muscle relaxation and improved body composition, cause weight loss and increase overall physical endurance. Preliminary research suggests that yoga may reduce chronic back pain, but more research is needed before drawing definitive conclusions.<span id="more-1358"></span></p>
<p>In a new study, researchers randomly assigned (by chance) to 313 adults with chronic low back pain to a 12 yoga classes for 3 months or standard care (or usual). To determine the outcome of the questionnaire responses were included Roland-Morris Disability (RMDG), measurements of pain and general health measures after three months and again at six and 12 months follow up.</p>
<p>The researchers found that patients in the yoga group had greater improvement in the functioning of the back than the standard care group. In addition, scores were averaged RMDG 2.17, 1.48 and 1.57 points lower for patients of yoga in three, six and 12 months respectively.</p>
<p>The authors noted that two patients in the standard care group and 12 in the yoga group reported increased pain and other adverse effects. In addition, missing data of 21 patients in the yoga group and 18 in the usual care group.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that yoga can be more beneficial than standard care for patients with chronic low back pain, however, due to limitations of the study, more research is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://c713371.r71.cf2.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/iStock_000017143674XSmall_Vicki-Reid1.jpg" alt="Exercise to prevent cancer" align="left" style="padding-right:5px" width="200"/>Doing regular exercise can reduce up to 35 percent the chances of developing colon cancer and breast cancer by 25 percent. So found a study that confirms the relationship between physical inactivity and cancer and provides new data in order to reduce the risk of this disease with healthier lifestyles. If your favorite pastime is to sit comfortably on a couch watching TV for hours, you&#8217;re passing it an unnecessary invitation to cancer. Ciérrale the door by putting your body in motion, even during work hours.</p>
<p>Monday to Friday and sometimes Saturday, Raul gets up early, leaves home and takes the bus that takes him to his job sitting where he spends eight to nine hours sitting at a desk. When finished, take the bus again and when he comes home he loves to sit back watch a movie while you dine. Then she lays down and the next day everything starts again. Do you find it known this routine?</p>
<p>If your habits are similar, you have to start considering the possibility of adding more movement to your life. Doing regular exercise you can improve your quality of life and stay healthier longer.<span id="more-1356"></span></p>
<p>Physical activity not only helps relieve back pain or symptoms of fibromyalgia, but also allows you to maintain a healthy heart. If one analyzes the results of different studies that confirm to sit for hours watching TV can raise blood pressure, something that endangers the health of your heart. In this muscle as it puts a heavy burden worker inactivity: just look at a paper in which we explain to sit for a long time may increase the chances that you suffer a heart attack.</p>
<p>The danger of inaction is alarming when one considers that according to the researchers calculated, people sit for 15.5 hours each day, including meals, travel to and from work or school, working on the computer and watch TV. Office workers, for example, spend 75 percent of the time sitting.</p>
<p>A new study by researchers at Cancer Care of Health Services in Calgary Alberta, Canada, has found an association between physical inactivity and cancer development, another negative consequence of inactivity.</p>
<p>But there are solutions. According to the study, published in the October issue of the journal Cancer Prevention Research, regular exercise can reduce the risk of developing colon cancer by up to 35 percent. The same goes for breast cancer, whose risk can be reduced up to 25 percent through exercise.</p>
<p>Even when you must sit many hours, as happens to Raul, just take a few minutes recurrent breaks to walk may be helpful, both to maintain the health of your heart to prevent cancer.</p>
<p>Therefore, some recommendations to combat sedentary work are:</p>
<p>- Get up several times to serve water or another beverage like tea or coffee (avoid soda and sugary drinks).<br />
- Receive phone calls to the feet.<br />
- Walk to where you will find a partner of work instead of calling or send an e-mail.<br />
- If you work driving a car, be sure to stop a few minutes every so often to take a short walk and stretch your legs.<br />
- Go pick out your copies or prints you did, instead of asking someone to bring you the your office.<br />
- If you can, stands at a meeting or conference.<br />
- If you work at home, stop going to the bathroom, to go to the kitchen to the stairs or walk around the house.</p>
<p>And if all this, plus, you add an exercise routine a little more intense with healthy habits in your diet, you&#8217;ll gain health and quality of life. Cheer up! With a few small changes you can tell the difference.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.willtobegreat.com/GoodExercisesToLoseWeight/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/exercise51.jpg" alt="Exercises that improve your sex life | Recommendations" align="right" style="padding-left:5px" width="200"/>There are certain exercises and these are especially recommended:</p>
<p>- Particularly for men, plates or lizards (push ups): Aim to do 3 sets of 12 to 15 repetitions each. This is a classic exercise that will strengthen your arms, torso and abdomen. If you can not perform all the series, never mind. Begins with a minimal amount. You will gain in strength and endurance over time.</p>
<p>- For both sexes, the abdominals. A flat stomach is not the only advantage derived, since men and women see an improvement in the stability and strength to keep the positions and stronger backs. Men in particular will also achieve a better push during penetration. Lie on the floor with your legs bent and arms bent behind his head. Rest your head on your hands, chin toward the ceiling. Now, move the torso up without raising the hips off the floor, abdominal muscles tight (try not to push your head with your arms to avoid injury to the neck). Do 3 sets of 15 repetitions each. To avoid back pain, you can work your abdominal muscles up. Stand with legs slightly apart, the muscles of the abdomen compressed, pulling your navel inward. Lift one knee while trying to play with the opposite hand. Repeated for the other side. You can switch to lift the knee once (single), or double or triple it, leaning heavily on the opposite leg.<span id="more-1354"></span></p>
<p>- Hip lifts (also known as a bridge or bridge): the two partners can strengthen the buttocks, pelvis, lower back and the back of the thighs. Lie down on a mattress on the floor, bend your legs and place your heels near the buttocks. Now, raise your hips, glutes contracted (abs tight, trying to get the belly down) and hold the position for 3 to 4 seconds. Lower hips to floor and repeat. As a goal, intend to make 3 sets of 15 repetitions each. These exercises strengthen the pelvic muscles which helps to intensify the contractions during orgasm.</p>
<p>- Squats: Stand with legs slightly apart, arms along the body (you can do them with weights or without them). Bend your knees, bringing the pelvis back (as if you were to sit in an imaginary chair). Returns to the starting position and repeat. You can perform them with legs apart or together. Avoid tilting the torso forward. All movement is done with the hip, bringing back as you bend your knees. With this exercise you strengthen the buttocks and thighs, giving you more thrust at the hip, more strength and more strength to play other positions in the sexual encounter. Perform 3 sets of 8 to 12 repetitions each.</p>
<p>Another alternative that can also be very useful are called Kegel exercises, which are recommended to control urinary incontinence (when you can not stand the urge or desire to urinate or when you get a bit of urine when laughing or sneezing , for example). While these exercises are geared primarily to women (especially after childbirth), men also benefit because they can control ejaculation and to increase the volume of blood in the penis to achieve harder erections.</p>
<p>How are Kegel exercises? It is easy to learn this technique, but can sometimes be difficult to identify the supporting muscles located in the pelvis, and consciously not used frequently. One way to detect them is trying to stop urine while going out. If you do, you learn the basic movement. Once you&#8217;ve identified the muscles, contráelos and hold the position for 3 seconds, then relax for 3 seconds and repeat this sequence 10 times, three or four times a day.</p>
<p>Now you know what exercises you can do to improve your sexual activity, you also know how sex can help you improve your health. To learn more about these topics, be sure to read this other article published in vidaysalud.com some time ago about natural remedies to increase your sexual desire. Improve your love life and your health is in your hands. Your Move!</p>
