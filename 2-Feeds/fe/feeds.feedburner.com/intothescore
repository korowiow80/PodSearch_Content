		<itunes:summary>the only podcast solely dedicated to the academic study of videogame music! Every episode, we study a different game and address what the world was like at the time of its release, where gaming was and why this game is important in the literature.  Furthermore, we study the composer and their life while analyzing their music.  Through the adventure of each episode, our listeners are exposed to new music and new musical devices and conventions in a quest to understand how the composer crafts his/her sounds! Learning new musical practices through a cutting-edge medium -this is one podcast you will not want to miss!</itunes:summary>

<p>Happy May!</p>
<p>Hey there, team! There&#8217;s a new FULL episode of &#8220;Into the Score,&#8221; can you believe it? Here we are, delving deep into the Underworld and following the awesome adventures of our favourite <em>calaca</em>, Manny Calavera, in LucasArts&#8217; 1998 release of &#8220;Grim Fandango&#8221; with a score by Peter McConnell.</p>
<p>In this episode, we also look at different influences from jazz history that McConnell used to craft the game&#8217;s score, including Duke Ellington and (most probably) Count Basie.  We also dig deep into the concept of extended techniques on our instruments and how they change the natural sound of both instruments and their ensemble.</p>
<p>This is an episode that you do not want to miss! Enjoy!</p>
<p>Until next time!<br />

In this installment, we hammer in a look at Square Enix&#8217;s 2008 release of &#8220;Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King&#8221; with a score by Koichi Sugiyama and performed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra!</p>
<p>We also look at the Classical Era (and all of the coolness that it entails), we look at the life of Sugiyama, the history of the franchise, as well as many other musical and gaming tidbits! It&#8217;s sure not to disappoint, so tune in!</p>
<p>Until next time!<br />
Kenley<br />

<p>Good evening, listeners! While Manitoba may be hit with a torrent of snow, thaw (and subsequent flooding), the March episode of &#8220;Into the Score&#8221; is finally up, focusing on Takeharu Ishimoto&#8217;s dynamic score to the 2008 release of Square Enix&#8217;s &#8220;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII.&#8221; In this episode, we focus on the music from the game, the legacy of Final Fantasy VII and it&#8217;s compilation titles, with Crisis Core receiving particular focus.  Musically, we&#8217;re going to to work on thematic material from the game, remixing, the string quartet and Ishimoto&#8217;s departure from traditional &#8220;Final Fantasy&#8221; orchestration while still staying to musically true to the series.</p>
<p>We ALSO have two sets of guests for this episode! Our first set are two of the higher-ups from VGM remixing community, OverClocked ReMix! To speak about remixing and OCR&#8217;s place in the VGM environment, we have founder and head of submissions, David W. Lloyd (&#8221;djpretzel&#8221;) and Larry Oji (&#8221;liontamer&#8221;), respectively.</p>
<p>For a roundtable to discussion to cap off this month&#8217;s show, we have Kyle Wynen and Laren McFadden from the FXN Final Fantasy XIII podcast.  This discussion is insightful, exciting and musical, to say the least!</p>
<p>We have a great show this month, make sure not to miss it!</p>

<p>For this month&#8217;s episode, we jump into a 1995  score that made a huge impact in the VGM community, if not as a breakout hit, then as a cult classic.  The game is <em>EarthBound</em> and its score was composed by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu (&#8221;Hip&#8221;) Tanaka! So excited, can&#8217;t wait to talk with you all about it!</p>
<p>We also have guests on the show! The Canadian VGM jazz combo, &#8220;The Runaway Five&#8221; is on the show to talk with us about their group, their connection with <em>EarthBound</em> and we get to hear some of their music! To boost this concept up, our big idea is the jazz combo!</p>

After a month of traveling and then a month of research and recording, Episode 22 of &#8220;Into the Score&#8221; has finally arrived!

This month, we chronicle Ko Otani&#8217;s moving and emotional score to Sony&#8217;s &#8220;Shadow of the Colossus&#8221; for the PlayStation 2.  In the episode, we look at it&#8217;s quasi-sequel &#8220;Ico&#8221; as well as the origins of the symphony, with the Baroque Era in particular!</p>
<p>Emotionally, this episode tries to unravel how the music fits into the game; but also, how the absence of music fits in as well.  We look at the sparseness of the environment and the grandeur of each colossus - this is not an episode that you&#8217;ll want to miss!</p>
<p>For the dictation of which music plays for which cutscene and colossus, the file is down below!<br />

<p>For the shownotes, just click on <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/siven7/intothescore22.txt">shownotes!</a></p>
<p>Stay tuned for next month&#8217;s episode, studying Square&#8217;s 1997 PlayStation release of &#8220;Final Fantasy Tactics,&#8221; with a thrilling, epic and unbelievably skillful score by Hitoshi Sakimoto!</p>

<p>Good evening, everyone! I hope that everyone is excited for Episode 20 of &#8220;Into the Score!&#8221; It&#8217;s been a while coming, but for some crazy reason, this episode took me a long time to write, even though it&#8217;s 1/4 of the length of the last episode! In which case, it&#8217;s here and I hope that everyone is pumped!</p>
<p>In tonight&#8217;s episode, we engage the 1996 collaboration of Nintendo and Square for their SNES release of &#8220;Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars&#8221; with a terrific score by Yoko Shimomura! While the game has a ton of terrific original music, we largely study the quotation of the older musical themes in this new game&#8230; linking the old with the new!</p>
<p>This release is also correlated with the SM:RPG tribute album &#8220;Heavy Troopa is Ready to Launch&#8221; put on by <a href="http://www.gamemusic4all.com">GameMusic4All.com</a> and it&#8217;s definitely worth checking out! For tonight&#8217;s arrangement portion, we hear from Jeremy Robson and his 3-piece medley for orchestra called &#8220;Three Mushroom Dances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Enjoy, it&#8217;s a good&#8217;er!<br />
Kenley</p>
<p>Enjoy and always remember to leave comments!<br />
Until next time!</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, listeners of video game music! I hope that you really enjoy this episode, as it&#8217;s on my favourite VGM score of all-time, Square&#8217;s 1994 release of &#8220;Final Fantasy VI&#8221; with an epic, evocative and memorable score by Nobuo Uematsu! In this episode, we study character themes, also called &#8220;leitmotifs&#8221; and how influential they are in the score.  We also see how Uematsu has taken these themes and changed their meaning according to how he&#8217;s arranged them&#8230; quite interesting stuff!</p>
<p>Also, lots of arrangements as well as a guest who is a phenom of a vocalist! Her name is Jillian Goldin and she is a judge at OverClocked ReMix, a ReMixer herself and also has a new album coming out on Earth Day of 2008! That&#8217;s next week! Also, she used to host VGDJ, which is the podcast that got me podcasting&#8230; quite important stuff! She&#8217;s great!</p>
<p>Go check her out here: <a href="http://www.jilliangoldin.com">http://www.jilliangoldin.com</a>! Please buy her album, it&#8217;s wonderful.</p>
<p>Also, forgive the overwhelming number of &#8220;Terra&#8221;s in this episode&#8230; it&#8217;s a bit extreme and I didn&#8217;t realize it until it was done.  Also, the editing isn&#8217;t as good as it usually is, heavy time constraints and even now as I&#8217;m posting this, I&#8217;m in Banff, AB, Canada with my Senior Band and Choirs&#8230; quite busy!</p>

The album covers nearly every track from Capcom&#8217;s late-80s release, &#8220;Mega Man 2&#8243; and is performed with cutting musical accuracy and polished with clean production in the band&#8217;s own &#8220;Dr. Light Studios.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this discussion, we talk about the band&#8217;s creative process, their performances, styles of writing and the eases and trials of the album, from start to finish! We also hear some of the tracks from start to finish, which is really nice!</p>
<p>Thankfully, it&#8217;s done.  Sorry for the lateness, but after being plagued with technical difficulties (both before and during the interview), it really came together well.  Thanks to the band for being on the show!</p>

<p>Hey all! This post is just a heads-up that the next show will not be with Glenn Stafford and Russell Brower, but it will actually be with &#8220;The Megas&#8221; and we&#8217;ll discuss the release of their new album, &#8220;Get Equipped.&#8221;   There were a few scheduling conflicts between Blizzard and myself, so the wait is still on&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; but this is cool too.</p>
<p>The interview with &#8220;The Megas&#8221; has been on the backburner for a while.  &#8220;Get Equipped&#8221; came out in mid-January and has been subject to an incredible amount of press and success.  While there are a few reviews and interviews that highlight the album&#8217;s greatness, the interview with ITS is really about the nuts-and-bolts of the album and most importantly, the journey of making the album.</p>
<p>This interview was supposed to be Episode 19, but because our schedules miraculously worked out, it&#8217;s going to be this Episode 18 instead.  This is just an update to let the audience know that&#8230; but you also get a sample of &#8220;Get Equipped&#8221; too&#8230; which is awesome <img src='http://intothescore.blueandbrownbooks.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Game on and enjoy!<br />

		<itunes:summary>Hey all! This post is just a heads-up that the next show will not be with Glenn Stafford and Russell Brower, but it will actually be with "The Megas" and we'll discuss the release of their new album, "Get Equipped."

The interview with "The Megas" has been on the backburner for a while.  "Get Equipped" came out in mid-January and has been subject to an incredible amount of press and success.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy holidays everyone! This is a brief holiday edition of &#8220;Into the Score&#8221; and while it is quite short, there are many treats in store for our next episode, chronicling the 1998 Blizzard release of &#8220;Starcraft!&#8221;</p>
<p>Everything is a crystalline purity around the city of Winnipeg, with freshly fallen snow and a blanket of white that sits on the pine trees in front of the houses.  Life is good!</p>
<p>In our next episode, we tackle &#8220;Starcraft&#8221; and celebrate the 1st birthday of &#8220;Into the Score!&#8221; On December 29th, ITS turns one! Listen along and celebrate! As well, the following episode will carry an interview with the lead composer of the &#8220;Starcraft&#8221; franchise, Glenn Stafford! To celebrate both Starcraft and the holidays, our musical selection of this very short episode will be &#8220;The 12 Days of Starcraft!&#8221; It&#8217;s only a snippet, but there are links to it all over the internet (I&#8217;ve put one below!)</p>
<p>If you celebrated Hanukkah between the episodes, I hope that it was wonderful and full of family and friends! Also, if you celebrated the winter solstice, I hope that the yule was good to you and full of rejoicing! If you are celebrating Christmas in the coming days, happiest of holidays and enjoy the company of those around you! If you are rejoicing in the pan-African Kwanzaa, enjoy many great celebrations!</p>
<p>Happiest of holidays and I will see you on the 29th! Enjoy the &#8220;12 Days of Starcraft!&#8221;</p>

Also, if you celebrated the winter solstice, I hope that the yule was good to you and full of rejoicing! If you are celebrating Christmas in the coming days, happiest of holidays and enjoy the company of those around you! If you are rejoicing in the pan-African Kwanzaa, enjoy many great celebrations!

Happiest of holidays and I will see you on the 29th! Enjoy the "12 Days of Starcraft!"

<p>Also in this episode, we study the influence the influence of Gothic and Romantic music and culture on the games as well as their ongoing prevalance in subculture today.   We look at the importance of folklore, mysticism and the supernatural in the ongoing feud between the Belmont Clan and the Dark Lord himself, Count Dracula.</p>
<p>There is particular focus on the first two &#8220;Castlevanias&#8221; as well as &#8220;Symphony of the Night,&#8221; which was released in 1997 for the Sony PlayStation.  The composers of choice for the show are Kukeiha Club and Michiru Yamane - how did they approach the scores of the series? How are they same? How are they different?</p>
<p>Only one way to find out&#8230;</p>
<p>There is also a supplementary image regarding the focus on style and structure versus emotion and evocation in Western Music.  That image can be found right <a href="http://cdn.libsyn.com/siven7/Ep15-SupplementaryImage.jpg" title="Episode 15 Supplementary Image" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Ahoy, listeners! With only three days left until Video Games Live, I&#8217;m really excited to put out a &#8220;mini-episode&#8221; before I leave! Because I&#8217;m really interested in the personal lives of the hosts of shows that I like (and am, perhaps, a big narcissist, ha!), I&#8217;m releasing an interview that I did on the University of Manitoba radio station&#8217;s show called &#8220;F*SMAK.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a program that highlights the U of M&#8217;s Faculty of Music, as well as big works from Renaissance/Baroque/Classical/Romantic/20th-Century/etc.  and Jazz Repertoire! It&#8217;s hosted by Steph Davis (tuba) and Vanessa Nowastowski (French horn) and it&#8217;s on at 3:30 CST on UMFM - 101.5 on the radio and http://www.umfm.ca for some online listening!</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t really show me as a podcast host or music teacher as much, but more of a composer and a member of the Winnipeg Game Development Community (which is starting to grow, yeah!).  You get to hear some of my original work for a game that&#8217;s in development and that game&#8217;s team gave the green-light for some of the pieces to be played on the podcast! Sorry that it&#8217;s in mono and 64kbps, but you&#8217;ll get to hear it!</p>
<p>Right on! Episode 15 is coming within the next two weeks! It&#8217;s on Konami&#8217;s late-80s release, &#8220;Castlevania&#8221; and we study Gothic art and music! It&#8217;s going to be a&#8230; howl? mwa ha ha ha ha&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230; okay, not funny.  Enjoy!</p>

<p>Also in this episode, we study the practice of orchestration, we stumble upon the practice of &#8220;demoscening&#8221; and we have a guest on the show! For the first time in the history of &#8220;Into the Score,&#8221; we study a game and then  interview the composer of that very game! Tonight, we interview Vincent Diamante, an adjunct professor at USC and the composer for the &#8220;Cloud&#8221; project.</p>
<p>We study the score then discuss it with Vincent - what it was like writing it, his thoughts on the work and what is next on the horizon! This episode is one that you do not want to miss!</p>

<p>Good evening! After some technical difficulties on the back end of things, ITS13 is finally up! While betamodradio.com is still down, I&#8217;m borrowing some webspace from a good friend of mine at our sister site (http://www.blueandbrownbooks.com, moderated by Aaron), so many thanks for that!</p>
<p>This episode&#8230; (#13&#8230; not #14 as stated in the show)&#8230; is different than most others.  This show is framed in the form of an interview with the project coordinator of a monolithic arrangement project of music from Final Fantasy VII called &#8220;Voices of the Lifestream.&#8221; His name is Andrew Aversa (aka &#8220;zircon&#8221;) and he is a judge from a VGM arrangement community online called &#8220;OverClocked ReMix.</p>
<p>This interview with Andrew Aversa was conducted in the first week of October, 2007.  Together, we explore the highs, lows and everything-in -between on Day 1 of the project to its eventual release on September 14, 2007.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone - this is a bit of a supplementary video for Episode 12 because it was the first presentation that I gave on Thematic &amp; Adaptive music (as well as other compositional elements as well&#8230; like hydrogen, jk)</p>
<p>While I&#8217;ve scored another game since the time that I did this, I still hold a lot of the same ideals towards writing.  It&#8217;s a bit of a big video, but it&#8217;s a more visual way to interact with the ideals of Thematicism and Adaptivity, which I think are kind of important!</p>
<p>Anyways! Enjoy!<br />
Kenley</p>
<p>PS: Shivers was really released in 1996, not &#8216;94&#8230; which I said in the video&#8230; that&#8217;s not correct <img src='http://intothescore.blueandbrownbooks.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

		<itunes:summary>Hey everyone - this is a bit of a supplementary video for Episode 12 because it was the first presentation that I gave on Thematic  Adaptive music (as well as other compositional elements as well... like hydrogen, jk)

While I've scored another game since the time that I did this, I still hold a lot of the same ideals towards writing.  It's a bit of a big video, but it's a more visual way to interact with the ideals of Thematicism and Adaptivity, which I think are kind of important!

Anyways! Enjoy!
Kenley

PS: Shivers was really released in 1996, not '94... which I said in the video... that's not correct ;)</itunes:summary>

<p>Yeah! Episode 10! I&#8217;m really excited that &#8220;Into the Score&#8221; has survived such trials as the last year at University, last big student-teaching block, job-hunting and then having two jobs this summer - spot on, podcast <img src='http://intothescore.blueandbrownbooks.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Because we&#8217;ve reached double-digits, I decided to tackle a bigger score than usual - one that everyone would know and one to which most people have a sort of&#8230; emotional connection.  This bi-monthly episode, the podcast focuses on Nobuo Uematsu&#8217;s brilliant score to Square Enix&#8217;s &#8220;Final Fantasy VII.&#8221;</p>
<p>The episode is quite huge - not going to lie to you, and it talks about a lot of big parts of the work - particularly regarding development, Cloud&#8217;s relationship to the Overworld theme and the character of Sephiroth (both musically and historically).   There were a few things that I wanted to talk about in the episode, but to be honest, I simply forgot.  The biggest one was the myriad of plot themes and macrocosmic ideas that get played out through the game.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just so much! Abuse in power, the environment, love, loss&#8230; but not everyone takes away ALL of those themes, it&#8217;s as though the game speaks to everyone in a different way&#8230; that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really magical about it.  I&#8217;ll let the music speak for itself, enjoy Episode 10!</p>
<p>Also, the addition to this episode, 10-2 (ha!) is the full performance of Jeremy Robson&#8217;s &#8220;Final Fantasy VII Philharmonic Suite,&#8221; which is unbelievably clever, crafty and beautiful.  Definitely check this out after you catch this episode!</p>
