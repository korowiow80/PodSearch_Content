<p>Because of this, and other difficulties (vacations, time constraints, etc.) we were unable to record the first TTB Mini this week. However, look forward to it next week, and the week after, and the week after that, and - well, you get the point.</p>

It&#8217;s a new year for The Teen Tech Buzz, and with that comes two new podcast treats. The first is a brand-new, <a href="http://cafepress.com/teentechbuzz" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/cafepress.com');">Teen Tech Buzz store</a>, where we sell all kinds of TTB-branded merchandise, such as T-shirts, hats, buttons, and more. 10% of all sales go to supporting our podcast, so please buy, buy, buy!</p>
<p>Next, we also are going to start a new part of our podcast, TTB mini. TTB mini will be a special, short version of the podcast that will come out every week to accompany the full, monthly one. In it, we&#8217;ll do announcements, news, and a mini-segment or two.</p>
<p>But, if that&#8217;s not enough, TTB #27 itself is fully loaded with lots of great content, including news from CES and Macworld &#8216;08, a review of the Aliph Jawbone Bluetooth headset, and much more. So, please feel free to download, listen to, and enjoy our first podcast of the new year.</p>

Remember when we said that we&#8217;d be at Digital Life 2007? Well, don&#8217;t worry, we were, but now we&#8217;ve finally got our coverage out&#8230;a month later. Yeah, yeah, I know, but trust me, this almost two-hour special edition episode is worth the wait. Starting with the Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock press launch and ending with the Zipit Wireless Z2 Messenger, and featuring loads of interviews in between, ranging from Palm to Gateway to Wizards of the Coast, this podcast has a enough tech-talk to make any teen-geek drool. But don&#8217;t take my word for it, check it out for yourself!</p>

We&#8217;ll probably get to the store around 5 PM, and stay until 6:30, all the while interviewing people with my audio equipment and Austen&#8217;s camcorder. So, if you&#8217;re in the tri-state area and want to see (hopefully) you&#8217;re two favorite podcasters, than come on down. It should be a lot of fun, really exciting, and really crowded. Heck, you may even be able to <em>touch</em> an iPhone. Plus, the 5th Avenue Apple Store is in a great location, filled with <a href="http://gridskipper.com/travel/new-york/ultimate-iphone-campout-guide-nyc-fifth-avenue-271233.php" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/gridskipper.com');">lots of places to hang out</a> and spend even more money on expensive, shiny things. So, if you decide to come along, we&#8217;ll be the two teens bothering people and sticking recording equipment in their faces.</p>
<p>The interviews and stuff we record at the launch should be included in TTB #24 and be out very soon after the iPhone&#8217;s release (it really depends on how fast I can edit). Also, the video we record will hopefully turn into the first Teen Tech Buzz Video segment, and will come out soon after the iPhone launch. So, Austen and I are really excited about this launch (even though neither of us will be getting iPhones ourselves), and look forward to meeting some of you guys too.</p>

Welcome back from vacation! A lot has happened in the past two months, including CES and the Macworld Expo. In this podcast, we cover these two events, review the Slingbox AV and Microsft Zune, and discuss Apple&#8217;s new iPhone. This, plus some of our mini-segments, make up this milestone TTB #20.

<p>Yes, TTB #18 is here, at last. Sorry for the delay but there was a lot of stuff going on these past few weeks, so editing took a little while. But, #18 is up, complete with reviews of the new 2G iPod nanos and 5.5G video iPods, two video iPod cases, and the strange Skype accessory, Verball. We also have the very latest in tech news, including the release of the Product RED iPod Nano, Firefox 2.0, and Internet Explorer 7. And, instead of an interview, Austen and I have some audio from when we went to the WIRED Nextfest Expo back in October and checked out some of the latest, coolest, futuristic technology. This, and much more, is on the latest TTB #18.</p>

<p>After a two month break, The Teen Tech Buzz is back, and with a ton of new content! In our one year anniversary episode, we have a bunch of news including the new iPods and iTunes 7, Microsoft&#8217;s official launch of their Zune, and much more. We also have reviews of the Logitech Harmony Remote for Xbox 360, the Motorola RAZR V3m, and the Oakley O ROKR Bluetooth sunglasses. Plus, we interview Peter Rojas, co-founder and editor of the Engadget blog.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.teentechbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/Picture%203.png" /></p>
<p>Also, as I mentioned before, this is our 1-year anniversary. Exactly one year ago today, on September 25th, 2005, The Teen Tech Buzz teaser went online. A lot of things have changed since then, including better podcast equipment and software (Skype and Garageband vs. two mics/mixer and Sound Studio 3), higher quality content (more prepared news, reviews, etc.), and our voices have gotten deeper (listen to the trailer and this podcast, notice the difference?). But, we couldn&#8217;t have done any of that (well, except our voices changing) without you, our devoted listeners, to motivate us with your comments, criticism, and overall feedback. Some of you guys have been with us since the beginning, others are new, but you all are great all the same. When Austen and I started this podcast with just two headsets, Garageband, and my .Mac account, I wasn&#8217;t sure that this podcast would get beyond only a few listeners. This month, we maxed out at 91 subscribers (see the image above for our subscriber history, and our latest podcast has been downloaded over 500 times. We are now members of the <a href="http://teenpodcasters.com" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/teenpodcasters.com');">Teen Podcasters Network</a> and the <a href="http://www.techpodcasts.com/" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/www.techpodcasts.com');">Tech Podcast Network</a>. We have sponsored reviews from <a href="http://www.tekserve.com" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/www.tekserve.com');">Tekserve </a>(stay tuned for TTB #18). We have press credentials for the <a href="http://nextfest.net" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/nextfest.net');">WIRED NEXTFEST</a> technology expo (special edition episode coming up). Overall, I never could have anticipated the incredible growth of this podcast and the podcast industry. So, really, I&#8217;d just like to say thanks to you, our listeners, for everything.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, there&#8217;s a lot of stuff to talk about in this post. One, as some of you may know, our server was down for much of today, though now it is up and running. I&#8217;m not sure of why the downage occurred, but I&#8217;ll try to contact our hosting provider, Bluehost, to see what happened. Also, due to July 4th weekend, TTB #16 will be delayed for being recorded an extra week, which means it won&#8217;t be online for about two weeks. Speaking of TTB #16, that will be our last podcast epsiode until September, as Austen and I will be on vacation during August. Also, with September comes the one year anniversary of our podcast (September 25th to be exact). Woohoo!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, even though we are a very small podcast (under 100 subscribers), it seems like we&#8217;re starting to get some internet recognition. <a href="http://www.podcastpup.com" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/www.podcastpup.com');">PodcastPUP</a> has just added us as their featured podcast for June, meaning that for the next 30 days, we&#8217;ll appear on the PodcastPUP hoempage. Hopefully this will increase our subscriber base and &#8220;get us out there&#8221; more, but who knows. Also, just a reminder, our first contest ends on Sunday, and we still have had no participants, so I&#8217;ll drop another hint: He&#8217;ll roll over, play dead, and doesn&#8217;t need to be potty trained.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, we&#8217;ve decided to start expanding the podcast into a new territory: Contests. We have decided to start doing contests with (of course) good and juicy prizes. These prizes will usually be review copies of products that we are allowed to keep, but, according to our unofficial ethics code, can&#8217;t. All of these products in the contests will be technology related. These contests will usually be announced via an episode of the podcast, and via the website at about the same time. Most of these podcasts will probably last about two weeks on average, so it will be in between podcasts.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough about what we plan to do: This is our first contest, which won&#8217;t be featured on the podcast unless there are no winners by the time that the podcast is released, where we will announce it &#8220;officially.&#8221; For this first one, we&#8217;re going the make it simple: 20 questions. We&#8217;ll give you some clues about a product that we will give away, and you can ask up to 20 YES OR NO questions in the comments, about it&#8217;s qualities, maker, etc. You can also (of course) guess what product it is. So here&#8217;s the clues:<br />
<em>We are in the possesion of a consumer electronics product.</em><br />
<em>It is a product directed at a younger audiance.</em><br />
<em>It costs between $50 and $100</em>.<br />
<em>It has been talked about on the podcast, either in a news segment, review, discussion, or any other segment.<br />
</em></p>
<p>What is it? The first one to answer with a comment to this post wins the mystery item. You can ask as many questions as you want, but you can only state <strong>1</strong> guess. Please include in your comment your email address, so that we can email you to find out your contact info. We promise we won&#8217;t give your address to anybody but our parents, who are very good people. Trust us. Once we have your address we will mail the product to you. Please be aware that we have the legal obligation to refuse sending this product to anybody. If you think you know what the product is, but don&#8217;t want it, you might want to leave it for someone else who wants it. You have <strong>2</strong> weeks. If no one has figured out the right product by then (after being featured on the podcast, also) we will probably do a new contest where you know the product that you don&#8217;t know now beforehand.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Podcasts cost money. In order to pay for the costs of hosting, equipment, etc., we have come up with two new forms of revenue. The first is ads. Now we know that no one likes ads, but we need the revenue and will be adding them to our podcast once we get some sponsors. In the mean time, it would be great if you could fill out a <a href="http://www.podtrac.com/audience/start-survey.aspx?ver=1&#038;pid=WHfr5Pkr_es$"target="_blank"  onclick="javascript:urchinTracker ('/outbound/article/www.podtrac.com');">listener survey</a> to give potential sponsors (and, to some extent us) an idea of our listener demographic. In addition to ads, a tip jar will be added to the sidebar for accepting PayPal domations, along with what funds wwe collect will currently be going towards (currently a full-site redesign). We&#8217;d greatly appreciate donations, though they won&#8217;t be tax-deductable. Sorry for bothering you with ads and donation requests, it&#8217;s just that we need the money to support the podcast that you (hopefully) know and love.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know you&#8217;re all getting tired of epsiode delays, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do. Austen and I recorded the show on Sunday, but then when I tried to edit it in Pro Tools, and then quit the program, the file became corrupt. I&#8217;ve tried everything including calling DigiDesign support to trying to figure out how to edit the AIFF header, but all to no avail. Sorry, but Episode 10 won&#8217;t be up until next week. But on the good side, this gives Austen and I more time to prepare and help make the episode much better.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unfortunately, Austen lost all of his prepared content for today&#8217;s show, so we&#8217;ll have to postpone it. The good news is this will give me time to get a mixer with my Hanukkah money. But boy, when this show goes up, either next week or next weekend, it&#8217;s going to be a great show with all the new equipment we have. But what&#8217;s going to be on this terrific show, you say? Well, just don&#8217;t do all your holiday shopping just yet. Also, an update on hosting, we&#8217;ll probably get our hosting plan next week and start building a new site soon after.</p>
