For anyone who doubts that you can build muscle on a low carbohydrate diet because you don&amp;#8217;t have enough &amp;#8220;fuel&amp;#8221;, my brother is living proof that you can.

		<itunes:summary>I personally swim 3-4 times per week.The pool I swim in is chlorinated.

I also shower every day, in water that has been chlorinated by the city of Spokane, where I live.

How about you?

How much chlorine are you exposed to?

If you're a swimmer or triathlete, then it's probably quite a bit. If not, you're still getting significant chlorination from simply showering or bathing in your city's water.

Today, I speak with a naturopathic physician and nutritionist, Dr. David Getoff, about how to reduce the risk from swimming in chlorinated pools and drinking chlorinated water. I learned quite a bit during our discussion, and I think you will too.





During this audio interview, I ask David the following questions:


	Why does chlorine get added to pools?
	What type of potentially dangerous things might be happening to the body of someone who is swimming multiple times per week in the average chlorinated health club pool?
	Is there anything that can be done before, during or after swimming to reduce the damage, including nutrition supplements, foods or other strategies?
	Should swimmers use chlorine removing soaps, shampoos and conditioners, and if not, are there better, more natural solutions?
	Are there any types of nutrient, vitamin, mineral or hormone tests that a swimmer specifically should consider getting to see how chlorine may be affecting their body, or how able their body is to withstand damage from swimming in chlorine?
	Aside from a river or lake, are there alternatives to chlorinated pools, and if so, are they easy to find?
	When a swimmer is at home, what type of changes can they make to ensure that the water they're showering in and drinking is as healthy as possible?


In our discussion, Dr. Getoff recommends you also listen to the following:
-Vitamin C Lecture Part 1
-Vitamin C Lecture Part 2
In addition to Vitamin C, David also recommends the following supplements:
-Vitamin D (this is the one I recommend)
-Vitamin E (he recommends Unique E)
-Alpha lipoic acid  (the source I use is NutraRev)
For testing your antioxidant levels, David recommends:
-Metametrix ION Panel at DirectLabs 
For alternatives to chlorinated pools, David recommends:
-Absolute Ozone
-Grander Water filtration
At the end of our discussion, David also mention the Price-Pottenger Foundation, and a new education series he is putting out on that website very soon. I'd highly recommend you check that out as well.

Question, comments or feedback about how to reduce the risk from swimming in chlorinated pools? Leave them below!

P.S. My Dad wrote me after hearing this podcast. He mentioned that my great Uncle Bernie placed a structured water unit into the skimmer of his indoor pool, and within a week he went from using four chlorine pucks to one puck, his pump pressure was reduced by more than half, the slime on his tile disappeared, yellow staining on his steps disappeared and on and on and on. E-mail my Dad, Gary Greenfield, if you want more info on the unit he used in his home pool.</itunes:summary>

Listener Q&amp;A:
As compiled and read by Brock, the Ben Greenfield Fitness Podcast "sidekick".
Audio Question from John:
He just finished a sprint triathlon. He's been swimming all winter and spring but had a panic attack in the water during the race. Hung on to a canoe for the first time in his life. How can he avoid this in the future? How can he calm his mind during the swim.

Audio Question from Terri:
She has bowel/bathroom issues during her morning training runs. She eats breakfast, goes to bathroom, walks dogs, goes to the bathroom again, and then again a few more times during the run. She does not have this problem during afternoon and evening runs.

~ In my response to Terri, I mention CapraCleanse and the Squatty Potty.

Audio Question from Abe (sorry... I mean Dave):
He has an "Endurance Weekend" race coming up: 5k run on Friday, sprint triathlon Saturday morning, followed by 15 mile time trial. Then after a 3 to 4 hour break, there is a 25 mile road race. On Sunday morning there is a "crit". What would you do training, fueling and recovery for the week of the race?

~ Here is my magnesium oil.

Audio Question from John:
John is considering running the ING New York City Marathon. He has run 2 half marathons, goes to gym 4 times a week, and is in good shape (but could lose 5lbs around stomach). Has a slight case of hypermobility syndrome in his knee.</itunes:summary>

Listener Q&amp;A:
As compiled and read by Brock, the Ben Greenfield Fitness Podcast "sidekick".
Audio Question from Chris:
We frequently hear about fellow athletes having these profound medical events where they "crash" and it is determined they have a 80-90 percent blockage in an artery! I personally know of two fellow runners who have had this occurrence. Fortunately both survived after open heart surgery. I am amazed that we continually hear about active, well trained athletes who experience near death occurrences in spite of being active. Makes me wonder about all the efforts of preventative healthcare. I understand much of this can be hereditary but am surprised when a well performing athlete crashes with no previous indicators. I am sure that Listeners would be interested if there are test available to screen for life threatening blockages since it appears that it can strike athletes who are training and performing and show no signs in advance. Would a stress treadmill test be an indicator test?

~ In my response to Chris, I mention the HeartMath emWave2. I also mention this article. And (of course) the New England Journal of Medicine's Cardiac Arrest during Long-Distance Running Races.

Audio Question from Tony:
Udo Erasmus talks about how when you heat saturated fat you damage them and even if you have a good diet you can't reverse the damage from heated oil. What is your opinion on using it for cooking?

~ Episode #127: Why Saturated Fat Won't Kill You But Vegetable Oil Will

		<itunes:summary>Most of us know that workout songs and music can help you to exercise harder.

But if you understand how sound and music actually change your brain waves, you can use this knowledge to alter your mental and physical performance states with laser accuracy.

It sounds geeky, but I'm going to explain how...



At first glance, brain waves seem a bit like "woo-woo" science, and it can be a bit intimidating and confusing to understand how they work.

But here's the basics, which will really help you when you're listening to today's interview with Dr. Jeffrey Thompson about how sound affects your brain.

Your brain is made up of billions of brain cells called neurons, and your neurons (just like the rest of your body) use electricity to communicate with each other. As you can probably imagine, these millions of neurons sending signals all at once produces an enormous amount of electrical activity in your brain, and this can actually be detected using medical equipment like an electroencephalography (EEG), which measuring electricity levels over areas of your scalp.

When you graph the electrical activity of your brain using EEG, you generate what is called a brainwave pattern, which is called a "wave" pattern because of its cyclic, wave-like nature.

And the brainwave patterns are generally categorized like this:



Most of us live the majority of our lives in a state of primarily beta brain waves - aroused, alert, concentrated, but also somewhat stressed.

When we lower the brain wave frequency to alpha, we can put ourselves in an ideal condition to learn new information, perform more elaborate tasks, learn languages, analyze complex situations and even be in what sports psychologists call "The Zone", which is a state of improved focus and performance in athletic competitions or exercise. Part of this is because being the slightly decreased electrical activity in the brain can lead to significant increases in feel-good brain chemicals like endorphins, noroepinephrine and dopamine.

So, for example, when you meditate, you are focusing on something, whether it's a candle flame or your breath going in or out, or a mantra or a prayer. When you focus like that, the electrical patterns in your brain slow down and relax, and the amplitude of your brain-waves generally stabilizes in the alpha wave range.

But it turns out that you don't need to be a trained monk or meditate for weeks on end to be able to achieve this state of alpha brain wave relaxation.

Instead, you can use a concept called "brainwave entrainment" to get the same effect.

Brainwave entrainment is any method that causes your brainwave frequencies to fall into step with a specific frequency. It's based on the concept that the human brain has a tendency to change its dominant EEG frequency towards the frequency of a dominant external stimulus (such as music, or sound).

The type of sound frequencies that are typically used in brainwave entrainment are called "binaural" beats. The way that these work is that two tones close in frequency generate a beat frequency at the difference of the frequencies.

I know this sounds complicated, but it's pretty simple to understand when you think about it. For example, a 495 Hz audio tone and 505 Hz audio tone (whether overlaid in music or in a sound frequency) will produce a 10 Hz beat, roughly in the middle of the alpha brain wave range, like this:



 

OK, so now we get to the cool, practical application of using sound and music to enhance your brain and change your brain wave frequences.

I hunted down an expert, Dr. Jeffrey Thompson, from NeuroAcoustic.com, which produces and educates on using sound for stress reduction, relaxation, sleep enhancement, mega-learning, creativity, peak performance, meditation and higher states of consciousness.



In this interview with Dr. Thompson, we discuss:

-How sounds and frequencies affect human physiology...

Listener Q&amp;A:
As compiled and read by Brock, the Ben Greenfield Fitness Podcast "sidekick".
Robert says:
G'day Ben I have a question for the podcast. I wanted to know what your thoughts are on the Recovery Pump compression boots, also its competitor NormaTec also as a comparison. Their claims seem to be supported and they do what they claim to do from the literature I have read. Have you tried them? What would the effect of the recovery pump be when treating peroneal synovitis? Or other tendinopathies? Would you recommend this as a recovery modality with other traditional methods such as ice baths, NSAID's etc.

Kathryn asks:
I've read about recent research that found that swishing a mouthful of carbohydrate solution and then spitting it out rather than swallowing was effective in providing energy for a workout. Would this be an effective way to train in a fasted state occasionally, as Ben recommends, without the negative effects of inadequate fueling? I'm someone that doesn't tend to do well without food before my am workouts, even easy recovery type activity but I would like to try some fasted workouts occasionally.

Rob asks:
How many calories are you really burning when it is 10 degrees out. If I run 13 miles and my little Garmin says I have burned 1300 calories, how much does the cold, and my body dealing with the cold,</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Migraine headaches are different than other headaches. They're tough to get rid of, but very closely related to your nervous system activity, and specifically your autonomic nervous system response to foods and stress. Today, you'll learn how to use these concepts to get rid of migraine headaches forever.

This morning, my wife posted this to Facebook:



She's been struggling with occasional migraines for the past several years, but this month, I've witnessed her completely eliminate migraines and "stop them in their tracks" by fixing her body's pH levels - in other words, making her body less acidic.

So how can something like drinking green smoothies eliminate migraines?

In Podcast #191, I explained that migraine headaches can be multi-factorial -

...sometimes migraines can be caused by consumption of foods containing tyramine and histamine (such as cheeses, sauerkraut, kefir, alcohol and vinegar)...

...sometimes migraines can be caused by consumption of foods containing arginine (like nuts and chocolate)...

...but many times migraines can be caused by foods that leave a net acid load when they are metabolized by the body (such as the type of foods I talk about in today's podcast interview with Dr. Ted Morter), and this turned out to be the case with my wife.

In today's audio, I talk with Dr. Morter about how your body's acidity levels affect your health, mental and physical performance, and how doing something as simple as consuming a high amount of alkaline producing foods (such as the dark, leafy greens found in green smoothies), can reduce net acid load on the body and cause the autonomic nervous system to shut down the stress response that causes health problems like migraines.





Dr. Ted Morter is a trainer, author, researcher, Doctor of Chiropractic, and CEO of Morter HealthSystem and a founder of Dynamic Life Training seminars of North America, one of the fastest growing personal and professional development companies teaching health and wellness techniques for well over 40 years.

In my discussion with Dr. Morter, I ask him:


How is it that certain foods can affect the body's pH?
You say that the body is "alkaline by design and acid by function". What does this mean?
Can more than food affect the acid in our bodies?
What are examples of acid producing foods? What about alkaline producing foods?
If the body is exposed to a high amount of acid producing foods, does it have built in mechanisms to protect itself, and if so, how do those work?
What is the alkaline reserve, and why is it important?
How does this tie into the autonomic nervous system, and the "fight and flight" vs. "rest and digest" systems?
How is it that people can actually track their pH?
What do people need to do to get well and stay well?
You can find Dr. Morter's "BEST Living Kit" by clicking here. It includes a book, with 9 CD's that tell you what to do to fix your body's pH and your autonomic nervous system response to stress. My wife has been using this program to test her pH, adjust her pH using food and supplements, and get rid of her migraine headaches with this formula.

Listener Q&amp;A:
As compiled and read by Brock, the Ben Greenfield Fitness Podcast "sidekick".
Audio Question from Brandon:
How does a ketogenic diet relate to or work with the metabolic typing diet?

~ In my response to Brandon, I mention episode #187.

Audio Question from Joe:
Smoker for almost 10 years who quit cold turkey 2 years ago. Is an age grouper in great shape. The only issue is when he's stressed or has a good "buzz-on" he wants a cigarette. Are e-cigarettes a viable option to have in a pinch?

~ In my response to Joseph, I mention Dietary Supplements That Can Massively Control Your Most Intense Carb Cravings.

Dave asks:
There is a lot of old health trends being busted in the last 10 years, can you bust this one? Is ground turkey really more healthier than ground beef? I need to know... beef is sure more tastier!

Keith asks:
I know you like kombucha. What do you think about Mugi cha (barley tea)? It was in every kids thermos all summer long. Actually everyone drinks it from housewives to office workers.
Ice baths after exercise are all I hear about these days on podcasts and in magazines but here in Japan almost every house has a high tech bathtub and 40 deg C plus soaks are a nightly family ritual (my wife prefers 40 but her dad likes 42, I can only stand 39). Is a hot bath after a normal exercise session for an uninjured runner a no no?</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>When I was in college, one of my roommates was totally geeked out on body language.

He had shelves full of books about how to get what you want with your body language, including how to tell if people are lying based on their body language, how to sell with your body language, and how to get girls with your body language.

I remember being both fascinated and frustrated by his uncanny ability to know instantly if there was any shred of untruth in anything I told him, and also his ability to know exactly what I was thinking nearly 100% of the time.

Sometimes, he'd even have me tell him a story that I may or may not have contrived, and he instantly would know whether I was lying or telling the truth.

But is it really true that body language is that powerful, and, if so, could it be used to enhance human performance? In other words...

Can body language be used to "get what you want"?

Can your body language directly affect your health or fitness?

Are there things that you can do during a workout or event (like a marathon) with your body language to perform better?

Can body language help you to eat better or fix your diet?

I ask all these questions and more to Kirk Duncan in today's interview, and I also include a fantastic infographic: "How To Use Body Language To Be More Attractive".





Kirk Duncan (pictured right), president of 3 Key Elements, is a trainer, mentor and body language master.  I met Kirk in Utah a couple months ago, and went to one of his body language seminars. It was pretty powerful stuff.

Kirk's job is to help people find the obstacles that they face and show them how to get through them.  He has taken the tools he’s discovered through many years of observing people’s body language and developed a system for training and teaching others in such a way that they experience breakthroughs quickly and permanently.

Today, in this audio interview, Kirk teaches you the Art Of Looking Good With Your Body Language.

Also, be sure to check out the graphic below about using body language to be more attractive. The text gets a bit small in places, but you can click on the image to get a close-up.

Listener Q&amp;A:
As compiled and read by Brock, the Ben Greenfield Fitness Podcast "sidekick".
Audio Question from Megan:
When you do a big event like a marathon or Ironman in the days after the event is it true that you have a bigger caloric need. If so, what would the percentage be? She eats good/healthy food after the event but wants to know how much more she might need or not need to consume.

~ Resources I mention to Megan: Enerprime, Capragreens or SuperGreens, Tian Chi for adaptogenic herbs, Energy28 for Maca, Caprazymes and Caprobiotics, and Betaine HCL.

Audio Question from Josh:
Can seasonal allergies cause his heart rate to get really really low? In April and May he can't get into Zone 4 or 5 while riding. His standing rate is 40 or 50 BPM!

Christian says:
My wife and I ran a 1/2 marathon today. She appears to have a significant histamine reaction causing vasodilatation every time she runs significant distances. Her arms and legs turn purplish red and she feels her blood pressure drops. She dumps cold water on her arms each aid station and that helps some. The problem is worse when it is hot outside. Her hydration and nutrition are good. Her liquid nutrition has electrolytes and she adds a salt tablet to her water bottle. I recall your podcast interview about not needing electrolytes but adding salt seems to help her.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>In today's interview, I speak with a surgeon, engineer and relentless self-experimenter, Dr. Peter Attia (pictured above as he swims across the Catalina Channel), about whether it is possibly to be extremely active and eat a low carbohydrate diet.

If you've ever wondered whether it's possible to keep yourself in a "ketogenic", low carbohydrate state and still swim, bike, run, lift and do other extreme sports and activities, then this audio will answer all your questions.





Let's begin with a video of a workout being done by Dr. Attia, who I interview in today's podcast:





And he does all that while eating only 30-50 grams of carbohydrates per day!

Dr. Attia (pictured right) of Canada is a relentless self-experimenter who has spent the last two years examining the role of nutrition on all aspects of personal performance. He is a former McKinsey &amp; Company consultant, surgeon, engineer, calculus teacher and an author of numerous medical and research papers.

Dr. Attia received his medical degree from Stanford University and holds a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mathematics from Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, where he also taught and helped revamp the calculus curriculum. He did his surgical training at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He also did a fellowship in surgical oncology at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.

Dr. Attia's website, which we discuss during the interview, is WarOnInsulin.com.

Here are the questions that I ask him:
You have an interesting story. How did you come to start your website, WarOnInsulin.com, and what is it that you are trying to achieve?
You appear to keep yourself very fit. Walk us through a typical week of exercise for you.
For any given day, especially on these exercise days, about how many carbohydrates do you eat, and what does your eating look like?
How about before and during a long workout, like a long bike ride. What do you eat?
What is the science behind how your body is able to accomplish so much exercise with so few carbohydrates?
What research is out there that has been conducted on people exercising very long, very hard or both while eating low or no carbohydrates, and what has been observed in the research?
Is there a "maximum" amount of carbohydrates that would be considered healthy for frequently exercising individuals, such as enough carbohydrate to keep liver glycogen stores full?
Was this style of eating an easy transition for you, and how can people expect to feel if they try to combine high volume or high intensity exercise with carbohydrate restriction?
Have you found a "ceiling" for how long or how hard you can go while in a carbohydrate restricted phase?
Do you feel or have you observed a need to include carbohydrate re-feeding periods, whether specific days of the week, periods of the exercise year, or seasons in which you may eat more fruit or more carbohydrates than usual?
Have you found that particular dietary supplements or strategies help active individuals to succeed with or adhere to a low carbohydrate diet?
Some studies have shown low insulin and a low carb diet to reduce thyroid function or cause leptin resistance. Is that true, and if so, is it an issue?
Recommended reading as an additional resource:
-Art &amp; Science of Low Carbohydrate Living
-Low Carbohydrate Diet For Triathletes
Recommended supplements for long workouts:
-UCAN Superstarch - use plain flavor only (avoids the sucralose), 80-100 calories per hour
-MCT Oil - use 30-50ml 30-60 minutes prior to workout
Other resources:
-Blood glucose monitoring system
-Ketone strips

Ben recently posted a link entitled "carbs are killing you". This was pretty interesting and I am curious if you know where any of the information on this handout is coming from. The archive information only gives information about the website design. Is there any scientific evidence behind this,</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Last week, at Ironman 70.3 Galveston, Lance Armstrong decimated the field on the bike, but then slipped to a disappointing seventh place finish due to hydration and nutrition problems during the run.

So why does a guy like Lance Armstrong have gastrointestinal issues during a triathlon?

And what should you be eating during a triathlon?

In today's interview with Dr. Stacy Sims, you'll find out what to eat during a triathlon, and also learn fascinating new information about fueling that is going to change many of the recommendations that I personally make, and the way that I eat and drink during Ironman.



Dr. Stacy Sims is an Innovative Exercise Physiologist, and a Nutrition Scientist of Thermoregulation, Hydration, and Performance Nutrition, and also involved with "Kai Nutrition". She is an accomplished athlete in her own right, having ridden as an elite women's cyclist, won multiple Xterra events, and even raced as a pro triathlete. Her cutting edge research with athletes has led her to work with the likes of Garmin, RadioShack and Lance Armstrong where she has helped athletes of all abilities find the extra edge through science.



During my discussion with Stacy, I ask her:
How common are GI problems among runners and endurance athletes, in terms of rough percentages of athletes who have some kind of GI distress during a race?
What is going on physiologically during intense exercise or dehydration that can cause gut issues? 
Can use of any supplements or medications aggravate this issue even more?
Does exercise, and specifically a form of exercise like running, cause changes in your gut muscles or the way your intestines work?
Are these type of GI issues more prevalent in men or women, and if so, why?
What are the most common mistakes athletes make in terms of race day meal planning, and are there specific compounds (lactose, fructose, etc.) that should be avoided?
What do you think is the best carbohydrate fuel during exercise, and why? 
Do you think there are any issues with gels and if so, are there better solutions, like blocs, chomps or jelly beans?
What about sucralose and other artificial sweeteners?
There are a variety of concentrated sport drinks on courses, such as Powerbar Performance, Gatorade, etc. Are these OK to drink?
Do you think that endurance athletes should be using electrolytes, or would you agree more with the philosophy of Tim Noakes that the body does a pretty good job maintaining plasma sodium levels? If we do use electrolytes, are certain forms better than others?
Any final tips that can be using in a pinch to stop GI issues? 
So what were some of my biggest takeaways and changes that I will personally make in Half and Full Ironman triathlons, based on this discussion?

1) During races, begin using green tea extract, delta-E, or 5 hour energy - rather than coffee or caffeine tablets.

2) During the run, switch a sucrose or glucose based solution, and avoid fructose/maltodextrin sources. I'm doing more research on this right now, because here are the current gel options on the market (notice that Clif uses “brown rice syrup” which is basically sucrose).



3) If I do use any Powerbar Perform or GU Brew drinks during an event, dissolve 3 parts water to 1 part solution.

4)  Include 10-20g protein prior to races, or better yet, use a pre-digested aminos source such as MAP capsules

5) Avoid any electrolyte capsules or solutions that use chloride, and instead opt for carbonate, along with a trace minerals solution consumed during week of race and before race.

6) Keep Peppermint Tums on hand during run.

News Flashes:

	Interesting study &amp; suggests if you're taking an iron supplement do NOT take it in a 6 hour window around any workout.
	Even if you're exercising for 5 hours per week, a seated desk job still raises your risk of death. So stand more.
	It turns out those little unstable air pillows that you can stand on at the gym actually could be *bad* for performance.

Listener Q&amp;A:
Audio Question from Kelsey:
What is best to eat before bed? Garret Webber-Gale's nutritionist says carbs instead of protein or it will all turn to fat... is that true?

Audio Question from Patrick:
Wondering about heat susceptibility. If he can't take an icebath, he gets crazy headaches 24 hours after a hot/hard workout.

~ In my response to Patrick, I recommend CapraColostrum.

Audio Question from Mike:
Wants your opinion of the "Longevity" and "Six for Men" supplements.

Audio Question from Jared:
Wants some recommendations for videos he can watch to help his swimming technique as he prepares for a triathlon.

~ In my response to Jared, I recommend Swim Smooth, and especially the DVD's.

Bob asks:
If I train myself to be ketogenic, is that purely for health and fat burning? What about racing? Do I still eat the gels, etc. before/during a race? Or is that counter-productive?

Stephanie asks:
I need some advice on how to manage my tendonitis in my foot once and for all. In fall 2010, I completed my first marathon. During the end of my training, I started to develop pain on the inside of my left foot. I pushed my way through the race but was left limping for a week. The pain subsided enough to allow me to start running in April 2011. However, by August, I had to cease running due to extreme pain on the outside of my foot. An MRI determined that I had tendinitis and I spent 3 months in Physical Therapy. My foot has gotten better but it is still not 100%. What do you suggest in terms of stretching,</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>If you want to know how to stay fit as you age, today's double interview release is a must-listen.



The first interview is with Cary Nosler. Cary (pictured right) is 65 years old and has been a fitness enthusiast for the past 50 years. He is a wealth of knowledge about how to stay fit as you age and what happens to your body when you get older.



During our interview, Cary talks about:
-How to deal with the mental aspects of aging and exercise....
-How to stay motivated to exercise as you get older...
-What a typical day of exercise look like for him...
-How to figure out what expectations to have for yourself as they age...
-How to balance what doctors and medical community says you should do with what you feel like doing...
-How to deal with the accumulated injuries that happen to everyone who exercises, especially as you age...
-Considerations for nutrition, supplements, and hormone balance as you age...
Cary also has a weekly radio show on the Wide World Of Health Radio, in which he interviews health experts from around the world!
----------------------------------
The second interview is with Elizabeth Ruiz (pictured right).
Elizabeth is a coach at Pacific Elite Fitness. With over 20 years racing experience as an elite road and track cyclist, Elizabeth garnered 11 Florida state championship titles, as well as podium finishes in triathlon, duathlon, road and trail running.
With time spent in the racing trenches, she has first hand experience of the challenges of preparation, travel, and race day performance, as well as how to optimize the way that you feel and your growth hormone levels as you age.
During our discussion, Elizabeth answers the following questions:
-What is growth hormone and why should we care about it? 
-Is there a way to test for growth hormone levels? If so, what test is best? 
-What happens if you're deficient in growth hormone? 
-How common are deficiencies in active men and women? 
-How can you naturally raise growth hormone levels? 
-Is taking growth hormone illegal or dangerous, or does it depend on the type of supplement you use?

Listener Q&amp;A:
Audio question from Matt:
Wants to know what he should ask his doctor about at his annual physical.

~ In my response to Matt, I reference: www.directlabs.com, www.cyrexlabs.com, bioletics.com, and pacificfit.net

Audio question from Dave:
Curious about Oil Pulling.

Audio question from Jenn:
Is returning to running after injury and wondering about using a very frequent but short walk/run technique.

~ In my response to Jenn, I mention Jeff Galloway's walk/run ratios.

Audio question from Jared:
How to improve tendon and ligament strength and durability.

~ In my response to Jared, I recommend Capraflex.

Audio question from Bob:
Looking for recommendations for mobility exercises to help with Olympic Lifting.

~ In my response to Bob I reference these two videos:



Audio question from Chuck:
Help with recovering from a hamstring tear. Also can a ketogenic diet starve out cancer cells?

Audio question from John:
Wants some ideas for Compex Sport Elite protocols.

Kyoko asks:
Can I select whatever type of flour I like? Or, is there any important things I should look at?

Pam asks:
I just got done listening to episode 180 when you mention that people with Hashimotos should avoid nightshades. I am 37, and was diagnosed with Hahsi's at 16. I feel pretty good for the most part. I maintain an active lifestyle, and have good energy in all that I do. I treat my Hashi's with synthroid (.150mcg) and monitor the condition pretty much through blood work. I have a couple questions regarding nightshade food. 1) What exactly are the reasons they should be avoided? 2) How do I know if they are having a negative effect on me? 3) Should they be avoided if there is no noticeable effect?

~ In my response, I recommend the book: Why Do I Still Have Thyroid Symptoms When My Lab Tests Are Normal?

		<itunes:summary>Ever wondered how to test and fix your body's biochemistry?

You're going to learn how, and learn 8 ways to get your body operating like a finely tuned engine in today's episode with Dr. Ryan Bentley.



Dr. Bentley has been described as one of the brightest young leaders in the field of nutritional medicine. A true innovator, Dr. Bentley has emerged on the national scene in natural medicine circles with his engaging seminars and his book, "Sex, Lies &amp; Cholesterol", which is being praised by practitioners and lay people alike.

Dr. Bentley is the co-founder and CEO of The Wellness Prescription - created to educate practitioners on how to construct proven, objective, and quantifiable systems and protocols to help their patients reach optimal health. He has taught his principled nutritional approach to thousands of doctors around the country.

In this interview with Dr. Bentley, you're going to learn 8 ways to get your body operating like a finely tuned engine.



Our discussion includes:
-Acid Base balance - why taking electrolytes isn't the key to stopping cramps, and what strips electrolytes from your body...
-Oxidative stress - what you don't realize that most athletes truly die from...

-Inflammation - how to truly test the amount of inflammation in your body...
-Liver and kidney stress - how your liver can make you fat...
-Carbohydrate metabolism - why you can't just monitor your blood sugar, and what else you need to test...
-How to balance your cellular respiration, electrolyte balance and hydration...
-Protein metabolism - how to find out if you're eating to much or too little protein, and if you're digesting it properly...
-Adrenal stress - the specific vitamin deficiencies that make you more prone to overtraining and adrenal fatigue...
-How to find your emotional button to ensure that you're able to actually adhere to the lifestyle changes that Dr. Bentley recommends...

During our discussion, Ryan graciously offered for you to e-mail him if you have more questions about how to test for these issues or fix them. His e-mail is: rbentley@wellnessprescriptions.net

	It would be interesting to see if hypoxic swimming has a similar effect on boosting your hormone levels.
	Sure…if you're running 3 times a week recovery is overrated. But I've never met Ironman triathletes who don't benefit from ice, antioxidants, etc.
	How long does it take to recover after a marathon?

-----------------------------------------------------
Listener Q&amp;A:
Tom asks:
I've been hearing a lot out of Jack Kruse, a neurosurgeon-gone-paleo, about cold thermogenesis for health and fat loss. I'd love to hear your take on cold thermogenesis for general health and/or fat loss, as well as its potential use as a training/recovery tool.

~ In my response to Tom, I mention this recent Get-Fit Guy article, and my previous interview with Ray Cronise.

Melanie asks:
I know you had an interview regarding metabolic typing, but I wanted to know how much stock you put in the details of these type of "diets". I am a protein type and I know that is right for me, but I did the metabolic typing from the Wolcott group website and received a specific list of foods to eat and ones to avoid. Some of the ones for me to avoid are ones that are in the "eat" category in your food pyramid. For example, I'm supposed to rarely have yogurt, cabbage, berries,</itunes:summary>

	Carob is a great alternative to chocolate. Compared to chocolate it has higher calcium count (three times as much), no caffeine content, nor fat, and presents your taste buds with a different experience. It's also high in Iron, Vitamin B, Phosphorus, Magnesium, fiber and protein.
	Top injury sites for the long distance triathletes includes lower back (17.9%), Achilles tendons (14.3%), and knees (14.2%). Among the short to intermediate distance triathletes, most injuries occurred in the knees (44%), calf (20%), hamstrings (20%), and lower back (20%).
	A group of healthy, active individuals were instructed to cut back on their activity for 3 consecutive days. What they found was that their blood sugar levels spiked 26% more than it normally would have, and that the spikes increased slightly over each successive day.

Listener Q&amp;A:
Audio Question from Jennifer:
Is liposuction an option or a last resort?

Audio Question from Jake:
15 weeks out from Ironman with chronic calf strain.

Eric asks:
I've been hearing a lot about P.A.P. training and was hoping you could help define what it is and how it may help endurance athletes.

Andrei asks:
I keep hearing about how after an workout you have to eat to replenish the glycogen storage. Also, during a long training run or a race, you have to ingest carbs to top your glycogen storage. My question is if you can do this with fat or protein, not carbs.</itunes:summary>

This mineral is essential for more than 300 reactions in your body, including nerve and cardiac function, muscle contraction and relaxation, protein formation, and perhaps most importantly for the triathlete, synthesis of [...]&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

In today's audio interview, I interview author and nutrition professor Marion Nestle - who is also featured in the excellent "Rise &amp; Future Of the Food Movement" video lecture, about food politics, and how the food industry influences your nutrition and health.



Marion has authored three books, all of which are very good reads if you want to know more about how lobbying, marketing and other political actions affect the quality, safety and price of your food:
-Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health
-Safe Food: Bacteria, Biotechnology, and Bioterrorism
-Why Calories Count
Finally, although it's not directly tied to my conversation with Marion, I thought that during this election year, the following infographic would be fun for you to check out.
Which one are you? And do the food profiles below really  match your political persuasion? Leave your comments below!</itunes:summary>

Listener Q&amp;A:
Audio Question from Martin:
Asking about Cortisol levels.

~ In my response I recommend MAP for amino acids. At www.pacificfit.net, I recommend - Recoverease, Solar Synergy, TianChi.

Anonymous wrote:
My husband is a marathoner, and is training for his first full Ironman. I am supportive and interested in his athletic exploits as a shorter distance runner and a group exercise instructor myself. However, his training starts to take a toll when his athletic exploits start to interfere with our sexual exploits. During marathon training his sex drive takes a significant dip. During Ironman training it has been even more noticeable. I have read that endurance training can actually inhibit testosterone production. Is there a natural dietary way to boost testosterone while training? If not, is there a way he should alter his training and/or diet once he completes this event to "reset" his natural sex drive? He hasn't had his testosterone tested, he doesn't have ED, he's not totally exhausted from training, and our relationship is otherwise healthy and happy. We are in our mid twenties.

~ In my response, I reference this free video/pdf I produced, and  www.Tri-Ripped.com. Also OptiMale and Vitrix (tribulus).

Scott asks:
How and why should I jump rope? What are the benefits and what's the best workout routine? What kind of rope should I use? How many calories are typically burned? I'm looking for an overview of rope work.

I am going to be entering a mountain bike race this spring in Sandpoint, Idaho. I have about 3 months to get fully prepared.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>If you read "12 Mental Performance Hacks: A Cheat Sheet For Boosting Your Brain Power", you may have noticed that suggestion #7 recommended that you take a compound called "Huperzine", and mentioned Chinese herbal mix "Tian Chi" as a source of club moss, since club moss contains natural levels of Huperzine.

But that article just scratched the surface when it comes to how to use Chinese herbs.



So in today's audio interview with the inventor of Tian Chi and Chinese diplomat of herbology Roger Drummer, you'll learn everything you need to know about how to boost your brain power with Chinese herbs.



You'll also learn:
-Why you need to be careful with which Chinese herbs you choose and use...
-How most Chinese herb supplement manufacturers "water down" their formulations...
-The best time of day to take Chinese herbs...
-A shocking discovery Ben made when he combined Chinese herbs and heart rate variability testing...
-And much more!


The highly concentrated Chinese herb mix that I've personally been taking on a daily basis is Tian Chi. I'd highly recommend that you treat yourself to just one box and use it for the next 20-30 days so that you can see what it feels like to have your neurons firing at peak capacity.

Click here for a full list of the ingredients in Tian Chi. You can get it now with free shipping when you click here and use code FREETIANCHI (expires March 9).

Vegan runner who eats well and takes CoQ10, Hawthorn (ect…) and still has high blood pressure. What else can he do?

~ In my response to Tom, I mention heart rate variability testing using the emWave.

Audio Question from Clay:
Wants some help with his exercise induced asthma (beyond his inhaler).

Kyle asks:
This is a totally serious question, I saw this mentioned in a discussion about over training. Is there any basis behind the theory of nocturnal penile tumescence being an indicator or not of testosterone level, and possible being over trained?

Ian says:
How effective are Curves Women's gyms from both a weight loss and fitness point of view? My wife's main goal is weight loss at the moment so she wants to know if she'd be better off hitting a gym with a pool, treadmill, bike, classes, etc and losing her Curves membership.
