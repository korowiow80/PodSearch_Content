			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today is a bit of a history lesson. We explain how feedburner used to be THE way to get your RSS feed &#8220;iTunes Ready.&#8221; Now there are plugins like PowerPress which we discussed ina previous episode.</p>
<p>Likewise, &#8220;Back in the day&#8221; iTunes was a huge deal (and still accounts for 59% of my traffic). Over time they went from making it super easy to subscribe to podcasts ot making it not so easy to subscribe to podcasts. This doesn&#8217;t mean you ignore iTunes, but it does mean you should ALWAYS have a button for your &#8220;Reulgar&#8221; RSS feed so people that aren&#8217;t using iTunes (like on a phone, or some other type of &#8220;podcatcher&#8221;) can subscribe to your podcast. To see how to subscribe to a podcast manually, see <a title="Learn to Subscribe to A Podcast" href="http://www.learntosubscribe.com" target="_blank">www.learntosubscribe.com</a></p>
<h2>Try Somethng New With Your Podcast</h2>
<p>I tried an experiment with my Logical Weight Loss podcast. I recorded it on my Roland R-05 portable recorder. I was worried since it didn&#8217;t have the &#8220;Professional&#8221; sound of me in a studio and people might tune out. Instead people LOVE the fact that I&#8217;m inspiring them to get off the couch and get moving themselves. They loved the sounds of nature in the background. I asked the question in the podcast, and had quite a number of people replay and tell me they loved it. With this in mind, don&#8217;t be afraid to try something new in your podcast. If they had hated it, I would&#8217;ve quit and learned a lesson.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we focus on a new website that enables people to pay podcasters, and we also look into mp3 tags and show notes, and we also look into the iTunes guidelines that will have you getting kicked out of the iTunes podcast directory.</p>
<h2>Flattr Wants to Help Podcasters Get Paid</h2>
<p>This is a new service (started in 2010) that makes it easy for people to &#8220;flatter&#8221;.</p>
<p>Let’s say I put aside $10 a month to “Flatter” people with, and I click 10 different <a href="http://davidjackson.org/flattr" target="_blank">flattr</a> buttons on websites.Each person gets $1. The more people I click, the smaller amount given to each. To “flatter” someone, when I visit their website I will have to login to my <a href="http://davidjackson.org/flattr" target="_blank">Flattr</a> account, and from there it’s one click. In reading the idea behind flattr, the developers felt <a href="http://davidjackson.org/paypal" target="_blank">paypal</a> donations required too much work. I’m not sure I agree with that.</p>
<p>Flattr is integrated with dailymotion.com website, and also with the <a title="Instacast Podcatching App" href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=Ee5nlwqyAws&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Finstacast%252Fid420368235%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="_blank">Instacast Podcatcing software </a>for the iphone. Now users of instacast will be able to flatter the podcaster with one click in the app. There is also a setting in <a title="Instacast" href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=Ee5nlwqyAws&amp;offerid=146261&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0&amp;tmpid=1826&amp;RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Finstacast%252Fid420368235%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="_blank">Instacast </a>to allow it to flatter every podcast that the listener consumes in the app.  I was informed by some folks at flattr that &#8221; podcasting is our most successful category, there’s a well-known German podcaster Tim Pritlove (he has at least one show in English too) who has publicly revealed that he makes €2500 (that should be over $3000) per month after tax. Oh, and for the Android users <a title="Podkicker Pro" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.podkicker&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Podkicker Pro</a> just integrated Flattr in a similar way.&#8221;</p>
<p>For podcasters using WordPress there is a plugin that will add a flattr button at the bottom of every post (or you can customize it). This was super easy to install and setup. (you can see this at the bottom of this post). The plugin also puts the flattr button in your feed (if you want).</p>
<p>Their catalog is not very cast at this point, and as people sign up they are going to want to flattr people so you might want to sign up while this is still growing.</p>
<h2>MP3 Tags and Show Notes</h2>
<p>ID3 tags are entered into the media (audio and video) before you upload it to the Internet. I typically put a summary of the show (entered into the comments section). Also be sure to enter an image. Two software titles I recommend is <a title="Mp3 Tag Edior" href="http://www.mp3tag.de/en" target="_blank">MP3 </a>tag, and <a title="ID3 Editor" href="http://www.pa-software.com/id3editor/" target="_blank">ID3 Editor</a> ($15 Mac).</p>
<p>Show notes are typically a blog post where you should write about your episode (I try to do 300 words).</p>
<h2>Getting Kicked Out Of iTunes</h2>
<p>Her are the iTunes Submission Rules</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Technical problems, usually the lack of episodes or the inability to download or play episodes. These problems can almost always be avoided by testing your feed using Subscribe to Podcast in the Advanced menu prior to submission.</em></li>
<li><em>Requirement of a login or password to access the feed or any of the episodes.</em></li>
<li><em>Strong prevalence of sexual content.</em></li>
<li><em>Use of explicit language in the title, description or cover art of the podcast.</em></li>
<li><em>Use of explicit language in the podcast when the <code>&lt;explicit&gt;</code> tag is not set to “yes”.</em></li>
<li><em>Apparent misuse of copyrighted material or other violation of third party rights.</em></li>
<li><em>Inclusion of offensive material, such as racist content or child pornography.</em></li>
<li><em>Misrepresentational use of Apple copyright, including “<a href="http://davidjackson.org/ipod" target="_blank">iPod</a>,” “iPhone,” “<a href="http://davidjackson.org/ipad" target="_blank">iPad</a>,” “Apple TV” and “iTunes.”</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>In general, if there’s something that you want to convey about your feed, please do so in the summary field in your RSS feed, not in the content of an episode</em></p>

Flattr Wants to Help Podcasters Get Paid
This is a new service (started in 2010) that makes it easy for people to "flatter".

Let’s say I put aside $10 a month to “Flatter” people with, and I click 10 different flattr (http://davidjackson.org/flattr) buttons on websites.Each person gets $1.

<h2>Media Hosting For Podcasting and Membership Websites</h2>
<p>Courtney this is a hard solution to find. With podcasting you need/want stats and lots of unwanted bandwidth (something like Libsyn &#8211; use code sopfree to get your first month first). With a memberhsip site you want your media in a location you can lock down tight (like your <a title="Host Gator Web Hosting" href="http://www.schoolofpodcasting.com/hosting" target="_blank">website host</a> &#8211; assuming you don&#8217;t have a TON of members). Amazon S3 appears cheap, <strong><a title="Amazon S3 for Podcast Publishing" href="http://davidjackson.org/2010/05/why-and-how-im-moving-from-amazon-s3/" target="_blank">but its not </a></strong>once you get a few episodes under your belt and then you wind up with expensive bandwidth bills. You had mentioned Google drive, but there are no stats and no pricing for bandwidth.  The good news is there are scripts like <a title="Mamgic Member Membership Scipt for WordPress" href="http://www.schoolofpodcasting.com/magicmembers" target="_blank">Magic Members</a> or <a title="Digital Access Pass" href="http://www.schoolofpodcasting.com/digitalpass" target="_blank">Digital Access pass</a> that not only protect content, but also protect downloads.  Keep in mind, if soneone REALLY wants to steal your downloads they will (and they weren&#8217;t going to buy your stuff anyway).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Do I NEED to use an Insert Jack?</h2>
<p>Steve McQueen (his real name) wrote in and asekd:</p>
<p>I have the <a title="Behringer 1202 Mixer" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J5Y282/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sop-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000J5Y282" target="_blank">Behringer 1202</a> and an <a title="Alesis 3630" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000WS6UY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=sop-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0000WS6UY" target="_blank">Alesis 3630</a> I got cheap. (Not a popular compressor from what I have read) My mic is a Rode Procaster and I use a Tascam DR-07. Do you need to use a mixer with the <a title="Insert Jacks Explained at Wiki Pedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insert_%28effects_processing%29" target="_blank">insert jack</a>?</p>
<p>A compressor makes the loud parts software and the soft parts louder (giving you a consistent audio level). The quick answer is no you do not HAVE to use an insert jack.<br />
I&#8217;ve done that with my little Behringer mixer. I either plug my mic into the compressor (if it has XLR inputs) and then plug the compressor into the mixer (and mixer into recorder). Or I plug my mic into the mixer, and then the output of the mixer into the compressor, and then the compressor into my recorder. I&#8217;ll Google and see if there is any major difference</p>
<h2>Problems with Pamela Skype Recording Software &#8211; No Active Call</h2>
<p>Tina from episode 300 is having issues with Pamela for recording Skype calls. I&#8217;ve tried this software twice and couldn&#8217;t get it to work in either case. I recommend using a portable recorder to record skype. HOwever, not everyone can afford that, so if yo have to use software is use Powergramo. If you&#8217;re on a Mac look for total recorder.</p>
<h2>Want to Split Costs at BlogWorld NYC?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ll be at BlogWorld in June, and the hotels in NYC are expensive. I&#8217;m looking for someone to split the cost of the hotel. If you&#8217;re interested and attending, please <a title="Contact" href="http://schoolofpodcasting.com/contact-the-school-of-podcasting/">contact me</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to really find a topic that had not been addressed in the podcast world. This is do I have to be an ego maniac to start a podcast? Are all podcasters narcissist? Is it all about them? I through this out the a podcasting group at Linked in and here are some of their responses to the question, &#8220;Podcaster Ego, How much is too much?&#8221; When I first thought about Ego, and egomaniacs, this was must original thought:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>If you don&#8217;t believe in yourself, you&#8217;ll never have the courage to press the record button. On the flip side if you think every word coming out of your mouth is golden, you might be in for a rude awakening (content &#8211; not you &#8211; is king). It hasn&#8217;t hurt Rush Limbaugh, Donald Trump, Paris Hilton, Howard Stern etc. But then again these people are polarizing (loved and hated with extreme passion)&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p><a title="Jim Meeker" href="http://www.ctrlaltdeliver.com/" target="_blank">Jim Meeker</a> said this:</p>
<p>Anytime that anyone presents their content, in any medium, as being &#8220;the only way&#8221;, the ego of producing a podcast turns to the egomaniacal. And no matter how you slice it, it just ain&#8217;t pretty <img src='http://schoolofpodcasting.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  I find humility and a soft stick to be much more enticing when it comes to podcasting. When I feel that the podcaster is just being natural and &#8220;sharing their passion&#8221; for whatever the content, I am more inclined to return to the podcast for a second listen. So, yes, I have tuned out of podcasts that I felt that there was an arrogance to the host.</p>
<p><a title="Steve Hart" href="http://www.stevehart.co.nz/" target="_blank">Steve Hart</a> said this:</p>
<p>If the podcaster lets their ego get in the way of addressing criticism or listening properly to what other people say, then that is when ego becomes an issue.<br />
Podcasters can have all the ego in the world, but the ego must be matched with an equal amount of humility for it not to become destructive.</p>
<p><a title="Charlie Hays" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/charleyhays" target="_blank">Charlie Hays</a> had this to say:</p>
<p>To me, one side of the line is that you need to have confidence in yourself and your knowledge / expertise in your chosen niche as well as mic delivery and creating compelling content that grabs an audience&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>On the other side, when the show is more about promoting personal agendas and less about creating compelling content, your ego has become too big. I have unsubscribe from a handful of podcasts for this very reason.</p>
<p>I know that more people than ever are making money from podcasts which is great, but when 1/4 of the show is infomercials or testimonials or content that is not related to the shows topic, that does not interest me personally, even though I can fast forward through a podcast.</p>
<p>Here are some other quotes on being an &#8220;Egomaniac&#8221; from people you may have heard of:</p>
<p>&#8220;If being an egomaniac means I believe in what I do and in my art or music, then in that respect you can call me that&#8230; I believe in what I do, and I&#8217;ll say it.&#8221;<br />
-John Lennon</p>
<p>&#8220;To have ego means to believe in your own strength. And to also be open to other people&#8217;s views. It is to be open, not closed. So, yes, my ego is big, but it&#8217;s also very small in some areas. My ego is responsible for my doing what I do &#8211; bad or good.&#8221;<br />
Barbara Streisand</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a huge ego and a huge inferiority complex at the same time.&#8221;<br />
Barry Gibb</p>
<h2>Balancing Your Ego in Podcasting</h2>
<p>You need to be able to speak to be a podcaster. The number one fear of humans is speaking in public. This means to start a podcast you need to overcome the number one fear of most people. Sure, talking into a microphone in a basement is not in technically in front of people, but in a way it is. You need to have something to say.</p>
<p>Confidence in knowing what you know is great. I was amazed (being a musician my whole life, and a Beatles fan) that my wife could not name the original drummer of the Beatles (Pete Best &#8211; Pre &#8211; Ringo). I never thought of it, but I do have a lot of information about music, history, etc. I was the only kid in first grade who knew who Jimi Hendrix was when he died.  If you have information that other people may not know, you may be viewed as an expert. You may not feel like an expert, but if you have spent time in your topic you probably know more than most people. Share it, and find other like you.</p>
<p>For me balancing your ego is (to use my teaching background) throwing out the top and worst and keeping the middle. While it&#8217;s nice to have the person that just GUSHES about your podcast, they may not have made it to those episodes that you&#8217;re not as proud of. Likewise, the scathing review you read in iTunes about your podcast burned and was painful to read. That person may not have been your target audience.</p>
<h2>Good Ego &#8211; Bad Ego</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example when an ego is good, and an ego derails a podcast</p>
<p><strong>Good</strong> &#8211; You miss an episode. You know there are people who listen every week. You take a few minutes toward the end of the podcast to explain the lack of show last week. This is a courteous gesture to your audience, and shows a sincere appreciation for their devotion to regular listening.</p>
<p><strong>Bad</strong> &#8211; The podcaster launches into a 10 minute explanation about why they missed last week&#8217;s episode. Feeling guilty they go into insane amounts of detail explaining why they missed last week.  <em>In my opinion</em> this shows that the podcaster has a belief that his audience is waiting with intense anticipation for the next episode. That they are barely surviving without your podcast. Get a grip. You&#8217;re no longer talking about your passion, but instead are talking about you. Your ego has go you off topic.  The truth (from what I&#8217;ve experienced an heard), most podcasters <em>may</em> get <em>some</em> feedback if they miss an episode, but you&#8217;ll be surprised just how well your audience got along without you.</p>
<h2> New Stats at Libsyn</h2>
<p>Libsyn announced that they have weaked their stats to better reflect mobile downloads. In the past if a mobile phone started to download a podcast and then was interrupted when it started again it boosted your stats. Now they have tweaked their stats to better identify this situation. What this means is their stats are going to be more accurate, but your numbers may take a small dip. For more information about Libsyn, go to libsyn.com and if you sign up use the promo code sopfree to get your first month free.</p>
<h2>Great Tool For Show Notes</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve said in the past that one way to organize your show notes is to write them in WordPress and save them as a draft (and the publish them when you release the show). This stops you from having to them type them twice. However, when you are out and about this means you have to remember your idea, etc until you get back to a computer. If you have a smartphone, you can use Evernote and clip websites, type notes, record audio notes, and more. This is not a new tool, but I&#8217;ve been a little late jumping on the <strong><a title="Ever Note" href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote </a></strong>bandwagon. I&#8217;ve heard it was cool, and after using it I can agree.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being that I&#8217;ve done 300 episodes of this podcast I took some time this week to think about the &#8220;Die hard&#8221; truths of podcasting as I see it. If this was a football team, it would be able learning how to tackle. Without that skill you&#8217;re sunk. The tips that (from my chair) are the CORE of podcasting.</p>
<p>1. It&#8217;s not about you &#8211; its about your audience&#8217;s passion.</p>
<p>Even when I do a show about me (Building a Better Dave) I still want the audience to do something with the info (laugh, cry, think, grown, learn). Answer every email. Respond to every comment. Connect in as many ways as you can. Chances are these people are just like you. In this episode I talk with one of my listeners who turned me on to a new tool for WordPress themes. We always say talk about your passion. That&#8217;s true. That&#8217;s podcasting 101. In the end it&#8217;s about your audience&#8217;s passion. In theory your audience will end up mirroring you and your passion.</p>
<p>2. Pick a Schedule and Stick with it.</p>
<p>I have done a podcast and a newsletter for musicians for 10 years (podcast for 7). At the end of last year I just couldn&#8217;t find anything to create shows around. My publishing was very unreliable. I was averaging anywhere from 700-1200 downloads per episode. This year I dedicated to putting out a show a week even if its shorter. When I checked my stats, I&#8217;m averaging 150-250 downloads per episode. I also changed the name of this podcast (but didn&#8217;t change the feed). All I can learn from this is people want to be able to count on you.</p>
<p>3. Abandon The Idea of Free Podcasting</p>
<p>You can paint with peanut butter. It&#8217;s true. Should you? Probably not. Can you podcast for free? Kind of. Should You? No. I recommend you get a website host ($7 a month), and a media host ($15 a month &#8211; use Libsyn promo code <strong>sopfree</strong> to get your first month free).</p>
<p>4. Resist the Impulse to Start Another Podcast</p>
<p>When you get your first one off the ground, your next urge is to start another five podcasts. Unless you have a lot of time on your hands, its probably better to focus on putting out great content.</p>
<p>5. Resist The Impulse to Spill All Your Beans</p>
<p>As Content is King, when you get a giant surge of content resist the urge to make a special two hour episode. Instead pace yourself, and while you deploy this information you will have time to find more great content that you will deliver when the surplus is gone. This is so easier said than done.</p>
<p>6. Content Is King</p>
<p>If your information doesn&#8217;t MOVE me, I&#8217;ve got way to many options to listen/watch your mediocrity. What do you want people to do with your information? How do you want them to feel?</p>
<p>7. Presentation is Queen</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget your album art. Get some decent equipment, produce an intro and outro, and have ways for people to contact you. If you are looking for sponsors, your website should be clutter free.</p>
<p>8. Promotion is the Jack</p>
<p>Man does not live by content alone. If you build it, they might stumble over it. You build your audience one at a time. Get to know them using tools like Polldaddy, Survey monkey (Blubrry, Libsyn, and Podtrac have tools as well), go to where they are, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">make friends</span>, THEN tell them about your podcast. There is no giant switch that will give you 1000 subscribers. Make sure everyone in your family has a business card that points people to your site. Make sure site makes it easy to listen to your show. Then the content can suck them in.</p>
<p>9. If this is your first podcast, forget about going LIVE for a while.</p>
<p>CNET just put out a statement that they cancelled some of their podcasts because nobody was listening live. The power of podcasting is people can listen whenever they want. To the best of my knowledge, there is no Podcaster who has more listeners live then downloads (not counting Radio people who put out their show as a podcast). I&#8217;m talking about people who started in podcasting. Even Leo Laporte who HAS a radio show has stated publicly that his live to download ratio is very heavy on the download side. When you do &#8220;live&#8221; you add more technology, and more complexity and the return on your investment is very little. Yes its fun to get live feedback, but when you are first starting out I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth the extra effort. This is <em>strictly</em> my opinion.</p>
<p>10. Drop the idea that your podcast should be &#8220;this long.&#8221;<br />
Unless you&#8217;ve got a legit reason, I would not worry that your podcast is not &#8220;an hour&#8221; or &#8220;40 miutes&#8221; long. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. It should be in the ballpark. Don&#8217;t do a five minute podcast and then follow it with a 90 minute episode. For me, a podcast should be just long enough to cover your topics in the episode and not a minute more. But Dave what about talking about myself to build listener loyalty and that relationship you always talk about. THAT&#8217;s a great point. Lead with your best stuff first (the content) and anyone still listening will love to learn about you.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS TIP Quit Waiting to Be Perfect</strong></p>
<p>If you are waiting for the seas to part, and the perfect room with the perfect microphone, and after this, or if this would just happened THEN you would podcast, I want to share with you the immortal words of David Lee Roth (one of my heroes growing up ) he said, &#8220;I have a two word plan, &#8220;let&#8217;s go.&#8221; You can get paralysis by analysis, and eventually you WILL HAVE TO PRESS RECORD.</p>
<p><strong>SUPER JUMBO DELUXE TIP</strong></p>
<p>Be careful talking about your family. Be careful trying to be &#8220;Edgy&#8221;. You never know who is listening. It might be your future mother-in-law, or your future boss.</p>
<h2>Reaching Out To My Audience</h2>
<p>As this episode is all about my audience when I got an email from Tina, I sent back a reply asking her to ask the question live. Later that night we got on skype and made it happen.</p>
<p>Tina is starting a podcast about home schooling. She wanted to know how much to share about herself. I explained at first your audience doesn&#8217;t know you (and may not be interested in a 10 minute lesson on Tina). This doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t explain your motives, and give some &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; info. I just wouldn&#8217;t lead with it. In radio, or TV (especially the news) they always lead with their &#8220;top story.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can find Tina at</p>

I purchased it at best Buy for around $23 dollars. The interesting thing is I can purchase this microphone at Amazon for $3. This probably explains why it sounds like a $3 microphone.</p>
<h3>Podcast Co-Hosts Checklist</h3>
<p>From <a title="Steeden Crowe" href="http://www.steedencrowe.com" target="_blank" class="broken_link">Steeden Crowe</a> via the Vociemail button on the right side of the screen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you find a co-host?&#8221;</p>
<p>Typically co-hosts come from people you hang around with or are in your community (in this case photographers). I don&#8217;t know of any &#8220;find a co-host&#8221; specific resources. As for other podcasters, I would find one that fits your idea and regularly contribute, and the host <em>may</em> eventually ask you to co-host. Some people enjoy being in control (a solo podcaster makes all the decisions and has say over every aspect). With that said here are some things to think about when it comes to co-host.</p>
<p>1. Time zone (makes it hard to get together when there is a 6 hour difference).<br />
2. Passion. They need to match your passion for the subject.<br />
3. Readiness. You are ready to go. Do they need to wait 6 months before buying their first microphone?<br />
4. Schedule: It takes 4 minutes for every minute of produced podcast (so a 15 minute podcast takes an hour). You need to decide on weekly, twice a week, once a month. Whatever the schedule is stick to it, but make sure your co-host and you agree on it.</p>
<p>Then once you get a co-host you need to get in writing:<br />
1. Who owns the name of the podcast (see Pink Floyd) .<br />
2. What happens if someone quits.<br />
3. What will get someone fired.<br />
4. Who does what (one may do all the technical while the other handles twitter and facebook, etc).<br />
5. How will you split up the money if any rolls in?<br clear="all" /><br />
For now do you know anyone in your immediate circles that might be interested? If not go to a forum for photography and mention you are thinking of starting a podcast and are looking for a potential co-host.</p>

<h3>I&#8217;m Speaking at Blogworld in NYC</h3>

It&#8217;s June 5-7. They are looking to really boost the Podcasting track this year. having Cliff at the helm should be a fun boost. When I heard Daniel Lewis and Ray Ortega (and possibly Dave Thackery), I was like &#8220;I&#8217;m there!&#8221;. I&#8217;ll be speaking on a panel, and possibly more. If you&#8217;re looking for a great conference to help you understand blogging, podcasting, and new media, this is THE conference.  I&#8217;ll keep you posted as to exact times and sessions I&#8217;ll be involved in.</p>

Podcast Co-Hosts Checklist
From Steeden Crowe (http://www.steedencrowe.com) via the Vociemail button on the right side of the screen.

"Where do you find a co-host?"

Typically co-hosts come from people you hang around with or are in your community (in this case photographers). I don't know of any "find a co-host" specific resources. As for other podcasters, I would find one that fits your idea and regularly contribute, and the host may eventually ask you to co-host. Some people enjoy being in control (a solo podcaster makes all the decisions and has say over every aspect). With that said here are some things to think about when it comes to co-host.

1. Time zone (makes it hard to get together when there is a 6 hour difference).
2. Passion. They need to match your passion for the subject.
3. Readiness. You are ready to go. Do they need to wait 6 months before buying their first microphone?
4. Schedule: It takes 4 minutes for every minute of produced podcast (so a 15 minute podcast takes an hour). You need to decide on weekly, twice a week, once a month. Whatever the schedule is stick to it, but make sure your co-host and you agree on it.

Then once you get a co-host you need to get in writing:
1. Who owns the name of the podcast (see Pink Floyd) .
2. What happens if someone quits.
3. What will get someone fired.
4. Who does what (one may do all the technical while the other handles twitter and facebook, etc).
5. How will you split up the money if any rolls in?
For now do you know anyone in your immediate circles that might be interested? If not go to a forum for photography and mention you are thinking of starting a podcast and are looking for a potential co-host.


I'm Speaking at Blogworld in NYC
(http://www.shareasale.com/image/13821/copyblogworld-2010.gif)I was asked by Cliff Ravenscraft to speak at this year's Blog World in New York City. It's June 5-7. They are looking to really boost the Podcasting track this year. having Cliff at the helm should be a fun boost. When I heard Daniel Lewis and Ray Ortega (and possibly Dave Thackery), I was like "I'm there!". I'll be speaking on a panel, and possibly more. If you're looking for a great conference to help you understand blogging, podcasting, and new media, this is THE conference.  I'll keep you posted as to exact times and sessions I'll be involved in.</itunes:summary>
