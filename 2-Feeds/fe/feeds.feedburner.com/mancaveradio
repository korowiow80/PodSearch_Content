	<description>Tune in every week as Jesse and J. J. cover the latest tools, toys, and gadgets they find interesting; talk to guys with cool jobs; and sound the alarm about the world’s “wimpmakers.” Jesse gives tips on how to score — er, succeed — with your woman, how to win at work, and how to raise kids that don’t drive you crazy. And they have fun with sketches like Uber Man, the slightly dense superhero who also tries to make a difference at his day job.</description>

It starts with a great product, content, or experience. Then it becomes about generosity, other-centeredness, helpfulness … and trust. Courage to walk on fire. Bonus offer.</em></p>
<h2>The Practical Follow-Up to Tribes</h2>
<p>Some time ago, I was hugely inspired by Seth Godin&#8217;s ground-breaking book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tribes-We-Need-You-Lead/dp/1591842336">Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us</a></em>. This past week while reading Michael Hyatt’s new book <em><a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/platform">Platform: Get Noticed in a Noisy World</a></em>, I kept thinking, &#8220;Oh, so that&#8217;s how to put it into action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Hyatt and Godin write from the perspective that building a platform and a tribe is (in Hyatt&#8217;s words) &#8220;not about ego or being the center of attention. It is about having something of value to others and finding the most powerful way of getting that message to those who can benefit from it.&#8221; Key to this is generosity, other-centeredness, helpfulness, and earning trust.</p>
<p><em>Tribes</em> changed the way I think. <em>Platform</em> provides the practical how-to’s to bring your vision to life. Hyatt is inspiring, yet down-to-earth and transparent. I would go so far as to say this book is generous &#8230; rather than hiding the secrets of his success to make himself look more impressive, he shares nitty-gritty details such as the specific software he uses and companies/people he has hired to help him along the way.</p>
<div id="attachment_1378" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 203px">
	<img class=" wp-image-1378 " title="Michael Hyatt" src="http://www.mancaveradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Michael_Hyatt.jpg" alt="Michael Hyatt" width="203" height="236" />
	<p class="wp-caption-text">Michael Hyatt</p>
</div>
<p><em>Platform</em> also feels more up-to-date than Gary Vaynerchuck’s bestseller, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crush-It-Time-Cash-Passion/dp/0061914177">Crush It!: Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion</a></em>. That’s because Gary’s book was mostly focusing on blogs and YouTube, whereas Michael covers Facebook, and perhaps more importantly for newcomers, Twitter. However, <em>Crush It!</em> is still a great book that will convince you of the necessity of building and managing your personal brand, regardless of what your vocation is.</p>
<p>I think I’m proof that Michael’s principles still work in 2012. Gary V started WineLibrary.TV in 2006 and published <em>Crush It!</em> in 2009. In 2009, I had never even heard of Michael Hyatt. I first heard him mentioned in 2010, by my buddy Cody Gascho and then by a speaker at a Dan Miller workshop for writers. I checked out his blog a time or two, eventually signed up for his free ebook, a year later he got some affiliate marketing revenue when I purchased <em>Evernote Essentials</em>, and then more recently I bought his ebooks on writing book proposals and now have bought his new book <em>Platform</em>. It took a long time for him to earn enough trust for me to spend any money with him.</p>
<p>As an interesting side note, based on titles (since I haven’t read them), Hyatt’s first four books appear to be essentially scare tactics… warnings and tips about Y2K and digital privacy. This seems to be his first book in more than a decade. I think it’s inspiring that from that rather weak background, he has developed a major book that will be so helpful to many people.</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qkeicFhhwvU?fs=1&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>It Starts with a Great Product, Content, or Experience</h2>
<p>“It’s time to get the passion back,” Hyatt says. “Push one another and yourself to deliver that you are delighted to offer.” Example: Apple’s Steve Jobs introducing the iPhone with almost no marketing.</p>
<p>Hyatt shares six ways to find the courage you need to make “wow” happen</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a stand for greatness.</li>
<li>Connect with the original vision.</li>
<li>Remind yourself what is at stake. (Why is this so important?)</li>
<li>Listen to your heart.</li>
<li>Speak up. Give voice to your heart and go on the record to defend your wow ideas. If you don’t, who will?</li>
<li>Be stubborn.</li>
<li>Very inspiring, yet down-to-earth and transparent. In fact, he even shares with us the specific software he loves and companies/people he has had good results with.
<ul>
<li>Starts his blogs with an Evernote template and then actually do the writing in ByWord, a stripped down word-processor.</li>
<li>MarsEdit for offline blogging client.</li>
<li>TweetPages for his custom background for Twitter, FB, and YouTube.</li>
<li>Standard Theme for WordPress</li>
<li>Shares specific examples, such as effective media kits.</li>
<li>Writes without editing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><em>Then It Becomes about Generosity, Other-Centeredness, Helpfulness, and Earning Trust</em></h2>
<p>“Contrary to what many think, social media rewards generosity, other-centeredness, and helpfulness… They work when there is trust. When they become just another form of spam (violating people’s trust), they fail to be effective.”</p>
<ul>
<li>My example: <a href="http://thelocalmethod.com/">Albert Hathazi</a> is a fellow podcaster whom I trust. Recently he <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/TheLocalMethod">tweeted</a> about a product that he believed in, Noodlesoft Hazel for the Mac. It does several things, but the #1 thing that made it worth it for me is that it automatically deletes files from my Mac’s Trash and Downloads folders when they get old. He wasn’t trying to sell me, he was just sharing a tool that he found.</li>
<li>This is a not just a social media principle &#8212; it’s true for all business, and all of life.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><strong> Courage to Walk on Fire</strong></strong></h2>
<p>Hyatt’s metaphor of the firewalk.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tribes</em> was inspiring. <em>Platform</em> has some inspiration but is mostly practical how-to. Both are a bit scary if you are early in the process.</li>
<li>“Setting out to develop a platform can be overwhelming and scary. This is so much to learn. What if you make a mistake or look foolish? What if they don’t like you? What if you fail? Let me tell you a secret. Forget all of that. Just like fire walking, the key is to start. Once you take the first step everything else will take care of itself”.</li>
<li>“Here’s the question I always ask when I face a daunting task: ‘What would accomplishing this make possible?’”</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.8960267289076"> Bonus Offer</strong></h3>
<p>To celebrate the launch of Michael Hyatt’s new book <em>Platform: Get Noticed in a Noisy World</em>, Michael is giving away $375.98 worth of free bonus content for those who purchase the book between May 21 and May 25. Complete details are available at <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/platform">http://michaelhyatt.com/platform</a>.</p>
<p>Bonuses include: Platform Video Jumpstart Program (six sessions), How to Write a Winning Book Proposal (two e-books and two audio sessions), Why NOW is the Best Time Ever to Be an Author (hour-long video), Digital Versions of <em>Platform</em> (audio and eBook), and more.</p>
<p><em>Note: I was invited to review an advance copy of this book. I received the Kindle version for free, but I found it to be well-worth the purchase price, and I have bought a hardback copy for one my colleagues at <a href="http://www.aspendalecommunications.com/">Aspendale Communications</a>. I am not receiving any compensation or commissions from Michael Hyatt or Amazon.</em></p>

The Practical Follow-Up to Tribes
Some time ago, I was hugely inspired by Seth Godin's ground-breaking book, Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us. This past week while reading Michael Hyatt’s new book Platform: Get Noticed in a Noisy World, I kept thinking, "Oh, so that's how to put it into action."

I checked out his blog a time or two, eventually signed up for his free ebook, a year later he got some affiliate marketing revenue when I purchased Evernote Essentials, and then more recently I bought his ebooks on writing book proposals and now have bought his new book Platform. It took a long time for him to earn enough trust for me to spend any money with him.

As an interesting side note, based on titles (since I haven’t read them), Hyatt’s first four books appear to be essentially scare tactics… warnings and tips about Y2K and digital privacy. This seems to be his first book in more than a decade. I think it’s inspiring that from that rather weak background, he has developed a major book that will be so helpful to many people.

It Starts with a Great Product, Content, or Experience
“It’s time to get the passion back,” Hyatt says. “Push one another and yourself to deliver that you are delighted to offer.” Example: Apple’s Steve Jobs introducing the iPhone with almost no marketing.

Hyatt shares six ways to find the courage you need to make “wow” happen

	Take a stand for greatness.
	Connect with the original vision.
	Remind yourself what is at stake. (Why is this so important?)
	Listen to your heart.
	Speak up. Give voice to your heart and go on the record to defend your wow ideas. If you don’t, who will?
	Be stubborn.
	Very inspiring, yet down-to-earth and transparent. In fact, he even shares with us the specific software he loves and companies/people he has had good results with.

	Starts his blogs with an Evernote template and then actually do the writing in ByWord, a stripped down word-processor.
	MarsEdit for offline blogging client.
	TweetPages for his custom background for Twitter, FB, and YouTube.
	Standard Theme for WordPress
	Shares specific examples, such as effective media kits.
	Writes without editing.

<p>Jesse invites into Man Cave One our special guest <a href="http://twitter.com/codygascho">Cody Gascho</a>, the lead guy at <a href="http://createpraxis.com">Praxis Church</a>.</p>
<h2>There is no “I” in TEAM, but there are 5 “I’s” in LEADERSHIP</h2>
<p>Listening to Michael Hyatt’s <em>This Is Your Life</em> podcast earlier this week about the &#8220;<a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/012-the-5-marks-of-authentic-leadership-podcast.html">5 Marks of Authentic Leadership</a>,&#8221; Jesse was struck by the fact that Cody exemplified these five marks, seemingly without trying. For a directing, extroverted guy like Jesse, Cody seems like a quiet, non-leading sort of guy… and yet a large number of people in the Ausable River Valley are following his leadership.</p>
<p>Jesse noted that Michael suggested that authentic leaders should pursue all five of these “I” characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentic leaders have <strong>insight</strong>.</li>
<li>Authentic leaders demonstrate<strong> initiative</strong>.</li>
<li>Authentic leaders exert <strong>influence</strong>.</li>
<li>Authentic leaders have <strong>impact</strong>.</li>
<li>Authentic leaders exercise <strong>integrity</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Are life plans crap?</h2>
<p>Coincidentally, Cody is the guy who introduced us to Michael Hyatt about two years ago. And in early 2011, Jesse, JJ, and Cody decided to meet on a regular basis to walk through Michael’s ebook, <em><a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/life-plan">Creating Your Personal Life Plan</a></em> (available free for those who sign up for Michael’s free newsletter).</p>
<p>Of the three guys, Jesse has been the most proactive in completing and following the life planning process (he’s always been an overachiever). Sadly, today marks one full year since Cody has last touched his life plan. And even Jesse hasn’t fully implemented the process. Does that mean life plans are crap?</p>
<p>Another leader who teaches similar principles but with different processes is Kent Julian. Many people will appreciate Kent’s approach to Goal Getting and Time Investment (those who sign up for his free newsletter can get his ebook <em><a href="http://www.liveitforward.com/">Goal Setting That Actually Works!</a></em> for free).</p>
<h2>Looking forward to Michael Hyatt’s new book</h2>
<p>We’re pleased that Jesse was invited to review an advance copy of Michael Hyatt’s new book, <em><a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/platform">Platform: Get Noticed in a Noisy World</a></em>. Today he finished reading the book, and he will share his thoughts on Man Cave Radio early the week of May 21. Stay tuned for your chance to receive $375.98 worth of free bonus content.</p>

<h2>Geeky Insults You Can Use Almost Anywhere</h2>
<p>There are times when we just want to give someone a piece of our mind without suffering the consequence of a beat-down. Thankfully, <em>Wired</em> has compiled <a href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/05/33-geeky-insults/">a list of their favorite geeky insults</a>. Jesse and J. J. take some time to toss back and forth a few memorable quips from film, TV, literature, and more.</p>
<h2>The Avengers</h2>
<div>The long wait til the release of <em>The Avengers</em> is finally over! The guys thought the movie was fantastic and were talking about it long after their already lengthy discussion. Check out <a title="Movie Review: “The Avengers”" href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/avengers/">their review of</a><em><a title="Movie Review: “The Avengers”" href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/avengers/"> The Avengers</a>.</em></div>

<h2><strong>Bucket-List Smack-Down</strong></h2>
<p>Jesse and J. J. talk about accomplishing items on your &#8220;bucket-list&#8221; as a way leaving behind your legacy. But how do you figure out which ones are important to your happiness and which ones are merely filler? Kevin W. McCarthy&#8217;s <em><a title="The On-Purpose Person" href="http://www.amazon.com/The-On-Purpose-Person-Making-Parable/dp/0891097058/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336775178&amp;sr=8-1">The On-Purpose Person: Making Sense of Your Life</a> </em>suggests pitting your goals head-to-head in a battle of priority.</p>
<p>While we all grow up having big dreams, not all of them come true. <em><a title="Average Joe: God's Extraordinary Calling to Ordinary Men" href="http://www.amazon.com/Average-Joe-Extraordinary-Calling-Ordinary/dp/1601423071">Average Joe: God&#8217;s Extraordinary Calling to Ordinary Men</a> </em>by Troy Meeder suggests that being an &#8220;Average Joe&#8221; is something to be commended in this day and age.</p>
<p>Andy Perkins (@liberiandy) has a great message about &#8220;Live Your Legacy&#8221; now. After a lifetime of achievement, a serious health crisis made him realize that he still wasn&#8217;t living his legacy. He is living it now, through a Liberia ministry he founded and leads called <a title="Help BESTWA and live your legacy now!" href="http://bestwa.org/about/" target="_blank">BESTWA</a>.</p>

<p>This podcast is longer than our usual Man Cave Movie discussion, but that&#8217;s simply because The Avengers has so many interesting things to talk about.

		<itunes:summary>**SPOILER ALERT** Don't listen if you haven't seen the movie yet. When the Demi-God Loki threatens the earth with an alien army, Nick Fury, Director of the international peacekeeping agency known as S.H.I.E.L.D., brings together a team of superheroes to save the planet. All your favorite heroes – from Iron Man to Captain America – assemble as a mighty team: The Avengers.  Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and Samuel L. Jackson, and directed by Joss Whedon.

This podcast is longer than our usual Man Cave Movie discussion, but that's simply because The Avengers has so many interesting things to talk about. What do you expect from the first movie in years to give Titanic and Avatar a run for the money? For more on The Avengers, check out our other discussions of this series!

<h2><em></em>Age-Activated Attention-Deficit Disorder</h2>
<p>AAADD is a serious disorder that we believe is caused by multi-tasking. We know it’s serious because we learned about it from the <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/content/age-activated-attention-deficit-disorder-how-it-goes">Car Talk guys</a>.</p>
<h2>I Can’t Stop Working: 4 Ways to Manage How Much You Work (Part 2)</h2>
<p>Based on what’s been helpful to him, Jesse shares four suggestions to manage how much you work.</p>
<p><strong><em>1. Understand the importance of your other priorities.</em></strong></p>
<p>Michael Hyatt does a great job discussing the why and how of managing your priorities in his podcast <em>This Is Your Life</em> episode 009, &#8220;<a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/009-is-work-life-balance-really-possible-podcast.html">Is Work-Life Balance Really Possible?</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>In his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/When-Work-Family-Collide-Cheating/dp/1601423799">When Work and Family Collide</a></em>, Andy Stanley says that for anyone who has spouse and kids, family “is your only unique responsibility. On the marketplace side of the equation, you’re expendable. Even if you own your own company, you’re expendable. You know that.”</p>
<p><strong><em>2. Have a designated time and place for work.</em></strong></p>
<p>A great resource to help you set boundaries for your work is Dr. Henry Cloud’s book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-One-Life-Solution-Achieving-Professional/dp/B0064XF1Y2/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335450920&amp;sr=1-1">The One-Life Solution: Reclaim Your Personal Life While Achieving Greater Professional Success</a>.</em><strong><strong></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>3. Understand what&#8217;s behind your drive to work so much.</em><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is it your own fears? Trust problem? Cultural validation? Fear of missing an opportunity? I only matter when….</li>
<li>Is it the culture of your company or team? Your boss? (Jesse&#8217;s story of first job out of school)</li>
<li>Is it a specific season of life or of the year? Breadwinner? (Healthy tension)</li>
<li>Are you just working from prior programming / work habits?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>4. Make the most of the time you do spend working.</em><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose work that you&#8217;re passionate about.</li>
<li>Play to your strengths. Choose work that allows you to spend 80% of the time in a good fit with the way you are wired. (For example, Jesse most enjoys creative work and interacting with other people, with about a 50/50 split on solo work vs. team work. He is good at detailed and management work too, but if that consumes the majority of his work time, he gets burned out.)</li>
<li>Delegate anything that someone else could do better or cheaper than you, or at least roughly as good as you.</li>
<li>Remember the Pareto (80/20) principle so that you are focusing 80% of your time on what produces the most important results. Focus on results that matter, not just achievement or (even worse) activity.</li>
<li>Beware of multi-tasking. Focus on one thing at a time, for maximum productivity and work satisfaction. See <a title="How (and Why) to Stop Multitasking" href="http://blogs.hbr.org/bregman/2010/05/how-and-why-to-stop-multitaski.html">How (and Why) to Stop Multitasking</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong id="internal-source-marker_0.8191046244464815">Hootcha!</strong></h2>
<p>It’s not easy keeping up with teenage kids, but that doesn’t stop Jesse from trying.</p>

Age-Activated Attention-Deficit Disorder
AAADD is a serious disorder that we believe is caused by multi-tasking. We know it’s serious because we learned about it from the Car Talk guys.
I Can’t Stop Working: 4 Ways to Manage How Much You Work (Part 2)
Based on what’s been helpful to him, Jesse shares four suggestions to manage how much you work.

1. Understand the importance of your other priorities.

Michael Hyatt does a great job discussing the why and how of managing your priorities in his podcast This Is Your Life episode 009, "Is Work-Life Balance Really Possible?"

In his book When Work and Family Collide, Andy Stanley says that for anyone who has spouse and kids, family “is your only unique responsibility. On the marketplace side of the equation, you’re expendable. Even if you own your own company, you’re expendable. You know that.”

2. Have a designated time and place for work.

A great resource to help you set boundaries for your work is Dr. Henry Cloud’s book, The One-Life Solution: Reclaim Your Personal Life While Achieving Greater Professional Success.

3. Understand what's behind your drive to work so much.


	Is it your own fears? Trust problem? Cultural validation? Fear of missing an opportunity? I only matter when….
	Is it the culture of your company or team? Your boss? (Jesse's story of first job out of school)
	Is it a specific season of life or of the year? Breadwinner? (Healthy tension)
	Are you just working from prior programming / work habits?

4. Make the most of the time you do spend working.


	Choose work that you're passionate about.
	Play to your strengths. Choose work that allows you to spend 80% of the time in a good fit with the way you are wired. (For example, Jesse most enjoys creative work and interacting with other people, with about a 50/50 split on solo work vs. team work. He is good at detailed and management work too, but if that consumes the majority of his work time, he gets burned out.)
	Delegate anything that someone else could do better or cheaper than you, or at least roughly as good as you.
	Remember the Pareto (80/20) principle so that you are focusing 80% of your time on what produces the most important results. Focus on results that matter, not just achievement or (even worse) activity.
	Beware of multi-tasking. Focus on one thing at a time, for maximum productivity and work satisfaction. See How (and Why) to Stop Multitasking.

Hootcha!

Chris Hemsworth delivers a stunning performance alongside Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins, and Tom Hiddleston in this film by Kenneth Branagh.

<h2>Top 10 Things I’d Do If I Became an Evil Overlord</h2>
<p>Keep these in mind if you ever find yourself as the bad guy in a James Bond flick.</p>
<h2>What Went Right &amp; Wrong During the Half-Marathon</h2>
<p>J.J. and Jesse and four other buddies completed the Glass City Marathon’s half-marathon event. J.J. led our team and beat his personal record by about 15 minutes &#8212; on our show, he shares his secret. Jesse ran one of his worst races ever, and he shares what he did wrong that made the race harder and less enjoyable.</p>
<h2>I Can’t Stop Working: 4 Ways to Manage How Much You Work (Part 1)</h2>
<p>Jesse shares a brief audio clip from <em>The Successful Life Mindset</em> podcast episode 030, &#8220;<a href="http://gspn.tv/slm030/">Living in the Now</a>,&#8221; when hosts Cliff Ravenscraft and Tracy Yost talked about their personal struggles to keep their working hours in check relative to their other priorities. It’s an issue Jesse has also struggled with throughout his career.</p>
<p>Based on what’s been helpful to him, Jesse shares four suggestions to manage how much you work.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Understand the importance of your other priorities</strong>. Michael Hyatt does a great job discussing the why and how of managing your priorities in his podcast <em>This Is Your Life</em> episode 009, &#8220;<a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/009-is-work-life-balance-really-possible-podcast.html">Is Work-Life Balance Really Possible?</a>&#8220; In his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/When-Work-Family-Collide-Cheating/dp/1601423799">When Work and Family Collide</a></em>, Andy Stanley says that for anyone who has spouse and kids, family “is your only unique responsibility. On the marketplace side of the equation, you’re expendable. Even if you own your own company, you’re expendable. You know that.”</li>
<li><strong>Have a designated time and place for work.  </strong>A great resource to help you set boundaries for your work is Dr. Henry Cloud’s book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-One-Life-Solution-Achieving-Professional/dp/B0064XF1Y2/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1335450920&amp;sr=1-1">The One-Life Solution: Reclaim Your Personal Life While Achieving Greater Professional Success</a>.</em></li>

<h2 dir="ltr">Countdown to The Avengers</h2>
<p>With the impending May 4th release of the much-anticipated blockbuster The Avengers, Jesse and J. J. take some time to review and analyze the previous five movies in Marvel’s stellar superhero universe.</p>
<p>The guys will review one movie each week until <em>The Avengers</em> is released. Their <a title="Movie Review: “The Incredible Hulk”" href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/movie-review-the-incredible-hulk/">review of <em>The Incredible Hulk</em></a> is already up, but stay tuned for upcoming reviews of <em>Iron Man &amp; Iron Man 2</em>, <em>Thor</em>, and <em>Captain America</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>For more, listen to <a title="Movie Review: “Iron Man”" href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/movie-review-ironman/">Jesse and J. J.&#8217;s  review of <em>Iron Man</em> here</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Mission: Impossible 4</h2>
<p>The latest <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie, <em>Ghost Protocol</em>, finally gets a physical release (and digital, if that’s more your style). <a href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/mission-impossible-ghost-protocol/">The guys loved <em>Ghost Protocol</em> when they reviewed it</a> in January, and the review has been our most-downloaded show to date.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Reader Comments</h2>
<p>On <a href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/mcr-022-the-first-90-days-of-the-rest-of-your-life/">the blog post for episode 22</a>, commenter Christopher finds that breaking the year up into quarters, goal-wise, works better for him. Darrel responds to Jesse via Twitter, asking if he’s had the courage to simply delete backlogged emails in his own inbox, as recommended in Mark Hurst’s book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bit-Literacy-Productivity-Information-Overload/dp/0979368103/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334872545&amp;sr=8-1">Bit Literacy</a></em>.</p>
<p>Jesse talks about a presentation called &#8220;<a title="Inbox Zero by Merlin Mann" href="http://youtu.be/z9UjeTMb3Yk">Inbox Zero</a>&#8221; by Merlin Mann, a well-known speaker, writer, and podcaster (his most well-known podcast being <em><a title="Back to Work" href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to Work</a></em>). Mann gives moving presentations wherever he goes, including his speech &#8220;<a href="http://youtu.be/Lk0hSeQ5s_k" target="_blank">Scared —less: How I (Mostly) Learned to Love Being Afraid of Pretty Much Everything</a>&#8221; (note: contains swearing).</p>
<p>Receiving upwards of 100 emails per day, Jesse takes some cues from Michael Hyatt’s podcast episode “<a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/005-how-to-take-control-of-your-e-mail-inbox-podcast.html">How to Take Control of Your Email Inbox</a>” in order to shape his email habits.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Important vs. Urgent</h2>
<p>The guys discuss the idea of separating things that are important from those that are simply urgent. Lots of things can be urgent, but very few of those things are actually<em> important</em>. Jesse talks about how to tell the difference between the two, and what to do if something falls into one category or the other, or both.</p>

Mann gives moving presentations wherever he goes, including his speech "Scared —less: How I (Mostly) Learned to Love Being Afraid of Pretty Much Everything" (note: contains swearing).

Receiving upwards of 100 emails per day, Jesse takes some cues from Michael Hyatt’s podcast episode “How to Take Control of Your Email Inbox” in order to shape his email habits.
Important vs. Urgent
The guys discuss the idea of separating things that are important from those that are simply urgent. Lots of things can be urgent, but very few of those things are actually important. Jesse talks about how to tell the difference between the two, and what to do if something falls into one category or the other, or both.</itunes:summary>

Man Hero: “Not Just In Charge of Food Service.”</em></p>
<h2>Fueling the 5-Stroke Engine</h2>
<p>The idea of a 5-stroke engine helps us remember that there are five basic ways that people feel revved up by the people they live and work with. Most of us need to receive all five to feel approved, affirmed, respected, and/or loved. But usually, one or two of the “strokes” is most significant, and that’s different for everyone.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in reading a whole book on this topic, many people recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Love-Languages-Secret-Lasts/dp/0802473156"><em>The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love That Last</em>s</a> by Gary Chapman. Frankly, we just haven’t been interested enough to read a whole book about it.</p>
<p>However, we did read a concise and enjoyable chapter on the topic in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Have-New-You-Friday-Confidence/dp/0800719336">Have a New You by Friday</a></em> by Dr. Kevin Leman. And Andy Andrews also explores the topic in a fun way during a chapter of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Noticer-Sometimes-person-perspective/dp/0785229213">The Noticer</a></em>. Based on their “cliff notes,” in this episode we provide a summary of all five strokes, as well as an animal that helps us remember each one:</p>
<ol>
<li>Words of affirmation or approval (dog)</li>
<li>Quality time (canary)</li>
<li>Gifts (chicken)</li>
<li>Acts of service (goldfish)</li>
<li>Physical touch (cat)</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding the 5 strokes can help you waste a lot of time and frustration with your wife or girlfriend: you can focus on showing her that you care in ways that make a difference to her, and you can help her understand how to treat you right too. It also can help you connect better with your kids, and even help you influence and inspire &#8212; or at least get along with &#8212; your co-workers.</p>
<h2>Man Hero: “Not Just In Charge of Food Service”</h2>
<p>Most guys in his shoes would say, “I just run a cafeteria.” But that’s not how <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/041206/6mess.htm">Floyd Lee</a> sees it.</p>
<p>“I am not just in charge of food service,” said the director of the Pegasus chow hall in Iraq. “I am in charge of morale.”</p>
<p>Floyd Lee has a vision that inspired his entire food staff &#8212; providing American troops with a respite from the turmoil. &#8220;This is my niche,” he said. “I&#8217;ve waited for this job all my life, and here I am in Baghdad.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Pegasus crew gets their food from the same sources as the other military dining halls &#8212; the basic fare is the standard 21-day Army menu. But they’ve created an atmosphere, a gourmet cooking approach, and a presentation that makes soldiers travel out of their way to eat at Pegasus.</p>
<p>&#8220;The time you are in here,&#8221; said Sgt. David Sammy, &#8220;you forget you are in Iraq.&#8221;</p>

Fueling the 5-Stroke Engine
The idea of a 5-stroke engine helps us remember that there are five basic ways that people feel revved up by the people they live and work with. Most of us need to receive all five to feel approved, affirmed, respected, and/or loved. But usually, one or two of the “strokes” is most significant, and that’s different for everyone.

<h2>Taking a Family of 6 Across the Country to See In-Laws Is a Recipe for &#8230; Fun?</h2>
<p>Last week, our family was on vacation with Jesse’s in-laws in Washington, D. C. (and as a result, we didn’t do a show that week). Traveling halfway across the country for a family reunion may not top everyone’s list for fun, but we turned a good time into a great time by putting the “Enjoy Now” practice into use.</p>
<h2>Why You Should Learn Karate</h2>
<p>After taking a week off while on vacation, Jesse was ready to kick it again at his karate class — instead he got kicked in the face by a teenage girl with a black belt! He kicked her butt in retaliation. Literally. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s as high as he could kick, and the butt zone doesn&#8217;t score a point in karate sparring.</p>
<p>Still, after all is said and done, Jesse has some valid reasons for why karate is a great cross-training sport for the average guy. For more about the story, and the list of reasons, check out his blog post, <a title="7 Reasons You Should Learn Karate (or, How I Got My Butt Kicked by a Girl)" href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/7-reasons-you-should-learn-karate-or-how-i-got-my-butt-kicked-by-a-girl/">7 Reasons You Should Learn Karate (or, How I Got My Butt Kicked by a Girl)</a>.</p>
<h2>Interview with Kent Julian</h2>
<p>Our good friend <a href="http://www.kentjulian.com/">Kent Julian</a> discusses how he became a successful speaker and author — even though he wasn’t already famous. He shares an important lesson for every guy trying to make it in competitive field.</p>
<p>Information about Kent’s career-coaching services is available at <a href="http://www.liveitforward.com/">www.liveitforward.com</a>, and more about his training for up-and-coming speakers is available at <a href="http://www.speakitforward.com/">www.speakitforward.com</a>.</p>
<h2>The First 90 Days of the Rest of Your Life</h2>
<p>At the start of the year, the guys set goals for the first quarter. Now it’s time to check in and see how they did and what they’re going to do differently in the next quarter.</p>

The 4 primary birth orders. 3 ways to take advantage of this knowledge.</em></p>
<p>In this episode, Jesse and J. J. discuss how helpful it is to understand the four DISC personality profiles or temperaments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>D</strong>ominant</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>nfluencing</li>
<li><strong>S</strong>teady</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>onscientious</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it’s often difficult to remember what the four profiles mean, to identify which of the four profiles is most applicable to someone you know, and sometime even to know which most apply to you. That’s why for years, Jesse and J. J. have found it helpful to also understand the influence that birth order has on people’s personalities … it’s certainly easier to ask a person if they are a middle child than to guess at their DISC profile or ask them to take a DISC assessment.</p>
<p>A great resource for understanding birth order is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Birth-Order-Book-The-Why/dp/0800734068/ref=pd_sim_b_1">The Birth Order Book</a>, by Dr. Kevin Leman. Leman suggests that the four personality profiles have a strong correlation to these four primary birth orders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oldest child:</strong> Dominant</li>
<li><strong>Youngest child:</strong> Influencing</li>
<li><strong>Middle child:</strong> Steady</li>
<li><strong>Only child:</strong> Conscientious</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there is not always a 1:1 correlation, as many other factors apply. And it would be a mistake to simplistically categorize everyone into one of the four categories. As <a href="http://www.liveitforward.com/">Kent Julian</a> points out, understanding personality profiles can help you better read yourself and other people, but there is more to a person’s personality than the DISC profiles.</p>
<p>Even so, if you understand the DISC profle and/or birth order of yourself and other people, there are three ways to take advantage of this information for greater success in your work and personal life:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Play to your strengths:</strong> Understanding your personality can help you focus 80% of your efforts on leveraging what you are naturally good at and passionate about. For example, many “I” personalities and youngest children enjoy roles such as sales where they have an opportunity to interact and influence other people … they probably would be unhappy pursuing a career that requires them to spend most of their time sitting at a desk doing accounting.</li>
<li><strong>Understand and improve your weaknesses:</strong> You don’t want to spend all your time working in areas that just aren’t a natural fit for you, but you don’t want to ignore your weaknesses either. Consider spending 20% of your efforts to improve or compensating in those areas. For example, that “I” or youngest child may not enjoy accounting, but they can learn some accounting principles and practices to become a better business person, or else bring in a team member to handle that role.</li>
<li><strong>Understand other people:</strong> Being a quicker “read” on other people can help you be more effective at work and also enjoy better relationships in all areas of your life. It can help you find better ways to work with, communicate with, and influence others. Perhaps even more important, it can help you “lighten up” about things people do that bother you, because you’ll be less likely to take it personally when you realize how their natural temperament works.</li>

		<itunes:summary>The 4 DISC personality profiles. The 4 primary birth orders. 3 ways to take advantage of this knowledge.

In this episode, Jesse and J. J. discuss how helpful it is to understand the four DISC personality profiles or temperaments:

	Dominant
	Influencing
	Steady
	Conscientious

However, it’s often difficult to remember what the four profiles mean, to identify which of the four profiles is most applicable to someone you know, and sometime even to know which most apply to you. That’s why for years, Jesse and J. J. have found it helpful to also understand the influence that birth order has on people’s personalities … it’s certainly easier to ask a person if they are a middle child than to guess at their DISC profile or ask them to take a DISC assessment.

Enjoying the now. Going against the grain to achieve your goals. Holding the stars in the palm of your hand.</em></p>
<h2>Enjoy Now</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ryaneggenberger.com/">Ryan Eggenberger</a> commented on &#8220;<a href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/mcr-019-sometimes-renting-is-better-than-owning/">MCR 019: Sometimes Renting Is Better Than Owning</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“I rent an apartment and definitely love the freedom it is currently providing me.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.findingforwardmotion.com/">Tony Elam</a> commented on &#8220;<a href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/7-reasons-being-debt-free-wont-make-you-happy">7 Reasons Being Debt-Free Won&#8217;t Make You Happy</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“I love being debt free, but you are right it didn&#8217;t make us happy. I learned to be content way before I become debt free.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Tony’s comment prompted Jesse and J. J. to discuss how contentment makes a big difference in work and personal success and satisfaction. As Gretchen Rubin pointed out in The Happiness Project, <a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2009/03/happiness-myth-no-8-youll-be-happy-as-soon-as-you.html">it helps tremendously to “Enjoy Now”</a> rather than getting tricked into the “arrival fallacy,” the belief that when you arrive at a certain destination, you’ll be happy.</p>
<p>Jesse and J. J. talk about how their focus on “Enjoying Now” was a big reason why their recent trip to Miami was such a blast. Their keys for getting the most satisfaction out of experiences like that are:<strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy and talk about the anticipation and preparation (“We’re going to have a great time! I’m already having fun just getting ready for it.”)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy and talk about the experience while it’s happening (“Isn’t this great? Wow, look at that view!”)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy and talk about experience (“Man, that was such a blast!”)</li>
</ul>
<p>And this isn’t just hype. As noted in <a href="http://www.happiness-project.com/">The Happiness Project</a>, studies show that talking with others like this truly does boost your happiness and satisfaction.</p>
<h2>Do the Opposite</h2>
<p>Speaker and author Kent Julian is often asked questions about the secret to success, such as:</p>
<p><em>“How can I achieve success in the most important roles of my life such as personal development, family, and work?”</em></p>
<p>Kent says the simple answer is … Just do the opposite of what 90% of the people are doing, and you’ll likely be very successful. <a href="http://www.liveitforward.com/secret-to-success-do-the-opposite/">Kent recently shared nine examples</a> of things you could do that are the opposite of what most people do. Jesse and J. J. discuss six of these and how they put them into practice:<strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Wake up earlier than most.</li>
<li>Commit to reading 30-60 minutes everyday.</li>
<li>Exercise daily.</li>
<li>Be 100 percent responsible for your actions and attitudes throughout the day.</li>
<li>Invest your best effort at work.</li>
<li>Choose to see the glass half-full instead of half-empty.</li>
</ol>

Jesse’s car) in Miami, Florida, the guys reflect on life lessons from their trip to the Miami Beach half-marathon.</p>
<p>J. J., Jesse, and Jesse’s dad Marty took a road trip to Miami and Key Largo for this event, which turned out to be their hardest running event yet. The scenery was beautiful and the people were fun, but the course was hilly and became quite hot as the morning went on. (See <a href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/why-i-added-another-half-marathon-to-my-schedule/">Why I Added Another Half-Marathon to My Schedule</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/1_.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-833 alignleft" title="Marty and J.

J. in Florida." width="211" height="300" /></a>As we relaxed in Key Largo for a couple of days after our race, we realized a few lessons about truly enjoying life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes renting (or borrowing or just enjoying a friend’s item) is better than owning</li>
<li>Some experiences are most enjoyable simply due to their uniqueness or rarity</li>

		<itunes:summary>Recorded from the “Mobile Man Cave” (a.k.a. Jesse’s car) in Miami, Florida, the guys reflect on life lessons from their trip to the Miami Beach half-marathon.

J. J., Jesse, and Jesse’s dad Marty took a road trip to Miami and Key Largo for this event, which turned out to be their hardest running event yet. The scenery was beautiful and the people were fun, but the course was hilly and became quite hot as the morning went on. (See Why I Added Another Half-Marathon to My Schedule)

As we relaxed in Key Largo for a couple of days after our race, we realized a few lessons about truly enjoying life:

	Sometimes renting (or borrowing or just enjoying a friend’s item) is better than owning
	Some experiences are most enjoyable simply due to their uniqueness or rarity
	Some things are best enjoyed in their proper season</itunes:summary>

<p><em>The Man Wall. Debt-Free Isn’t All It’s Cracked Up to Be. Marriage Moment: Evaluating Our Weekend Getaway. Man Toys: Key of Rock and Ultimate Backpack.</em></p>
<h2>The Man Wall</h2>
<p>Jesse admits that he would never spend so much on this kind of thing, but it’s fun to dream.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="http://uncrate.com/stuff/the-man-wall/">Uncrate</a>: <em>Bring the sports bar experience home with The Man Wall ($14,900). This all-in-one chunk of awesomeness features room for four TVs — one 52&#8243; and two 26&#8243; units are included — a 1200-watt Panasonic home theater with integrated speakers and wireless surround units, two 25-cigar humidors with gauges, a 32-bottle wine rack, a microwave, a live 7-foot sports ticker at the top with built-in computer, a full-size kegerator with tap, an iPod docking station, DVD player, and the ability to control it all via a single remote control. Feel free to grunt in approval.</em></p>
<h2>Debt-Free Isn’t All It’s Cracked Up to Be</h2>
<p>Jesse and Erin worked together for 14 years to become debt-free, including their house. They are very glad they achieved debt freedom and recommend it as a goal for others. But did it make them happy?</p>
<p>For more about this topic, see Jesse’s blog post <a href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/7-reasons-being-debt-free-wont-make-you-happy/">7 Reasons Being Debt-Free Won’t Make You Happy</a>.</p>
<h2>Marriage Moment: Evaluating Our Weekend Getaway</h2>
<p>At the beginning of 2012, Jesse and Erin put one weekend getaway per quarter on their calendar. This past weekend was time for 2012 Getaway #1. But it was really hitting them at a bad time. Deciding that “it’s never a good time,” they decided to be true to their original plans and head to Traverse City for a weekend alone. Now it’s time to ask, are they glad they did it?</p>
<p>(Jesse didn’t realize it until later, but he pulled Erin into the Man Cave for this discussion at a moment when she was really distracted by a problem with one of our kids. Hopefully, Man Cave listeners will appreciate our authenticity!)</p>

<h2>6 Ways to Have More Balance in Your (Love) Life</h2>
<p>Is your marriage in danger of being swallowed by “the maw of the mundane”? The problem is about balance, but not just work/life balance. Other priorities like kids, hobbies, friends, TV, Facebook — and yes, work — crowd out the time and energy you have for each other. Your wife no longer gets excited when you walk in the door. She’s no longer interested in your goals and dreams. She says “not tonight” too often.</p>
<p>After 17 years of marriage, Jesse has learned that if he makes Erin a top priority in his life, he’ll get the attention and priority from her that he desires. He shares six ways to keep more focus on your love life.</p>

<h2>Man Toys</h2>
<p>J. J. tells us about a wardrobe component that every guy needs: a bulletproof polo shirt.</p>
<p>And if you’re the type to let it all hang out, he suggests the Wild Man Beard Conditioner.</p>

<h2>The Next Big Thing</h2>
<p>Many people lose the balance in their life because they waste a lot of time and energy chasing the “next big thing.” Then that thing doesn’t turn out to be so big, so they’re soon chasing after another big thing.</p>
<p>Jesse discusses the “Fire Bullets, Then Cannonballs” principle from <em><a title="Great by Choice by Jim Collins" href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Choice-Uncertainty-Luck--Why-Despite/dp/0062120999/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1330109308&amp;sr=8-1">Great by Choice</a></em> by Jim Collins. Great companies like Apple have used this approach in finding and launching big things like the iPod, iTunes, and iPhone. It’s a principle that guys can use to be successful &#8212; <em>and</em> keep balance in both work and life.</p>

<em>Why a Man Cave? Man Toys: Ferrari 458 Spider and Craftsman Shovel. 20-Mile-March Workday. Creating Your Own Boundaries.</em></p>
<h2>Why a Man Cave?</h2>
<p>Jesse talks about why &#8220;Man Cave&#8221; is our theme. A Man Cave is an enjoyable, comfortable place to get away from the demands of the world and be refreshed &#8212; whether that means reading books like Jesse enjoys or putting &#8220;more power&#8221; in machines like Tim Taylor used to do on <em>Home Improvement</em>. But it&#8217;s not a selfish place, to spend long hours watching TV and playing video games. A Man Cave is about time and space to rest and re-recharge, to bring some balance back into life and avoid &#8220;killing the golden goose,&#8221; so that a guy has energy and inspiration to continue leading and serving others.</p>
<h2>Man Toys</h2>

<h2>The 20-Mile-March Workday</h2>
<p>On the heels of talking about the 20 Mile March principle on <a title="MCR 015: Getting Lucky — Lessons from the South Pole" href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/mcr-015-getting-lucky-lessons-from-the-south-pole/">episode 15</a>, Jesse discovers the blog post &#8220;<a title="3 Things That Can Derail Your Success While Self-Employed" href="http://rise365.com/2012/01/26/3-things-that-can-derail-your-success-while-self-employed/">3 Things That Can Derail Your Success While Self-Employed</a>&#8221; by Michael Good. Jesse realizes that applying the 20 Mile March to his workday &#8212; having both a lower limit and an upper limit on the number of hours worked each day &#8212; can ensure steady progress, avoid burnout, and provide margin to deal with the emergencies and opportunities of life.</p>
<h2>Creating Your Own Boundaries</h2>
<p>J. J. shares his disappointment that Safe House and other movies that look like fun Man Cave movies are rated R. Jesse talks about how he remembers being excited when he was finally old enough to decide on his own whether to watch R-rated flicks &#8230; and why, within a few years, he made the personal decision to skip them most of the time. It&#8217;s not a hard-and-fast rule, but a general boundary that has helped him choose movies that he&#8217;s more likely to fully enjoy.</p>
<p>Sometimes, setting boundaries for ourselves in different areas of life can help us be stronger, healthier, and more positive. A great teacher on this concept is Henry Cloud, Ph.D., author of books such as <em>Boundaries</em> and <em>The One-Life Solution</em>.</p>

		<itunes:summary>MCR 016: What Does Your Man Cave Mean to You?
Why a Man Cave? Man Toys: Ferrari 458 Spider and Craftsman Shovel. 20-Mile-March Workday. Creating Your Own Boundaries.
Why a Man Cave?
Jesse talks about why "Man Cave" is our theme. A Man Cave is an enjoyable, comfortable place to get away from the demands of the world and be refreshed -- whether that means reading books like Jesse enjoys or putting "more power" in machines like Tim Taylor used to do on Home Improvement. But it's not a selfish place, to spend long hours watching TV and playing video games. A Man Cave is about time and space to rest and re-recharge, to bring some balance back into life and avoid "killing the golden goose," so that a guy has energy and inspiration to continue leading and serving others.
Man Toys
At $258,000, the Ferrari 458 Spider featured in the March issue of Popular Mechanics doesn't fit in Jesse's budget, but he does get geeked out about the Craftsman D-Handled Digging Shovel ($35).
The 20-Mile-March Workday
On the heels of talking about the 20 Mile March principle on episode 15, Jesse discovers the blog post "3 Things That Can Derail Your Success While Self-Employed" by Michael Good. Jesse realizes that applying the 20 Mile March to his workday -- having both a lower limit and an upper limit on the number of hours worked each day -- can ensure steady progress, avoid burnout, and provide margin to deal with the emergencies and opportunities of life.

<h2>Getting Lucky</h2>
<p>In his latest book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Choice-Uncertainty-Luck--Why-Despite/dp/0062120999/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1328901514&amp;sr=8-1">Great by Choice</a></em>, Jim Collins and his research team analyze why some companies are able to thrive even in difficult circumstances and unstable environments &#8212; for example, how did Southwest Airlines have huge growth and profitably from 1972-2002, a period when most other airlines were struggling and even going bankrupt?</p>
<p>A common notion is that companies like Southwest have a lot more good luck. Collins’ team discovered that’s not true … they did not generally have more luck than other companies in their situation. Instead, they <em>made their own luck</em> &#8212; largely through a combination of planning and discipline.</p>
<p>This myth of “good luck” doesn’t just apply to large corporations &#8212; it applies to life! Making your own luck can revolutionize your work, your finances, your love life, your health, and your family.</p>
<p>A key analogy in Great by Choice is the true story of Roald Amundsen and Robert Falcon Scott, who led teams that set out within days of each other in October 1911, in a race to become the first explorers to reach the South Pole. Amundsen’s team not only reached the South Pole more than a month faster, but it was the only team to return alive. The difference between the approaches taken by Amundsen and Scott &#8212; who were of similar ages and with comparable experience &#8212; illustrate the principle of making your own luck.</p>
<p>Here are three lessons from the South Pole to help you get lucky:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Take responsibility and take action.</h3>
<p>Never forget that you are not the victim of your circumstances. You are still ultimately in control of your life and happiness. <a href="http://www.liveitforward.com/speaker-urges-students-not-to-be-normal/">As Kent Julian teaches</a>, unsuccessful people believe that E = O (the Events that happen to me create the Outcomes in my life). But successful people know that E + R = O … Events plus Response = Outcomes. Scott’s journal entries show that he frequently complained about about weather and bad luck; Amundsen’s philosophy was to presume bad events might strike his team along the way, so he prepared for them rather than waiting for “bad luck” to strike.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst.</h3>
<p>Be optimistic, but assume plan ahead so that you are prepared to deal with bad things that could happen. For example, Scott was devastated when his team’s only altitude-measuring thermometer broke; Amundsen brought four thermometers to cover for accidents.</li>
<li>
<h3>Follow the discipline of the 20 Mile March.</h3>
<p>Have a goal for regular progress that you achieve no matter what, but set an upper-limit so you don’t over-extend yourself. In his race to the South Pole, Admunsen’s team traveled 15-20 miles every day, regardless of whether the weather or other circumstances were favorable. “In contrast, Scott would sometimes drive his team to exhaustion on good days and then sit in his tent and complain about the weather on bad days.”</li>
</ol>
<p><em>“Victory awaits him who has everything in order — luck, people call it. Defeat is certain for him who has neglected to take the necessary precautions in time; this is called bad luck.”</em> <em>— Roald Amundsen, The South Pole</em></p>
<h2>Marriage Moment: Give and You Shall Receive</h2>
<p>One of the ways many guys can make their own luck is by investing in your woman … little things to express love to your wife. If you’re married, your wife can have a huge impact on your life and your happiness &#8212; therefore, marriage is one area where you should be putting the three Getting Lucky lessons into action.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/adriana_lima.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-618" title="Adriana Lima" src="http://www.mancaveradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/adriana_lima.jpg" alt="Adriana Lima" width="363" height="231" /></a>The 2012 Super Bowl commercial for Teleflora featuring super-model Adriana Lima expressed it well: “Give and you shall receive” &#8212; of course, as a commerical for flowers, its focus was materialistic. But it is pretty likely that if you frequently <strong>give</strong> your wife authentic signals that you love her, you will <strong>receive</strong> great sex, great friendship, and a great partner for life. That’s getting lucky!</p>
<p>Last month on ArtofManliness.com, <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2012/01/03/a-resolution-for-romance-the-52-loves-notes-challenge/">Joshua Gordon issued a challenge to men</a> to write a love note every week to their wife. That’s one way to put the 20 Mile March into effect, building up deposits in your wife’s emotion bank account which will help weather the storms that life will surely send your way.</p>
<p>One way that Jesse follows the 20 Mile March principle is a goal to take Erin on a date (almost) every week. Often it is a no-cost or low-cost date … a walk, a visit to a neighbor’s house, a dessert or coffee at a coffee shop. Other times it is mid-priced (lunch at a restaurant), or higher-priced (dinner at a restaurant) … and 3-4 times a year, we splurge for a night or two at a hotel or bed-and-breakfast.</p>
<p>A lot of guys feel intimidated by the notion that their wife needs frequent signs of their love. In movies and TV, we see guys who plan super-romantic events for their women. As Jesse and Erin discuss in this segment, it doesn’t have to be fancy or well-planned … just some time to enjoy and focus solely on your wife.</p>
<h2>Man Toy: Bio Lite Camp Stove</h2>
<p>The <a title="BioLite" href="http://www.biolitestove.com/BioLite.html">BioLite</a> ($130) is a compact, portable stove that burns sticks, twigs, and pine cones instead of gas, so you don’t have to carry fuel with you when camping. Use it to cook food and boil water &#8212; and use its USB port to charge your gadgets or power an LED light.</p>

<h2>BurgleDolls</h2>
<p>Are you afraid of burglars? With the BurgleDoll, you don’t have to worry about burglars ever again! With these life-size, burglar mannequins in your yard, potential thieves will think your house is already being robbed. (Use this product in addition to the BurgleStickers, which you paste on your window to make it look like there are bad guys in the house already.)</p>
<h2>Beating the Winter Blues</h2>
<p>Jesse was glad to read Michael Hyatt’s recent post, <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/how-to-overcome-the-winter-blues.html" target="_blank">“How to Overcome the Winter Blues,”</a> in which Michael talked about how he overcame a mild winter-time depression. This is a topic that not many men talk about, but it’s pretty common. Over the last 3-4 winters, Jesse has experienced occasional periods of winter blues. Jesse comments on the four ways that Michael recommends for overcoming it, and adds two more keys that have helped him.</p>
<h2>Man Toy: CycleOps Indoor Bike Trainer</h2>
<p>The CycleOps indoor bike trainer provides a better experience than a stationery exercise bicyle, for a fraction of the cost. This device lets you bring your road bike indoors for the winter months.</p>
<p>Jesse welcomes Steve Hanley back to the Man Cave so both guys can give their take on the <a href="http://www.cycleops.com/" target="_blank">CycleOps</a> indoor bike trainer. They both recently started using the trainer to start preparing for the triathlons they&#8217;ve planned for the year. To see a video of Jesse demonstrating the trainer, visit <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5groEeCsA" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU5groEeCsA</a></p>
<h2>Winning At Work &#8211; Part 1</h2>
<p>In the book<a href="http://mensanthology.com/about/" target="_blank"> Ordinary Men, Extraordinary Lives</a>, Roy Baumeister, Ph.D discusses some key differences between men and women (in general &#8212; there are many exceptions too). Men find their way to extremes. Men are more likely to accept risk, including taking on the dangerous jobs that our society needs people to do. Men may not be as good at close, one-on-one relationships, but they are very good at relating through large networks and groups.</p>
<h2>Interesting Guests</h2>
<p>We welcome three fascinating guests into Man Cave One: A mime, a man who speaks only the ends of words, and a man who looks like a dog.</p>
<h2>Winning At Work &#8211; Part 2</h2>
<p>Earlier in the show, we talked about some of the “man qualities” that have made a difference in world history and the workplace. However, we also need to recognize that the world has changed, and past styles of leadership and work don’t seem to be succeeding in the 21st century. Historically, men have excelled at a style of leadership that researchers at Burnham Rosen call Imperial (Stage 3) leadership &#8212; similar to a dictator or even a democratic president. Since the 1990s, however, the majority of successful leaders are practicing Interactive (Stage 4) leadership &#8212; more like a team coach. This style of leadership seems to come more naturally for many women &#8212; which is perhaps one reason why most leadership positions in corporate America are now filled by women (see <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-end-of-men/8135/?single_page=true " target="_blank">“The End of Men”</a> in The Atlantic Monthly). However, the pendulum may have swung so far to the female side that we are in danger of seeing a lack of gender diversity in leadership that won&#8217;t be healthy for businesses, communities, and families. The world needs more men to become interactive leaders.</p>
<p>Note: <a href="http://www.burnhamrosen.com">Burnham Rosen</a> offers a three-day workshop on Interactive Leader. Jesse completed this workshop and highly recommends it.</p>

<h2><strong>Endurance Events for Average Guys</strong></h2>
<p>You may have been a jock in high school or even college, but when your school days ended, were you able to continue that sport as a life-long source of fun and fitness? Endurance events include runs such as 5ks and half-marathons; bicycle rides; and multi-sport events like triathlons and the Tough Mudder.</p>
<p>Steve Hanley explains why an average 30-something guy like him got interested in endurance events just two years ago – and now leads an <a href="http://fcaendurance.com/" target="_blank">FCA Endurance</a> group in Northwest Ohio.</p>
<p>Don’t miss next week’s show, as Jesse and Steve provide a review of their CycleOps bike trainers, an inexpensive and fun way to keep bicycling during the winter.</p>
<h2><strong>Winning with Kids: The #1 Most Important Thing a Dad Can Do</strong></h2>
<p>In his blog post &#8220;<a href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/5-secrets-to-raising-kids-that-dont-drive-you-crazy/" target="_blank">5 Secrets to Raising Kids that Don’t Drive You Crazy</a>,&#8221; Jesse shared the five P.R.I.D.E. keys: Practice, Reinforcement, Insulate, Doing life together, and Enjoy.</p>
<p>Today, Jesse shares how the &#8220;Enjoy&#8221; key begins with a genuine smile. Smiling at your kids is such a simple thing, but many dads fail to provide their kids with this desperately needed sign of affection and affirmation.</p>
<h2><strong>SportsMan: Road to the Super Bowl</strong></h2>
<p>Ty Daniels explains how the New York Giants could make it to the Super Bowl despite a mediocre regular season. Who does he predict will win when the Giants face the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 46?</p>
<h2><strong>Man Heroes: Ordinary Men, Extraordinary Lives</strong></h2>
<p>We need to hear about Man Heroes this month!</p>
<p>In April, we will celebrate the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Titanic and its heroes who lived out “Women and Children First.” This month, however, more people are focused on the Jan. 13 tragedy of the cruise ship Costa Concordia near Italy. The ship’s captain, now nicknamed “Captain Coward,” is accused of causing a shipwreck (which resulted in at least 16 deaths) and then abandoning the ship before all passengers were evacuated. Some commentators have said the captain represents a modern stereotype of irresponsible, selfish, and perpetually adolescent men.</p>
<p>As a welcome contrast, our Man Hero this week is Steve Jones. Steve had a very difficult childhood, which included the alcoholism and suicide of his father. However, thanks to key mentors, this ordinary guy grew beyond his circumstances to live an extraordinary life – including playing football for the Seattle Seahawks, becoming a successful businessperson, and providing mentorship for others.</p>
<p>Steve’s story is shared with us by Dr. Jim Sharon, a clinical psychologist for more than 30 years. Readers can learn more about Steve Jones, as well as 39 other Man Heroes, in Dr. Sharon’s book <a href="http://mensanthology.com/about/" target="_blank"><em>Ordinary Men, Extraordinary Lives</em></a><em>. </em>Dr. Sharon is also the founder of the annual <a href="http://mensanthology.com/whole-man-expo/" target="_blank">Whole Man Expo</a>, an event that will be held on Sept. 8, 2012, to celebrate and support men <em>and</em> to increase public awareness of key challenges that contemporary men experience.</p>

Today, Jesse shares how the "Enjoy" key begins with a genuine smile. Smiling at your kids is such a simple thing, but many dads fail to provide their kids with this desperately needed sign of affection and affirmation.

<p>Jesse shares how although most of his day went wrong, he made progress on one of his 90-day goals by doing something rather simple … taking his kids sledding.</p>
<p>As shared in his blog post “<a href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/5-secrets-to-raising-kids-that-dont-drive-you-crazy/" target="_blank">5 Secrets to Raising Kids that Don’t Drive You Crazy</a>,” Jesse and Erin have practiced the 5 PRIDE secrets for 16 years:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Practice:</strong> use short, fun training sessions to teach young children how to behave and respect authority</li>
<li><strong>Reinforcement:</strong> consistently reward attitudes and actions with appropriate rewards and consequences</li>
<li><strong>Insulate:</strong> filter out harmful influences as appropriate for their age, and teach them to protect themselves as they get older</li>
<li><strong>Doing Life Together: </strong>spend quality time in quantity, working and playing together</li>
<li><strong>Enjoy: </strong>smile at your children and have an attitude that builds connections with their heart</li>
</ul>
<p>Jesse says that taking the kids sledding was an example of “Doing Life Together.” He set a goal to create 12 memories for his kids this quarter, to help build strong relationships with them.</p>
<p>Jesse also encourages listeners to participate in a free teleseminar by Kent Julian on Feb. 2 called <a href="http://www.liveitforward.com/teleseminars/parent-it-forward-teleseminar/" target="_blank">“Parent It Forward &#8211; Parenting with Intentionality and Purpose.”</a></p>
<h2><strong>Jeep Sledding</strong></h2>
<p>Speaking of sledding, how about riding a sled pulled by a Jeep going 38 miles per hour? Zach Lahey says it’s all fun and games until the Jeep’s driver slams on the brakes.</p>
<h2><strong>Man Toys</strong></h2>
<p>J. J. and Jesse get geeked out over several items spotlighted in the February issue of <strong><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/" target="_blank">Popular Mechanics</a>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://us.microplane.com/microplaneeasyprepmeattenderizer.aspx" target="_blank">Microplane’s Easy Prep Meat Tenderizer</a>: could also double as a weapon if you get attacked.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/news/the-rise-of-the-ultrabook-ces-analysis-6636800?click=main_sr" target="_blank">Intel Ultrabooks</a>: HP, Ausus, Lenovo, and Dell are bring their answer to the MacBook Air.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/reviews/drives/2012-honda-cr-v-test-drive-6563613?click=main_sr#fbIndex1" target="_blank">2012 Honda CR-V</a>: A sharp looking, very versatile and practical car that’s fun to drive.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Marriage Moment: Getting Lucky and Date Nights</strong></h2>
<p>Valentine’s Day is less than a month away. Before you groan, think about using this as an opportunity to “pursue” your wife … you know, like you did when you were first dating. You may say, “But I’ve already won her; it’s hard to get excited about pursuing her.”  But in her heart, she doesn’t want to be taken for granted; she wants to be pursued by her lover.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Winning with Kids
Jesse shares how although most of his day went wrong, he made progress on one of his 90-day goals by doing something rather simple … taking his kids sledding.

As shared in his blog post “5 Secrets to Raising Kids that Don’t Drive You Crazy,” Jesse and Erin have practiced the 5 PRIDE secrets for 16 years:

	Practice: use short, fun training sessions to teach young children how to behave and respect authority
	Reinforcement: consistently reward attitudes and actions with appropriate rewards and consequences
	Insulate: filter out harmful influences as appropriate for their age, and teach them to protect themselves as they get older
	Doing Life Together: spend quality time in quantity, working and playing together
	Enjoy: smile at your children and have an attitude that builds connections with their heart

Jesse says that taking the kids sledding was an example of “Doing Life Together.” He set a goal to create 12 memories for his kids this quarter, to help build strong relationships with them.

Jesse also encourages listeners to participate in a free teleseminar by Kent Julian on Feb. 2 called “Parent It Forward - Parenting with Intentionality and Purpose.”
Jeep Sledding
Speaking of sledding, how about riding a sled pulled by a Jeep going 38 miles per hour? Zach Lahey says it’s all fun and games until the Jeep’s driver slams on the brakes.
Man Toys
J. J. and Jesse get geeked out over several items spotlighted in the February issue of Popular Mechanics:

	Microplane’s Easy Prep Meat Tenderizer: could also double as a weapon if you get attacked.
	Intel Ultrabooks: HP, Ausus, Lenovo, and Dell are bring their answer to the MacBook Air.
	2012 Honda CR-V: A sharp looking, very versatile and practical car that’s fun to drive.

Marriage Moment: Getting Lucky and Date Nights
Valentine’s Day is less than a month away. Before you groan, think about using this as an opportunity to “pursue” your wife … you know, like you did when you were first dating. You may say, “But I’ve already won her; it’s hard to get excited about pursuing her.”  But in her heart, she doesn’t want to be taken for granted; she wants to be pursued by her lover.

And there is at least one thing our wives can inspire pursuit from most of us guys …. Jesse so far has read one-third of the latest issue of Rebel Magazine. His key take-away so far is this sentence written by Ashlan Gorse: “I love when a man cooks for me, and if he cleans up after, he’s definitely getting lucky.”

The latest issue of Thriving Family Magazine shares eight fun ideas for low-cost dates with your wife. If you these type of things to regularly “pursue” your wife, plus occasionally splurge on her, it’s a pretty good bet that she’ll make sure you get lucky. Isn’t it awfully nice when she’s the one to initiate “getting it on”? That frequent scenario is worth pursuing!

<p>The guys were pleased to be joined in the Man Cave by one of their best friends, Jesse’s dad Marty Lahey, owner of <a href="www.manhattanstoledo.com" target="_blank">Manhattans’ Restaurant</a> in Toledo.</p>
<h2><strong>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol</strong></h2>
<p>Jesse and J. J. provide a brief review of Tom Cruise’s latest spy thriller. A more extensive discussion about the movie will be posted shortly, on our <a href="http://www.mancaveradio.com/category/movies" target="_blank">Movies</a> page.</p>
<h2><strong>Winning at Work: Thought Patterns of a Great Leader</strong></h2>
<p>In studying hundreds of thousands of people from countries around the world, researchers at Burnham Rosen Group discovered that of the 300 positive motives that influence people’s behavior, <strong><em>80% of all people</em></strong> are driven by some combination of just three motives. And more than 9 out of 10 white-collar professionals are internally motivated by the same three:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Achievement:</strong> Interested in excellence, completing tasks, efficiency, beating competition, beating past personal records, being unique, and career advancement.</li>
<li><strong>Affiliation:</strong> Interested in friendship, close personal relationships, being liked and accepted, and avoiding being disliked by anyone.</li>
<li><strong> Impact (also known as Power):</strong> Interested in influence, influential relationships, and making a difference in people’s lives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of these motives that influences your own thought patterns has a direct and definite impact on your success in life and career. For example, if Achievement dominates your thought patterns, you stand a good chance of success in roles such as a salesperson or entrepreneur. If Affiliation, you might be successful in a helping role, such as a social worker, teacher, or clinical psychologist. And if Impact, you could be successful in roles such as a business leader, politician, author, artist, or architect.</p>
<p>These thought patterns are programmed in you during childhood, teenage years, and early adulthood. But you can learn to adopt thought patterns that can bring you more success. For example, many guys would be more successful in life if they could become better leaders at work, in their family, and in their community … and therefore, the Impact motive is a key thought pattern to develop.</p>
<p>Note: <a href="http://www.burnhamrosen.com " target="_blank">Burnham Rosen</a> offers a three-day workshop to leverage this information to become a superior leader. The core concept is that to create lasting, meaningful change, you must change the way you think. Jesse completed this workshop and highly recommends it.</p>

Winning at Work: Thought Patterns of a Great Leader
In studying hundreds of thousands of people from countries around the world, researchers at Burnham Rosen Group discovered that of the 300 positive motives that influence people’s behavior, 80% of all people are driven by some combination of just three motives.

<p>Tom Cruise returns for the fourth time to the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise. This time, everything seems to goes wrong as Ethan Hunt and his new team go rogue in an attempt to prevent nuclear war after the Kremlin is bombed. Listen in to hear why Jesse and J. J. decided to give this surprisingly funny action thriller 5 stars. Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg, and Paula Patton also star in this near-perfect movie.</p>
<p>NOTE: One of the things that makes this movie so cool is that Tom Cruise does his own stunts, and in the scene in the picture here, when he climbs up the side of the Burj Khalifa &#8211; at over a half-mile tall, it&#8217;s the tallest building in the world &#8211; he really did climb up it!

<h2><strong>Society for Prevention of Failed New Year’s Resolutions</strong></h2>
<p>Many people have already given up on their 2012 resolutions, but Jesse and JJ haven’t even set resolutions! They are excited about the plans they’re shaping up for the year, though, including several triathlons and half-marathons.</p>
<h2><strong>5 Resolutions in 5 Days</strong></h2>
<p>The guys take a call from Jimmy, who has already completed the five resolutions he set for the new year: Lose 20 pounds, watch every Schwarzenegger film, get a Master’s degree, find a cure for a major disease, and grow a ponytail. How did he accomplish all five in just the first five days of 2012, and what will he do for the rest of the year?</p>
<h2><strong>Taking Control of the New Year</strong></h2>
<p>What would make 2012 a great year for you? It’s not too late to set a few goals that you can get excited about – even if you’ve already given up on any resolutions that you’d already set! The guys share four simple points to help you make 2012 a year to remember, based on an article by <a href="http://goodpeoplegoodbusiness.areavoices.com/2011/12/28/take-control-of-your-life-and-resolutions/ " target="_blank">The Village Business Institute</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>SportsMan</strong></h2>
<p>Ty ventures outside to run despite 6-degree windchill. Jesse has been focusing more on indoor workouts. He’s trying out CrossFit.com and likes it so far. It’s a free website that posts workouts every day, providing a good mix of cardio plus strength-training. Jesse likes that these intense workouts take only about 20 minutes, with plenty of variety to prevent stagnation.</p>
<p>College football bowl games are in full swing, with many lopsided games but also some great matchups. In fact, so far, five bowls have gone into overtime – including the Sugar Bowl (Michigan beat Virginia Tech), and the Outback Bowl (Michigan State beat Georgia in triple overtime). Ohio State ended the year with seven losses, their worst record since 1897 – more than 110 years ago!</p>
<p>Ty predicts Alabama will win the National Championship game over LSU, despite the fact that LSU won earlier in the season when these same teams faced each other.</p>
<p>This coming weekend is the NFL’s Wildcard Weekend, kicking off the playoffs and setting the stage for the Super Bowl.</p>

Society for Prevention of Failed New Year’s Resolutions
Many people have already given up on their 2012 resolutions, but Jesse and JJ haven’t even set resolutions! They are excited about the plans they’re shaping up for the year, though, including several triathlons and half-marathons.
5 Resolutions in 5 Days
The guys take a call from Jimmy, who has already completed the five resolutions he set for the new year: Lose 20 pounds, watch every Schwarzenegger film, get a Master’s degree, find a cure for a major disease, and grow a ponytail. How did he accomplish all five in just the first five days of 2012, and what will he do for the rest of the year?

<p>The latest edition of Popular Mechanics is out – and woohoo! – it features a jetpack that the average guy could have a chance to fly sometime soon. Sure, it’s a water jetpack and not the rocket-fuel jetpack that James Bond flew in <em>Thunderball</em>, but it looks like a ton of run.

<h2><strong>Man Cave Movies</strong></h2>
<p>The guys provide their review of <em>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows</em>, the 2011 follow-up to the 2009 hit reboot of stories about the world’s most famous detective. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law resume their roles as Holmes and Dr. Watson, taking on the diabolical Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris).</p>
<h2><strong>SportsMan</strong></h2>
<p>What the heck happened this week? Tim Tebow’s winning streak is broken … a heart-breaking loss crushes the Packers dreams of finally breaking the curse of the 1972 Dolphins … and the Colts finally win a game. Featuring Ty Daniels, the SportsMan (not dead yet).</p>
<h2><strong>Man Hero: George Washington, Every-Day Guy</strong></h2>
<p>Like most Americans, Jesse used to think of George Washington as a guy famous for being our first president. After reading <em>Killing Lincoln </em>on his Kindle, though, Jesse saw the suggested book <em>Being George Washington</em> by Glenn Beck. While some parts of the book dragged, and other parts skipped around so much chronologically that it became hard to follow, certain chapters were very exciting and inspiring. This was an every-day joe, a “man’s man” who – long before he became president &#8212; became the most famous American of his time by showing courage, honesty, and self-sacrifice in both big and little moments of life.</p>
<h2><strong>Wimpmakers</strong></h2>
<p>Can over-use of video games, texting, and touch-screens lead to symptoms similar to bipolar disorder? Can poor sleep habits, poor nutrition, and other factors lead to symptoms similar to ADHD? If so, what happens when doctors want to put you or your kids on long-term medications to manage these symptoms? It sounds like the potential for a generation of unhappy, unproductive wimps.</p>

<h2><strong>Guys’ Guide to Christmas Shopping</strong></h2>
<p>It’s December 21st, a little early for Christmas shopping in your book, but it’s time to at least start thinking about what you might want to get the loved ones in your life this holiday season. Of course, you won’t actually buy the gifts until Christmas Eve, but it’s a good idea to decide what you should get everybody. Here are five rules that should help you avoid screwing it all up.</p>
<h2><strong>Man Cave Christmas Carol</strong></h2>
<p>For this week’s Men at Work segment, Jesse Scrooge attempts to interview Mr. Christmas Carol himself, Charles Dickens. Instead, his co-host J. J. Cratchitt takes over the show, and a series of ghosts – er, spirits – descend on Jesse to persuade him to change his evil ways. Special appearance by Zach Lahey as Turkey Boy.</p>

<h2><strong>Man Toys</strong></h2>
<p>The new Sylvan Sport Go is part man-toy hauler, part pop-up camper. And at only 800 pounds, it can be towed by even small cars. Plus, to help out all the guys making last-minute Christmas gift selections, we compare the pros and cons of the three hottest contenders in the tablet market: Kindle Fire vs. Nook Color vs. iPad 2.</p>

<h2><strong>SportsMan</strong></h2>
<p>Tim Tebow takes the Broncos from last place to first place, and raises a lot of attention by openly sharing his faith. Will Aaron Rodgers lead the Packers to become the first NFL team to have an undefeated season since the 1972 Dolphins? And will the Colts, winners of two recent Super Bowls, go the entire season without a win?</p>
<h2><strong>Winning with Kids</strong></h2>
<p>Reactions to the movie “Courageous,” a story of cops and fathers. The movie had its good points and bad points, but it was effective in inspiring Jesse to take a couple of new steps toward being a great dad. It may sound simple, but I think my two middle kids will be positively impacted by me 1) taking weekly karate lessons with them, and 2) taking a few minutes at bedtime a couple times each week, to read a chapter  from <em>Preparing for Adolescence</em>, by James Dobson, Ph.D.</p>

<h2><strong>Men at Work</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.WoosleyCoaching.com" target="_blank">James Woosley</a> is project-management consultant specializing in implementation of large-scale computerized systems (such as SAP and PeopleSoft). It’s enjoyable, important work that pays well, but it also requires a huge amount of travel with long stretches of time away from his family family and community. James is also a business coach; he uses his project management skills to help entrepreneur-hopefuls follow a roadmap to launch their businesses successfully.</p>
<h2><strong>Gift That Keeps On Giving</strong></h2>
<p>At this busy time of year, we’re often under pressure to get in the Christmas spirit. It can make a big difference to take note of the things and events in our lives that we’re grateful for … whether big or little, and whether positive, neutral, or even negative. Gratefulness can be a perpetual gift to ourselves, and our example can be a gift to our loved ones.</p>

<h2><strong>Men’s Depression and Bipolar Disorder</strong></h2>
<p>It’s generally not considered “manly” to talk about your problems, especially if they involve any form of mental weakness. But we all go through rough moments of life. Jesse’s brother Zach talks candidly about his struggle six years ago – including an apparent misdiagnosis of bipolar disorder and the long-term effects of the anti-psychotic drug he was prescribed. Learn the surprising way he was able to get his life back, with no recurrences so far in the years since then.</p>
<h2><strong>UberMan: The Sidekick</strong></h2>
<p>Michael Buckminster, the mild-mannered alter-ego of UberMan, is stretched thin from all the travel required by his day-job as an IT project-management consultant.  As a result, our hero is finding it difficult to keep up with fighting crime. And so, he tries out a new sidekick, Stretch. But can the untried duo tackle two villains at once?</p>

Public Service Announcement
By the request of the Society for the Prevention of Ill Manners, J. J. shares the top 5 Ways to Tick People Off.
Man Movies to Watch for in 2012
Fresh from watching “Captain America” and “Thor” this week on DVD, the guys tell why their most-anticipated movies of 2012 are “The Avengers,” “Spiderman 4,” “Wrath of the Titans,” “Men in Black 3,” “Bourne Legacy,” – and potentially the biggest movie of next year: “The Dark Knight Rises.”

SportsMan: New head football coach at Ohio State, plus Tony Stewart wins NASCAR championship. Man Hero: Ernest Shackleton. Marriage Moment: He says, She says. UberMan meets The Jesster.</em></p>
<h2><strong>A Fresh Look Back at the Movie “Bucket List”</strong></h2>
<p>We finally got around to checking out this movie that is on the top of list of many guys for fun, inspirational flicks. The very next day, Phil Cooke happened to mention the same movie &#8230; but he asked if you <a href="http://philcooke.com/do-you-have-a-bucket-list-of-people-to-see-before-you-die/" target="_blank">have a list of PEOPLE</a> you&#8217;d like to meet or talk to before you die.</p>
<h2><strong>Winning with Kids</strong></h2>
<p>We’re inspired by the example of Cody Gascho who teaches his junior-high basketball players how to answer the question, “Who has it better than we do? “</p>
<h2><strong>On the Hunt</strong></h2>
<p>Jesse gets up close and personal with roadkill. Zach and J. J. can’t stay awake long enough to bag a deer.</p>
<h2><strong>Man Toys</strong></h2>
<p>We get geeked out by the possibilities with a next-gen, glass <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1116966310/multi-touch-keyboard-and-mouse" target="_blank">multi-touch keyboard and mouse</a>. Jesse shares his long-time idea for an even more advanced laser keyboard for smart phones.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.mensjournal.com/the-wrangler-rejuvenated" target="_blank">2012 Jeep Wrangler</a> has us pretty stoked too. It’s a jeep for the 21<sup>st</sup> century with more power and 20+ MPG.</p>
<h2><strong>Men At Work</strong></h2>
<p>Tony Elam, from the Gaylord Palms Hotel in Orlando, explains how being a bellman for 12 years has trained his entrepreneurial skills. He’s begun sharing his accumulated wisdom at <a href="http://findingforwardmotion.com" target="_blank">http://findingforwardmotion.com</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Wimpmaker Alert</strong></h2>
<p>Should guys be concerned about a level playing field? We don’t think guys should be worried about new competition, but we should continue to look for opportunities to use our “man gifts” to make a positive difference for customers, our families, and our communities. Otherwise, the future of America could look a lot like many third-world countries, where many people seem to think that men only cause problems rather than create solutions. We mentioned articles by <a href="http://www.xyonline.net/content/what%E2%80%99s-real-%E2%80%9Cboy-crisis%E2%80%9D-they-will-soon-find-themselves-having-compete-girls-truly-level-pla" target="_blank">Bill Patrick</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/30/opinion/gates-maternal-health/index.html?hpt=hp_t2 " target="_blank">Melinda Gates</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>SportsMan: Ty Daniels</strong></h2>
<p>Ohio State University hires Urban Meyer as its football coach. Tony Stewart Wins NASCAR Championship at Homestead.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Interview with Tony Elam, bellman at the Gaylord Palms Hotel in Orlando. A fresh look back at the movie “Bucket List.” Winning with Kids: Who has it better than we do? Up close and personal with roadkill. Man Toys: glass multi-touch keyboard and mouse, plus the 2012 Jeep Wrangler. Wimpmaker Alert: should guys be concerned about a level playing field? SportsMan: New head football coach at Ohio State, plus Tony Stewart wins NASCAR championship. Man Hero: Ernest Shackleton. Marriage Moment: He says, She says. UberMan meets The Jesster.
A Fresh Look Back at the Movie “Bucket List”
We finally got around to checking out this movie that is on the top of list of many guys for fun, inspirational flicks. The very next day, Phil Cooke happened to mention the same movie ... but he asked if you have a list of PEOPLE you'd like to meet or talk to before you die.
Winning with Kids
We’re inspired by the example of Cody Gascho who teaches his junior-high basketball players how to answer the question, “Who has it better than we do? “
On the Hunt
Jesse gets up close and personal with roadkill. Zach and J. J. can’t stay awake long enough to bag a deer.
Man Toys
We get geeked out by the possibilities with a next-gen, glass multi-touch keyboard and mouse. Jesse shares his long-time idea for an even more advanced laser keyboard for smart phones.

The 2012 Jeep Wrangler has us pretty stoked too. It’s a jeep for the 21st century with more power and 20+ MPG.
Men At Work
Tony Elam, from the Gaylord Palms Hotel in Orlando, explains how being a bellman for 12 years has trained his entrepreneurial skills. He’s begun sharing his accumulated wisdom at http://findingforwardmotion.com.
Wimpmaker Alert
Should guys be concerned about a level playing field? We don’t think guys should be worried about new competition, but we should continue to look for opportunities to use our “man gifts” to make a positive difference for customers, our families, and our communities. Otherwise, the future of America could look a lot like many third-world countries, where many people seem to think that men only cause problems rather than create solutions. We mentioned articles by Bill Patrick and Melinda Gates.
SportsMan: Ty Daniels
Ohio State University hires Urban Meyer as its football coach. Tony Stewart Wins NASCAR Championship at Homestead.
Man Hero
Ernest Shackleton was one of the key explorers of Antartica in the early 1900s. Even his rivals admitted that he was a great leader. “If I am in the devil of a hole and want to get out of it, give me Shackleton every time."

Put in your vote a hero of today at CNN.
Marriage Moment
Jesse plays a game of “He Says, She Says” with Erin.
UberMan Meets The Jesster
UberMan demonstrates how to be an effective bellman, but The Jesster has something to say (or sing?) about that.</itunes:summary>

<p>Imagine life is a game in which you are juggling five balls. The balls are called work, family, health, friends, and integrity. And you&#8217;re keeping all of them in the air. But one day you finally come to understand that work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back. The other four balls–family, health, friends, integrity–are made of glass. If you drop one of these, it will be irrevocably scuffed, nicked, perhaps even shattered. And once you truly understand the lesson of the five balls, you will have the beginnings of balance in your life. &#8211; <a href="http://www.jamespatterson.com/about_contact.php" target="_blank">James Patterson</a>, <em>Suzanne&#8217;s Diary for Nicholas</em>.</p>

<p>Jesse gets geeked up about his new iPhone 4S. And in the aftermath of yet another (and hopefully the last) Windows disappointment for the Lahey gang, Jesse and JJ talk about their efforts to interest Erin in the iPad 2.</p>
<h2><strong>Too Old to Become Mr. Stud Athlete?</strong></h2>
<p>Two years ago, Marty couldn’t run a mile. This past week, he signs up at the last minute to run his first half-marathon. But at 59 years old, can he finish the race? Is 59 too old to start a new sport? Jesse joins him on the 13-mile run in case the old coot needs to be rescued.</p>
<p>Jesse continues to live out a key message from a speech he heard nearly 10 years ago called “Think of Yourself As an Athlete,” by former Stanford and pro basketball player Mariah Burton Nelson (<a href="http://www.mariahburtonnelson.com" target="_blank">mariahburtonnelson.com</a>).</p>
<h2><strong>Men at Work</strong></h2>
<p>Jeff McManus (<a href="http://www.plantingtogrow.com/" target="_blank">plantingtogrow.com</a>) gets paid to play with big toys. As Director of Landscaping at The University of Mississippi, he leads a team that creates the “wow factor” that helps Ole Miss attract the best and brightest students. His role is important because 62% of incoming freshmen make their decision to attend a given school based on their experience in the first 15 minutes they spend on campus &#8212; impressions and experience within their first 15 minutes on campus.</p>
<h2><strong>Gotta Love a Woman in a Tool Belt</strong></h2>
<p>Jesse ventures out of the Man Cave to demonstrate the payoff for a guy in showing support and enthusiasm for your wife’s interests. We weren’t sure what Erin would call her latest project (Woman Cave? Mom Cave?) … but the first name that popped into her head was “Girl Cave.”</p>
<h2><strong>The Best Sex Book I Never Read</strong></h2>
<p>Jesse talks about how many years ago, his life was changed simply by hearing the title of a book by Dr. Kevin Leman. Our Quote of the Week is from that book title: <em>Sex Begins in the Kitchen</em>.</p>
<h2><strong>Winning with Your Kids</strong></h2>
<p>Jesse shares a point to help guys raise kids that don’t drive you crazy.</p>
<h2><strong>Winning at Work</strong></h2>
<p>What do Steve Jobs, the “glass ceiling,” and Generation X have in common … and what difference does it make in how guys can succeed on the job?</p>
<h2><strong>UberMan: F-Word Frenzy</strong></h2>
<p>UberMan is introduced to the new villain The Jesster, and he has a few choice words to say on the matter. Meanwhile, his alter-ego Michael Buckminster tackles landscaping at a large university.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><h2><strong></strong><strong>Man Toys</strong></h2>
<p>With the right toys, some guys can make a game out of anything. Before hauling away his old refrigerator for recycling, our neighbor Russ lets us shoot it full of lead.</p>
<h2><strong>Men at Work</strong></h2>
<p>Jesse interviews Jeff Richardson, basketball coach and teacher at Oolitic Middle School in the land of the Hoosiers. Jesse shares an inspiring quote by Dan Miller, best-selling author of <em><a href="http://www.48days.com" target="_blank">48 Days to the Work You Love</a></em>.</p>
<h2><strong>Marriage Moment</strong></h2>
<p>What’s a woman doing in the Man Cave? Some rules are made to be broken, so Jesse invites in his favorite hottie to help him share a tip on how to score &#8230; er, succeed … with your woman. It seems to work so well that Jesse decides he needs a commercial break.</p>
<h2><strong>“More Weight for My Shoulders”</strong></h2>
<p>Like many guys, Ray has a hard time letting go of his worries. But there may be good reasons why he is wired this way.</p>
<h2><strong>Quote of the Week</strong></h2>
<p>&#8220;All happy families resemble each other, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Cervantes, as quoted in <em>Made to Stick</em> by Chip Heath and Dan Heath.</p>
<h2><strong>Wimpmaker Alert</strong></h2>
<p>Can we fight poverty without encouraging men to become wimps? Jesse comments on an intriguing guest post on michaelhyatt.com, written by Pat Morley (author of <em>Man in the Mirror</em>).</p>
<h2><strong>Fight Club</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.drdavidpowers.com" target="_blank">Dr. David W. Powers</a> shares about how guys beating up on each other at a monthly event has been a healthy experience. Can learning to get hit help a man gain confidence?</p>
<h2><strong>History in the Making</strong></h2>
<p>Jesse discusses the defeat, capture, and killing of Gaddafi. While he has not been following the news closely, the battle against a dictator inspires Jesse to talk about William Travis and the other heroes of the Alamo who led the fight against Santa Anna.</p>
<h2><strong>UberMan Begins</strong></h2>
<p>Are superheroes born or made? Either way, they have to learn how to wear their underwear on the outside of their pants. When we first meet UberMan, he is coaching an almost-all-girls basketball team at a small middle school.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop Automatic --><p>Our second pre-launch show! The first recording on our new audio equipment! Many thanks to Cliff Ravenscraft from podcastanswerman.com for getting me this far. Also thanks to Erin, J. J., and my other kids for setting up the studio while I was out of town.</p>
<p>Here are the topics covered in this episode:</p>
<p>The first print issue of the brand-new magazine Rebel arrived this week. See <a href="www.rebelmagazine.com">www.rebelmagazine.com</a></p>
<p>Jesse practically wet himself when he discovered the man stuff in the April 2011 issue of Popular Mechanics. See <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com">www.popularmechanics.com</a></p>
<p>Man Cave One is now coming together! This space used to hold my weightlifting equipment, but this week J. J. moved all that to a section of the basement. I now have a real space, next to my office, that is just for me. It’s dedicated to two things … mostly for me relaxing, but also to record our new radio show.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to the movie Courageus, which opens this weekend. Jesse has read the novelized version, and provides a mixed review here. Based on the progressing production quality of the producers’ prior movies – Flywheel, Facing the Giants, and Fireproof – we are nonetheless fairly confident that the new movie will be worth watching. Hopefully, though, they will learn the value of artistic subtlety. See <a href="http://www.courageousthemovie.com">http://www.courageousthemovie.com</a></p>
<p>For our “Men at Work” feature, I interviewed Ron Oliver, a CNC operator at Prescott Products. See <a href="www.prescottproducts.com">www.prescottproducts.com</a></p>
<p>After the show, we agreed that we sucked, but not nearly so bad as we did in June. A couple of the lowpoints:<br />
• Jesse can’t seem to talk to his co-host or guest and speak directly into the mic at the same time. And despite Ron being a great guest, Jesse can’t think of anything to say except “Um.”<br />
• J. J. gives away the punch line to Jesse’s story from When Character Was King by Peggy Noonan.</p>
<p>Once launched, our actual show will be much more fun and faster-paced. Right now we are still working on a lot of the behind-the-scenes details for the show, so we didn’t put any planning or preparation into the show itself.</p>

<p>Wow, we really sucked. We even made ourselves bored.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, it was fun to record this in the brand-new man cave of Marty Lahey, owner of Manhattans Restaurant in Toledo, Ohio, and second-best dad in the world (#1 being Jesse). See <a title="Manhattans Toledo" href="www.manhattanstoledo.com">www.manhattanstoledo.com</a></p>
<p>We talked about what it’s like to own a restaurant, and also discussed Marty’s experience going from near-couch-potato to sprint-triathlete and half-marathoner, despite the fact that he’s already on AARP’s mailing list.</p>
