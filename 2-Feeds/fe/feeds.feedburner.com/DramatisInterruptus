Part of maturity is having enough perspective and self-control to handle that appropriately. Those that can't manage that are doomed to the ranks of the Fan Dumb.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;-----&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Amusingly enough, the RP video that followed the one I discussed has been pulled down on a copyvio claim &lt;i&gt;(Update: It's been uploaded to &lt;a href="http://blip.tv/slowbeef/want-lp-gone-5428727"&gt;Blip.tv&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;. So much for "the video creators tend to take it well."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;From a legal perspective, both LPs and RPs are &lt;i&gt;derivative works&lt;/i&gt;. Derivative works can only be copyrighted if they display some degree of originality. The law in this area is murky - even more so than with copyright law in general - but if the LP is deemed sufficiently original to have a copyright, I'd have to assume that a commentary on it would also pass muster. Retupurae has an additional defense - as a commentary, it is legally considered &lt;i&gt;parody&lt;/i&gt;, and parody gets a wider berth (something Seamus mentioned in response to the fans who wanted him to file a copyright claim). There's just not much of a case here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course, Matthew Needler - the user who issued the claim - knows this. The copyright standards for Retsupurae were settled after YouTube reinstated the original account. People like him are relying on YouTube's slow copyvio claims process and notoriously gun-shy attitude towards anything that even smells of copyright.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh, and just so I can end this on a positive note: &lt;a href="http://pastebin.com/8dsC8Q3T"&gt;Retsupurae fanfiction with "implied slash."&lt;/a&gt; You're welcome.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3051486633313496455-4139735954977601370?l=dramatisinterruptus.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~4/nrq4D5L7hmI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~3/nrq4D5L7hmI/dramatis-interruptus-special-2-fan-dumb.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (D Johnston)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://dramatisinterruptus.blogspot.com/2011/07/dramatis-interruptus-special-2-fan-dumb.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3051486633313496455.post-1389071993312289738</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2011 20:16:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-08-01T15:29:13.079-05:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Flashbacks</category><title>Flashback - Dramatis Personae #9</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dramatis Personae&lt;/b&gt; was my first attempt at a web series.

It is a bit different than most episodes, carrying on the fine tradition of "performing an intellectual task while drinking/drunk." </itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Flashbacks</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://dramatisinterruptus.blogspot.com/2011/07/flashback-dramatis-personae-9.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~5/mJ1bCHdK8ss/huNfgpuxCAA" length="340743" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://blip.tv/play/huNfgpuxCAA</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3051486633313496455.post-7562516099732687793</guid><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2011 19:37:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-07-24T00:39:52.777-05:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">the Internet</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">pop culture</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">politics</category><title>Dramatis Interruptus - Into the Heart of Conservapedia</title><description>&lt;div&gt;(&lt;a href="http://blip.tv/dramatis-personae/into-the-heart-of-conservapedia-dramatis-%20interruptus-5395866"&gt;Blip.tv&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy9Y-zlLSGk"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/download/DramatisInterruptus-IntotheHeartofConservapedia/di24.mp3"&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On the continuing drama of a trainwreck website; a lunatic who became a sacred cow; a pallet of "satires" that would make Swift spin in his grave; a debate challenge that backfired; and why I find all of this hilarious.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Links:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://revision3.com/pennpoint/fat_atheists"&gt;Penn Jilette - Are You A Fat Atheist?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;-----&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Normally, I would use this space to expound further on an idea touched upon in the episode, or to bring up something I missed.

But then they would be marginalized by people like you, saying that they are only a product of a society dominated by men rather then saying that they are﻿ free minded people that can make their own decisions. Why do you belittle behavior that is moving towards an equal society, where women can think for themselves? You are a modern force for sexual opression... Congrats.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Set aside, for a moment, the ridiculous anti-feminist crack about sexual oppression that has nothing to do with anything Watson actually said. Let's look at his first comment, the one about "a lot of girls" being happy to be in this situation. In this fellow's world, there are a lot of women who, being propositioned by a complete stranger in an elevator, will immediately drop their panties and spread their legs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;You'll pardon the crudeness of that last bit, but I'm trying to make a point here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Meeting a sexual partner in an elevator is, evidently, a common male fantasy. It strikes me as the grown-up version of the adolescent "sharing a hotel room with the girl I like" fantasy. Both cases present a "captive audience" scenario in which the woman - who would otherwise rebuff or ignore the individual - is forced into an intimate situation with him, and eventually recognizes his sexual superiority. An understandable fantasy in an insecure, inexperienced teenager, but a bit harder to grasp in an adult. It's even worse that some adults apparently base their understanding of women around this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;What a lot of these guys don't seem to get is that hook-ups just don't happen like this. In real life, people don't just bump into each other and go off to have sex. They do in pornography, though. Elevator sex strikes me as a classic porn scenario. In the world of pornography, all relations are reduced to sex, so any situation that can result in two people meeting becomes innately sexual. Still, most people realize that porn doesn't reflect reality, so why do these guys have so much trouble with it?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;I have a theory. The culprit is something I call "Porno Syndrome", a disorder marked by a complete inability to fathom female sexuality. Porno Syndrome afflicts men (usually young men in their late teens or twenties) who a) consume a large amount of pornography and b) have few substantial interactions with women in their daily lives. Without the understanding of women that's brought on by talking to them, their only source for information is the world of pornography. Porn world women are sexual objects who will sleep with any man who wants them and who don't mind being degraded for someone else's pleasure. And because porn is more "real" than television, the viewers never consider that these women are happy because they are being paid to do these things.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Naturally, this leads to disappointment as the unfortunate man find that his cheezy, clumsy pick-up lines don't result in sex. Should he manage to find a sexual partner, he will still be disappointed as she probably won't line up with his fantasies - I'm reminded of the men who believe, thanks to porn, that the typical woman has no pubic hair. So, he grows increasingly misanthropic, hating both the women who rebuff him and the men who he sincerely believes are living out his porn-fueled fantasies.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;I seem to have lost the point somewhere in there, so here it is: Basing your perspectives on women on sexual fantasies is neither wise nor healthy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;The men who can't fathom Watson's discomfort are those who view women - first, foremost and possibly solely - as targets for lust. A woman should be happy to be the focus of a man's sexual frustration, since that's what she's made for. I often wonder how one of these men would raise a daughter. Would he teach her to base her self-worth on how many men make dirty remarks to her? Would he treat her discomfort like it was a personal problem? Unfortunately, I've met men well into their thirties and forties who still hold these perspectives on women, and some of them have children, so this is not conjecture.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Personally, should I have any daughters, I will be teaching them to take no shit from sexists. And, for anyone who might be inclined to try these sleazy moves with my potential female offspring, I would like to note that I collect knives and blades. Remember, according to Watson's detractors, that was not a threat - merely a statement of fact.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3051486633313496455-6686696617773787220?l=dramatisinterruptus.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~4/ND-lvvgCTpE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~3/ND-lvvgCTpE/rebecca-watson-is-entirely-right.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (D Johnston)</author><thr:total>2</thr:total><media:content url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~5/WBa7alYTMQg/di23.mp3" fileSize="19311016" type="audio/mpeg" /><itunes:explicit>yes</itunes:explicit><itunes:subtitle>(Blip.tv/YouTube/MP3) On sexual harassment within a cultural movement; the spirited debate on women's problems within said movement; a famous intellectual who made an ass of himself; a really specific cause that is shockingly large (and angry); and gender</itunes:subtitle><itunes:author>noreply@blogger.com (D Johnston)</itunes:author><itunes:summary>(Blip.tv/YouTube/MP3) On sexual harassment within a cultural movement; the spirited debate on women's problems within said movement; a famous intellectual who made an ass of himself; a really specific cause that is shockingly large (and angry); and gender relations in groups with gender imbalances. --- The video in question is here and the post in question is here.

Porno Syndrome afflicts men (usually young men in their late teens or twenties) who a</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>the Internet</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://dramatisinterruptus.blogspot.com/2011/07/rebecca-watson-is-entirely-right.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~5/WBa7alYTMQg/di23.mp3" length="19311016" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://www.archive.org/download/DramatisInterruptus-RebeccaWatsonisEntirelyRight/di23.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3051486633313496455.post-9183027874988939908</guid><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2011 04:18:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-07-05T23:22:28.669-05:00</atom:updated><title>A Bit of Business</title><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Out of town this week, so no podcast. In the meantime, I'd like to clear up some site business:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over the last few weeks, I've been putting my older podcasts (Episode 9 and back) on YouTube. When I started doing this for Episode 10, it was to give my listeners more options, as many people don't like Blip.tv. However, in an attempt to broaden my audience, I'm making all of them available. Currently, all podcasts except #8 and #9 are available on both sites. You can find them all in the &lt;a href="http://dramatisinterruptus.blogspot.com/p/index.html"&gt;index&lt;/a&gt;, or on my YouTube channel page, linked at left. Don't be afraid to subscribe - remember, people who create content for the Internet are, by nature, insecure types who are validated by growing numbers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Speaking of video hosting, I've been thinking about cleaning up my channels a bit. In particular, I'm considering Dramatis Personae, a series with predates Dramatis Interruptus by a good margin. Frankly, DP was not a great production. I was fiddling with video then, which wound up being low-quality and distracting. I've already removed most of the DP episodes from YouTube (where they received very few hits), but they are still present on &lt;a href="http://blip.tv/dramatis-personae"&gt;my Blip account&lt;/a&gt;. I've thought about deleting them over there as well, but I feel like I should keep them on for the sake of personal history, regardless of their quality. If any of you have seen Dramatis Personae, I'd love to hear what you think I should do with them. Even if I choose to delete them, I'll probably save a few of the better ones and link them through this site.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you haven't checked out &lt;a href="http://kingdomofsharks.wordpress.com/"&gt;Kingdom of Sharks&lt;/a&gt; yet, I invite you to do so - remember, I'm validated by traffic figures! Kidding aside, though, there's a lot there. I estimate that I've posted 15,000 words, including the entire uncut first chapter. The manuscript is currently in its third rewrite and is due for a fourth, so don't hesitate to comment. My next step will probably be adding a few anecdotes that didn't make the original version, and I would love to hear if you think these stories are worth including.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3051486633313496455-9183027874988939908?l=dramatisinterruptus.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~4/-nrazQKDxjk" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~3/-nrazQKDxjk/bit-of-business.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (D Johnston)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://dramatisinterruptus.blogspot.com/2011/07/bit-of-business.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3051486633313496455.post-474314134486766615</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2011 00:10:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-06-30T20:55:26.237-05:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">politics</category><title>Dramatis Interruptus - Gay Rights</title><description>(&lt;a href="http://blip.tv/dramatis-personae/on-gay-rights-dramatis-interruptus-5332535"&gt;Blip.tv&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukHZTofX8ts"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/download/DramatisInterruptus-GayRights/di22.mp3"&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On progress v. traditionalism in the battle over gay rights; an atrocious analogy that just won't die; an adoption ruling that shamed the state of Florida; the miscegenation comparison that traditionalists hate; and why one doesn't need to be hurt by bigotry to hate it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;-----&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Interesting that George Rekers came up in this podcast.

By the time I had finished recording this episode, there was a new controversy brewing, this time over a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ3B8WvVjL4&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;bizarrely racist ad&lt;/a&gt; from the CA-36 special election. This thing really has to be seen to be believed - I'm not even going to spoil it by describing it here.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What struck me as particularly odd was the response to the response, as it were. Over on Balloon Juice, the blogger "Angry Black Lady" &lt;a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/2011/06/15/ca-36-campaign-ad-holy-fucking-shit/"&gt;wrote a post about the ad&lt;/a&gt;, noting (with no small amount of ire) that a lot of people talking about it were completely ignoring the racial element. The commenters responded by getting upset . . . &lt;a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/2011/06/16/ca-36-ad-hahn-investigating-hueys-connection-to-creator-of-most-comically-racist-campaign-ad-in-universe/"&gt;at ABL&lt;/a&gt;. Many accused her of being too angry, as though anger were not a valid response to something this horrible. Even more bizarrely, some of them claimed that she should only talk about important racism. Apparently, ABL needs Balloon Juice's (predominantly white) audience to tell her how she should feel. It seems that, over the last few years, there's been a real increase in this sort of thinking. There's little more jarring than seeing a white person explain to a black person that he doesn't understand black issues, so his anger is unwarranted.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Actually, this isn't limited to racial issues. The consensus of the moment is that anger is always an illegitimate response, no matter what the circumstances. This is nonsense. If my lower-class neighbor is relieved of his savings by a con artist, anger is a natural and expected response that only proves that I have a conscience. If half of what we're hearing about the GOP is true, then what they want to do is orders of magnitude worse. If driving seniors into poverty doesn't merit anger, what does?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One more wrinkle from the ABL response. Several of her detractors actually claimed that ABL's anger was invalid because the ad was made by trolls. Comments like this make me think that we, as the Internet populace, need to declare a moratorium on the term "troll" until we learn to use it correctly. Leave aside that what these people are claiming makes no sense - making an offensive ad on behalf of your candidate just to make some people upset is about as logical as cutting off your nose to spite your parents. The term "troll" makes absolutely no sense in this context. The problem is that the term has become so diluted that it's lost all meaning. A "troll" is just someone I don't like, online or offline. If I had my way, we'd all go back to UseNet for a refresher course on what it means (here's a hint: the original term was "trolling" and it referred to the angling technique, not a hideous bridge dweller).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3051486633313496455-1941304911015791159?l=dramatisinterruptus.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~4/f9j09PA0XS8" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~3/f9j09PA0XS8/dramatis-interruptus-sockpuppetry.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (D Johnston)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total><media:content url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~5/g5z01SCEmWM/di21.mp3" fileSize="29430225" type="audio/mpeg" /><itunes:explicit>yes</itunes:explicit><itunes:subtitle>(Blip.tv/YouTube/MP3) On deception in the Electronic Age; a researcher who felt a need for public self-flattery; a writer whose ego grew into its own persona; a race-baiter's "authentic" views on the black experience; and why we keep falling for it. -----</itunes:subtitle><itunes:author>noreply@blogger.com (D Johnston)</itunes:author><itunes:summary>(Blip.tv/YouTube/MP3) On deception in the Electronic Age; a researcher who felt a need for public self-flattery; a writer whose ego grew into its own persona; a race-baiter's "authentic" views on the black experience; and why we keep falling for it. ----- For those of you who are interested in seeing MacMaster's answer to A Million Little Pieces, here it is.

This week was no different; however, this time the development wasn't just another vandal-baiting article or weirdo Andy insight. What happened was something that managed to be both surprising and predictable.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;It started with a discussion on the Main Page about Ken DeMeyer's habit of locking pages which had never been vandalized. This led to sysop Rob Smith creating the &lt;a href="http://conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Community_Portal"&gt;Community Portal&lt;/a&gt;, a project page for discussing site policy. Smith is a degenerate liar, but I can't see any ulterior motives for him to create the page. It appears to be a legitimate effort to reach out to the user base while addressing some of the complaints they've received. That was the surprising part.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Discussion on the page quickly turned to another of DeMeyer's idiosyncrasies - repeatedly deleting and recreating pages. DeMeyer does this a lot - five times in the last 24 hours as of this writing, in fact. The exact reason varies, but his intent is always to wipe out the edit history. Often, he'll delete and recreate a page he just edited, concealing the dozens of page changes it takes him to make even a small change. Other times, he'll recreate a page with a comment or two missing, thus eliminating embarassing remarks he made or inconvenient questions from other users. In short, he never does this for legitimate, site-related reasons, only to save face.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;When DeMeyer deletes and recreates an article, it completely eliminates the edit history. The only edit in the new revision history is Ken's, thus making it appear that he created the article single-handed. Normally, he only does this to his own "parody" articles, so it doesn't really matter. However, on June 2nd he deleted and recreated the &lt;a href="http://conservapedia.com/Sun_Tzu"&gt;Sun Tzu&lt;/a&gt; article. To be fair, it's a shit article - under 300 words, completely unsourced and containing baseless speculation - but it's still better than most of what passes for scholarship on CP.

This week was no different; however, this time the development wasn't just another vandal-baiting article or weirdo Andy insight. What happened was something that managed to be both surprising and predictable. It started with a discussion on the Main Page about Ken DeMeyer's habit of locking pages which had never been vandalized. This led to sysop Rob Smith creating the Community Portal, a project page for discussing site policy. Smith is a degenerate liar, but I can't see any ulterior motives for him to create the page. It appears to be a legitimate effort to reach out to the user base while addressing some of the complaints they've received. That was the surprising part. Discussion on the page quickly turned to another of DeMeyer's idiosyncrasies - repeatedly deleting and recreating pages. DeMeyer does this a lot - five times in the last 24 hours as of this writing, in fact. The exact reason varies, but his intent is always to wipe out the edit history. Often, he'll delete and recreate a page he just edited, concealing the dozens of page changes it takes him to make even a small change. Other times, he'll recreate a page with a comment or two missing, thus eliminating embarassing remarks he made or inconvenient questions from other users. In short, he never does this for legitimate, site-related reasons, only to save face. When DeMeyer deletes and recreates an article, it completely eliminates the edit history. The only edit in the new revision history is Ken's, thus making it appear that he created the article single-handed. Normally, he only does this to his own "parody" articles, so it doesn't really matter. However, on June 2nd he deleted and recreated the Sun Tzu article. To be fair, it's a shit article - under 300 words, completely unsourced and containing baseless speculation - but it's still better than most of what passes for scholarship on CP. I wouldn't be surprised if it were edited dozens of times by numerous editors. Of course, I can't tell you how many edits of editors because the revision history is gone. Needless to say, some of the users were upset over this. The Community Portal quickly filled with complaints about DeMeyer's antics. This led Smith to take action against DeMeyer - a fairly safe move, seeing as how most of the sysops don't like or trust DeMeyer (although they hate Smith too). Smith clearly wasn't prepared to talk to DeMeyer about deleting pages, but he did leave a comment on DeMeyer's talk page requesting that he stop reverting comments on talk pages. DeMeyer responded by reverting Smith's comment, then deleting and recreating the talk page. That was the predictable part.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>the Internet, pop culture, politics</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://dramatisinterruptus.blogspot.com/2011/06/dramatis-interruptus-wonderful-world-of.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~5/4i9xPLuHYFA/di20.mp3" length="30287460" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://www.archive.org/download/DramatisInterruptus-TheMagicalWorldofAndySchlafly/di20.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3051486633313496455.post-2346298568735837730</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jun 2011 20:47:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-06-03T15:59:21.595-05:00</atom:updated><title>Dramatis Interruptus is Delayed Due to Rain . . .</title><description>. . . or something like that. There was plenty to discuss this week, but I quickly discovered that there was nothing I could say that hadn't been said or written elsewhere. My backup was an editorial which I scrapped after realizing that it came across as hostile (something I'm trying to avoid). My choice was between doing a low-quality podcast or skipping this week and doing a better one next week. I chose the latter.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'd like my 20th cast to be on a topic of real interest to my listeners. Therefore, I would like you to tell me what the topic should be. I don't care if you're heard every episode or if this is your first time on the site - If you have an idea for an episode, leave it in the comments. If it's something I can discuss intelligently, it will make its way into next week's episode.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Finally, I'd like to take this opportunity to pimp my latest project. I've mentioned my writing before, particularly my frustrations with writer's websites. This time, I'm taking matters into my own hands. I will be posting portions of my manuscript over at &lt;a href="http://kingdomofsharks.wordpress.com/"&gt;Kingdom of Sharks&lt;/a&gt;, along with background information and rough drafts I'm workshopping. The passages are split up into nice, easy-to-digest chunks of around 500 words, so you're free to read the whole thing or just parts that interest you. As always, I appreciate your patronage.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3051486633313496455-2346298568735837730?l=dramatisinterruptus.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~4/9XnNqnZiZaY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DramatisInterruptus/~3/9XnNqnZiZaY/dramatis-interruptus-is-delayed-due-to.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (D Johnston)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://dramatisinterruptus.blogspot.com/2011/06/dramatis-interruptus-is-delayed-due-to.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3051486633313496455.post-90169970925224987</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2011 16:32:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2011-07-05T13:02:21.535-05:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">the Internet</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">pop culture</category><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">science</category><title>Dramatis Interruptus - On Being Provocative</title><description>&lt;div&gt;(&lt;a href="http://blip.tv/dramatis-personae/on-being-provocative-dramatis-interruptus-5205852"&gt;Blip.tv&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt8l64RS5bc"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://www.archive.org/download/DramatisInterruptus-BeingProvocative/di19.mp3"&gt;MP3&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;On the people who seek fame by offending their audiences;

Dispensationalism is a truly toxic worldview - nihilistic, spiteful, opposed to progress and in support of chaos. Millions of people are exposed to this worldview on a regular basis - in church, the social functions they attend, and even the entertainment they consume. Many of those people are children, fed a steady diet of End Times theology from the time they're able to read. When their leaders turn out to be wrong, these children of the apocalypse either take sanctuary in denial or lose faith in everything they've ever known.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the same time, there's no questioning that evangelicals - including the End Times set - have a great deal of influence over American politics. Evangelicals have been running the party machinery of the GOP for thirty years. They are an incredibly reliable voting bloc, consistently supporting Republicans even as those same Republicans all but ignore them. Beyond that, evangelicals are a major force in the culture. No one disputes this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So why is it that it's so hard to find anyone who's willing to take evangelicals seriously? They're either dismissed as crazies or used as a source of mockery. We point and laugh and high-five each other for being smarter than the kooks, but there are millions of these "kooks."
