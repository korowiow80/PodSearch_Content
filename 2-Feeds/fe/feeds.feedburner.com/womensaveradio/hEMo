				<div class="entry">
					<p>When you are listening to a radio program that is aimed at women having a man host it may not be the best idea.  For many women the idea that a man knows what they are thinking or how they feel about delicate subjects simply will not work.  Men do not know what it feels like to go through many of the medical or emotional things that women face every month.  One example is when it comes to women and <a href="http://www.womensaveradio.com/2012/06/01/should-female-oriented-radio-programs-be-hosted-by-men/#more-10" class="more-link">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</a></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>With many female oriented radio shows popping up across the nation, many misconceptions are popping up as well. Many listeners are used to male oriented radio shows and are uneasy about a woman taking control of the airwaves. In fact, some listeners are so worried that they have created several outrageous misconceptions! </p>
<p><b>Men Are Not Welcome to Call In</b><br />
Since the show is aimed at women many believe that men are not able to call in to voice their opinion. That is not only incorrect, but even offensive <a href="http://www.womensaveradio.com/2012/05/28/common-misconceptions-about-female-oriented-radio-stations/#more-9" class="more-link">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</a></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>A wave of female oriented shows are hitting the airwaves thanks to satellite radio.  Their has been a long debate about whether this is truly something effective.  </p>
<p>The answer, without question, is yes.  This provides such a wonderful platform from the traditional male-dominated radio shows.  Long gone are the days of platforms that only consisted of Howard Stern prototypes.  Today there is a much bigger need for more talent from female artists.</p>
<p>The ability to get some female oriented radio channels is important.  There are so many issues that women would like <a href="http://www.womensaveradio.com/2012/05/27/are-female-oriented-radio-channels-effective/#more-8" class="more-link">Read the rest of this entry &raquo;</a></p>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>There are many radio and television advertisements and commercials geared towards women. Where women are the primary audience or listener, of course, advertisers take this fact into consideration.  </p>
<p>So, it is considered what products are geared to or used mainly by women.  Feminine hygiene products may be the first product solely used by women and of course, always will be just for them.   But other products are geared towards women.  Beauty products including perfume, makeup, moisturizers and cleansers constitute the largest market anywhere.

					<p>Why do women like to listen to womenâ€™s radio stations?  Women like to listen to radio stations that have programs on issues that interest them.  They are concerned about being better parents while holding down a full-time job.  They also want to know what is out there in the job market.  They are also interested in community affairs and what is going on in all levels of government that affect women.</p>
