			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://ebusinessmap.com/images/green_checklist.jpg" alt="" title="checklist" width="400" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-75" /><br />
<strong>Target super focused groups of engaged visitors online.</strong></p>
<p>How to make money from a checklist.</p>
<p>Checklists are easy to research and provide a lot of great value for readers.<br />
You make money by sending targeted traffic to your affilate company.  To start<br />
you will need to sign up for Amazon.com&#8217;s affiliate program<br />
(https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/) and need to do some keyword research,<br />
but once you do that, you&#8217;re off to the races.</p>
<p>Keyword Research</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to make a checklist no one is searching for.  With a little<br />
keyword research you&#8217;ll be able to target a checklist and rank on Google<br />
(providing you free traffic).  I use the keyword tool found in Google&#8217;s Adwords<br />
area https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal</p>
<p>To start, search for the word &#8216;Checklist&#8217;.  You will get a whole list of<br />
possible ideas.  Next, click the column labeld &#8220;Global Monthly Searches&#8221;, it<br />
will organize the keywords with the most popular at the top.  Scroll through<br />
the list and find something with at least 500 searches but not a lot of<br />
competition either.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve found your term, head over to Google and type it in the search<br />
bar.  Look at the top five results for the phrase.   Right about now you&#8217;ll<br />
want to have an SEO toolbar installed.  I like this one<br />
http://tools.seobook.com/seo-toolbar/ (You&#8217;ll need to be using Firefox to use<br />
that tool.)</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve installed that toolbar you should turn it on.  Visit the top five<br />
results (or websites) again for your targeted term in Google.  Look at the<br />
little green bar in the toolbar that says &#8216;PageRank&#8217;.  If these results have a<br />
page rank of 3 or more you probably should look for another term to target.<br />
But, don&#8217;t give up on a term too early, sometimes by adding another word, you<br />
can target a smaller group of people and not have to compete with a broader<br />
term.  To find more targeted terms type your first phrase you like into the<br />
keyword tool.  For example, if your first term was &#8216;Camping Checklist&#8217; you<br />
would enter that in the keyword tool and do a follow-up search.  Your follow up<br />
search brings up a lot of more targeted alternatives &#8216;Camping checklist food&#8217;<br />
or &#8216;RV camping checkilist&#8217;.  Enter those phrases into Google and see what the<br />
competition is like.  If you find a phrase without much competition you&#8217;ve got<br />
a winner.</p>
<p>Rember that &#8216;checklist&#8217; is only the beginning.  The other thing you could<br />
search for are terms with &#8216;Top ten&#8217; or &#8216;Best&#8217; or &#8216;Planning&#8217;.  I think you get<br />
the idea.</p>
<p>Researching your checklist</p>
<p>Researching the checklist is simple.  Just spend a couple hours cherry picking<br />
the best items and information from all the various checklists out there.  Put<br />
some thought and provide specifics.  Give reseason why you&#8217;ve included some<br />
things and excluded others.  Make customized lists and make them well<br />
organized.  It is important that you don&#8217;t copy or steal someone elses list<br />
word for word.  You will not get any traffic from Google if you do that.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve posted your checklist on your website you need to build links.<br />
There are some tricks to building links but they aren&#8217;t too hard.   To start<br />
off you could write an article on EZinearticles.com using the phrase you&#8217;re<br />
targeting.  Many times these articles will rank on Google and send direct and<br />
SEO juice to your page.  Also, try to get links from sites that are ranking for<br />
the phrase you&#8217;re targeting.</p>
<p>There you have it, in a nutshell here are the things you need to make money<br />
from a checklist:<br />
1. Keyword Research<br />
2. Research and Create a Checklist<br />
3. Post it on your website with keyword rich URL<br />
4. Add your affiliate links to the various products in your checklist<br />
5. Build links to your page with article marketing and other means.  Try to<br />
get links from the top pages that are already ranking for the term.<br />
6. When visitors use your links to buy things on Amazon you get paid!</p>
<p>Things to Remember</p>
<p>You can get free traffic from Google.  It&#8217;s important to remember that Google<br />
ranks pages, not websites, for specific keywords (most of the time).  I&#8217;ve done<br />
this with a brand new website, starting from scratch, and within a month I was<br />
on the first page of Google.  The trick is to do good keyword research in the<br />
beginning.</p>
<p>Starting a Buusiness</p>
<p>1. [1]Get a website.</p>
<p>2. Sign up for affiliate programs.</p>
<p>3. Get Traffic</p>
<p>Marketing Tips</p>
<p>In a nutshell here are the things you need to make money from a checklist:<br />

<p>I’ve set some rigorous goals to guide my online businesses this year.  In perusing these goals it became clear that my productivity needed improvement.  There are three areas of improvement: Behavior, Mechanical, and Mindset.</p>
<p>Starting work is never fun.  Once work starts I actually enjoy myself.  Finishing a project always feels great.  The trick is making the start of work as easy as possible.  These are some things I’m trying.</p>
<h2>Behavior upgrades</h2>
<p><strong>Google homepage now has only task related items</strong><br />
Things like the news, Digg, Delicious, Reddit, and RSS readers have been moved to tab called “Time Wasters”.  Up till now I’ve had everything on one page.  If I needed to check my email or reference my calendar I was exposed to a lot of great headlines and interesting news.  A five-minute visit soon turned into an hour of reading offbeat news.  If I have time for that in the future I’ll click the “Time Waster” tab.<br />
<strong><br />
Shut down unused browser windows</strong><br />
 As the day goes on my taskbar is filled with a huge amount of unused browser windows.  By closing down the browser windows it helps me stay on task and see things through to completion.  It will also reduce my distractions.</p>
<p><strong>Clean up my workstation</strong><br />
I’ve also made an effort to clean my desk and declutter my work area. Time has been dedicated to organizing files and folders on my computer too.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure everything works</strong><br />
Spending money on ink or toner cartages is the worst.  For months I’ve put it off.   In an effort to improve productivity, the toner in now full and I can print to my hearts content.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Good Sleep</strong><br />
Trying to write good content or think through difficult problems just doesn’t happen when I’m tired.  My mind can’t be tricked, coerced, or coaxed into thinking (but sometimes chemicals help).  It’s a simple machine that runs like a charm if I give it a good amount of sleep.  Personally, I’m a 9-hour-a-night person.  8 hours of sleep isn’t bad but my body and mind feel great after a full 9 hours.</p>
<h2>Mechanical upgrades</h2>
<p><strong>Upgrade Internet connection</strong><br />
The extra money to go from 2 MB to 7MB per second is worth the investment.  Waiting for my internet connections isn’t worth it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>RAM upgrade</strong><br />
RAM (or Memory) is one of the best ways to make your computer run faster.  Getting “under the hood” of your computer is easier than you might expect.  You don’t have to have an electrical engineering degree to tinker with the guts of your computer.  Each plug is unique and many things are color-coded.  As long as you turn the power off and make sure you’re grounded you shouldn’t be able to do much damage.  Look up your motherboard brand and find the RAM that fits the slots.  All RAM is not the same so make sure you buy the right stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Dual monitors</strong><br />
Most nerds like me have had dual monitors for years.  I’ve finally made the jump and I love it.  It’s actually really easy to get two monitors.  If you have a <a href="http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&#038;um=1&#038;hl=en&#038;client=firefox-a&#038;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&#038;q=dvi+&#038;btnG=Search+Images" target="_blank">DVI plug</a> on your video card you can buy an adapter to add an additional monitor.  <a href="http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-2717172-10440023?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FProductList.aspx%3FSubmit%3DENE%26N%3D40000353%26Description%3Ddvi%2Bto%2Bvga%26name%3DAdapters%2B%2526%2BGender%2BChangers" target="_blank" onmouseover="window.status='http://www.newegg.com';return true;" onmouseout="window.status=' ';return true;">Find your DVI to VGA adapter here. </a><br />
<img src="http://www.lduhtrp.net/image-2717172-10440023" width="1" height="1" border="0"/></p>
<h2>Mindset Upgrades</h2>
<p><strong>Stop the time wasting cycle</strong><br />
My hands automatically type in the same five URLS whenever I get to a computer with an Internet connection.  Even though I’ve checked my email 10 minutes ago I find myself pulling it up again.  Throughout the day I will pull up the same five sites over and over.  When I’m tired the cycle gets more frequent.  While most of these sites are important I will limit my exposure to them.  Most importantly, these are the site’s I visit last instead of first.  Writing great content and business planning comes first.</p>
<p><strong>Stop patting myself on the back</strong><br />
Once something difficult has been accomplished I find myself patting myself on the back.  While that’s usually a good thing I tend to take it too far.  Instead of jumping on the next big project I use my recent accomplishment as an excuse to relax.  One big accomplishment will stop a week of progress.  Do you know what I do with my time instead?  I type the same 5 URLs mentioned above all day long.  It’s sad, I know.<br />
<strong><br />
Think in terms of accomplishments</strong><br />
Using good ideas as a protection from working hard is a crutch I use regularly.  Instead of buckling down and working I’d rather dream up new ideas.  This is changing as I refocus on the work at hand.</p>
<p><strong>An item on a list is a special thing</strong><br />
In the past I’ve had a tendency to make to-do lists and include some unreachable items.  It feels good to include a massive undertaking on a list but it cheapens the whole thing.  A few weeks after I add items like that the list is worthless.  I don’t even want to look at it anymore.  To be more productive I’ll only include things on the list that can be accomplished within the week.</p>
<p>If anyone has anything to add please leave a comment.</p>

<p>This is the last episode on building back links. It should be noted that these are areas where discretion is advised.  Using these platforms to build links can be a highly successful but can backfire if not used correctly.  Where does healthy promotion turn into SPAM.  I think its fair to say that if you provide little to the community beyond a link its spamming.  Most of these are relationship based.  The regular users are protective and have certain rules to follow.  Self promotion and random additions don’t cut it most of the time.  Try following some of these suggestions when building backlinks with social media sites.<br />
<strong><br />
1-Don’t try to fit a square peg in a round hole.</strong> Join forums and look for social sites that are complementary to the theme of your website.  If you have a motherhood blog sign up for motherhood forums and comment on other motherhood blogs.<br />
<strong>2-Build relationships and gain friendships.</strong>  Web 2.0 is more about interaction and less about broadcasting. When you find a few niche places where you fit in try building relationships and don’t piss people off.<br />
<strong>3-Add value.</strong>  If you have an article or nifty service that the community would benefit from try submitting it.  Some site’s like Digg frown on self submission while Reddit doesn’t (for the most part).  By knowing the community and having some friends I’m sure it would help to have them do it.<br />
<strong>4-Make your links a side note instead of the main event.</strong><br />
<strong>5-Game the system within the boundaries.</strong>  Social news sites have a core of very dedicated users. They submit and vote on content 8 to 10 hours a day. These users have a tight group of friends.  Together they dominate what is voted up and what gets thrown out.  They are gaming the system but Kevin Rose (the founder of Digg) actually counts on these users to weed out spammers and other less savory people.  While social sites hate the idea of being gamed they’re whole system depends on it.  The moral here is: gaming is okay if you’re not a jerk about it and everyone likes you.<br />
<strong>6- Know what’s popular.</strong>  If you’re an active reader and user of some of these sites you’ll start to get a feel for what the community likes.  Helpful lists, development tools, funny pictures, amusing stories, valuable tips, and sensational news is some of the most popular things.  If you can put together an interesting story or useful list try getting it in and see how it does.<br />
<strong>7-All traffic is not equal. </strong> The type of traffic coming from different social vary in quality.  Some sites provide visitors that spend more time on your site and other visitors consume and leave quickly.  While many standard conversion goals aren’t reached (i.e. clicking on ads, signing up for newsletters, and subscribing) it’s possible to have other rewards from bad traffic.  Backlinks are common in the coming weeks after becoming popular on these social sites.</p>
<p>There are some general rules with forums as well.<br />
<strong>1-Remember to use your signature wisely. </strong> Providing a few meaningful links in your signature will provide a backlink each time you comment.  Sometimes it makes sense to include an affiliate link as one of your links.<br />
<strong>2-Whatever you do don’t piss of the owners of the forum.</strong>  The same rules apply here in forums as on social sites.  There are definitely different personalities in each forum.  Find one the works good for you.<br />
<em>For blog comments:</em><br />
<strong>1-Don’t SPAM.</strong>  Most spam is filtered out automatically for having the wrong set of keywords.<br />
<strong>2-Add to the conversation. </strong> That means reading the blog and reading the <strong>comments. If you can&#8217;t bear to read both don&#8217;t leave a comment.<br />
3-Backlinks are getting less love</strong> &#8211; Many backlinks on blogs are automatically labeled  with “no follow”  and won’t do you any good anyways.<br />
<strong>4-Again, find blogs where you fit in.</strong></p>
<p>Hope this helps.  If you have any further advise please leave a comment.</p>

<p>Paid directories and press releases are both excellent ways to get your website more backlinks.</p>
<p>There are some general rules to go by before you start paying your hard earned cash to paid directories.  For starters, make sure you have enough content for the directories to make a fair judgment on your site.  As a rule of thumb at least ten original pages but the more the better.  Make sure your site isn’t under construction, partially finished, or have dead links.</p>
<p>The good paid directories use your money to hire someone to professionally review your site.  The good paid directories will decline applications.  Paying the money doesn’t mean your website will be included.  This aspect of paid directories is what makes them more credible in the eyes of search engines.</p>
<p>Spending a good chuck of change on good paid directories is a good idea.  If you only want to spend money on getting into one directory make that directory Yahoo.  Yahoo charges $299 as an initial review fee and another $299 annually from that point on.  It sounds like a lot but if you’re accepted into the directory it will one of your most important backlinks to your site.</p>
<p>These are the minimum criteria to be included in the directory:<br />
•	If the site is a commercial web site, the official business name must be visible to any visitor to that site;<br />
•	The site must clearly define its purpose, products, and/or services;<br />
•	The site may not appear in the Directory under a different URL;<br />
•	If the site is applicable to a specific geographic region, the address must be visible to any visitor to that site;<br />
•	The site must not contain any parts under construction;<br />
•	All links on the site must function properly;<br />
•	The site must be in the English language (or have an English version available);<br />
•	The site must support multiple browsers and capabilities (e.g., no Java-only sites);<br />
•	The site must be up and running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week;<br />
•	The site must not be dedicated to directing the user to another page;<br />
•	The page may not give the search engine different content than what the end-user sees.</p>
<p>From Yahoo Directory <a href="https://ecom.yahoo.com/dir/reference/submit">Terms and Conditions</a></p>
<p>To say the least it’s important to read the terms and conditions before you submit to any paid directory.</p>
<p>Here’s a short list of the top paid directories:<br />
dir.yahoo.com<br />
stpt.com/directory/<br />
joeant.com<br />
ezilon.com<br />
botw.org<br />
elib.org<br />
directory.v7n.com<br />
rlrouse.com<br />
uncoverthenet.com<br />
abilogic.com<br />

<p>Article submission is a great way to bring traffic to your site and build backlinks.  There are five key advantages to using articles to build backlinks.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are allowed 2-3 backlinks for every article you submit.  </li>
<li>You have complete control over the anchor text for each link</li>
<li>Every backlink is a oneway link, many times from PR 6 sites</li>
<li>Depending on how good the article is it can be picked-up posted in other places, thus, building more backlinks.</li>
<li>Article traffic is a means to get traffic on highly competitive keyterms.</li>
</ul>
<p>These facts make articles a very attractive way to get traffic and links.  The only downside is that people can take your content and remove the links.  The good news is that Google doesn’t count stolen or duplicated content as valuable.  This should be enough incentive to deter would be thieves but there still is a good chance it will be plagiarized or stolen.</p>
<p>As a general rule it would be best not to host the articles you’re submitting on your site.  The exception to this is if you post the article on your site, wait for it to get indexed, then start posting in article directories.  I’ve done both and would suggest not hosting your articles on your site.  Instead send them to your author page on one of these article directories.</p>
<p>When writing your article try to give some good information and submit your best work.  Keep things simple and easy to read.  Avoid run-on sentences.  Don’t go crazy on the length.  Shorter articles can be just as good or better than really long articles.  A standard requirement is a minimum of 500 to 700 words.  Avoid making your article a sales letter.  You’ll seriously hurt the chances of having your article picked up and distributed by other people.</p>
<p>At the end of the article its common to have an “about the author” section.  If I’m trying to get more keyword phrases in, sometimes I’ll use “Additional Resources” as the text before my links.  That way I don’t have to work my keyword phrases into an awkward author profile.</p>
<p>If you have a really great article maybe you don’t want to submit it everywhere.  If this is the case you might consider the alternative of posting it on your site and have social media sites look at it there.  We’ll talk more on that in the next episode.</p>
<p>This is a list of article submission sites I’ve combed through and submitted to personally.  Most of them are general-purpose directories.  If you have a specific niche or type of business you may want to seek out topic specific article directories.  If you want the Excel sheet subscribe to Premium Content and send it after the episode is published.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Since last episode talked about paid directories and this episode will talk about free directories I thought this excerpt from <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/how-to-report-paid-links/">Matt Cutt&#8217;s blog</a> was interesting.  Even though he talks about reporting paid links most of the time he does provide this gem of knowledge regarding directories:</p>
<p><strong>Q: Hey, as long as we’re talking about directories, can you talk about the role of directories, some of whom charge for a reviewer to evaluate them?</strong></p>
<p>A: I’ll try to give a few rules of thumb to think about when looking at a directory. When considering submitting to a directory, I’d ask questions like:<br />
- Does the directory reject urls? If every url passes a review, the directory gets closer to just a list of links or a free-for-all link site.<br />
- What is the quality of urls in the directory? Suppose a site rejects 25% of submissions, but the urls that are accepted/listed are still quite low-quality or spammy. That doesn’t speak well to the quality of the directory.<br />
- If there is a fee, what’s the purpose of the fee? For a high-quality directory, the fee is primarily for the time/effort for someone to do a genuine evaluation of a url or site.</p>
<p>Matt Cutts &#8220;joined Google as a software engineer in January 2000. He&#8217;s currently the head of Google&#8217;s Webspam team.&#8221; In other words, he&#8217;s the one in charge of natural search rankings at Google.  He adjusts the alogorith to filter out &#8220;spammers&#8221; or people that are trying to take advantage of Google.</p>
<p>With that as an intro let&#8217;s talk about the next two ways to build backlinks.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3:  Free Directories</strong><br />
It&#8217;s important to remember the role of directories in internet history.  Back in the &#8217;90&#8242;s directories were much more useful.  Search Engines weren&#8217;t very advanced and the web was still relatively new.  Directories were a way for to collect the best websites in one place.  But today directories are on their way out.  Links from directories aren&#8217;t as useful as they used to be.  That&#8217;s not to say they aren&#8217;t important and you&#8217;d be wasting your time,  it&#8217;s just important to know how they are viewed in the current environment.</p>
<p>With that said, you can find a big list of free directories here: <a href="http://info.vilesilencer.com/main.php?rock=seo-friendly.php">http://info.vilesilencer.com/main.php?rock=seo-friendly.php </a>.

If you&#8217;re lucky you won&#8217;t get a corrupt editor and your site will be included!  This is a good starter list to get your site some backlinks.</p>
<p>Good Luck,</p>

<p>Building backlinks is one of the most important aspects of SEO.  Who, where, and how many all are important.  This six step series will guide you through popular ways to get backlinks.</p>
<p>As we discussed before, don’t use automated, subscriber based services, or other shortcuts.  There is no substitute for good old fashioned hard work!</p>
<p>These steps assume you’ve already made a keyword spreadsheet and have your top terms selected.  If you don’t have your terms selected this tool will help immensely. <a href="http://tools.seobook.com/general/keyword/">SEOBook Keyword Tool.</a></p>
<p>STEP 1:  Email Link Requests<br />
Your competitors are on the front page because of their backlinks, age, and on-page optimization.  You can’t do much about the age of your domain but you can change the other two aspects.</p>
<p>Type your phrase your competing on: “little dog clothes”  The top result is www.gwlittle.com</p>
<p>Now take that domain and plug it into your backlink checkers.  I like <a href="http://www.iwebtool.com/backlink_checker">http://www.iwebtool.com/backlink_checker</a> because it provided the pagerank of the link.  That way you don’t spend all your time chasing down low value links.   I like this tool <a href="http://www.webuildpages.com/neat-o/">http://www.webuildpages.com/neat-o/</a>  because it also gives you the anchor text with the page.  Use both tools together to get a combination of anchor text and page rank.</p>
<p>After you get 10-15 quality links to pursue, write them a personalized email.  Try not to sound like an automated spammer.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE:</p>
<p>Hi [Name – try to get a name if at all possible],</p>
<p>Your site on [subject] is very interesting.  I found your list of resources on [url of page] helpful.  I’m a small business owner of www.[websitename].com.  We provide [describe services] and would be a valuable resource to your visitors.  Please come check us out at www.[your website].com</p>
<p>This is my personal email address and phone number, [name@email.com]. Please feel free to contact me.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>[Name]</p>
<p>STEP 2: Submit to Paid Inclusion Directories<br />
These directories are trusted directories and provide great backlinks quickly.  If you have to pick just one, pick yahoo.  An important thing to remember when submitting to most directories is that your site can’t be under construction or not have any content on it.  Yahoo will decline your site if it looks like hell.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/internet/google-ranking-factors.htm">This list</a> is incredible. Reading through forums is okay but this list has it all with no searching.</p>
<p>As a summary this is these are the major factors for</p>
<p> <strong>On-Site SEO:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Good Factors-</strong><br />
1 &#8211; Keyword in URL &#8211; First word is best, second is second best, etc.<br />
2 &#8211; Keyword in Domain name &#8211; Same as in page-name-with-hyphens. <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/dashes-vs-underscores/">DON&#8217;T_USE_UNDERSCORES!</a> *Note &#8211; As of this month<br />
3 &#8211; Keyword in Title tag &#8211; Keyword in Title tag close to beginning &#8211; Title tag 10 &#8211; 60 characters, no special characters.<br />
4- Keywords in H1,H2, H3 tags<br />
5- Site Age</p>
<p>Bad things on your pages to avoid:<br />
1- Over optimization penalty<br />
2- Linking to bad neighborhoods<br />
3- Excessive crosslinking among sites with the same c-class (or sites in general) Use this tool to check <a href="http://www.seochat.com/seo-tools/class-c-checker/">c class</a><br />
4- Keyword stuffing (Don&#8217;t cram every keyword under the sun in your Meta tags and in the body)<br />
5- Hiding or being sneaky with keywords and web pages (Cloaking, same color text of the background.<br />
6- Changing a page too often too much.<br />
7- Imbalance of code to text ratio.</p>
<p> <strong>Off-Site SEO:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Good Factors-</strong><br />
1- The anchor text of inbound links coming into you.  When building your inbound links try to get your keyword phrase as the link.  Example: Buy <u>Small Dog Clothes</u> here VS Buy small dog clothes <u>here</u>.  Be CAREFUL with this though.  Just like the Over Optimization penalty too many links saying the exact same thing can hurt you.</p>
<p>2-  Age of link &#8211; If you buy a link or get a link on a page make sure its there forever.  If you have links going up and down or changing anchor text Google will frown at you.</p>
<p>3- Link from Expert Sites</p>
