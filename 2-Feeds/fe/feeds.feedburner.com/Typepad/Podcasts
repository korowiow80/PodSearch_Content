<p>This month, we talk to Brendan Halpin, author of two memoirs and three books of fiction. His latest, <em>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</em>, is a simmering romance between two scarred souls who have each been on the wrong side of a hit break-up song. Music plays a big part in this novel and all of Halpin's work, and we talk to the author about his take on pop in 2007, as well as his life as a teacher and a writer, and the ins and outs of marketing yourself as a novelist on the Internet. Visit Brendan's <a href="http://brendanhalpin.typepad.com/">TypePad blog</a> and check the <a href="http://books.typepad.com/store/">TypePad Bookstore</a> for the opportunity to buy <em>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</em> or any of Halpin's previous work.

<p>This month, we're expanding our podcast schedule. To this point, we've been picking one author per month to promote, interview, and otherwise honor with the title of TypePad Book of the Month. Well, it just isn't enough. We've got so many great writers using the TypePad platform that 12 per year can't even begin to tell the story. Starting with this podcast conversation with Brian Bailey, author of the newly released book <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/sixapart-20/detail/0787984876/104-6642026-8348762"><strong><em>The Blogging Church</em></strong></a>, we'll be bringing as many authors as we can to this podcast and to the <a href="http://books.typepad.com/store/">TypePad Bookstore</a>.</p>

<p>We recently talked to Bailey about his own experience as a blogger (at <a href="http://www.leaveitbehind.com/">Leave It Behind</a>), what led him to write a book about creating blogs for religious ministries, and what surprised him the most about the creative process.</p>
