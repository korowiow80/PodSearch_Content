			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay well its been over a year since I have really even posted any of the live shows I&#8217;ve been doing and of course there hasn&#8217;t been a show every week, but there have been quite a few shows over the past year.  Most were recorded, but just weren&#8217;t quite what I wanted for the podcast of this show.  Well a lot has changed and well, this podcast has changed and if you liked it before, I hope you will like it even more now as I have made some improvements on some things and I am happier with it.  So I decided that I will continue to bring the podcast on a regular basis now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now this show was one that almost didn&#8217;t happen.  You see, I was on the turntables for a few hours and was broadcasting but there apparently was an issue with the broadcast and you know me when it comes to technical difficulties.  I get frustrated and quit the show.  Well I suffered through it this time and well here it is.  As you can probably tell, I&#8217;m a bit rusty on the turntables since I really haven&#8217;t used them much for the past year.  But here&#8217;s a bit of an old school hip hop mix.  Playlist pending, this is just a raw unedited mix so take it for what its worth.  This week, you also have to deal with a 320k MP3&#8230;hey its better audio quality, so you can hear my fuckups in perfect clarity!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Show #244 &#8220;WTF Did She Say, Pt 3?&#8221;<br />
Friday, June 13, 2008, 10pm to 1am</p>
<p><em>Summary </em></p>
<p>This show started very slowly and definitely picked up towards the end&#8230;(Zero Arrogant Bastard Ale at the beginning&#8230;2 or 3 by the end of the show).  This was also the last time the show was on AH100&#8230; Yeah it was all a big funny joke to me.  This was also the last time the show was part on XLR radio.  XLR wasnt a joke, but the show will now just be live through madbeatfactory.com.  Some highlights of the show tonight, King Skullie lost his crown this week (Don&#8217;t call him NUBB).  The only cohost thats ever been part of this show, was being a troublemaker, coming in the chatroom calling me a sellout&#8230;that naughty girl.  After a bit of a dubsession, MBC got mad about being distracted so he played some really loud noisy songs as revenge.  Afterwards, we got opened up the phone lines and were treated to yet another call from the lovely Samantha.  We tried to see if she would consistent with her age again this week, and as always, had to help her figure out how to log in.  We also had an attempted call from the X-man, but it just didnt work out.</p>
<p>Rooster then called in to provide input on the Samantha situation, we talked some Douchecast, online dating, gas prices, etc.  Samantha called back because she was unhappy that her accent was being made fun of, but we talked about her on LR, and then her phone cut off again.  We called Rooster back and talked more Samantha, Douchecast, and the Mad Beat Factory hiatus.  Biff called to voice his complaints about Rooster being a phone whore.  We also spoke about Douchecast and ubroadcast.  When we got back to Rooster, he was asking me if the woman sending me dirty IMs throughout the show was Holly Ho.  We discussed her and her antics for a while, and little did I know, Rooster was setting me up, as he had her call in while he and I were on the phone&#8230;Just wait to hear my reaction when I realized it was her calling.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t even attempt to understand the show after the last phone call.  Just listen and enjoy, or turn it off if its too much to handle.</p>

Summary 

This show started very slowly and definitely picked up towards the end...(Zero Arrogant Bastard Ale at the beginning...2 or 3 by the end of the show).nbsp; This was also the last time the show was on AH100... Yeah it was all a big funny joke to me.  This was also the last time the show was part on XLR radio.  XLR wasnt a joke, but the show will now just be live through madbeatfactory.com.  Some highlights of the show tonight, King Skullie lost his crown this week (Don't call him NUBB).  The only cohost thats ever been part of this show, was being a troublemaker, coming in the chatroom calling me a sellout...that naughty girl.  After a bit of a dubsession, MBC got mad about being distracted so he played some really loud noisy songs as revenge.  Afterwards, we got opened up the phone lines and were treated to yet another call from the lovely Samantha.  We tried to see if she would consistent with her age again this week, and as always, had to help her figure out how to log in.  We also had an attempted call from the X-man, but it just didnt work out.

Rooster then called in to provide input on the Samantha situation, we talked some Douchecast, online dating, gas prices, etc.  Samantha called back because she was unhappy that her accent was being made fun of, but we talked about her on LR, and then her phone cut off again.

Saturday, 12am-2:30am</p>
<p>This is the aftershow portion of the Mad Beat Factory.  This evening, we had a phone call from girl caller Samantha once again.  She always has a lot to say.  Whether you know what she is talking about is on you.  She is looking for a new boyfriend so all you guys out there, she is looking at you as a prospective boyfriend.  Unless of course you are in  Iowa or Texas&#8230;she already went through all you guys.  Everyone else is fair game.  She also unknowingly made a LunaticRadio.com drunk call hotline call that was featured on this weeks show.  HA!!!!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Show# 228 - &#8220;What People Do For Money&#8221;<br />
Saturday, March 1, 2008, 8pm to 10pm</p>
<p>A little taste of what the show would be if it were sold-out.  Hahaha!  Complete with ads, sell-out music, and stupid trivia games.  But you know that as always&#8230;the dread always comes out and we find our way back to the dark pure sounds of dub.  However, when the dub just wasn&#8217;t suitable for one listener that wanted to hear house/trance/techno, MBC attempted to mess with his head by playing cheesy Canadian music until Mr. MBC realized his turntables were all discombobulated because of some experiments from earlier in the week.  MBC FTL =(  So we found our way back into the dub for a while&#8230;found out what people do for money&#8230;sent out an anti-drug message&#8230;received some breaking news from Nextgen570&#8230;and went on a space voyage with the Creation Rebel.</p>
<p>Entering the second hour of the show, we had a call from girl caller Julez, pretending her name was &#8220;Mariah.&#8221;  She told a story about a guy sending txt messages from her cell phone while she was drunk, guys who get with puking girls, and drunken naked pics.  During the second hour we changed up the groove and began playing mostly 80&#8217;s music.  Girl caller Penny called into the show from the titty bar right before she was about to go get a lap dance.  Played a little stripper music and then got back into the 80&#8217;s music.</p>
<p><em>AFTERSHOW</em></p>
<p>We played some music trivia with the chatroom audience during the after hours portion of the show.</p>

Saturday, January 26, 2008, 9pm to 12:15am</p>
<p>Backed by the sounds of 80&#8217;s freestyle, MBC &amp; MzWhoMe put on another show getting off to a late start.  With wide open telephones tonight, MBC and WhoMe took phone calls from Teesha and Kingdomz Kutz.  There were many many random stories told on this show as well as MzWhoMe gossiping about fashion faux-pas.  Teesha&#8217;s bodily functions entertained us during her calls.  All in all, it was a pretty fun show.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Show #216 - &#8220;The WhoMe Show&#8221;<br />
Saturday, January 19, 2008, 9:30pm to 12:15am</p>
<p>While I fumbled around for the first five minutes trying to get the show ready to go, MzWhoMe sat at the control console looking pretty, eating french fries, sippin on some Mr. Pibb, and she even managed to fit in a nice little rant about using the word TWAT.  And this was all before the show actually started.   So the show began with MzWhoMe at the controls and she selected some great tracks from funk, to soul, to old school hiphop tracks.  In her search, she came across a man by the name of Mr Pookie and expressed her disdain for a grown man going by the name of Pookie.  At one point, while MBC was working the equipment in the background, he turned on the sound effects for MzWhoMe&#8217;s voice, causing her to sound a bit like a tranny.  She about kicked MBC&#8217;s ass until he got into his Bruce Lee stance.  MzWhoMe taught us about changing the words to hiphop songs so you can sing them and not get in trouble.  Speaking of getting in trouble, MBC yells at his mics too much and they do not like him anymore.  They do however like MzWhoMe so at least you can hear her speaking.  Because the mics like her so much, she was able to rant and rant about things like TWAT, talk about Soaring Over California, and using the word Hispanic.  The next hour or so of the show was MBC on the turntables, with some random MzWhoMe rants thrown in here and there, and when she rants, she goes until she runs out of breath.  As always, there was discussion of farts, MzWhoMe getting fired for being a trouble maker, and now MBC needs to stop using sound effects on MzWhoMe.</p>
<p>Oh shit!!  I forgot MzWhoMe started talking dirty to the chatroom!!!  That was funny shit!  We had to discuss Kingdomz Kutz Tim Berlake dance and cholo dancing.  More topic discussed, we don&#8217;t wear red around here in So Cali, guys saying someone is just an old friend when a woman asks who it is, Celebrity Rehab, using Nintendo DS&#8217; in Las Vegas, conveyor belt sidewalk in Vegas&#8230;wow we are nerds.  Somehow we began talking about Britney Spears, Jamie Lynn Spears, and Juno and then had to explain to chatroom listeners that we were actually both in the same room right next to each other and not using some gamer chat program to talk to each other&#8230;damn, and I thought we were the nerds.  We learned that the origins of the name Whomequa came to be because people hear her and think she is a Sistah!  Why do New Yorkers think NY is the shit??  I think we are beginning to understand East Coast/West Coast rivalries.</p>

About 10pm on December 31, 2007, we turned off the feed until about 11:30pm and reopened the broadcast and went live for a small audience for New Year&#8217;s Eve. In studio for the evening, was MzWhoMe.  So a majority of the show was us talking to the people in the chatroom and we got so sidetracked, we kept forgetting to countdown to the new year and then we decided to do a scavenger hunt.  First the listeners gave us things to look for here, then we gave them things to look for in their houses and they had to show us on cam all the items they found.   We pretty much sat around not doing much of anything.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again, playing all new dubs never before heard on the Mad Beat Factory.  Like so many other episodes, the Mad Beat Chemist starts off tonights show a little mad.  The madness eventually turns into the psychedelic dub mixing and live track rebuilding.  Nearing the end of the show, Rooster called the show and we were unable to hear him at all.  So soon after, PhattyBiff called in and then all hell broke loose.  Sybrows called in from the UK to give us a special messge..FAJEETAS.  We then called Rooster back and the three of us talked about a lot of nonsense things like, Yahoo vs Skype, phone numbers, English accents, BBQ, meatloaf, cocksucker royales, watching boobies on cam, granny watching 2girls1cup, yellaface, speculums, and pee in the hole.  Biff wonders if it sucks being British and then takes over the show while I take a phone call.  Sybrows calls back in to chime in on Rooster and Biff&#8217;s English pronunciations.  So we discussed some after show activities, radio theater, and Biff graced the show with a brand new Friday night outro.<br />

		<itunes:summary>Once again, playing all new dubs never before heard on the Mad Beat Factory.  Like so many other episodes, the Mad Beat Chemist starts off tonights show a little mad.  The madness eventually turns into the psychedelic dub mixing and live track rebuilding.  Nearing the end of the show, Rooster called the show and we were unable to hear him at all.  So soon after, PhattyBiff called in and then all hell broke loose.  Sybrows called in from the UK to give us a special messge..FAJEETAS.  We then called Rooster back and the three of us talked about a lot of nonsense things like, Yahoo vs Skype, phone numbers, English accents, BBQ, meatloaf, cocksucker royales, watching boobies on cam, granny watching 2girls1cup, yellaface, speculums, and pee in the hole.

Fri. Nov. 30, 2007, 10PM to 12AM PST</p>
<p>It was a cold and rainy night and so we started off with a darker, gloomier sound than usual. Tonight&#8217;s musical selection is definitely not the usual fare that you get week to week at the Mad Beat Factory. After the first 30 minutes, we had wide open phone lines. We only had two callers tonight and both were drunk. However, one is a professional drinker and the other an amateur. Our first call came from WaterLilly who was drinking some Bacardi 151. She was very loud the entire time, laughing about everything, and she was VERY drunk. She had a lot of stories to tell, my favorite was one about her riding her bike from Salt Lake City to New York. After I hung up on her, I&#8217;m assuming she continued talking for a while before she realized she got hung up on but we received a call from a professional drinker, EmoTony. We discussed WaterLilly, another non-fan of Ustream, vain drunks on cam, Tony Typing, and the Ron Jeremy of TPXRadio. WaterLilly then called back and was going to take a shot while on the phone&#8230;it was a mess.</p>

<p>MBC is back on the turntables tonight, for the first official Live show on Ustream.tv. So for the first hour, it is a mix of Drum n Bass and jungle. The second hour is a mixture of different styles of music which started with some old school hiphop. We got a call from Mark and he told about his love of Llama&#8217;s and how he wants a llama that eats people. Later in the evening, the Llama lover was kicked out for calling someone OLD, so there was an MBC rant about calling people OLD. After that, MzWhoMe called in to tell MBC to calm down and then we discussed everyone who complains about the new Ustream chatroom.</p>

<p>It was a perfect weather day like any other in San Diego. The walk to work this evening was especially memorable&#8230;felt like I was walking on the southern edge of the world, the sky was purple with a light scattering of clouds. It was like almost any other day. The 8 hour shift I worked went by in a blur&#8230;I arrived back home and first heard the news that morning. After waking up, we went to Clinton&#8217;s house. We barely knew him, but they had a bag of balloons and a medical grade tank.

<p>Well as has been tradition here at the factory for quite some time now, we had a slight technical issue.  I didn&#8217;t begin recording until 15 minutes into the show.  Well could you blame me, there were tits right next to me.  They were staring at me and making me lose my concentration!  So you are left with this trainwreck of a show, but it was still fun.  We were inundated with phone calls tonight.  We had calls from Bean93, xxAbsentxx (WGAY The Wad, AskAFatDude.com), PhattyBiff (AskAFatDude.com), Rockit (LunaticRadio.com), and Sybrows (our UK man on the scene).  In the shat chat, we were even treated to Pita (wearing Sodomy handles and a Hockey Jersey) doing the Electric Slide while Beer Bear tricked us all with video of him sitting at home drinking a beer, yet he was really at work.  While MzWhoMe took control of the keyboard, MBC took control of turntables.  It was really just another night of MadBeat insanity.  Oh and by the way, Eff that Biatch SAMMIS!!!  &#8220;What is this gay voicemail (isht) that you&#8217;re givin&#8217; me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the creator of this show has a lack of creativity.  But I have EMO HAIR and that should count for something!!!  I DON&#8217;T CARE!!  Buy my damn book.</p>
<p>The people you hear at the beginning are the infamous EMOs, <a href="http://www.stickam.com/profile/storytold" target="_blank">Story Told</a>. Just kidding, I don&#8217;t know if they are emos, nor do I care, and they seem like some cool cats so you should go check them out.  But the emos and the emo hair run rampant on that website.  The Mad Beat Factory does not stand up to the emo image, even with emo hair.  Thank you, we will continue to DUB you every Friday and Saturday night!!!  This is probably one of the worst recordings ever as all the channels didn&#8217;t even make it into the final mix.  These things happen when I try to make studio changes during the week and not everything gets plugged back in where it should be.  Feel free to make known your complaints and whatnot!</p>

<p>Although the show is still live every Friday and Saturday night, this has been the first Live show recorded and posted for download since last November.  I hope you enjoy!  The recording was rather subpar for this evening but I do not apologize one bit!  My tech issues make the show what it has become to this day!  Although I won&#8217;t be posting a playlist for this show&#8230;WHY???  I DONT WANT TO.  Anyways, although I won&#8217;t be posting a playlist for this show, here are a few minor highlights.  The Krazy Korean Lady called once again.  She sounded a bit mad at me.  I took a trip to the bank and got a roll of quarters from Chesty LaRue.  All I wanted was a roll of quarters, JUST A ROLL OF QUARTERS!  Also tried out a new concept!!  Did this whole show totally SOBER!!  :::BURP:::  Found Captain Stabbin and Isaac&#8230;Jack Jones sang the theme music to that party and he brought the fucking HOUSE down!   Isaac found my Compton crate and started playing some appropriate music.  Then all of a sudden Isaac turned into my friend from high school who was a Boston Celtics fan.  All of a sudden there&#8217;s fucking shamrocks and shenanigans all over the damn place.  When we found the Blarney Stone, it kinda made everyone walk funny.  Some bitches dropped it like it was hot, others just dropped it cuz I&#8217;m So Fly.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I Like It, but do I really have it like that, no I Dont&#8217; Think So.</p>
<p>As we arrived at the midnight hour, and the calendar turned to Feb 10, 2007, I played some J Dilla in memory of the one year anniversary of his passing.</p>

<p>What began nearly two years ago is finally beginning to make sense&#8230;kinda!</p>
<p>There are times when the shows goes on late into the night.  Listeners fall asleep and head off to bed.  But the Factory goes on and on.  It is during these late hours that the show turns into something of this sort.  I figure no one is listening anymore due to the late hour of the night and I can&#8217;t help but experiment and build upon old ideas.    This is part 2 in a series of audio madness, that I call the Oddcast.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sound of Madness<br />
<em>November 24, 2007</em></p>
<p>Welcome to the first edition of The Oddcast.  Upon first listening to this, you may have no clue as to what to expect from this feed.  That&#8217;s exactly the attitude I expect from you as a listener.  You see this is where all the other show archives are going now.  All the Dub shows can be found on the other feed still and it will remain that way.  This feed is strictly for the non-dub shows, the shows which rarely get uploaded to the webserver.  In the past these shows have basically just been for the Live listeners.  So here is an excerpt from the last half hour of the Mad Beat Factory on Saturday, November 24, 2006.</p>
<p>By far one of the most interactive shows ever done on the Mad Beat Factory.  As the soundscape became increasingly more confusing, which is where this feed begins, the Live listeners were calling into show on the DUB line, 650-515-DUBZero (650-515-3820).  However, I did not answer the phone and opted instead to play the voicemails directly over the feed as they came in.  As the callers began to realize this, the show twisted off into different directions based on their calls.

		<itunes:summary>Sound of Madness
November 24, 2007

Welcome to the first edition of The Oddcast.  Upon first listening to this, you may have no clue as to what to expect from this feed.  That's exactly the attitude I expect from you as a listener.  You see this is where all the other show archives are going now.  All the Dub shows can be found on the other feed still and it will remain that way.  This feed is strictly for the non-dub shows, the shows which rarely get uploaded to the webserver.  In the past these shows have basically just been for the Live listeners.  So here is an excerpt from the last half hour of the Mad Beat Factory on Saturday, November 24, 2006.

By far one of the most interactive shows ever done on the Mad Beat Factory.  As the soundscape became increasingly more confusing, which is where this feed begins, the Live listeners were calling into show on the DUB line, 650-515-DUBZero (650-515-3820).  However, I did not answer the phone and opted instead to play the voicemails directly over the feed as they came in.  As the callers began to realize this, the show twisted off into different directions based on their calls.  I would like to thank Conwoman and Kannibus Kingdom for interacting with such great spontaneity during this show!</itunes:summary>

<p>Tonight&#8217;s show was a landmark event, the 100th show of the Mad Beat Factory, so it was worthy of a celebration.  Started with a different vibe tonight&#8230;Lover&#8217;s Rock and Ska.  Still falls under the guise of reggae music, but a totally different sound for the DUB Edition.  But like always we came through with some of the heavyweight Dub platters you&#8217;ve come to enjoy hearing on the DUB Edition.  Tonight we also received a call from the PNW crew who were having a party and we got to hear from Kannibus Kingdom, At0m81, Badspark, and Beat Babe Conwoman.  We also had a call from two of the lovely Beat Babes, Teesha and WhoMe.  During this call, MBC was presented with a gift, via webcam in the chatroom.  A handmade record commemorating the 100th show.  Thank you WhoMe and everyone else that called in to make the 100th show so much fun!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Show #98 - &#8220;I Gotta DUBBIT&#8221;<br />
Friday, November 3, 2006 10pm to 11:00pm</p>
<p>Earlier this week, we received a copy of the new Eric Ryan album, I Got A Habit II.  Although we don&#8217;t usually post hiphop on this netcast, however, this is a special occasion.  This is an Eric Ryan album and it is a must that all hear it.  But also, keep in mind, this is the DUB Edition, and DUB we must!  So we put some of the best in DUB music along with select tracks from Eric Ryan&#8217;s new album.  So do me a favor.  If you like these Eric Ryan tracks, go pick up his album over at <a href="http://www.ericryanmusic.com" target="_blank">EricRyanMusic.com</a>.  It&#8217;s only $4.99.  You can&#8217;t beat that when you get about 25 tracks of quality music.  This is downtempo, instrumental hip hop beats at their finest.  Also, go befriend Eric at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ericryanmusicdotcom" target="_blank">Myspace</a> and tell him how much you like his album.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Show #85 - &#8220;Burnt Pizza - The Kitchen, The Kitchen, The Kitchen&#8217;s On Fire&#8221;<br />
Saturday, September 16, 2006 10pm to 12:00am</p>
<p>Saturday night shows regularly start at 8pm, but tonight was different.  Beginning an hour later, the show came to an ubrupt end when MBC discovered a  burning piece of pizza in the microwave.  That&#8217;s right, mini-MBC got up from bed to go make himself a piece of pizza.  Eight minutes to cook a piece of pizza may seem like overkill to some, but mini-MBC was determined.  Of course when he discovered that his creation was on fire, he did what any gourmet chef would do; he hid under his bed.  After airing out the lab, MBC attempted to redo the show just how it began, now 2 hours behind schedule.  But this is what you end up with on a night like this.  You can enjoy this show like you&#8217;d enjoy eating a piece of burnt pizza!</p>

Saturday, September 16, 2006 10pm to 12:00am

Saturday night shows regularly start at 8pm, but tonight was different.nbsp; Beginning an hour later, the show came to an ubrupt end when MBC discovered anbsp; burning piece of pizza in the microwave.nbsp; That's right, mini-MBC got up from bed to go make himself a piece of pizza.nbsp; Eight minutes to cook a piece of pizza may seem like overkill to some, but mini-MBC was determined.nbsp; Of course when he discovered that his creation was on fire, he did what any gourmet chef would do; he hid under his bed.nbsp; After airing out the lab, MBC attempted to redo the show just how it began, now 2 hours behind schedule.nbsp; But this is what you end up with on a night like this.nbsp; You can enjoy this show like you'd enjoy eating a piece of burnt pizza!</itunes:summary>

<p>Our latest journey finds MBC digging crates all over the world when he meets up with the strongest girl in the world.  She ends up breaking one of his records because sometimes she doesn&#8217;t know her own strength.  Consequently, she also has the strongest lungs in the world, as the stickiest of the icky has no effect on her.  The only redeeming part of this journey is that her friend Super Snatch came along for the adventures.  But what do you do when your record breaks?  Sit back and chill out listening to the Dub and funk grooves.</p>

<p>Tonight&#8217;s show began as a journey into the deep dark tranquility of late 70&#8217;s electronica. The last hour is back to our specialty, DUB.  Then of course there was the after show, post show, or POST POST SHOW as I think is the more proper term considering that the Live Mad Beat Factory show is already a Post Show.  The POST POST show was not all that wonderful though, but nevertheless, here it is, a little mixture of 80&#8217;s latin freestyle/disco.</p>

<p>Darker Side of The Vinyl, ©1997, Mad Beat Factory</p>
<p>This is an epic saga of one man&#8217;s journey into the inner depths of madness.  At a time when America was on the brink of another war, it was hard to see beyond today and look to tomorrow with such a bleak outlook.  Using mind altering substances only allow the demons to enter one&#8217;s mind much easier.  Join us on this voyage.  Just be aware that there is no guarantee that you will return home from this one.  Enjoy!  Just remember that the Mad Beat Factory neither implies nor condones the use of illegal drugs or alcohol.</p>

<p>I think I have seriously been missing running my own radio station on Live365.  As much as I hated that place, I loved being able to play whatever I felt like whenever I felt like playing it.  Of course thats what got me into trouble on there.  But oh well.  Tonight&#8217;s theme was facetious at best, but the theme was LUV.  But of course it was all just a big joke.  I want to thank all who participated in the chatroom during the show, that made it much more fun to do.  Will we ever get back into the DUB mixes???  YES of course.  Just having a little fun and don&#8217;t want anyone to think I&#8217;m just stuck in one genre.  Have fun listening!!</p>

Friday, April 14, 2006 10pm to 12am (PST)</p>
<p>Tonight&#8217;s show can&#8217;t be taken too seriously.  It was more of a fun vibe going on  with a no holds barred atmosphere surrounding the show.  Taking a play on the consciousness-heavy, Stop The Slackness movement, the Mad Beat Chemist brings to you a different brand of slack tonight.  The seriously SLACKified DJ, Mad Beast Chemist was definitely on one this particular night.  A stray so far out of the realms of dub that only someone as fucked in the head as him could lead you on this journey.  So it wasn&#8217;t quite an adventure in Slackness, more of an adventure beyond Slackness.  Stay tuned for Part 2&#8230;</p>

<p>Okay so the King Tubby vs. Dolemite is just a joke as this is not a real SoundClash, just thought it was fun to pretend.  Okay so tonight&#8217;s edition of the Mad Beat Factory DUB edition was on the Heavyweight Dub Platter tip.  The show ventured deep into the mix with the Dub grooves for the first hour.  The second hour was a straight, funk, soul, and jazz grooves, and MBC broke the unwritten code of DJs by revealing the source of some old school breaks and samples.  It&#8217;s actually pretty irrelevant these days but lets just be overdramatic about it and get upset at him anyway.  And by the way, MBC don&#8217;t know shit anyways, he kept saying West Coast St. Mob, ain&#8217;t no Coast in that name, BISH!!!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SHOW#42 - &#8220;The Jungle River That Took Us Back In Time&#8221;<br />
Friday, April 7, 2006 10pm to 12am</p>
<p>Tonight&#8217;s voyage began on the River of Time, which flows through the heart of the Jungle.  One must voyage down this river to reach the nostalgic and mystical Land of The 80&#8217;s.  Our maps and compasses did us no good, so we took some help from DJ Yoda and navigated straight into the heart of the Land of the 80&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The show started off with a bang, a not quite a Big Bang, but maybe a little bang.  You should have expected something strange to happen when the show began with the Coast to Coast theme and the voice of Art Bell.  Got right into the Jungle for the first hour of the show with the heavy heavy mix of Drum and Bass.  As the hour came to an end, the plan was to get back into the dub reggae, but for the first time in Mad Beat Factory history, the show took a turn due to the chatroom topic at hand, which was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Video Games of the 80&#8217;s, and various other 80&#8217;s oddities.  It was at that moment that I broke out the DJ Yoda and we journeyed into some 80&#8217;s nostalgia, and it wasnt long after that I began feeling the vibe and cuttin up records along with Yoda&#8217;s mix.  The show took quite a journey away from the normal dub that is featured weekly on the Friday night mix.</p>
