<p>The past few days I have been adding lots of new music to the <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/gurbani" target="_blank">SikhNet Gurbani Media Center</a>, and it&#8217;s always exciting for me to hear new musicians explore their creativity using Gurbani and Mantras. The past year I have seen quite a few new musicians from all over the world produce beautiful albums of &#8220;spiritual music&#8221;. Each artist taking their own musical influence and &#8220;infusing&#8221; Gurbani/Mantras into it in a unique way that represents them and their experience of the Bani.</p>
<p>Those of you who are regular readers of SikhNet news might recall many of the stories regarding &#8220;<a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/tags/tags-519" target="_blank">Guru Ram Das Lord of Miracles &#8211; South America Tour</a>&#8221; which is led by Guru Bachan Singh Khalsa (from Espanola, New Mexico). They travel all through South America sharing the teachings of Sikhi, meditation, Kundalini Yoga, Healthy lifestyle and so much more.  Slowly in various parts of South America, little &#8220;pockets&#8221; of people have grown to love and experience these teachings. Some may call them selves Sikhs, while others may not&#8230;.though relate to the universality of these teachings and practice them.</p>
<p>A few years ago I wrote a blog post in relation to <a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2010/02/19/sikhs-of-south-america/" target="_blank">musicians and Sikhs in South America. If you missed it you can read it here.</a></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-76027" title="Pavan Kaur" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/560715_352118744829994_147975865244284_941467_1732084889_n-300x225.jpg" alt="Pavan Kaur" width="300" height="225" />I wanted to share with one more new and unique musician from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B3rdoba,_C%C3%B3rdoba_Province" target="_blank">Córdoba, Argentina</a>. <strong><a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/gurbani/artist/pavan-kaur" target="_blank">Her name is Pavan Kaur</a>.</strong>  Last year I stumbled on <a href="http://www.myspace.com/julietabuschiazzo" target="_blank">her myspace page</a> where she had shared a track from an Album she was working on. I loved the sound of the music and wanted more! I book marked her page and would check every few months to see if there was any new music posted. Finally after maybe a year I found out that it was finished! Eagerly wanting to have it, I convinced her to send me the music (since she didn&#8217;t have it for sale with anyone at the time).</p>
<p>I know how hard it can be as an independent musician to make people aware of your music, and it didn&#8217;t help that she didn&#8217;t speak English (only Spanish). The only way I was able to communicate with her was thanks to <a href="http://translate.google.com/" target="_blank">google translate</a> which worked pretty well for both of us :)</p>
<p>So, after her sharing the music with me,  I am compelled to share it with you all. Her <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/gurbani/album/akash-bani" target="_blank">new album is titled &#8220;Akash Bani&#8221; </a> (meaning &#8220;Words of the Ether&#8221;&#8230;the earth element). The audio from this album is centered around the Bani (writings) of <a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Guru_Nanak" target="_blank">Guru Nanak Dev Ji</a>. Each track has beautiful sweet musical compositions and her vocals with various pauri&#8217;s (lines) from Guru Nanaks&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Japji" target="_blank">Japji  Sahib</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="Pavan Kaur" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/327489_241151482593388_147975865244284_662230_30476_o-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" />These universal words of Guru Nanak speak truth which is beyond, time, religion or cultural background. By reciting and experiencing this universal oneness, we all come closer together in spirit. Listen, sing, chant and feel as Guru Nanak must have felt in his state of higher consciousness when he uttered these words. It&#8217;s always inspiring for me to see people as &#8220;flowers&#8221; bloom with love for Gurbani; No matter what they look like or their cultural background or religion.</p>
<p>So, now I encourage you to<strong> <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/gurbani/artist/pavan-kaur" target="_blank">head over to her musician profile on the SikhNet Gurbani Media Center and listen to her beautiful music.</a> </strong> If you like it, <a href="http://www.satnam.eu/akash-bani-pavan-kaur-cd-p-4283.en.html" target="_blank">please support her music and buy the CD</a>. Hopefully other music distributors will sell her music as well. Enjoy!</p>
<p>You can also connect with her through her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pavaneselaire" target="_blank">facebook fan page</a> and let her know how you like the music (Though if you don&#8217;t speak spanish you might consider using to <a href="http://translate.google.com/" target="_blank">google translate</a> :)</p>

<p>Today I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT3Kwwv93TQ" target="_blank">watched a video that some students made from quick impromptu interview sessions with students</a> on the Campus of <a href="http://www.sulross.edu/" target="_blank">Sul Ross State University (Texas, USA)</a>. They made the video in preparation for a Sikh Awareness Day project that their organization (the College Democrats of Sul Ross) are hosting April 18th 2012.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dT3Kwwv93TQ" target="_blank">Watching the video</a> you can see how pretty much all the students have no idea who Sikhs are, and associate the three pictures they are shown (of Sikhs) &#8230;as Muslims&#8230;terrorists&#8230;Iraqi, etc. One is a picture is of <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/news/warrior-saint-capt-tejdeep-singh-rattan-sequel" target="_blank">the first Sikh army graduate in 20 years (Tejdeep Singh Rattan),</a> The other is a picture of a more typical Sikh from Punjab talking on the phone, and then another older Sikh man looking at the camera.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dT3Kwwv93TQ" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>The first thought I had was, hope that at least there would be one person out of the bunch who might have heard of Sikhs. When that didn&#8217;t happen and the video finished it was a strong affirmation how little people know about Sikhs, and how much work we have ahead of us to change this. The constant media images of Osama Bin Laden with his turban and terrorism, portrayed a picture that people mistake for as Sikhs.</p>
<p>Reading comments from the video by Sikhs, I see shock, disbelief and feelings that these students and Americans in general are just &#8220;not educated&#8221; or just plain stupid. As I started to think about it I suppose from our perspective we feel like it should be obvious that everyone should know who WE are. As if just because they don&#8217;t know who we are they are un-educated. The reality is that the world is a big place and most people don&#8217;t get the kind of cross culture, world exposure that many of us are used to. I feel like in some ways it is egotistical to expect that people would know who Sikhs are.  There is a TON that I don&#8217;t know about various religions and people all over the world. Does it make me stupid? I don&#8217;t think so. Does it make me ignorant? Maybe.</p>
<p>So, how do we change this picture? It&#8217;s not going to happen on it&#8217;s own. We can&#8217;t expect someone else to do it either. I don&#8217;t see any millionaires coming forward to do PR campaign about Sikhs, so ultimately it is up to each of us to educate the people that we come in contact with. I often see that because of cultural differences many of the Sikh communities can be very insular and not having much interaction with people in the community. I also think we have to stop projecting out the feeling of &#8220;we are the victims&#8221;, so that when you are walking around you think and project out that the people think you are &#8220;this or that&#8221;. Or the worst is when Sikhs react to ignorant people in a negative way rather then keeping calm and using it as an opportunity to educate.</p>
<p>Part of the change comes from within, being strong in our identity, proud, joyful, confident, serviceful,  well mannered, standing up for people in need. The &#8220;vibe&#8221; and projections that we send out will effect what people perceive of us when we are out and about. We already stand out; so when our positive qualities and action in our communities are seen by people around THIS will affect change in the image of what they see. Often times the type of stories that mainstream public see are when we fight with each other :(</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s take this as an opportunity to think about this situation and ways we can &#8220;Change the Picture&#8221;. Let&#8217;s take the initiative consciously rather than sitting back doing nothing and feeling like we are always &#8220;the victims&#8221;. Guru Gobind Singh ji gave us this identity for a reason, with the purpose of standing out. The key is that we have to be active and be known for our service.</p>
<p>If you have ideas on how to help create change, please do share!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2010/07/29/patience-pays/">A few years ago I blogged about a cool audio affirmation that SSS Harbhajan Singh Khalsa (Yogi Bhajan) </a>made a recording of many years ago. It is about being patient in life, not worrying and letting God take care of your affairs.     The 3HO foundation just released a beautiful video version with this same affirmation. The video uses the voice of Yogi Bhajan and features several members of our 3HO family. I love listening to it when I get stressed out about things. Enjoy, listen, watch and share!</p>

<p>Last night I was trying to go to sleep early so  I could wake up refreshed in Amritvela to Meditate, and just kept sitting watching/reading the flood of twitter posts (particularly #Rajoana #IPledgeOrange ) finding it hard to put away my iPhone and go to sleep. There was (still is) a constant stream from Sikhs all over the world tweeting about the situation going on in relation to <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/tags/balwant-singh-rajoana" target="_blank">Bhai Balwant Singh Rajoana </a>.  It is very inspiring to me to see so many Sikhs uniting together around a positive cause for human rights and justice. This can serve to lift people up and hopefully re-ignite Sikhi in their every day life. It seems that a crisis brings a rallying point for us and serves to unite the Panth.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading about the many protests that have been taking place all over the world. These have been very peaceful though they have involved tens of thousands of Sikhs. In general though when I hear about protests in India, there is often a very different energy to them than compared to ones in US/UK/Canada. From my outside India viewpoint it appears that there is much less restraint, particularly on the part of police and people trying to incite a reaction. So it often seems like gas and match waiting to ignite at the flick of a finger.</p>
<p>This morning I heard the sad <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/news/sikh-boy-killed-police-gurdaspur-curfew-imposed-shiv-sena-attack-sikhs-patiala-phagwara" target="_blank">news about two Sikhs being shot and killed</a> apparently from the Punjab Police trying to disburse people as a result of clashes incited by &#8220;Shiv Sena&#8221; trying to incite violence against peaceful Sikh protesters in Gurdaspur.  This morning the twitter messages had really changed tone from hope and unison, to high emotions, fear and frustration. Thinking of the brutal time of 1984 and fears that <em>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to happen all over again&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Here I am, Sitting thousands of miles away in a small town (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espa%C3%B1ola,_New_Mexico" target="_blank">Espanola, New Mexico</a>), where there is only a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrsikhnet/sets/72157594253748475/" target="_blank">small Sikh community</a> (compared to other parts of the world), trying to feel and understand the pulse of the Panth right now. It&#8217;s hard to get a full picture and a real sense for what is going on and so be able to relate in the same way as other Sikhs who are living this movement more directly.</p>
<p><strong>My prayer is that Sikhs as a whole, and particularly those people who are in leadership roles, move very consciously forward, and advise those in their community to do the same by not letting our emotions control our actions. We need to ACT, but act from consciousness, and using our intuition as apposed to unconscious emotional REactions to events (which generally leads to negative consequences).</strong></p>
<p>While I write these words I&#8217;m listening to the<a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/radio" target="_blank"> beautiful kirtan live from Harmandir Sahib</a> and thinking how in spite of the daily turmoil, the Gurbani is always there, constant, neutral and inspiring. Not wavering, but just continuing to spread the messages of humanity, Oneness and God. It makes me think of our Gurus, who were so solid that didn&#8217;t waver in the face of any challenge.</p>
<p>As we chant the <a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Mool_Mantar" target="_blank">mool mantra from Japji Sahib</a>. It is a reminder for us to remember who we are as Sikhs of the Guru, and to remember that we are all part of <em>the ONE</em>. I am you, you are me; and have to see the Me/You/ONE in EVERYONE; even people we don&#8217;t like. It&#8217;s not an easy task.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nirbhao (ਨਿਰਭਉ) Without Fear<br />
Nirvair (ਨਿਰਵੈਰੁ)  Without Hate</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So Khalsa Jis, please take this time to move any feelings of anger, frustration, emotion, etc to positive prayer (Ardas) and positive peaceful action. When we unite in prayer together we can move mountains without lifting a finger. Many underestimate the power of prayer.</strong></p>
<p>You might feel that there is little you can do sitting far away from the many events going on, but know that with your meditation, with the bowing of your head to the Guru and your prayer, we can move forward together with the right state of mind to make more conscious choices that will have positive outcomes. Ultimately it is all in the hands of God so let us play our parts as consciously as possible as Sikhs of our Guru.</p>
<p>So, step away from the computer (and the constant flurry of Facebook and twitter updates) and close your eyes and take some time in prayer. Sit and meditate on the Waheguru Mantra. Recite Chaupai sahib, keep the Guru&#8217;s Chardikala flowing in your veins, so that we can all act from our alert, neutral, compassionate consciousness, just as our Guru&#8217;s would do.</p>
<h2> Act Don&#8217;t React</h2>
<p><strong>Here are a few quotes and excerpts from talks by SSS Harbhajan Singh Khalsa that are inspiring for me. They talk about Acting and Reacting. Food for thought</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;One thing will always make you lose, and that is reaction. There are certain other things in addition, but you must start with reaction: rudeness, subjective insecurity, objective paranoia and creative fear.  Aren’t they wonderful? When you have them all in your behavior, you destroy yourself. You don’t need an enemy.&#8221; &#8211; <a title="The Ten Manners of Life" href="http://fateh.sikhnet.com/sikhnet/articles.nsf/9dee2aa6164e1d9b87256671004e06c7/d399f19ba8eb2f2f872576fd007c795d!OpenDocument" target="_blank">4/19/1989</a><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Never be right or wrong, always be neutral. Speak not through the positive mind or the negative mind, but from the neutral mind. And whenever you have to confront a calamity or a pleasure, take the altitude. Adjust the attitude. Do not react right away.&#8221; &#8211; <a title="The Golden Rules of a Teacher" href="http://fateh.sikhnet.com/sikhnet/articles.nsf/9dee2aa6164e1d9b87256671004e06c7/1653440ad593896f872576fd007c9464!OpenDocument" target="_blank">7/22/1996</a></em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Life is one simple challenge. Act, don&#8217;t react. Calm yourself and claim yourself. When you reflect like a torch for a long distance, it takes away the darkness.&#8221; -  1/17/2000</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;We do things but we don&#8217;t watch them. We don&#8217;t enjoy them. We don&#8217;t relate to the things as we should. We don&#8217;t watch our actions, we don&#8217;t plan our actions, we have no mastery over our actions. Because we don&#8217;t act, we react! As the forces force us, we react. That&#8217;s a human nature. Self-defense is a human nature. If somebody is coming towards your eyes or something is coming towards your eyes, without your acknowledging it, your eyes, though the eyelids are very thin and not very strong&#8230; they are not that of steel, but they will close. At least they will save you from dirt, dust and storm.</em></p>
<p><em>Human body has an automatic system to react through self-defense. But when we do automatic self-defense and react against the pressures, then we do not play our part. Then our individual intelligence plays no part.&#8221; &#8211; <a title="When the Future Calls On You" href="http://fateh.sikhnet.com/sikhnet/articles.nsf/fed9a32db02c040887256671004e06c3/bb8885c5ec4f18b287256671004e469a!OpenDocument" target="_blank">07/06/1988</a></em></p>

<p>This past fall my friend <a href="http://drsoram.com" target="_blank">Dr. Soram Khalsa</a> made me aware of a <a href="http://www.forksoverknives.com/" target="_blank">new documentary &amp; book called &#8220;Forks Over Knives&#8221;</a> that he urged everyone to watch. The feature film Forks Over Knives examines the profound claim that<strong> most, if not all, of the degenerative diseases that afflict us can be controlled, or even reversed, by rejecting animal-based and processed foods.</strong></p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/O7ijukNzlUg" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>I added it to my NetFlix movie queue hoping to watch it, but it was in so much demand that I didn&#8217;t get it till very recently (I think it is available streaming now). Last night I watched it and was shocked to hear the information they shared. I&#8217;m already ahead of the curve in that I don&#8217;t eat meat, have very little dairy &amp; already eat pretty well. What surprised me was the fact that this information is not so widely available. I think the Meat &amp; Dairy lobbyists have so much control over the government (USDA) and that Americans (especially doctors!) have been so mis-informed.</p>
<p>You can get the documentary from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_6?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=forks+over+knives&amp;sprefix=forks+%2Caps%2C217" target="_blank">amazon.com</a> or read more about it on the official website <a href="http://www.forksoverknives.com/" target="_blank">http://www.forksoverknives.com</a></p>
<p>Just the simple awareness and changing of ones diet to primarily Whole food, plant based nutrition millions of people could be living much healthier and happier lives.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some facts from the movie, which will probably surprise you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The average American carries an extra 23 pounds of weight.</li>
<li>Heart disease and stroke claim the lives of 460,000 American women per year.</li>
<li>There are 215,000 new cases of prostate cancer per year in American men.</li>
<li>“We have a growing problem and the ones who are growing are us.” – Katie Couric.</li>
<li>40% of Americans today are obese.</li>
<li>Almost one in five American four-year-olds are now considered to be obese.</li>
<li>“This could be the first generation of children in the United States that lives less than its parents.” – Richard Carmona, former Surgeon General of the United States.</li>
<li>“We have an unprecedented amount of type II diabetes in our children, and we are starting to see hypertension in our children in grammar school.” – Richard Carmona, former Surgeon General of the United States.</li>
<li>About half of all Americans are taking some form of prescription drug.</li>
<li>We spend $2.2 trillion on health care, over five times the amount we spend on the defense budget.</li>
<li>We pay more per person for health care than any industrialized country in the world yet we are sicker than ever.</li>
<li>Obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure are all diet-related health issues that cost this country more than 120 billion dollars per year.</li>
</ul>
<p>In August of this year a new study was published in Lancet magazine entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2960814-3/abstract?_eventId=login" target="_blank">Health and economic burden of the projected obesity trends in the USA and the UK.</a>” Researchers point out that excessive weight gain in populations forecast an increased burden from several diseases, most especially cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers. They use a simulation model to project the probable health and economic consequences for the next two decades from the continuing rise in obesity in the United States and the UK.</p>
<p>The researchers project an additional 65 million obese adults in the United States and 11 million more obese adults in the UK by the year 2030. This is expected to lead to an additional 6.0 to 8.5 million cases of diabetes, 5.7 to 7.3 million cases of heart disease and stroke, and 492,000 to 699,000 additional cases of cancer. They predict that this will lead to  a loss of an additional 26 to 55 million quality—adjusted life years for the United States and England combined.</p>
<p>The researchers also predict that the medical costs associated with these preventable diseases are estimated to increase by $48 to $66 billion per year in the United States by the year 2030. They recommend that effective policies to promote healthier weight be put in place as soon as possible because of the economic benefits.</p>
<p>It is because of all these statistics and studies that I urge you to watch Forks Over Knives. It is a simple way to learn the benefits of a whole food, plant-based diet, which has been documented to help improve ALL of the conditions mentioned in this article.</p>
<p>I can also recommend that you read the book associated with the movie, because it is loaded with recipes to help you get started on this diet.</p>
<p>You can get the documentary from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_6?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=forks+over+knives&amp;sprefix=forks+%2Caps%2C217" target="_blank">amazon.com</a> or read more about it on the official website <a href="http://www.forksoverknives.com/" target="_blank">http://www.forksoverknives.com</a>

<p>I&#8217;m grateful to have had the opportunity to go to spend about 10 years as a kid in boarding school in India, which helped shape who I am today. I&#8217;m also grateful that there is a school like <a href="http://www.miripiriacademy.org/" target="_blank">Miri Piri Academy</a> that my ten year old son has been loving since he started a few years ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an amazing opportunity, and an experience that is life changing for these kids! Many of the children who want to go to this school can&#8217;t afford it, and so MPA does fundraising each year to fund the scholarship fund to help enable any kid who wants to be a part of this program. Watch the below video and give from your heart!  Help shape a child to be one of the leaders for tomorrow!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;">by SS Guru Amrit Singh Khalsa, Herndon, VA</span></strong></p>
<p>About 10 years ago I was at the fall Khalsa Council meeting in Espanola, New Mexico.  The Siri Singh Sahib was talking about the role of the Council and how it is our responsibility to deliver the Dharma to the future. Then he said (and I am sure you know why I am capitalizing this), “WHEN THE CALL COMES, YOU MUST ANSWER!” Right then my cellphone rang. I hustled outside, hit the talk button, and it turned out to be the pastor of a church in Pasadena, who I had not seen in many years, asking if I would give a talk to his congregation. My immediate thoughts were: &#8220;This would involve flying across the country and taking time from work. What would I talk about? It is just not practical to do it.” Then the words of the Siri Singh Sahib rang in my head. “I would be happy to do it,” I told the pastor, and it turned out to be a wonderful experience.</p>
<p>I remember another incident many years before that. It was in the days when the Siri Singh Sahib would personally travel to ashrams to give teach courses.  It was an evening after, and the Siri Singh Sahib was giving appointments to anybody who wanted to see him. There were a lot of people who wanted to see him, and by the time it was my turn it was 2:00AM in the morning. Before I entered the room I heard him comment to somebody how exhausted he was and how he hoped this would end soon. I walked in the room, and there he was smiling at me, looking energetic and bright and letting me take as much time as I needed to discuss my issue with him.</p>
<p>What I learned from both these experiences, and from others over the years, is that the role of a teacher is a complete surrender. When a teacher is asked for help, he or she doesn’t have a choice but to give it, regardless of what he or she may feel or think personally. It is a commitment to living outside one’s ego.</p>
<p>When that commitment becomes a way of life, life becomes divine. Guru Arjan is our model for this. He was considered Partakh Har, a personified god. His ability to live outside his ego allowed him to be brutally tortured and yet to not pass judgment or react in a personal way. He provided the most extreme example, illustrated by his own death, where his role as a teacher did not falter. It was perfect, and a lesson to us about the depth of consciousness that is possible.</p>
<p>I understand the size of the gap between myself and Partakh Har. It is a big one.  However, I also believe that life’s gift is the experience, slow and uneven, of closing that gap.  It closes a little each time I am called to teach and I answer the call while putting my own needs aside. These small incidents chip away at my ego until eventually selflessness becomes a habit and then a way of life.

<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>by SS Gurujodha Singh Khalsa, Bakersfield, CA</strong></p>
<p>Sikh Dharma is the path of the householder. If you are going to “hold” that house you have to earn righteously and pay for it, work for it, feed the people inside, be the neighbors of other householders and therefore live in a community, which becomes a nation. As a family, as a community and as a nation you develop an identity, values, and beliefs. You take actions which are consistent with and which support your identity, values and beliefs.</p>
<p>At some point you must be challenged, tested to see if you are serious and committed to those values and beliefs or if you lack the commitment to ”walk your talk”  and your “teachings” are a sham.  Invariably what started as a meditation becomes a test of applied consciousness where the individual and the community are forced to weigh their identity, values and beliefs against the possibility of suffering, financial loss, imprisonment, torture and death- and decide what they are going to do.</p>
<p>Guru Arjan and his martyrdom provide for me guidance and a model for passing such a test.  During the Guruship of Guru Arjan many thousands of people heard the teachings of the Gurus and began to follow the teachings of Sikhism. This included not only Sikhs but also Hindus and Muslims, since truth can never be confined to a culture, region or ethnic identity.  Since money, property, and influence often accompany the power of the “church”, the Mughal clergy weren’t happy about the Guru’s growing influence.  They perceived it as an encroachment and reduction of their influence and power.</p>
<p>Following his father Akbar’s death Jahangir, the new Mughal emperor, saw an opportunity to destroy the Sikhs and the growing influence of the Guru. Jahangir, unlike his father, subscribed to the idea of turning the whole of India into an Islamic State. As a matter of economic and political expedience, a number of Hindus supported the Mughal Court. Having seen their own power base rapidly disappearing under the influence of Guru Arjan, they joined the Muslims in their efforts to destroy the Sikhs.</p>
<p>Jahangir and his minions brought the Guru “up on charges”, arguing that the Adi Granth defamed the Hindu and Muslim religions and that Khusrau, Jahangir&#8217;s son (whom many saw as a more fitting candidate for Emperor than Jahangir), had been financially aided by Guru Arjan.  Accordingly, in May 1606 Guru Arjan was arrested and brought to Lahore where he was subjected to severe torture.</p>
<p>As we sing in Gurdwara:<em> “Guru Arjan gave his life to stand for what was right.  He was burned and tortured for five long days and nights.  He could have stopped it any time, just by giving in. His strength a solid wall, he never gave an inch at all.”</em> (<a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2006/02/08/song-of-the-khalsa/" target="_blank">From “Song of the Khalsa”, by MSS Livtar Singh Khalsa</a>). Various records reflect that Guru Arjan was made to sit on a burning hot plate and then in boiling water while red hot sand was poured over his head and body. When he was asked by his friend, Mian Mir, a Muslim saint, why he was allowing this torture to happen, Guru Arjan replied that he had to lead by example.</p>
<p>The Guru told him that people who stand for truth often have to suffer. He said, “I have to bear this pain with grace and dignity so that others when they meet similar adversity will have my example to guide and fortify them.”  As I reflect and meditate on Guru Arjan I am grateful for his sacrifice, grateful for the opportunity to receive the Guru’s wisdom into my heart, grateful for the opportunity to be in the company of the (Happy, Healthy and) Holy and grateful for the strength, wisdom, and courage I receive simply by reflecting on the example of Guru Arjan and those who have taught me and gone before me.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;"><strong>By MSS Krishna Kaur Khalsa, Los Angeles, CA</strong></span></p>
<p>The Siri Singh Sahib, my beloved teacher, inspired my ministry but not in the way I used to think of inspiration. From his example, I long to serve God as he served Him. When I met the Siri Singh Sahib I was coming out of a very confusing period in my life. There was a voice inside that for several years was telling me that I was supposed to help people find a way out of their pain. Not just for a few entertaining hours in the theater, but forever. When the thought first surfaced, I had no idea why I was thinking such a weird thought. It eventually sent me on a whirlwind round of searching that spanned three continents and lasted for over three years. Finally, my journey led me to the feet of the Siri Singh Sahib. I didn’t know where my head was at that time. All I knew was that the Kundalini Yoga I had been practicing for five months had become my safety net and that I wasn’t really losing my mind after all!</p>
<p>During my first appointment with the Siri Singh Sahib back in 1970, I expressed a concern over my brother who hadn’t been seen or heard from by the family in several years. I thought the Siri Singh Sahib, being a ‘holy man’ and all, would simply roll his eyes up to the ceiling in a trance-like manner and tell me my brother was fine and living in Paris or something like that. But instead he looked me straight in the eyes and commanded me to go out and teach. At first I thought he was kidding and I chuckled heartily. Then he said it again and I was a bit confused, wondering if he had heard correctly what I’d just said about my brother. But, before I could restate my reason for wanting an appointment, the eyes widened and the voice boomed out again.</p>
<p>“You must go out and teach! Do you agree, do you agree?”</p>
<p>What was he talking about? It may have sounded like a yes or no question but trust me, it wasn’t. As I searched the faces of the other guests in the room for help, the voice hit me again.</p>
<p>“You must go out and teach your people! Do you agree, do you agree?”</p>
<p>Of course I don’t agree! “I don’t know anything” I said, thinking what a ridiculous idea this was.  Over and over his voice continued to badger me and I kept telling him, “But I don’t know anything!” I pleaded unsuccessfully as the tears cascaded down my face and on to the basket of fruit I’d brought him. “This cannot be happening”, I screamed in my head. Then I was hit by another blow from the voice. “You must go out and teach….. teach….. teach!  Do you agree?”  “But I don’t know anything, sir….. how can I possibly teach this stuff?”  And the battle went on for what seemed like hours, but in reality was probably only a few minutes.  I finally surrendered.</p>
<p>“OK, OK!” I gasped, willing to say anything that would stop the booming voice and the pressure in my head. And of course, like magic, it all stopped. The Siri Singh Sahib smiled and patted me on the shoulder.  I felt a cool breeze blow across my face as a smiling lady came and gently took the basket of fruit and showed me to the door. I was stunned as I walked to my car wondering what just happened. I gave my word.  I promised I would teach, and I did.  I taught a class a week later to fourteen actors. The class was great. He was right. And I was hooked.</p>
<p>As Siri Singh Sahib has always said, a teacher is a chiseler and a forklift.  Well, I experienced that directly from my initial meeting with him. He was totally serving the destiny of my soul despite the resistance of my ego. He showed me the selflessness of true love and the commitment of a real teacher. It is with this dedication to serving the longing of others that I continue to travel and teach in Africa, Mexico, Canada, South America, Europe and throughout the United States. I do so with the hope that one day I will be as real and selfless with everyone as he was with me that day and many days that followed.</p>
<p>I truly believe that my personal mission as a minister of Sikh Dharma is to serve others with a technology that will help them find a way to drop their life’s suffering and embrace with reverence the joy and sweetness that is in their heart. I believe that the folks who gather before me are destined to be there as much as I am.  I believe when I give them the best I can, from as open a heart and mind as I can, I will have fulfilled my part of their journey as well.</p>
<p>I am humbled and deeply honored to be a vehicle for the love my teacher shared with me and thousands of others during his journey on this earth. It has instilled a great longing in me that is touched by Guru Arjan Dev Ji’s letters (Shabd Hazare) to his father, Guru Ram Das. His heart is full of wanting to be with his Saint Guru as mine is full of wanting to be near my beloved teacher every moment of my day and night. The time I feel I am closest to him is when I am teaching. I feel his presence so strongly that it is sometimes difficult to hold back my tears. It always takes me back to that day when he told me to go out and teach and I smile and whisper in my heart, “Sir, these too are your teachers”. Together we serve! God Bless the Siri Singh Sahib Ji.</p>

<p>Most people from India are used to the many spices added to their food; but many might not realize the health benefits of one of them called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmeric" target="_blank">Turmeric</a> (also known as &#8220;Haldi&#8221; in India). Turmeric is great in food, but also has many health benefits. It can be used as an anti-inflammatory for people suffering from arthritis, joint pain, clear the skin, muscle pain &amp; many other benefits.  It also aids in digestion, works as an anti-parasitic, and anti-bacterial. <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/news/holy-powder-ingredient-makes-membranes-behave-better-health" target="_blank">Turmeric is currently being investigated in many studies</a> for possible benefits in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, cancer, arthritis, and other clinical disorders. What the Ayurvedic tradition of India has known for thousands of years is just making it&#8217;s rounds in modern medical &#8220;discoveries&#8221;. (&#8220;It&#8217;s not real unless it&#8217;s been &#8220;proven&#8217;&#8221; is how it goes in western medicine).</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-73848" title="gldnmlk" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/gldnmlk-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" />I was first introduced to turmeric when I was a child, but it was in the form of a hot golden colored milk that we fondly call  &#8220;Golden Milk&#8221;. I had no cares about being &#8220;healthy&#8221; (who does as a young kid?) and just loved to drink this before going to sleep (though my mataji made it for me back then).</p>
<p>These days I drink it for other reasons. No, I&#8217;m not that old and don&#8217;t have arthritis, but I do get a lot of inflammation in my wrists from the many long hours of work I spend on the computer every day.  I have noticed dramatic improvements when my wrists start to hurt and I have golden milk or take curcumin capsules (concentrated extract from turmeric). So whether you have joint pain or work on the computer like me you will likely enjoy and benefit from this healing drink.</p>
<p><strong>So, how do you make it? It&#8217;s actually pretty fast and easy to make. Me and My wife Dr. Arjan Kaur Khalsa (who is a Doctor of Chiropractic) just produced the first video in a new series that she will be using on <a href="http://www.drarjan.com" target="_blank">her website</a> for her patients (and of course for any of you global online health seekers to enjoy!).</strong> In the video she talks about the benefits of Turmeric, various oils and how to make this drink yourself in your home.  Watch the below video and see! Or if you are in a rush just read the recipe below the video (though you&#8217;ll be missing my wife&#8217;s smiley charm and her talking about interesting stuff).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong></strong>Turmeric &#8220;paste&#8221; Recipe<br />
</strong></p>
<p>This version of the recipe is meant to make a small amount of turmeric paste that you can store in the refrigerator and use every day for a few weeks which makes it quick and easy to have on a regular basis. I sometimes use it in fruit shakes or with apple juice if I am in a hurry and don&#8217;t want to drink it hot. Just take a small spoonful and add to whatever you like! (though start small if you are not used to it because it can be bitter in larger quantities).</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Take 1/4 cup turmeric powder, mix with 1/2 cup pure water and simmer over medium-high heat for at least 7 minutes, stirring constantly.  You will notice a thick paste form. If it get’s too dry while cooking you can add additional water.  Once cooled, put into a glass jar and put in fridge.  This is good for a few weeks to one month.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Turmeric or where to get it, you should be able to purchase the powder from health food stores, Indian spice stores or other places online.</p>
<p><strong>Making Golden Milk</strong></p>
<p>Add 1 tsp of the turmeric paste to 1 cup. hot milk (cow, goat, soy, rice, almond, or any combination), maple syrup or honey to taste and 1/2 tsp. of almond or sesame oil.  Gently heat and stir and then Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>And yes&#8230;.the Disclaimer</strong><br />

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><em><strong>A long time ago&#8230; </strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><em><strong>in a galaxy far, far away&#8230; </strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><em><strong>I made computer</strong></em> <em><strong>games&#8230;</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I discovered the magic of computers in the 1970’s, working on a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11" target="_blank">DEC PDP-11</a></span> at Ohio State University where I was working as a research associate in high energy physics. That’s the branch of physics that studies sub-atomic particles such as mesons and neutrinos. Our DEC allowed me to ‘talk’ to other uses on the network and the conversation printed out on a big printer in the computer room. I sat at my first ‘personal computer’ in 1984. It was a PC clone called an “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&amp;c=499">Apricot</a></span>,” no, really; Apples and Apricots. It was the fruit salad days of computing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The day after I got my Apricot, I went looking for games and discovered my first adventure game, “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/wishbringer">Wishbringer</a></span>.” Like Alice through the looking glass, I fell through the computer screen into the universe on the other side of the glass. A whole new world opened up. At the same time, I bought a 300 baud modem and connected it up to the ashram phone line. Another new universe opened up through <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compuserve">CompuServe</a></span>, the birth of online forums where folks all over the world could gather and discuss pretty much any topic. My fave topic was games. It was here that I met a witty lady who went by the online handle of ‘<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.M.S._Pinafore">Buttercup</a></span>.” I recognized a dedicated fellow gamer in Buttercup, who spent much of her leisure time online serving as one of the original adventure game <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysop">sysops</a></span> (discussion forum moderator) for CompuServe.</span></p>
<p>Every Tuesday evening we had a live, real-time, gamer’s chat room where we gathered to crack jokes, talk about games and kick each other (virtually) under the (virtual) table. Buttercup was a mistress of puns and fun, and being a good typist and multitasker, she carried on multiple public and private chat room conversations simultaneously (as did I.) Through our mutual love of computer games, Buttercup and I became fast friends online.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">It was at this time that, at the behest of Yogi Bhajan, I started a computer BBS (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">Bulletin Board System</a></span>) called ‘SikhNet.’ It served to link Sikhs (who had modems and computers – a small contingent at that time!) around the world with discussion forums, file downloads and more. It was these early BBS’s that later became the turf of Internet we know and use today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In 1988, I was asked to beta-test adventure games for the pioneer adventure gaming company, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.mobygames.com/company/sierra-entertainment-inc">Sierra On-Line</a></span>. Among others, Sierra made such games as “King’s Quest,” “Space Quest,” “Hero’s Quest,” and Leisure Suit Larry. I guess I did a good job because in December of that year Sierra asked me to move to California and become their Senior Producer overseeing the development of new adventure games. For a list of the games I produced, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,2193/">check out this link</a></span>.</span></p>
<p>The fun of this job was being part of a super-creative team of artists, writers, game designers, musicians and programmers who worked closely together to create the game experience. We were known collectively as the “implementers” because we created immersive, micro-cosmic worlds for gamers to inhabit. Designing game worlds, characters and puzzles was the best job I could imagine at the time.</p>
<p>My main concern was what I called “the soul of the game.’ The soul of the game meant the values, the magic, the truest essence of the imaginary game world – evoking the best from the players.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In 1991 we were looking for writers and producers and I immediately thought of Buttercup; got in touch and hired her to work as a producer at Sierra. Buttercup’s online persona reflected who she was in ‘real life’ &#8211; the witty, playful and creative gamer, Gano Haine. At Sierra, Gano worked on a new series of adventure games for younger kids called “EcoQuest.” Ecoquest taught kids ‘green’ living and starred a cute dolphin named ‘Cetus.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In 1992, along with Ravi Har Singh, I went on to found a New Mexico-based computer consulting firm called Sun &amp; Son, and thence back to SikhNet in 2003. Gano went on to work at EA (Electronic Arts) and then founded her own game development company called StuntPuppy Entertainment, and later another company called LimeLife. Under her leadership, Stunt Puppy had four number 1 ranking titles with such licensors as Mattel, Disney/Buena Vista Games, Atari/Infogrames and Leapfrog Toys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Sometime in the 1990’s I was talking enthusiastically with Yogi Bhajan about computers and computer games and he casually said, “We should make our own computer game based on Sikh Dharma.” I happily agreed thinking that there was no way we actually had the resources to do this, but that it was a great idea. Like so many of Yogi Ji’s ideas, it was simply a matter of time before his vision manifested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Early in 2010, Gurumustuk Singh and I discussed tackling an adventure game for SikhNet. I pointed out that the games we made at Sierra On-Line had budgets over $1M and took over a year to create with a team of eight to twelve people working full-time on the project. There was no way SikhNet had that kind of resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">When Gano came to visit us in New Mexico, I broached the idea with her. She asked, “What’s your budget?” I said “Oh, I think we could afford $45K.” She thought for a minute and said. “We could do that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So began the almost two-year long journey that became “<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/karmagame" target="_blank">KARMA – The Ogre&#8217;s Curse</a></span>.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I had been out of the computer game business for 18 years at that point! At the outset, Gano said “Let me get hold of some of the artists, musicians and programmers I know and see if we can assemble a team.&#8221; So Gano and I began writing <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/karmagame" target="_blank">KARMA – The Ogre&#8217;s Curse</a></span>.</span></p>
<p>At that time we simply called it “the karma game” because the core idea we came up with was that instead of racking up high scores and trying to beat other players, we envisioned a game where the player starts off with a heavy load of karma, and works to lighten that load, so that by the end of the game, you “won” by having no karma at all. That was the seed idea. Players could work off their karma by doing seva and helping others, by meditating and working on themselves, and eventually by healing other characters using Gurbani.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">As it turned out, Gano was the perfect person to help us manifest the vision. The timing was right for her. She was willing to work on the project out of her love of Sikhi, and she assembled an inspired a team of artists, musicians, programmers and sound effects talent who were willing to work for much less than they could make in the world of commercial game development.</span></p>
<p>Without Gano, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/karmagame" target="_blank">KARMA – The Ogre&#8217;s Curse</a></span> would never have happened. When I expressed concern about how long the project was taking, she reminded me, “When you make a game, you have to choose two out of three: fast, good or inexpensive. You can never have all three, so pick two.”</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We picked inexpensive and good!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">That’s why <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/karmagame" target="_blank">KARMA – The Ogre&#8217;s Curse</a></span> took two years to complete. The implementers worked in their spare time. Gano gave of herself tirelessly. We had at least two Skype conferences every week for over a year. We shared our game design documents in Google Docs and assembled the game world and characters from scratch. We decided to use text only (no voice recording) as well as non-animated artwork to save money since actors and animators are expensive (but, as you know if you’ve played the game, that later changed.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In addition to the professional game development team, everyone in the SikhNet office joined in. Gurumustuk Singh designed the <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/karmagame/badges" target="_blank">Dharma Badge</a> system and the special game website within SikhNet to support this and future children’s projects. Gurujot Singh contributed to the game artwork and eventually taught himself Flash animation and animated the game characters. Gurujot designed the healing shabd mini dilruba game within the game as well. Harijot Singh recorded all the voices and worked tirelessly to get all the lines in the scripts correct and he recruited all the voice actors from our local Sangat. The actors really brought the game to life! No one who has heard him can forget Sarbjot Singh as our hero, Harimandir Jot Singh (of the Cherdi Kala Jatha) as the shopkeeper, Sherwanee, or Meeri Peeri Singh as the hilarious sadhu, Swami Seethrudhoti.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Gano’s team included our Flash programmer, Rick Hocker; our animation supervisor, Arthur Koch, our background and character artists, Joy Steuerwald and Karen Snave; our combat game designer Eric Luther (who designed the gatka mini-game) and our sound effects designer, Jane Scolieri. You can meet the whole development team <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/karmagame/credits" target="_blank">here</a></span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Gurumustuk Singh worked with Hargobind Singh to design and program the server-side environment for the game and all the supporting elements such as the Dharma Badge system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">But at the heart of it all was Gano who held the ‘soul of the game’ in her arms, and through her tireless dedication to the project, was able to bring it all to life. Thank you Buttercup! We did it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Gano-knackered1.jpg" rel="lightbox[73272]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-73288" title="Gano knackered" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Gano-knackered1.jpg" alt="Gaino Haine" width="640" height="432" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">I want to express my deep gratitude to all our generous supporters who, when our little project ran way over budget, generously donated funds to keep us afloat. Waheguru!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/karmagame" target="_blank">KARMA – The Ogre&#8217;s Curse</a></span> is Gano and the SikhNet Team’s gift to the children of the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">May you all be excellent, may you all be kind and may you all be heros!</span></p>
<p>Now go play the game and then lend a hand to other players in our <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/discussion/viewforum.php?f=15" target="_blank">gamers forum</a></span>!</p>

<p><em>November 1, 2011</em></p>
<p>Coming out of the subway station at Courtland, just a block away from Zuccotti Park, the first thing I notice is the towering presence of two skyscrapers still under construction. This is the defiant Freedom Tower – the phoenix rising from the tragic ashes of the 9/11 attacks. Shimmering and reflective against the shocking blue October skies. A statement that the US cannot be broken. We will rise again, rebuild and remain a power that touches the world.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize that the Occupy Wall Street protests were taking place across the street from Ground Zero. But then again– there was a lot I didn’t realize before I started this improvised pilgrimage to the heart of our US Spring. I didn’t realize that Zuccotti Park is just one city block. Maybe three-quarters of an acre. Frankly – it is less than half the size of the land I live on by myself in New Mexico. Yet the actions happening on that one block in New York City seem to be rippling across the universe.</p>
<p>Standing on the corner of Liberty and Trinity, the Freedom Towers to one side of me, the Occupy Wall Street protests on the other, I can’t help but wonder. What is it about this place? That in ten years’ time, two events have happened here that have impacted the psyche of the entire world?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Medical-Tent.jpg" rel="lightbox[72584]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-72634" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Medical-Tent.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a>I spend the better part of an entire day at Zuccotti Park. Looking around. Listening. Taking pictures. Talking. Witnessing. By the end of the day, I get a sense of why the mainstream media can’t get their head around what’s happening here. And why such a large percentage of the US population is cheering these folks on.</p>
<p>There’s the girl who is a medical assistant. She’s 24. Had a job in the medical field in Maryland that left her feeling empty. She quit her job and showed up at OWS to volunteer at the medical tent. With 90 bucks in her pocket and a cell phone whose charge had run out. Handing out Vitamin C tablets to the protesters who ask for them – she feels like she’s doing something important. She’s excited. She’s on fire. She’s empowered to be doing actual health “care” – where the “caring” is part of the role.</p>
<p>There’s another guy. Young and clean cut, with piercing blue eyes and a strong build. He has a tent, a knapsack, a laptop and a digital camera. He asks to take my picture because – let’s face it – with my white turban and white clothes, I stand out a little. We start talking. He’s been unemployed for the last four months. Living out of his car. Traveling from one Occupy protest to another. He’s experiencing and documenting the events in his own way because he doesn’t have anything else to do. I look at him and think – this is the face of the new displaced. They carry their belongings on their backs. But they are educated. They are digital. They are connected to each other, and they are a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>I walk through the park and walk around the park. Again and again and again. A picture starts to emerge. It’s complex. We’ve heard about flash mobs – connecting for a few minutes or a few hours for a specific purpose. Then disappearing back from where they came. This place – this Occupy Wall Street – is a flash town. It’s a living fractal of the kind of society these folks would like to create. That a lot of people would like to create. The infrastructure, the organization – they are experimenting and modeling for themselves what they’d like to see society become.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Gray-water.jpg" rel="lightbox[72584]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-72635" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Gray-water.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a>The Medical Tent.</strong> With doctors, nurses, and chiropractors that do have jobs. Yet they volunteer their time to take care of the protesters and anyone else who shows up.</p>
<p><strong>The Food Tent.</strong> Where they collect food donations, prepare meals, feed people. Feed the protesters. Feed the homeless. Feed the visitors. Feed anyone who comes along.</p>
<p><strong>The Comfort Tent.</strong> Where they hand out clothes to people &#8211; blankets, coats, shoes, socks. Making sure that folks have what they need.</p>
<p><strong>The Free Library.</strong> So many books being donated and lent out. Not just to the protesters – but to the crowds that meander through the park hour after hour. It’s open to them, too.</p>
<p><strong>The OWS Day Care.</strong> A little corner set up for the moms to look after their small children.</p>
<p><strong>The Media Tent. The Legal Tent. The Community Affairs Tent</strong> – if you want to know the schedule for the day. The Sanitation area – where the brooms and buckets are kept. The park was squeaky clean.</p>
<p>The gray water system display – illustrating how the water they use to clean the dishes is being recycled to water the plants in the park.</p>
<p>It goes on and on. A tiny little town within a square block, covering every human need. Fueled by volunteers, donations, and a fierce conviction that we can engineer a society where everybody gets taken care of.</p>
<p>Complexity. It doesn’t lend itself easily to sound bites.</p>
<p>Of course – all of the infrastructure would be pointless if there wasn’t something happening. Once again, &#8220;what&#8217;s happening&#8221; defies simple summaries. There are so many people converging in this one place, with so many different ideas. There’s no lack of things to do.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Tax-the-Rich.jpg" rel="lightbox[72584]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-72636" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Tax-the-Rich.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200" /></a>Every day, there’s at least one if not two marches organized somewhere for some purpose. The visible protest – with signs and people. The morning I arrived, a group had just donned Robin Hood costumes. They marched with signs saying, “Tax the Rich.” It was theatrical. It was New York. And it got a simple point across.</p>
<p>Yet to say that this point, “Tax the Rich” is THE point is not to be paying attention. That was one event. There were dozens and dozens of events happening all day long.</p>
<p>Free workshops offered on a range of topics: from non-violent communication, ala Marshal Rosenberg; to protecting yourself from predatory lenders.</p>
<p>Political action tables set up in the park. You can register to vote. Sign a petition supporting the Buffet Tax. Sign another petition to help keep US Post Offices open. And if you need a Public Notary? She there from 3-5 pm.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Sandwich-Board.jpg" rel="lightbox[72584]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-72637" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Sandwich-Board.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200" /></a>There’s the space for everyone to make a sign. For everyone to give voice to their thoughts. A lot of these protestors don’t sleep in the park. They show up for a while with their signs, and then go home when they’re done. One older man I spoke with wore a sandwich board that he obviously made himself. No flashy symbols or catch phrases. He had a rather crowded outline of what he thinks we need to be paying attention to.</p>
<p>I asked him how long he stayed there. He gave me a rueful smile. “I’m here with my wife,” he said. “And I stand here until my back or my legs give out.”</p>
<p>What fascinated me the most was how much more crowded the sidewalk became after business hours. You could see those people who, dressed very professionally, simply came by the protest on their way home from work. They added their signs and voices to the mix.</p>
<p>If you didn’t want to create a sign, you could always stop by the button maker’s table. Buttons in support of Occupy Wall Street. Take one and leave a donation “When my friends ask my why I’m here,” the button maker said, “I ask them – why aren’t YOU here?”</p>
<p>If signs and buttons aren’t your style – you can always sit in on The People’s Think Tank. In one corner of the park – just sit with other people – and talk about everything and anything that matters to you. I sat in for about 30 minutes. The people were regular folks. One guy, dressed like a yuppy, had come from upstate New York. He led the meeting, took notes, and his exuberance was infectious. “I feel like I can finally say all these things I’ve been thinking my whole life, but could never talk about with anyone.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Change.jpg" rel="lightbox[72584]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-72639" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Change.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200" /></a>Another voice, “There isn’t going to be a violent uprising. This is a spiritual uprising.”</p>
<p>Another voice. “It’s about compassion in leadership. How can we make it OK for leadership to be compassionate?”</p>
<p>And another, “This is the most American thing I’ve ever seen.”</p>
<p>The Think Tank met for 3 hours. They took a ten minute break, came back and kept going. Every single person involved was sitting on the edge of their seats, smiling, engaged, excited because they finally realized – hey, I’m not alone.</p>
<p>Not everyone likes the verbal route with signs, buttons or dialogue. So, on the other side of the park, you can jam with the infamous drum circle. The circle lasts for hours. Someone said to me, “I don’t even think all of them are protestors. I think some of these people just want a place to play drums – so they show up and become part of the circle for while.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Drum-Circle.jpg" rel="lightbox[72584]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-72642" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Drum-Circle.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a>It might annoy the heck out of the nearby businesses. But that drum circle keeps the attention on Zuccotti Park. Mobs of people line the street while they play, taking pictures and becoming curious.</p>
<p>(As a writer, as a journalist, I understand how difficult it might be to read this story. It’s taken me two hours to get this far, and there are more images in my mind. I know I am breaking the rules here. I may be going on longer than you are used to reading. But for some reason, I think it’s important. Just this once. To put all the pieces onto paper. Because this event, this OWS, is such a complex social phenomena. Perhaps in the not to distant future, there won’t be a chance to see it again. To talk about it again. I don’t want to forget any of the details.)</p>
<p>The more difficult aspects. The homeless. The pan-handlers. The mentally ill. Of course they are coming, too. Free food, free medical care, free warm clothes – who needs it more than they do? It would be easy to walk through the park, taking pictures of those people, and making them the face of the movement. By my estimation, this shadow side constitutes about maybe 5% of what’s happening there. To their credit, the OWS protestors are doing everything they can to manage these folks with dignity.</p>
<p>Next to a couple of pan-handlers, one protestor held up a sign. “Please don’t give money to the pan-handlers. Give it to OWS. We are making sure that everyone gets fed and gets what they need.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Brother-Police.jpg" rel="lightbox[72584]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-72643" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Brother-Police.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200" /></a>The interactions with the police. Both sides seem to be working very consciously to keep a dialogue going. There’s a dynamic tension at play. Cops are stationed on every side of the park. They maintain a certain distance, keep the foot traffic moving, and ask the protestors to change things with the camp if they perceive anything as hazardous. Some police officers wear vests that say, “Community Affairs Liaison.” There have been meetings between the protestors and representatives of the local neighborhoods. The amount of drumming going on has been a big issue.</p>
<p>It’s all about boundaries. Inside the park, a new world is being birthed, and it revels in the joy of its own existence. But a couple blocks away, New Yorkers and visitors are going about their daily life, oblivious to the social experiment taking place under the Freedom Tower. The police represent – physically and psychologically – the boundary line between those two worlds.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there’s the spiritual aspect.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Altar.jpg" rel="lightbox[72584]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-72644" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Altar.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a>On the corner of Liberty and Trinity, there is a simple tree at the center of a circle of marble benches. One of the protestors took it upon himself to create a sacred space around the tree. The protestors named the tree, The Tree of Life. There are small wooden shelves placed around the tree housing symbols from every possible religious and spiritual tradition &#8211; known and unknown. It’s universal. It’s open. And it serves as a spiritual sanctuary.</p>
<p>One of the people who created this sacred space watches over it as his contribution to the protests. &#8220;One day,&#8221; he said, “the yogis showed up.” Fateh Singh Khalsa, Hari Simran Singh Khalsa (who was featured in Time Magazine), Himmat Singh Khalsa and others. A group of Kundalini Yoga teachers, many of whom also happen to be Sikhs. They were inspired to come every evening and lead a Kundalini Yoga class for those in the camp who wanted to attend. They call themselves Occupy Yoga.</p>
<p>The “People’s Microphone” has been written about in other articles covering the protests. The yoga class works the same way. Sat Jagat Singh Khalsa, the head of the 3HO Brooklyn Ashram in NYC and co-founder of Kundalini Yoga in Park Slope, stands on one of the marble benches. He begins to explain the Kundalini Yoga exercises to those who are gathered there. His son, Hari Simran Singh, myself and others repeat the instructions in a loud voice. That way, the crowd which has gathered around can hear.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Occupy-Yoga.jpg" rel="lightbox[72584]"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-72645" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Occupy-Yoga.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a>This is grass roots, no glory, yoga teaching. This is bringing yoga to the people with humility and grace. There’s no room to stretch out. Sat Jagat Singh has to lead something simple that the participants can do while standing up or sitting down. Yet, people gather to watch. To participate. And yes – even to protest. As the yoga class happens, someone outside the park makes fun of it. They walk around with a sign that says, “This is the dawning of the Age of Hilarious.”</p>
<p>Some moments are too precious to put into words. The day ends the way it began. In the presence of the OWS protestors. Looking up at the emerging Freedom Tower. Sat Jagat Singh teaches a simple healing meditation as night falls. The Freedom Tower is the back-drop. There’s no way to express what it was like sitting there, across from Ground Zero, praying for healing with people who believe that we can build a better world. A more fair world. A more compassionate world. And who believe it enough to put themselves on the line.</p>
<p>It’s a one-in-a-million moment. The sound of the chanting. The reminder of what happened 10 years ago. The realization that the spirit to heal the problems we face has been inside us all along, and is coming to life. I don’t know what the end result of Occupy Wall Street will be. But I do know, day by day and moment by moment, there are conversations, prayers, connections and ideas happening here whose ripple effects will far outlast the life span of the protest, themselves.</p>

<p align="left">Every  fall, we have the blessing of celebrating Guru Ram Das Ji&#8217;s birthday. <a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Guru_Ram_Das" title="" target="_blank">Guru Ram Das was the fourth Sikh Guru</a>, and was known for his humility, service and deep devotion. He founded the city of Amritsar and designed the Golden Temple. There are 688 shabads of Guru Ram Das included in the <a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Siri_Guru_Granth" title="" target="_blank">Siri Guru Granth Sahib</a> and he wrote the <em>Lavan</em> (the Sikh marriage vows), as well as parts of <em>Rehiras</em> and <em>Kirtan Sohila.</em></p>
<p align="left"><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_5027.jpg" rel="lightbox[68461]"><img style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 15px" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/IMG_5027-300x200.jpg" alt="IMG_5027" title="IMG_5027" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-68465" align="right" height="200" width="300"></a>Guru  Ram Das held a special place in the heart of the <a href="http://fateh.sikhnet.com/yogibhajan" title="" target="_blank">Siri Singh Sahib</a>, and our local community looks to Guru Ram Das for guidance, for healing, and for protection. Many of our ashrams &amp; Gurdwaras were named in his honor. The Siri Singh Sahib started a beautiful special sadhana to do in celebration of Guru Ram Das&#8217;s birthday.&nbsp; For 11 days prior to his Guru Ram Das Ji&#8217;s birthday we chant the shabad <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/audio/dhan-dhan-ramdas-guru" title="" target="_blank">&#8216;<em>Dhan Dhan Ram Das Guru</em></a>&#8216; for 31 minutes. This is the Shabad of Miracles.&nbsp;  In many communities, Gurdwaras, ashram members, students and friends gather together to chant this shabad with devotion and faith, during the 11 days leading up to his birthday. Then, on October 9th, the day of Guru Ram Das Ji&#8217;s birth, we have a special sadhana of chanting the shabad &#8216;<em>Dhan Dhan Ram Das Guru</em>&#8216; for 2 &#189; hours in the Amrit Vela.What a special time.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font size="5"><a href="http://justin.tv/hgrd" title="" target="_blank">WATCH THE LIVE BROADCAST (Click Here)</a></font><br />   Celebrations will be almost all day Sunday October 9th. Below is the schedule and details&#8230;.</p>

<p align="left">I love this time of year during the fall when it is so beautiful. Then on top of it having these beautiful cozy evenings of Kirtan. It&#8217;s great being in the Gurdwara, but there is something unique and special about many members of the community opening their homes for all to come and sing and chant together in praise of Guru Ram Das. Every evening we go to someone else&#8217;s home, sing, meditate and then be served food by the hosts. </p>
<p align="left">Even if you do not have a Gurdwara or community you can play kirtan in your home or take the time to meditate on Gurbani. You can listen to the Shabad in praise of Guru Ram Das below along with many other musicians.

<p><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2011/09/22/the-sikhnet-film-festival-reviews-thoughts-part-1-juniors/" title="" target="_blank">Last week I posted the first part (junior group)</a> of this series of small video reviews from the SikhNet Youth Online Film Festival.&nbsp; Today I would like to share a few videos in the Intermediate Group which is of youth aged 18-25. This  category is always the most competitive since it is the prime age for video production. We normally get the most video submissions from youth in this category.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard for me to just pick a few videos since there are always so many great creative videos. However, here are a few videos that I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll enjoy. </p>
<p>I encourage you to <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/category/video/intermediate/" title="">watch the other videos</a> on SikhNet that are not featured here. All the participants of the film festival put a lot of time and effort into their videos, so I hope that you take the time to support them by watching the videos and shareing your appreciation and encouragement. </p>
<h2>Intermediate Category (Age 18-25 years) </h2>
<p><font size="3"><strong>&quot;<a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2011/born-to-lead/" title="" target="_blank">Born To Lead</a>&quot; <em>by 24 Year Satdeep Singh (Ludhiana, Punjab, India)</em></strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></font>This is Satdeep&#8217;s second year making films for the SikhNet Youth Online Film Festival. Last year his film titled, &quot;<a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2010/the-forgotten-truth/" title="" target="_blank">The Forgotten Truth</a>&quot; was the 2010 winner for the intermediate division. <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2010/the-forgotten-truth/" title="" target="_blank">You can watch his last film as well</a>. His film this year titled &quot;Born to Lead&quot; was a big jump up in production from last year.&nbsp;  Using a Digital SLR camera (Canon EOS 550D) with a normal 50mm lens created some very dramatic visuals with focusing and the actual video quality. I was surprised to see a production of this quality from India,  since often times the submissions from India are of lesser quality. They made their own music for the sound track for the video, which was produced by <a class="profileName" target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/tavsingh">Tavleen Singh (TAV).</a> I&#8217;m looking forward to them releasing the sound track that was played on the end credits of the video! </p>
<p>The  story of the video has to do with relating to ones&#8217; own Sikh identity and trying to fit in to what others think. It starts with a common theme  of a Sikh guy liking a girl who doesn&#8217;t like him in return because he is &quot;not her type&quot;  (meaning he wears a turban and beard). It has to do with his exploration of the value of being a Sikh, and for one&#8217;s self rather than  for others. It has a nice surprise twist near the end which was creative. I also like that it felt real and personal, unlike typical Bollywood melodramatic stories that are unreal. When we first watched this film I even caught myself getting a bit teary eyed at few parts. The music&#8230;story&#8230;acting&#8230;and whole production was very well done.</p>
<p>It  was also pretty cool to see the video spread through social networks like facebook and twitter. The more people commented on the video the more people shared it and saw the video. This video probably has more views within the first few days than any SikhNet videos in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2011/wake-walk-win/" title="" target="_blank">I encourage you to read more about the video and &quot;like it&quot;. Share your comments with the film makers and others on SikhNet.</a><font size="3"><a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2011/wake-walk-win/" title="" target="_blank"><strong><em> </em></strong></a><strong><em><br />   </em></strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong>&quot;<a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2011/the-reunion/" title="" target="_blank">The Reunion</a>&quot; <em>by Angad Bhai and Ethan Russell (New York, NY, USA )</em></strong></font></p>
<p>Two  friends who share a common background reunite after several years of being apart. One is a Sikh who has cut his hair after being brutalized during a hate crime, and the other has kept his hair since birth. Their dialogue deals with issues Sikhs face when trying to assimilate into modern American society, while maintaining their cultural and religious heritage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2011/05/11/the-reunion/" title="" target="_blank">I had previously posted info about this video which was released online earlier this&nbsp; year.</a>You  can read that info for details on the film. The lighting, sound, visuals and camera work and overall production was really high quality. You can definitely tell how hard Angad Singh and Ethan worked on this film. </p>

<p><strong><font size="3">&quot;<a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2011/japji-sahib-guru-nanak-the-kali-bein-the-black-river/" title="" target="_blank">Japji Sahib: Guru Nanak &amp; The Kali Bein</a>&quot; by Harimander Singh </font></strong><font size="3"><strong><em>(Santa Monica, CA, USA )</em></strong></font></p>
<p>This film starts with an video except by SSS Harbahajan Singh Khalsa about Guru Nanak Dev ji and then goes into a beautiful dramatization/visualization of Guru Nanak going into the river and experiencing the universe. Followed by his return and emerging from the water reciting Japji for the first time. </p>

<p><span>&quot;An old homeless man shows kindness and generosity to someone even less fortunate. I wanted this video to show people that there is always someone less fortunate and that we must always give to others.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span>This was a simple &amp; short video with only music and visually telling the story of a homeless man who falls into luck, yet still shares. This was filmed here in Espanola with his father as the main actor and Hargobind Singh (the kid). </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18px; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; background-color: #ffffff"><br />   </span></p>

<p><span>&quot;This is a story of a 6 years old child, who is not aware of the sacrifices made by the Sikhs. One day he transformed by a ray of light.&quot; This video is fun and playful and put&#8217;s you in the kids perspective. They did a great job with the video, sound effects and overall adding humor to the video. I&#8217;m sure kids will enjoy watching this video as well. </span></p>

<p>This morning I was eating my breakfast as usual sitting with my daughter before she left for school, reading the latest happenings through twitter, and saw a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/humblethepoet" title="" target="_blank">@humblethepoet</a> of a new music video that was posted online. This wasn&#8217;t a &quot;<a href="http://thepoetproject.tumblr.com/" title="" target="_blank">Humble the Poet</a>&quot; video, but a music video by a young American guy named <a href="http://www.shankartucker.com/" title="" target="_blank">Shankar Tucker</a> who is currently living in Mumbai on a special scholarship to learn with Hariprasad Chaurasia.&nbsp; He plays the clarinet along with all kinds of other instruments. I thought it was so cool seeing and listening to these videos which I can tell he put a lot of effort into. As soon as I heard the clarinet playing, I thought of my other friend <a href="http://ramdassmusic.com/" title="" target="_blank">Ram Dass Khalsa</a> who is also a talented musician who plays the clarinet (among many other instruments) and makes fusion/mantra/chant music. </p>

<p>Being a Sikh and Growing up in India has definitely made me fond of Indian music. I love many of the classic Indian musicians and particularly love the flute (Pt. Hariprasad Chairasia is awesome). Though I have western roots, I have loved listening to music which is a fusion of east and west. Probably most of my favorite music is Indian/western fusion music. So, when I see a young guy like Shankar Tucker, its pretty cool to see this music alive and growing. It&#8217;s cool seeing him and other young Indian musicians working together making some great music. </p>
<p>Over the years I have gotten to know many young Sikh musicians, and always try to encourage and support them in this creative art. I love that my daughter is learning music (violin) and hope that she continues to enjoy and play music. These days in school and life in general learning music is not a priority, so the few who do get into music are very lucky. I think it really is reliant on parents encouraging and taking the time to help kids learn music. It takes a lot of time&#8230;.not only for the kids but for the parents. As part of my daughter learning Violin one of the parents (my wife) has to learn with her as well, which creates a better support structure and investment on the parents part. If you have kids, I encourage you to share the gift of music with your children! </p>
<p>&nbsp;There are actually a lot of Sikh style music/gurbani that is fusion type (<a href="http://www.satkirin.com" title="" target="_blank">My mother included is actually a popular musicians</a>). Here are a few other musicians that you can explore that I can remember (This is in no way a comprehensive list &amp; is just a few artists that are listed on SikhNet). If you have others that you want to suggest&#8230;please do comment! I love finding new music!</p>

<p>These days we are seeing lots new Sikh musicians come out. Surprisingly for me, Rap music is pretty popular to Sikh Youth and there are quite a few Rappers these days. I recently became friends with another musician (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/tavleensingh?sk=info" title="" target="_blank">Tavleen Singh</a>) who made the music sound track for one of the recent popular SikhNet Youth Online Film Festival videos: &quot;<a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2011/born-to-lead/" title="" target="_blank">Born to Lead</a>&quot;. I&#8217;m looking forward to him releasing the track that he ends the film with. </p>
<p>Anyways&#8230; looking forward to hearing more Indian fusion style music&#8230;. please do share your favorites!</p>

<p>This fall marks the 6th annual SikhNet Youth Online Film Festival which started in 2006 with a simple goal to engage the Sikh Youth to get creative with communicating through media. By giving the Sikh youth a &quot;stage&quot; and some prizes as encouragement, we have seen so many personal and creative stories. If we want to educate our own community and the world about what Sikhi is about, then we have to have the skills, tools and actually do it. No one is going to do it for us.</p>
<p>I also feel that too often Sikhi is related in such dry way with no &quot;soul&quot; or spirituality in how it is communicated that doesn&#8217;t connect with the new younger generation of Sikhs. As if it (being a Sikh) was just something that we do &quot;because&quot;&#8230;or something that you practiced because your parents told you to, without it having much meaning to you. Often times with no personal relationship in expressing this&#8230;.it is harder to relate to. I always encourage the youth who submit videos to SikhNet to come up with a video showing unique and creative stories that share a personal experience. This helps the viewer relate to it in a real way and not come across as preachy or hollow.</p>
<p>Technology has made it easier than ever to use this media. Everyone has cell phones that record video&#8230;even HD quality video! Most youth have computers and are pretty comfortable with technology. It&#8217;s just a matter of applying their creativity and doing something unique with their time. Sit on the couch and watch TV? Or get a bunch of friends together and make a cool video that will be both fun and interested to many people. I have seen so many more Sikhs make videos in recent years. If you watch videos on YouTube or are on Facebook you have no doubt seen loads of videos by Sikhs. It&#8217;s pretty common to see <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2007/just-2-live-another-day/" target="_blank">Sikh rap music videos</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JusReign?blend=1&amp;ob=4" target="_blank">comedy</a></p>
<p>A few weeks ago was the submission deadline for the 2011 SikhNet Film Festival, and after getting all the videos, we started our work with processing them and getting ready to post online. Some years we get 20+ video submissions and sometimes 50+ so it really just depends. It&#8217;s always great to see repeat film makers who have started with their first video and then over the next years create more videos. You can always see the quality improvement for the ones that stick with it, each with their own unique style.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JusReign?blend=1&amp;ob=4" target="_blank"> </a><a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival"><img src="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/filmfestival-2011-wide.jpg" alt="SikhNet Film Festival Videos Online" height="140" width="580"></a>
<p>This past Friday we had the task to watch all the video submissions and decide who the prize winners would be. Overall we feel that all the participants are &quot;winners&quot; just by taking the time to make a video and do something creative, however we like to recognize some of the videos that might stand out from the rest. Plus&#8230;it motivates people to know that they can win some prize money.</p>
<p>It is no easy task choosing top three for each category (junior, intermediate, and senior). The 4 of us at SikhNet (Espanola) went over to Guruka Singh&#8217;s house and had a SikhNet Film Festival movie marathon all day. We started off with the video submissions by the juniors 11-17 years old and went upwards. </p>
<p>Judging videos is very subjective, so opinions can vary widely from person to person. In the past we had a whole ranking system that we had many different judges fill out to rank each movie, but in the end it didn&#8217;t seem to work very well.&nbsp; So for the past years we have done a bit of a hybrid of the two. We watch the videos and rank them on a sheet according to the creativity, message, technical aspects and overall impact. Then at the end of watching the videos for each youth group we compare our rankings to see if there is a common theme for our top picks. We do the marathon viewing together so that the videos are fresh in our minds and we can better compare to the other videos that we just watched. </p>
<p>If we find that all of us ranked certain videos similarly then it&#8217;s great. But often times (particularly for second and third place) we have to spend time to debate with each other and talk about why we each felt one video was better than the other. We always have some pretty heated and passionate &quot;debates&quot; as we argue why we think one video is better than the other. It&#8217;s no easy task since there are so many aspects to consider, and the videos can often be so different in nature and culture. For example, videos typically from youth in India are often VERY different than videos made by youth elsewhere in the world. </p>
<p>In any case, we do our best to be fair in ranking the winners and share tips and advice with the Film makers so they can improve.&nbsp; So are you ready to start watching some videos from this years SikhNet Youth Online Film Festival?? There are quite a few videos that you can watch so I thought I would share some of the videos that I enjoyed with a bit of commentary&#8230;..</p>
<h2>Junior Category (Age 11-17 years)</h2>
<p><font size="3"><strong>&quot;(Ex) Changed&quot; <em>by 17 Year old Angad Singh (Roswell, Georgia, USA)</em></strong></font></p>
<p>Angad Singh is one of the younger talented Sikh youth who started his first film for the 2007 SikhNet Film festival when he was 13 years old. He won 1st place in the junior category for <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2007/one-light/" target="_blank">the video titled &quot;One Light&quot;. </a>This was a project for him to educate his neighbors about himself as a Sikh and to learn about them as well. </p>
<p>Then in 2008 (age 15) he came out again with yet <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2008/roots-and-wings/" target="_blank">another winning video &quot;Roots and Wings&quot;</a> which poses  the question about whether one has to cut off their <em>roots</em> in order to spread their <em>wings</em> and soar high. </p>
<p>This year (now at 17 years old) he submitted <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2011/ex-changed/">his third film (Ex) Changed</a> about him as a Sikh-American teenager sharing the message of friendship and building bridges to an international level. He and his American classmates host 32 French teens for two weeks as part of an exchange program. They get to know French lifestyle and culture on an individual level, breaking the common stereotypes that they had of the French, while showing their guests the true face of America. While exploring two other connections Angad has to France, and building his third one, he realizes something that devastates him.</p>
<p>You can watch his latest video below which was one of my favorites for the junior group&#8230; </p>

<p> <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2011/ex-changed/" title="" target="_blank">I encourage you to read more about the above video and &quot;like it&quot;. Share your comments with the film makers and others on SikhNet.</a><font size="3"><a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2011/wake-walk-win/" title="" target="_blank"><strong><em> </em></strong></a><strong><em><br />    </em></strong></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong>&quot;Wake Walk Win&quot; <em>by 17 Year old twins Harnek Singh and Rasna Kaur (Troy, Michigan, USA)</em></strong></font></p>
<p>This is their second year submitting to the SikhNet Film Festival. In 2010 they won 1st place in the junior division for their film &quot;<a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/filmfestival/2010/iz-yu-ignanat-bout-sikhi/" title="" target="_blank">iz yu ignant bout Sikhi?</a>&quot;.&nbsp; This short film is a visually creative and simple message based on Gurbani to first &quot;wake up&quot;&#8230;&quot;start walking&quot;&#8230;and then &quot;win&quot;.&nbsp; I loved the creative idea they used for this and how they artistically conveyed this in video.</p>

<p>This morning while I was meditating I was thinking about Death because a lot of different things related to death have been coming up during the past week. First off&#8230;.today (Sept 22) in 1539 <a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Guru_Nanak_Dev" title="" target="_blank">Guru Nanak Dev Ji (Founder of Sikhism)</a> left his physical body and joined the creator. Wow&#8230;. Guru Nanak is someone definitely to remember! He changed the world and is still ever present through Gurbani and in the hearts of many. </p>
<p>Last night my 5 year old daughter Charanjeet Kaur over-heard a conversation that my wife was having with the mother of one of her friends.&nbsp; She was lit up about about the thought of death, exclaiming that her friend&#8217;s great grand mother is very sick and might DIE. And then saying&#8230; &quot;I don&#8217;t want to die!&quot;. It was interesting to see how she was relating to death, so we talked to her about death being a natural part of life and that we all are born and die eventually. I think some of her concepts of death are from what she has seen in movies which are mostly pretty sad and have no spiritual connection. She just kind of listened&#8230;.said again that she doesn&#8217;t want to die&#8230;and then I did my normal nightly Kirtan Sohila for her and she went to sleep. </p>
<p>I often think about death and ask myself ,&quot;If I were to die today would I feel like I did what I came here to do?&quot;. Most often the answer is no, and that even though God could take me home at any time I feel some assurance that I still have a lot of work to do, and surely &quot;God&quot; won&#8217;t take me yet. In reality though who knows. We often tell ourselves we will do certain things later on&#8230;and time passes&#8230;life passes going through the motions of every day life. It is in situations like this that you realize how important taking the time to connect with your soul and live as a spiritual person. The time really is NOW&#8230;today to make change and connect with our true spiritual self which is everywhere and in everything. I don&#8217;t think anyone wants to come to the end of their life and look back thinking how they wasted their life, and didn&#8217;t spend the time on the important things.
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrsikhnet/6089670594/" title="IMG_3479 by Gurumustuk Singh, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6065/6089670594_ea54388deb.jpg" alt="IMG_3479" width="500" height="334"></a> </p>
<p>Every day when I see my daughters bright face I take the time to hug her and cherish this gift that God has given to us, and try to treat it as if I might not see her tomorrow. I always pray for the protection and safe keeping of my family and hope my kids live a long life, but there are no guarantees of this. All I can do is just appreciate the time that I have NOW and not worry about &quot;what could happen&quot;.</p>
<p>For years me and my wife had talked about the idea of Life Insurance for me. We kept flip flopping on the idea but a few weeks ago decided to get a policy for me so that If I ever were to depart from the earth within the next 20 years that my wife and kids would be covered. Hopefully we never actually need to use the policy! I want to stick around for a long time and be one of those great grand parents sharing this beautiful path with the younger generations. All is in Guru&#8217;s hands&#8230;.</p>
<p>In any case one has to just keep on going and living life to the fullest and not take this precious time for granted. </p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>By Deva Kaur Khalsa</p>
<p>&#8220;Our  hair fashions might be just a trend, but if we investigate, we may find  that we have been depriving ourselves of one of the most valuable sources of energy for human vitality.&#8221; Yogi Bhajan</p>
<p>Consider the possibility that the hair on your head is there to do more than just look good. Man is the only creature who grows longer hair  on his head as he grows into adulthood. Left uncut, your hair will grow  to a particular length and then stop all by itself at the correct length for you. <strong>From a yogic perspective, hair is an amazing gift of nature that can actually help raise the Kundalini energy (creative life force), which increases vitality, intuition, and tranquility.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Hair</strong></p>
<p>Long ago people in many cultures didn&#8217;t cut their hair, because it was a part of who they were. There were no salons. Often, when people were conquered or enslaved, their hair was cut as a recognized sign of slavery. It was also understood that this would serve as punishment and decrease the power of those enslaved.</p>
<p>The bones in the forehead are porous and function to transmit light to the pineal gland, which affects brain activity, as well as thyroid and sexual hormones. Cutting bangs which cover the forehead impedes this  process. When Genghis Khan conquered China, he considered the Chinese to be a very wise, intelligent people who would not allow themselves to be subjugated. He therefore required all women in the country to cut their hair and wear bangs, because he knew this would serve to keep them  timid and more easily controlled.</p>
<p>As whole tribes or societies were conquered, cut hair became so prevalent that the importance of hair was lost after a few generations, and hairstyles and fashion grew to be the focus.</p>
<p>The science of hair was one of the first technologies given by Yogi Bhajan when he came to America. &#8220;When the hair on your head is allowed to attain its full, mature length, then phosphorous, calcium, and vitamin D are all produced, and enter the lymphatic fluid, and eventually the spinal fluid through the two ducts on the top of the brain. This ionic change creates more efficient memory and leads to greater physical energy, improved stamina, and patience.&#8221; Yogi Bhajan explained that if you choose to cut your hair, you not only lose this extra energy and nourishment, but your body must then provide a great amount of vital energy and nutrients to continually re-grow the missing hair.</p>
<p>In addition, hairs are the antennas that gather and channel the sun energy or <em>prana</em>  to the frontal lobes, the part of the brain you use for meditation and visualization. These antennas act as conduits to bring you greater quantities of subtle, cosmic energy. It takes approximately three years from the last time your hair was cut for new antennas to form at the tips of the hair.</p>
<p><strong>Kundalini Hair Care</strong></p>
<p>In India, a Rishi is known as a wise one who coils his or her hair up  on the crown of the head during the day to energize the brain cells, and then combs it down at night. <strong>A &#8216;rishi knot&#8217; energizes your magnetic field (aura) and stimulates the pineal gland in the center of your brain.</strong>  &#8220;This activation of your pineal results in a secretion that is central to the development of higher intellectual functioning, as well as higher  spiritual perception&#8221; (Yogi Bhajan).<strong> </strong>During the day, the hair absorbs solar energy, but at night it absorbs lunar energy. Keeping the hair up during the day and down at night aids in this process. Braiding your hair down at night will help your electromagnetic  field balance out from the day.</p>
<p><strong>Split Ends</strong></p>
<p>Loose scattered hair can develop split ends. Instead of trimming them  and losing your antennas, Yogi Bhajan recommends applying a small amount of almond oil to your hair overnight so that it can be absorbed before you wash it the next morning. Keeping your hair coiled on your crown and protected with a head covering during the day will help your antennas heal. If you have long hair, see if your experience is different when it is clean and coiled at your crown, or down and loose.</p>
<p><strong>Wet Hair</strong></p>
<p>One year after Winter Solstice, when Yogi Bhajan was sitting in our living room with wet hair, he explained that he was drying it before putting it up in order to avoid a headache. When you put your hair up wet, it will tend to shrink and tighten a bit and even break as it dries. A better idea is to occasionally take the time to sit in the sun and allow your clean, wet hair to dry naturally and absorb some extra vitamin D. Yogis recommend shampooing the hair every 72 hours (or more frequently if the scalp sweats a great deal). <strong>It can also be beneficial to wash your hair after being upset to help process emotions. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Wooden Comb</strong></p>
<p>Yogis also recommend using a wooden comb or brush for combing your hair as it gives a lot of circulation and stimulation to the scalp, and the wood does not create static electricity, which causes a loss of the hair&#8217;s energy to the brain. You will find that, <strong>if you comb your  hair and scalp front to back, back to front, and then to the right and left several times, it will refresh you, no matter how long your hair is.</strong> All the tiredness of your day will be gone. For women, it is said that using this technique to comb your hair twice a day can help  maintain youth, a healthy menstrual cycle, and good eyesight.</p>
<p>If you are bald or balding, the lack of hair energy can be counteracted with more meditation. If you are finding some silver strands in your hair, be aware that the silver or white color increases the vitamins and energy flow to compensate for aging. For better brain health as you age, try to keep your hair as natural and healthy as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Tagore&#8217;s Hair </strong></p>
<p>Yogi Bhajan told us this story about hair many years ago at Women&#8217;s Camp in New Mexico: Recognize how beautiful and powerful your hair is&#8212;that when you keep it, you live a life of fulfillment in this world. When Rabindranath Tagore, the great poet who found God within himself, tried to meet a friend on a steamer ship, the friend didn&#8217;t recognize him and so wrote him a letter. &#8220;We were on the same steamer, but I didn&#8217;t find you.&#8221; Tagore said, &#8220;I was there.&#8221; His friend said, &#8220;I understand you are now a God-realized man, and I would like to know what  your first action was when you became aware of the Oneness in all?&#8221; Tagore said, &#8220;When I realized the Oneness of all, I threw my shaving kit  into the ocean. I gave up my ego and surrendered to nature. I wanted to  live in the form that my Creator has given me.&#8221;</p>
<p>When humans allow their hair to grow, they are welcoming the maturity, the responsibility of being fully-grown, and fully powerful. That is why you will find grace and calmness in a person with uncut hair  from birth, if it is kept well. The Creator has a definite reason for giving you hair.</p>
<p>It is said that when you allow your hair to grow to its full length and coil it on the crown of the head, the sun energy, <em>pranic</em>  life force, is drawn down the spine. To counteract that downward movement, the Kundalini life energy rises to create balance. In Yogi Bhajan&#8217;s words, &#8220;Your hair is not there by mistake. It has a definite purpose, which saints will discover and other men will laugh at.&#8221;</p>

<p>This past 3 day weekend I have been hard at work in my back yard doing some major gardening in a race before the fall/winter frost. I love this hard physical labor which is like therapy for my wrists/arms/body which is normally sitting in front of a computer every day. I spent all day digging irrigation trenches; That was tough! Nothing like a good sweat. My muscles are so sore today. Any way getting off track</p>
<p>Today on my lunch break I drove to the local hardware store to pickup some things I needed for the project. As I was loading the stuff into the trunk of my car a woman walks up to me in the parking lot. She tells me this whole story&#8230;.and I&#8217;m not sure what to make of it all (all while I continue loading my stuff in the car). She said her husband was a into drugs, alcohol and abusive and her and her daughter had to get away from him. She basically wanted me to give her some money for gas/food. She got a bit sad looking and tried her best to convince me that she was for real; inviting me to see her daughter in the car. I didn&#8217;t quite believe her&#8230;but I gave her $5 and drove off watching my thoughts. Was she for real? Was she just a scammer or drug addict herself trying any which way to get money from people? I started thinking about it while driving back to the SikhNet office.</p>
<p>This all reminds me of my days in school in India where I used to come across a lot of beggars. Or on the street here in the USA where people hold a sign asking for help (money). One of the lines of thinking is &quot;don&#8217;t give money to people like this since it encourages them to do it more &amp; they take advantage of people.&quot;. </p>
<p>I used to be pretty cautious of who I give money to and try to tell if they are really in need. Sometimes when driving and I saw a sign that someone was holding asking for money for food I would give them some food. Sometimes these people were ungrateful since they were maybe just using it to get money. Sometimes they were happy to get something. I find that too often when someone is in need and asking for help it triggers a mental process of trying to &quot;judge&quot; them if they deserve my charity or are really wanting the money for the purpose they are asking me. It is often hard to determine who is for real and if what they are saying is the truth&#8230;and even if they are not telling the truth they might be having a hard time in their life. So now when someone comes to me I give them something and mentally ask for Guru to bless this person. It&#8217;s their karma to lie&#8230;and my blessing to give. </p>
<p>What is a few dollars to me or you anyways? The way I figure it, God takes care of me and provides all that I need. I have plenty that I can share with others (especially a few dollars here and there to random people). I have no way of knowing if the person uses the money for drugs or alcohol, but that is not for me to judge. I figure give with a smile and bless them. If someone came to the Gurus for help I would think that they would have given them help too. So rather than getting caught up in the mental process of &quot;judging&quot; if the person is truthful I just give something. I would not want to turn away someone who was really in need. So even if 4 our of 5 people are lying and just one was really in need and truthful then great!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Everyone has a hard time in their life&#8230;and many are stuck in poverty and hard situations. It&#8217;s easy for any of us to just say&#8230;why can&#8217;t you just get a job, though for many it is not so simple as that. Homelessness and poverty can be complex situations. I&#8217;m not saying you should do the same thing as me, but I find that I personally would rather give from the heart and pray for the person,&nbsp; than turn away someone in need. </p>
<p>How do you deal with these types of situations? Curious to hear others thoughts on this topic&#8230;. </p>

<p><font face=" Verdana">The week before Summer Solstice, I took a walk on my property doing what I like to do this time of year. Seeing what native grasses and wild flowers have decided to take up residence; seeing what pesky plants were being greedy for territory. Since I live by the side of a main road in the state of New Mexico, another thing that always shows up during my little walks is what we humans call &#8220;trash.&#8221; Plastic cups, paper, aluminum soda and beer cans. That kind of thing. </font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana">Usually, when I see the trash scattered around, I feel really annoyed. Like &#8211; why do people have to throw things out their windows while they are driving? With a simple gust of wind, all these little pieces of junk tumble across my property, unsightly, with no final resting place.</font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana">But during this walk, feeling the frustration as a battered piece of paper blew past me, Mother Nature gave me a different insight. The problem with trash isn&#8217;t that somebody threw it away. The problem is that Mother Nature can&#8217;t find another use for it.</font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana">The earth is a living organic being with its own cycles. Part of those cycles include the forces of wind and water taking organic material from one part of the land to another. This is how, unbidden, scarlet globemallow and baby white aster can suddenly show up in patches on my land where they never existed before. Mother Earth doesn&#8217;t create waste. When something transforms into seeds or dies and decays, it becomes the basis for new life. The earth evolved as a complex system of organic elements which constantly reorganize themselves. That reorganization is continual, powerful and inevitable.</font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana">When the wind brings paper or plastic cups on the land, it&#8217;s the exact same forces that bring seeds or dried leaves. It&#8217;s the cycle of life. The difficulty is that humans create things that are used only once, for one purpose. We see the here and the now, the immediate. But we don&#8217;t envision the entire life-cycle of the thing. When the purpose for the thing is finished, the forces of nature eventually take over. They act as they have always acted. But because of our own incomplete vision, Mother Nature can&#8217;t find any additional uses for what we release back to Her care.</font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana">Though we come from Mother Earth, and are completely dependent upon Her for everything, our intelligence is not aligned with Her intelligence. We ignore the power of Her creative forces and end up creating things that can&#8217;t be integrated back into the cycle of life.</font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana">Such a small lesson from the wind and the land. But this tiny dynamic on my property is happening in a big way in Los Alamos right now. Or in Japan a few months back. </font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana">When the tsunami struck Japan in March of 2011, I remember watching footage of what the water did to the land. What frightened me the most &#8211; even more than the nuclear reactor, frankly, was the sheer amount of &#8220;trash&#8221; getting hauled into the ocean. How many chemicals, plastics, and metals got dumped into the currents of the oceans that day? And what consequences would that have for the life of the sea? We think that we have the power to create safety zones where the toxicity we concoct can be contained to a small area. We believe we can control these human-made poisons so they don&#8217;t affect anything we don&#8217;t want them to affect. But this is the illusion of the human ego, of pride. Earthly forces will always be more powerful than us. Nature eventually destroys everything &#8211; including our own bodies. The matter and energy released from the forces of destruction are later reorganized into something new. This is the operating system of the planet. It has been going on for billions of years. Long before humans arrived. We don&#8217;t have the power to change that.</font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana">Tsunamis have always and will always exist. Yet, human beings have forgotten to have an integrated intelligence with the earth. So today &#8211; rather than a tsunami having the effect of renewing and reorganizing the ecology, it spreads poison and danger.</font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana">The same with the fires in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Tens of thousands of barrels of radioactive waste sit on the land near the Los Alamos labs. In the great arcing cycle of nature, one way or another, that waste is going to be released into the environment. It might happen in the next week. It might happen in the next 20 years. Or perhaps it will happen 200,000 years from now. But the forces of Mother Nature will continue. She reaches everywhere. Creation, destruction, re-creation. It&#8217;s foolish to believe that humans can protect that poison from the natural cycles of the earth forever.</font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana">I&#8217;m not advocating going back to the stone ages. For thousands of years, most of what humans created was integrated with the natural cycle because we didn&#8217;t have access to any technology what would give us any other options. There&#8217;s a purpose to the scientific awakening of the human race that has been going on for the last few centuries. Our ability to know how to split the atom and send satellites to the far-reaches of the solar system is, I believe, part of the Cosmic design. But the step we haven&#8217;t taken is to think differently.</font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana">Before this technological awakening, we didn&#8217;t need to visualize the life cycle of something because our creativity and the creativity of Mother Earth were more organically connected. Now we have to consciously wake up to what we are doing. For the future, it is essential that we develop another way to think about things. To think about what humans create and produce. To extend the thinking from &#8220;what can I make for this SPECIFIC purpose&#8221; to &#8220;how can we use our technology to create things that serve a purpose, and then die and are reborn in another form after that purpose is done.&#8221;</font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana">Before we develop something, we need to see its entire life-cycle as working in tandem with the life-cycle of the planet.</font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana">Some people may think that is impossible. But I believe the human intelligence is capable of asking and answering these questions. We can stretch that far. We can abandon the idea that technology requires this level of waste. We can create a new approach to develop processes, products and systems that work with, rather than against, the forces of the earth.</font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana">Human evolution is a remarkable result of the complex life-cycles of Mother Nature. Now is the time to remember that we are part of the intelligence of the planet. If we push ourselves to think in new ways, we can create a society that is technology advanced and ecologically balanced all at the same time.</font></p>

<p>Okay, I have to admit I love having a daughter, and like probably most fathers, I adore my beautiful Khalsa princess Charanjeet Kaur. Today she turned five years old (with my son turning 10 in a couple of months). It&#8217;s such a blessing to have children. They teach us so much. On one side it can often feel like so much work and energy to raise children, but if you pay attention &amp; work at it, they are little gifts! </p>
<p>Through every day life I learn patience, staying neutral and calm, how to communicate better and having fun (I&#8217;m too serious with my work all the time so the kids lighten things up for me). Since they are always watching you, being a good example is important so it helps me keep on track with my spiritual discipline. Children are still so pure and innocent and remind me of our source&#8230;.God in all. It is as they get older that they learn prejudice, hate, division, from the adults around them. </p>
<p>Charanjeet was born right after the annual 3HO summer solstice sadhana that happens each year here in the mountains of Espanola, New Mexico, so it can be challenging to have a birthday party with so much going on here! Weddings&#8230;..thousands of people traveling from all over the world to this little town to work on themselves. This year we squeezed in a small birthday breakfast for her before Gurdwara yesterday with just some of the family. Yummy pan cakes, cup cakes, vege links/strips and hot maple syrup with blueberries. Yum..yum.</p>
<p>For so long Charanjeet didn&#8217;t want to wear a turban because she didn&#8217;t think it was pretty (as she compared it to mainstream girl images of princesses and &quot;glamor girls&quot;). We didn&#8217;t want to force her, but wanted to encourage her to wear a real head covering. I&#8217;m excited now that she has changed and now loves her turban. Adding a pretty khanda pin, chunni&#8230;and showing how beautiful she looks in the mirror really helped. She now sees the real Khalsa princess that she is. This past week I took a bunch of pictures of Charanjeet Kaur up at Summer Solstice and at Gurdwara in Espanola and it really helps as she sees herself and her own shining light.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures that I took of Charanjeet this past week from her Birthday, Gurdwara, Summer Solstice, etc. </p>

<p>A SikhNet visitor asked the question of why bad stuff happens to them even though they are a &#8216;Good Sikh&#8217;.&nbsp; <em>&quot;My parents won&#8217;t let me do this&#8230;.so and so died&#8230;has illness&#8230;not doing well..&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#8217;m good&#8230;do my banis&#8230;get up in the morning&#8230;and yet all this stuff happens to me? Does the Guru/God not like me?&quot;. </em></p>
<p>In this latest SikhNet video myself and Guruka Singh talk about this subject. What do you think? When challenges or hardships come in your life how to you process this and relate to what is happening?</p>

<p><font face=" Verdana" size="2"><span></span></font><em><font face=" Verdana" size="2"><span><font size="3">&#8220;We must understand, our life is for expansion. And it will keep expanding until death, whether we use it or not. If we use our life, it will expand beautifully. It will benefit us beautifully. It will make us comfortable beautifully. But you can&#8217;t stop expansion. You were born like this and you keep on growing.&#8221; &#8211; </font></span></font></em><span>Yogi Bhajan &#8211; from <a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/success-and-spirit" title="">Success and the Spirit: An Aquarian Path to Abundance</a></span></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana" size="2"><span><font size="3">People who love plants understand there is a natural rhythm to life. A rose bush, a maple tree each has a cycle. Every spring, when the winter fades and the natural world begins to awaken, a rose bush will not only leaf with its exiting branches &#8211; but put out new shoots, as well. The tips of the maple limbs will stretch and grow, adding a few inches to its height and width. This is the natural cycle of creation.<br />   </font></span></font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana" size="2"><span><font size="3">As humans, even though we are surrounded by the reality of nature, we forget that we are also part of that cycle. It isn&#8217;t that we age every year, getting older and closer to death. Like the maple and the rose, our natural psyche expands with each turn of the earth around the sun. We perceive something we hadn&#8217;t seen before, explore new horizons in work or family life, develop new insights, decide to start a new hobby or continue to hone and develop our skills with an existing interest. This expansive impulse is natural for everything in creation &#8211; especially human beings. And like a rose bush or a maple tree, the cycle of expansion doesn&#8217;t end until the moment of our death.<br />   </font></span></font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana" size="2"><span><font size="3">Abundance is unavoidable because expansion is unavoidable. As long as you live and breathe, you are continually expanding. The question is &#8211; where is your abundance? Are you abundant in misery? In doubt? In unhappiness? In questions and insecurity? Or are you abundant in optimism? In faith? In happiness? In taking life as it comes?<br />   </font></span></font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana" size="2"><span><font size="3">Where has your abundance taken root?<br />   </font></span></font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana" size="2"><span><font size="3">Expansion is inevitable. The key is to know which way you want to expand yourself, and to be in command of your energy enough to deliberately expand in positive ways. None of us can ever get rid of our shadow side completely. But you can identify and cultivate what is beautiful in you; what is most effective in your habits; what your strengths are; what the unique gifts are that you have to offer. Then with a meditative mind, deliberately move your energy so that the beauty in your life grows and grows. It&#8217;s a matter of where you put your attention.<br />   </font></span></font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana" size="2"><span><font size="3">Sometimes we get to a point in life where we feel stuck or where the world around us falls apart. It can feel frightening. With the change of Ages, that experience will become more and more prevalent for people. But if we anchor to the principle that expansion is a continual process, then when things fall apart, we can understand it&#8217;s because expansion is no longer possible in the current form. As safe as it may feel, as familiar and comfortable &#8211; our soul and psyche have nowhere to go. No space to grow. And so a pressure gets created between the environment and the life energy until we have to try something different, and open up to new possibilities for the power of expansion to flow freely.<br />   </font></span></font></p>
<p><font face=" Verdana" size="2"><span><font size="3">As we get closer to Summer Solstice 2011, the last Summer Solstice of the Piscean Age, I invite you to meditate on ways you want to expand into the Age of Aquarius. Identify the best in you, the most beautiful aspects of your life &#8211; and use the powerful expansive energy of the sun at Solstice time to propel yourself into a positive and prosperous future.<br />   </font></span></font></p>

</p>
<p>Last week was an unexpected long and tedious week at SikhNet. You can blame or thank my wife whichever you prefer! It all started with a new electronic device in our office (The Amazon Kindle). My wife loves reading books, particularly before going to sleep. With her birthday coming up this weekend I was trying to think what I could get her for a gift, and decided on an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/kindle" title="" target="_blank">Amazon Kindle</a> <strong>(Don&#8217;t tell her! She doesn&#8217;t read my blog so hopefully doesn&#8217;t know)</strong>. For those of you who don&#8217;t keep up with technology, the Kindle is a small little mini note pad size device that allows you to read books, in an electronic format. It&#8217;s not back-lit like iPads, so easy on the eyes.&nbsp; Plus it uses what they call &quot;e-Ink&quot; which makes it just like reading a book. Battery life lasts weeks between charges! Everything is going digital&#8230;.so no reason why our books would not be doing the same on a large scale!&nbsp; Lots of my friends love e-Book readers use them all the time. You can even &quot;lend&quot; books to friends just like you would a paperback.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/photo8.jpg" rel="lightbox[51557]"><img style="margin-left: 10px" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/photo8-224x300.jpg" alt="photo8" title="photo8" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-51607" align="right" height="300" width="224"></a>Anyways&#8230; so after I bought the Kindle I had to figure out what I was going to put on it to get her started. She has been traveling more often and taking books, music, nitnem, and other devices I thought it would be great to simplify her packing and at least reduce her having to bring books and nitnem. Also, she has an ongoing Sahej Path (complete reading of the Siri Guru Granth Sahib broken over a period of time) so thought this would be another great way for her to continue this while she is away from home. </p>
<p>What I thought would be a quick process of putting the nitnem banis on her kindle turned out to be a larger project that took most of last week for myself and Gurujot Singh. I had started with Siri Guru Granth Sahib (original Gurmukhi and English translation) which was tricky since I wanted the pages to match the original Siri Guru Granth Sahib and also had to tackle with the issue of Gurmukhi text not displaying in traditional kindle/ebook formats. We then expanded on the format with some nice floral borders to make it more regal and look similar to the a printed SGGS. One of the days I had to go through all 1430 pages to correct some formatting issues. That was a tough day on my wrists, but the rewards are sweet!</p>
<p><img style="margin-right: 10px" alt="Gurbani Nitnem Bani on Amazon Kindle" src="http://www.sikhnet.com/files/images/2011/screen-capture-both-350.jpg" title="Gurbani Nitnem Bani on Amazon Kindle" class="alignright" align="left" height="454" width="350">With that done we moved into working on Nitnem Banis. There are so many different formats that one could do for banis! Gurmukhi only, Gurmukhi with translation, transliteration, and different combinations of the three together or separate. Gurujot Singh created some beautiful custom floral design patterns that we experimented with for the borders. Since we had to create the files in the PDF format for Gurmukhi to display it was tricky finding the right size and layout to maximize the space on the screen and ensure that full pages displayed on screen. Then we had to spend lot of time adjusting the size of text and breaking the text up into nice readable &quot;chunks&quot; going through each line to ensure that it doesn&#8217;t get broken up and flows nicely when reading. So by this past Friday we were done, and even though we wanted to do more banis and other formats we decided to just stop there and release the files on SikhNet and see how people liked them. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even know how many Sikhs use eBook readers however expect that after today, many more will consider getting their very own &quot;eGurbani Reader&quot;! </p>

<h2>Custom Screen Saver Images for Kindle &amp; other eBook Readers </h2>
<p>As  with any digital device that I get, I like to customize it and tinker to make it more personal. That is part of the fun and making it my own. On the Kindle when you stop reading for a while it switches from displaying your book text to it&#8217;s screen saver mode which displays the standard kindle &quot;screen saver&quot; images. I wish they had made a simple standard method to change these images, but fortunately there is a simple &quot;hack&quot; that you can do to your Kindle to allow you to add your own custom images to display.&nbsp; Whenever someone looks at my Kindle with MY OWN cool custom images, they always ask, &quot;How did you get your own images on the kindle?&quot;. It was very simple to do and only took a few minutes.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/37424/jailbreak-your-kindle-for-dead-simple-screensaver-customization/" title="" target="_blank">Here is how you can &quot;jailbreak&quot; your Kindle. Follow the tutorial here</a>. Once you have done this you can download and copy the screen saver pictures I made on to your Kindle. </p>
</p>
<p>I went through lots of my photos and picked out some that I then optimized for display on the Kindle. I thought you might enjoy downloading some of these to add to your eBook reader if you have one! I left out most of the family pictures that I made and left most of the more general Sikh related ones to share. I doubt you want to have pictures of our family, Narayan and Charanjeet all over your kindle. :) See how nice and portable the e-Reader is?</p>

<p><strong>We often hear people say things like &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not into religion, but I&#8217;m a very spiritual person&#8221; or, &#8220;he&#8217;s really very spiritual.&#8221; But what does it actually mean to &#8220;be spiritual?&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s very simple actually, spirituality is our true nature. That&#8217;s because we <strong>are</strong> spirit. Our bodies fall away, our material possessions fall away, our spouses, children, families and friends fall away. What is it that remains? What is the constant beyond time and space? That is our spirit. It is the essence of the infinite power of our projection and our creativity.</p>
<p>So how do we live in that spirit? Two things are needed: awareness and surrender.</p>
<p>Awareness is also known as Simran: moment to moment remembrance of our true identity &#8211; &#8220;<em>Naam Chit Aavai.</em>&#8221; Through our breath, we remember that we are alive in the ecstasy of being born and dying in each and every moment. The infinite flows through us like electricity. We see and we feel the sacredness in each moment. Who is brushing my teeth? God. Who is speaking? God. Who is listening? God. Who is eating lunch? God. Who is the salad I am eating? It is God eating God. </p>
<p>We train ourselves to awareness through sadhana. We live in awareness through Dharma. What is Dharma? Dharma is nothing but waking up, keeping up and flowing in the will of God. </p>
<p>Then there is surrender. That one is hard for most people. Why should I surrender? To whom should I surrender? How can I trust enough to let go? If I surrender, aren&#8217;t I giving up my unique identity? Who will take care of me if I don&#8217;t do it?</p>
<p>We are trained to go after what we want; to achieve and to be successful. We are neither trained to alert acceptance, nor to being in our own stillness.<em></em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;The Master acts without doing anything and teaches without saying anything. Things arise and she lets them come; things disappear and she lets them go. She has everything but doesn&#8217;t possess anything. She acts, but has no expectations. When her work is done, everyone says, &#8216;we did this all ourselves.&#8221; That is why she lasts forever.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><em>- Tao de Ching</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s where Guru comes in. Guru is the Divine guidance system built-in to every human being. It is the compass in your cockpit and it always points &#8216;true north.&#8217; It is by surrender to that cosmic presence within that the most sacred relationship in our life is established.</p>
<p>Now here comes the problem with religion. Religion itself is no problem. It simply means consciously connecting back to our own origin, to our source. But in organized religions, people have fallen asleep and just go through the motions of surrendering. Without the actual experience of the Guru people ritualize surrendering, but that is not the unconditional surrender that is required for true spirituality. It is in this state of hypocrisy that &#8220;goodness&#8221; and &#8220;piety&#8221; appear.</p>
<p>Surrendering to the Guru without conditions, accepting the Guru as your own, accepting the Guru all around you, accepting the Guru within you and within everyone; that is what is required.</p>
<p>In order for that to happen, you must have a real experience of the Guru. Not an outward show, but that divine, intimate touch that lies beyond words. That experience is unbearably sweet and absolutely personal. That experience comes by grace, and Divine grace is earned through lifetimes of work. </p>
<p>Mostly everyone seeks pleasure and tries to avoid pain. In this state of grace, there is no difference between pleasure and pain, between loss and gain or between obscurity and fame. </p>
<p>Pain wakes us up and pleasure puts us to sleep. It is in times of great pain that we learn to surrender. That is what gives us depth.</p>
<p>Do you want to improve the world? I don&#8217;t think it can be done. The world is sacred. It can&#8217;t be improved. It is absolutely perfect just as it is. Be content with what you have. Rejoice each moment in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing at all lacking, then the whole world belongs to you.</p>
<p>The Guru Granth Sahib says: &#8220;Amidst hope, the yogi remains without hope.&#8221; That is because hope and fear are both phantoms that arise from thinking of the self. When we no longer see the self as self, what do we have to fear or to hope for? There is only now. The past no longer exists and the future is being born right now. It is being born from our own thoughts, words and actions. </p>
<p>See the whole world and everything in it as your self. Have faith in the way things are. Love the world as it is &#8212; for it is your self.</p>
<p>My own personal prayer is very simple. It is the one I say each day as I bow to my Guru:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Beloved Guru Ji, I am Yours and You are mine.<br />     Bless everyone to live healthy, happy and holy.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><strong><font size="3"><em>&quot;Shave your beard or lose your job!&quot;</em> &#8211; Ms. Kelly and Ms. Romero to Sahaj Singh&#8230;</font></strong>    </p>
<p>I remember many years ago <a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2005/06/14/sikhs-ambulance-drivers-espanola-ems/%20" title="" target="_blank">posting on MrSikhNet about some of my friends who are Sikhs and are EMS (Emergency Medical Service) and how Sikhs are being able to work in the mainstream in full form</a>. However, it appears that the current management of the Espa&#241;ola Hospital and Presbyterian Health Services has been failing by fostering a work environment rife with religious discrimination, particularly to Sikhs. </p>
<p> I remember when it seemed that majority of the EMS staff were Sikhs, since they were everywhere driving around Espanola helping people. Now, they are pretty much all gone as a result of this discrimination and other reasons. I often get asked by other Sikhs if I faced discrimination and mostly responded, NO&#8230;.since we live here in a small town and Sikhs have lived here for over 40 years and are well known in the area and with the local governments. I have <a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2007/05/25/interview-with-prabhu-singh-sikh-professional/" title="" target="_blank">posted stories like of Prabhu Singh who works at Los Alamos National Lab</a> and works in full bana. So when I heard from Sahaj Singh and others about these issues I was surprised to hear this was happening. It&#8217;s sad to hear of discrimination in any form and that it was happening right here in little Espanola, New Mexico. </p>
<p>Discrimination is nothing new here. Other Sikhs like Guru Tej Singh Khalsa faced this when trying to work in the police, but was unable to do so because of his turban. The result of this was him starting Akal Security. <a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2005/08/01/job-security-akal-security/" title="" target="_blank">You watch a video and hear his story.</a> This was a long time ago so you would think that we would be beyond this. Apparently not in the medical field! </p>
<p>We take a few steps forward and then some steps back. I think all the Muslim-terrorist phobia of Americans has sparked a lot more discrimination all over America towards Sikhs.&nbsp; At the same time I am <a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2011/05/11/the-reunion/" title="" target="_blank">watching the new film by Angad Bhai called &quot;The Reunion&quot;</a> which is a short telling a story about two friends who share common background and reunite after several years of&nbsp; being apart.&nbsp; One is a Sikh who has cut his hair after being brutalized&nbsp; during a hate crime, and the other has kept his hair since birth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their dialogue deals with issues Sikhs face when trying to assimilate&nbsp; into modern American society, while maintaining their cultural and&nbsp; religious heritage.&nbsp; </p>

</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Sahaj Singh was able to get the help of the New Mexico ACLU and has filed charges with the New Mexico Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against Espa&#241;ola Hospital and Presbyterian Health Services for fostering a work environment rife with religious discrimination and failing to take reasonable measures to rectify the situation.&nbsp; <a href="http://aclu-nm.org/aclu-nm-charges-espanola-hospital-with-religious-discrimination-against-sikh-paramedic/2011/05/" title="" target="_blank">You can read the news story by them which is currently featured on their home page.</a> <br />   </strong></p>

<p style="background-color: #ffff99"><font size="3"><strong>Below you can read Sahaj Khalsa&#8217;s full affidavit about the type of discrimination going on towards many of the Sikhs working for the Espanola Hospital (Presbyterian Health Services)</strong></font></p>
<h1>AFFIDAVIT OF SAHAJ KHALSA </h1>
<p><strong>My name is Sahaj Khalsa and I am 35 years old.&nbsp; </strong>I have been subject to an illegal and hostile work environment at the Espanola Hospital and retaliation for reporting the same.&nbsp; I was employed by Presbyterian Health Services1 as a Paramedic and Field Operations Supervisor from September 2001 to December 2010.&nbsp; I am a practicing Sikh, was born a Sikh, and have maintained all of the tenets of the Sikh faith since birth.&nbsp; One of the tenets of Sikhism is maintaining uncut hair, including beards.&nbsp; As a result, I have never shaved or cut my hair.2 My hair is tied up and contained in a turban, which is also an article of my faith.&nbsp; All of the concerns set forth below are centered on discrimination that I faced in the work environment as a result of my sincerely held religious beliefs and Presbyterian&#8217;s failure to take reasonable measures to rectify the situation, despite my numerous complaints to Human Resources.</p>
<p>           In between 2000-2001, then Espanola Ambulance Manager, Dennis Cronin, hired multiple Sikh paramedics.&nbsp; Until recently, there were five bearded Sikh employees who all worked at Espanola Ambulance (&#8220;EA&#8221;) for Presbyterian.&nbsp; Collectively, Sikh employees have served Presbyterian and the people of Northern New Mexico for over 45 years.&nbsp; As a group, Sikhs have an exemplary work record and have provided excellent care to the people in need.&nbsp; This relationship benefited patients, the Sikh employees, and Presbyterian.</p>
<p>           Regrettably, something has changed, and Sikhs are no longer welcome as Presbyterian employees.&nbsp; In 2007 or 2008, former Presbyterian employee Siri Khalsa applied to be the Operations Director for EVEMS.&nbsp; Josh Duran, an EMT-Intermediate, told Siri Khalsa that if Siri Khalsa was hired none of the employees, except Sikh employees, would listen to him.&nbsp; From 2008 to 2009, David Payne, the Operations Director hired instead of Siri Khalsa, created unusual working schedules so that certain employees could avoid working with Sikh employees.&nbsp; And the most notable shift toward the intolerance of Sikh employees began when Brenda Romero (&#8220;Ms.&nbsp; Romero&#8221;) replaced Derrick Yu as hospital administrator in the middle of 2009.3 </p>
<p><font size="1">1 I worked for Espanola Ambulance which is affiliated with Espanola Valley Emergency Medical Services (&#8220;EVEMS&#8221;) and Espanola Hospital, but all entities are under Presbyterian Health Services and will be referred to as &#8220;Presbyterian&#8221;, unless the distinction is warranted.<br />            2 With the exception that my beard was shaved once when I required surgery.<br />            3 The pattern of discrimination against Sikhs became particularly apparent when Ms. Romero became hospital administrator.&nbsp; Some examples follow: In October 2009 a Sikh employee was forced to resign for failing to write patient care reports, while, in stark contrast, Presbyterian afforded other non-Sikh employees who had made the same mistake the opportunity to submit patient care forms months after supervisors discovered that they too had not submitted the appropriate reports.&nbsp; Employees in Presbyterian&#8217;s payroll department have referred to &#8220;all of the Sikhs&#8221; and &#8220;all of the Khalsas&#8221; working too much.&nbsp; Also, another Sikh employee&#8217;s vehicle has been keyed repeatedly while it was parked at work, causing significant damage.&nbsp; This particular employee raised this issue with hospital administration, and the administration refused to take action.&nbsp; No other vehicles have suffered similar damage while parked at work.&nbsp; More recently, raises were provided for all EVEMS employees across the board with the exception of a small number of employees.&nbsp; Incredibly the only two remaining Sikhs, a female Sikh employee, Dhyana Velasco (formerly Dhyana Khalsa), and I were among the few employees who did not receive the raises.</font>            </p>
<p>Over the past few years, Sikh employees endured derogatory comments in the workplace about their religion, management&#8217;s inattention to and facilitation of the discrimination, and management&#8217;s repeated requests, turned threats for the male Sikh employees to shave their beards.&nbsp; In the face of this brash discrimination, one by one, the Sikh employees have either left or been forced to resign.&nbsp; As a result, from April 2010 to November 2010, before I was forcibly discharged, I was the lone bearded Sikh employee who worked at EA; and predictably, my experience was no different than my other Sikh former co-workers&#8217;.</p>
<p>            I first brought my concerns about discrimination and a hostile work environment to Presbyterian Human Resource Officer, Kim Kelly (&#8220;Ms.&nbsp; Kelly&#8221;), in late May or early June 2009, after a staff meeting.&nbsp; In that discussion, I apprised Ms. Kelly of the following: some employees were unwilling to work with Sikhs and had changed their shifts to avoid Sikhs, and a previous director, David Payne, even directed a third ambulance be scheduled so individuals would not have to work with Sikh employees.&nbsp; I also reported that I heard that employees in the Albuquerque Human Resources and Payroll offices had made comments regarding &#8220;all the Sikhs&#8221; and &#8220;all the Khalsas&#8221;4 working too much.</p>
<p>           Instead of investigating my specific concerns as required by Presbyterian policy, Ms. Kelly merely responded by attending&#8212;along with Maria Hidalgo (&#8220;Ms.&nbsp; Hildalgo&#8221;), also from Human Resources&#8212;three staff meetings to remind all employees in general terms of Presbyterian&#8217;s anti-discrimination policy.&nbsp; Since those meetings, the environment at Presbyterian continued to deteriorate.</p>
<p>           The hostility and discrimination against me came to a head on or about February 12, 2010.&nbsp; While I was the supervisor on duty, a Presbyterian employee threatened, verbally abused, and physically assaulted me.&nbsp; The co-worker&#8217;s threats included statements directed at my religion.&nbsp; This incident was reported via email to Dennis Martinez (&#8220;Mr.&nbsp; Martinez&#8221;), my supervisor, and to Ms. Kelly.&nbsp; I again raised the issue of a hostile work environment in this email.</p>
<p>           Ms. Kelly did conduct an investigation of this incident.&nbsp; However, even though Ms. Kelly substantiated the wrongful conduct by the employee who attacked me, Presbyterian did not terminate the employee, and Ms. Kelly outrageously condoned the other employee&#8217;s behavior in comments to me.</p>
<p>           In early 2010, when Human Resources finally launched an investigation into the general allegations of a hostile work environment during which they interviewed many, if not all, of the EA employees, per Ms. Kelly, the investigation revealed that discrimination in this work environment was widespread.</p>
<p>           As a result of the investigation, on March 26, 2010, Ms. Kelly and Ms. Romero convened a meeting with all EA employees.&nbsp; The supposed intent of this meeting was to &#8220;set a new day&#8221; and inform everyone that discrimination and unequal treatment of any minority would be unacceptable.&nbsp; However, Ms. Kelly and Ms. Romero outrageously used the &#8220;new day&#8221; to fortify discrimination against Sikhs and retaliate against me for having made complaints of discrimination.&nbsp; During the meeting, many new policies were announced regarding scheduling, daily duties, acceptable behavior, and employee uniforms.&nbsp; The uniform policy included a provision that per OSHA policy, facial hair would no longer be allowed.&nbsp; After I inquired as to how the new policy on facial hair would affect me, because I knew Presbyterian had to make a reasonable attempt to accommodate my sincerely held religious beliefs and the integrity of my religious facial hair, Ms. Kelly and Ms. Romero told me to shave my beard or lose my job.&nbsp; This announcement was made in front of the majority of EA employees who I was expected to supervise.&nbsp; And again, although Ms. Kelly had substantiated instances of discrimination in the workplace, she failed to take any disciplinary actions against those employees responsible for the hostile work environment.</p>
<p>           My co-workers were emboldened by management&#8217;s ratification of discrimination against Sikhs; and after the meeting on March 26, 2010, the environment at work worsened considerably for me.&nbsp; Some employees clearly treated me differently, whereas others avoided speaking to me.&nbsp; It is little wonder, given administration&#8217;s public announcement that I was no longer welcome at Presbyterian unless he shaved his beard.&nbsp; My sincerely held beliefs were belittled even further by Ms. Kelly when she approached two non-practicing Sikh employees, Guru Dham Khalsa and Guru Bahdur Khalsa,5 and asked them about the meaning of a Sikh cutting his hair and/or shaving.&nbsp; Guru Dham Khalsa attempted to explain to her the religious significance of this practice, as he understood it, and Ms. Kelly responding by asking him if anything &#8220;physically&#8221; happened to Guru Dham Khalsa when he decided to cut his hair.6 In response to Ms. Kelly and Ms. Romero&#8217;s March 26, 2010 ultimatum, I proposed a reasonable solution that would allow me to continue to do my work and respect my sincerely held religious beliefs by offering to wear a Positive Air Powered Respirator (&#8220;PAPR&#8221;).&nbsp; A PAPR is a mask that covers the face more extensively and is more conducive for a person with facial hair to use than the standard N-95 mask.&nbsp; At first, Ms. Kelly and Mr. Martinez refused to consider a PAPR as a solution.</p>
<p>           I followed up with Ms. Kelly, Ms. Romero, Mr. Martinez, and Dr. Bajema (the service medical director) about the prospect of using a PAPR, and they detailed the following concerns:</p>
<p>           1. It would take too long to put on.<br />            2. It would require two people to put on.<br />            3. It would prevent me from using a stethoscope while wearing it.</p>
<p>           These concerns made it clear to me that none of them had actually seen a PAPR even though I knew that Espanola Hospital had four PAPRs abandoned in a storage space located in a garage.&nbsp; After I explained that their concerns were unwarranted, they eventually agreed to a test of a PAPR to see if it would provide protection and allow me to care for patients.&nbsp; At this time, Mr. Martinez sent an email out to staff announcing that implementation of the facial hair prohibition in the uniform policy would be delayed.</p>
<p>           I retrieved a PAPR from the storage closet and had to clean the PAPR because it was covered in dust.&nbsp; Administrators did not know of the existence of the four PAPRs in an Espanola Hospital storage space.&nbsp; In fact, very few employees knew of the existence of the PAPRs as there was never any training, planning, or instruction on the use of PAPRs in case of an emergency.&nbsp; I submitted to the PAPR test on April 2, 2010 in the presence of Dr. Bajema, Mr. Martinez and EVEMS employees.</p>
<p>           Per a memo Dr. Bajema wrote immediately following the test, I was able to don the PAPR in 26 seconds, do it alone, and the PAPR did not hinder the use of a stethoscope.&nbsp; This memo was sent to Mr. Martinez, Ms. Kelly, Ms. Romero, and me.&nbsp; Given the clear efficacy of the PAPR, it seemed as if this situation had been resolved.&nbsp; Initially, when I informed administrators about the PAPRs in the storage space there was not a problem with my use of the on-hand PAPR and it seemed to be a perfect resolution.&nbsp; However, in a meeting on Thursday, April 8, 2010 Ms. Kelly again stated the policy was no facial hair and &#8220;if [Mr.&nbsp; Khalsa] chooses to have facial hair, he chooses not to work here.&#8221; During this period, Ms. Kelly and Ms. Romero also retaliated against me for reporting religious discrimination.&nbsp; On or about May 5, 2010, Mr. Martinez allegedly wrote me up for missing a meeting that had been scheduled on such short notice I did not have time to rearrange my schedule so that I could attend.&nbsp; Later, however, Mr. Martinez disclosed the true motivation for the write-up, explaining that Ms. Romero and Ms. Kelly had pressured him to write me up because they were angry that I sent a letter to administration detailing frustrations with the treatment of Sikhs at Presbyterian.&nbsp; And Mr. Martinez implied that I would have never been written up if I had not sent the letter complaining of discrimination.&nbsp; Mr. Martinez went on to add that he knew how I felt because he was once discriminated against at the Los Alamos Fire Department as one of the few Hispanics who worked there, and he advised me to &#8220;keep [my] head down and do [my] job and [the discrimination] would go away.&#8221; For months, I worked with the threat of termination hanging over me.&nbsp; Suddenly and inexplicably, management informed me that it had reversed its &#8220;no facial hair&#8221; policy, but the on-hand PAPRs were for emergency room use only, and I would have to purchase my own PAPR at a cost of at least $800.00. This offer was made in direct contrast of what I understand OSHA policy to be, which is that an employer must provide all necessary respiratory equipment.&nbsp; My facial hair is fundamental to my religion and a PAPR, in this instance, is necessary to accommodate my beard.&nbsp; Although Presbyterian offered to set up a payment plan in order to assist me in the costly purchase, this offer was wholly insufficient given the remarkable history of discrimination and retaliation against me, including the recent insistence that I shave my beard, and Presbyterian&#8217;s complete failure to discipline those responsible for the discrimination.&nbsp; This offer served as yet another insult in a long line and convinced me that Presbyterian had no intention of truly addressing religious discrimination in the workplace.</p>
<p>           Since I put to rest the concerns surrounding the use of a PAPR it became clear that management is motivated by a discriminatory purpose rather than safety concerns.&nbsp; First, I was told I had to 5 cut my beard or lose my job.&nbsp; When provided with a reasonable alternative to accommodate my sincerely held religious beliefs, human resources fabricated concerns with the use of the PAPR.&nbsp; After demonstrating that the use of a PAPR would not impede my job duties, human resources introduced a new impediment to my continued employment and demanded that I purchase expensive equipment.&nbsp; I worked competently as an upstanding paramedic at Presbyterian for nine years with a beard and a respirator that was adequate for every prior administration, and it is clear that this new requirement was imposed to discriminate and retaliate against me.</p>
<p>           Given Presbyterian management ignored numerous and ongoing disparaging remarks about Sikhs.&nbsp; Supervisors acknowledged religious discrimination, failed to adequately investigate complaints of religious discrimination, and took no corrective action.&nbsp; Management ignored vandalism of Sikh employee property and implemented policies targeting Sikh employees.&nbsp; Supervisors retaliated against me for reporting discrimination.&nbsp; And, after all of the other Sikh employees had been fired or left, Presbyterian repeatedly told me that if I did not shave my beard or purchase expensive equipment to accommodate my beard I would be terminated.&nbsp; The environment at Presbyterian was so intolerable that I was forced to resign.</p>

<p><em>&quot;The Reunion&quot; is a short film co-produced, co-directed, co-written, and photographed by the Russell Brothers Company and Angad Singh Bhai. It tells a story about two friends who share common background and reunite after several years of&nbsp; being apart.&nbsp; One is a Sikh (played by Kunal Shah) who has cut his hair after being brutalized&nbsp; during a hate crime, and the other (played by Angad Bhai) has kept his hair since birth.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their dialogue deals with issues Sikhs face when trying to assimilate&nbsp; into modern American society, while maintaining their cultural and&nbsp; religious heritage.</em></p>
<p>Aside from the beautiful video production quality of this film, I love that it was very real and relevant to modern times. Much of the dialog of the characters discussed real issues and questions that might be asked about having the outward identity of a Sikh and standing out vs. not. I love the subtle metaphors of back and forth between the characters as they talk to each other and make their back and forth arguments while also playing chess.&nbsp; I think this film will also be interested to non-Sikhs as well and serve to create a bit more understanding about a Sikh and our identity. Great job Angad and Russel Brothers! I hope you work on more projects like this which will serve to educate mainstream as well as inspire and support Sikh Youth going through these challenges and questions themselves (Sikh men AND women).&nbsp;        &nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>Motivation and Influences</strong></font> <br />   <em>&quot;I thought it might be interesting to mention things that have influenced this film.&nbsp; A big one is my grandfather (<a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Yogi_Bhajan" title="" target="_blank">SSS Harbhajan Singh Khalsa Yogiji</a>), who always told me &quot;keep up and you will be kept up.&quot; Those are words that helped us get through the grueling process of filmmaking with all its mishaps, expenses, and obstacles. They are also words that some of the characters in the film embody.</p>
<p>               Another big influence is Dostoevsky&#8217;s &quot;Notes from the Underground,&quot; which he wrote while freezing in the dungeon of a Siberian work camp. The protagonist longs for friendship but sabotages himself by pretending like he doesn&#8217;t need anyone. Strangely, he takes pride in his voluntary alienation so that I didn&#8217;t really know what to think of him: he is too pathetic to hate and too willful to pity. &quot;The Reunion&quot; is an attempted answer to the vacuous nihilism that Dostoevsky explores. Authentic friendship is very important in a society that digitizes the self and forces us to traffic in representation, rather than allow us to see and accept one another wholly, flaws and all.&quot;</em>&nbsp; &#8211; <strong>Angad Bhai</strong>   </p>

<p>A Question was asked by someone about him having spiritual experiences and why he doesn&#8217;t have this kind of experience more often since he can&#8217;t get back to having that same experience again. Guruka Singh talks about this and also about the pitfalls of expectations.</p>
<p>  <strong>The question was asked:</strong> <em>I&#8217;m not amritdhari, but the first time I came to the gurus shrine (Gurdwara), I experienced an amazing experience, I felt this amazing bliss. Now it&#8217;s been almost 8 months and nothing like that has ever happened again, even though I have increased my simran and nitnem from before. I feel discouraged, what do you think I am lacking? Is it amrit? Was that experience just a preview to get my attention?</em></p>

<h2>from <em>Success and the Spirit &#8211; An Aquarian path to Abundance</em></h2>
<h3>by Siri Singh Sahib Bhai Sahib Harbhajan Singh Khalsa Yogiji </h3>
<p>A student asked Yogi Bhajan the following question:</p>
<p> &quot;Is giving an act of God?&quot;</p>
<p> Yogi Bhajan replied, &quot;No, no, no, no. Not at all. It is a perfectly selfish act. Have you heard about when I became rich? Listen to this. It  is true. Verbatim, this is exactly true.</p>
<p> I taught a class at the East-West Cultural Center. And I did a wonderful  job. There were three hundred and some dollars collected at class. I do  not know exactly how much. But I definitely know one hundred fifty and some cents were given to me in an envelope as my fifty percent of that lecture. This is what they do. You go. They advertise you. You teach in that center. And whatever money comes in on that day, fifty percent is given to the lecturer and fifty percent goes to the center.</p>
<p> I did that. Then the director of the center takes the speaker out to dinner. Now this lady, the director, was more spiritual, well-read with the scripture and much wiser than I was. I was very happy with her and she was extremely happy with me, because when she would talk scriptures,  somewhere along the line, I&#8217;d give her the understanding of the scripture. I&#8217;m not very good with all this bookish knowledge but certain  things I just know.</p>
<p> She said, &quot;Today your lecture was so pleasing. I just want to take you to eat. Please come with me.&quot; She was just overwhelmingly joyful.</p>
<p> I said to her, &quot;Well, there seems to be a storm behind the sunshine.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;What can it be?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;We&#8217;ll see.&quot;</p>
<p> When we came to the restaurant, on the side there was a pole. Standing beside the pole was a very beautiful, well-dressed black man. And he was  saying, &#8220;I do not want to beg, and I don&#8217;t want you to help me, but I have children. I have a life, and I have a family. I am selling these pencils. You can buy these pencils for any amount, because I am blind and can&#8217;t see it. But I hope by the end of the day there will be a profit and I can take care of my family.&quot;</p>
<p> When I heard that I handed over my envelope to him and I took one pencil  out. She saw me doing that and God, that divine woman became a living fire. She said, &quot;What have you done? You know, that&#8217;s what Indians do. You have encouraged beggary.&quot; She was so rude.</p>
<p> I said, &#8220;Ohhhhh!&#8221; That was my first experience, awakening the mind to encounter the bitchiness of an American woman. Up until then I was fine.</p>
<p> I said, &quot;What have I done?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You took one pencil for one hundred and fifty dollars. Do you know that you can get a truckload of them?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don&#8217;t need a truckload of pencils.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Why did you take one pencil?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I want this one pencil to write my own fortune.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;And you paid one-hundred and fifty dollars for it?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No. I paid much less. I paid nothing.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;I don&#8217;t understand you. You don&#8217;t like money. You don&#8217;t love money.&quot;</p>
<p> I said, &quot;I love money more than you like it. I love money. Don&#8217;t worry about that. I just wanted this pencil to write my fortune. I paid the money you gave to me.&quot;</p>
<p> She said, &quot;I can&#8217;t believe it.&quot;<br />    <img src="http://www.sikhdharma.org/files/images/Restaruant.jpg" alt="Restaurant" height="187" hspace="3" vspace="3" width="250" align="right"></p>
<p> Meanwhile, we entered the restaurant. Then you know what she said? She said, &quot;All right. I&#8217;ll teach you something practical.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p> &quot;Sure.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p> &quot;I&#8217;m not going to pay for your dinner.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p> &quot;Sure.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;That will show you what happens when you don&#8217;t have money.&quot;</p>
<p> I said, &quot;Sure. It&#8217;s okay.&quot;</p>
<p> So I took my plate to the place where you pick up your salad, and you pick up this and that and I picked up everything I wanted to eat. I walked to the tables and the lady at the check-out counter said, &quot;Thank you, sir.&quot; She never says that. I just went up there, took the things of  the tray, and put them on the table. We were about three or four people  and when the director came, the counter clerk told her, &quot;Thank you, ma&#8217;am. You can pass.&quot;</p>
<p> She said, &quot;Who paid for it?&quot;</p>
<p> The clerk said, &quot;It is all paid for.&quot;</p>
<p> So, she felt a little small and she came and sat down next to me. Meanwhile, the counter girl came and brought sixty-some dollars and gave  it to me. Imagine. I didn&#8217;t have a pocket. I didn&#8217;t have a dollar. I didn&#8217;t have a penny. She told me that she isn&#8217;t going to pay and I said to the counter clerk, &quot;Give it to her.&quot;</p>
<p> The clerk said, &quot;No, no. It is for you, sir. It is for you.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Why for me?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;There was a student of yours sitting here. He left me with a hundred dollars and he said, &#8216;My teacher is coming. All the people with him should be paid for, and the balance given to him.&#8217; So I am just doing what he said.&quot;</p>
<p> I looked at the director. I said, &quot;You didn&#8217;t pay for it?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;You got paid for, too?&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p> I said, &quot;See how God works?&quot; And I pulled out ten dollars and I gave it to the waitress.</p>
<p> She said, &quot;O my God. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.&quot;</p>
<p> And I gave the director the fifty-some remaining dollars.</p>
<p> She asked me, &quot;What for? I don&#8217;t understand. You seem so happy.&quot;</p>
<p> I said, &quot;Today, my Guru and my God have made me a giver. Before this, I was a taker. I was at your mercy. And when you tested it, Guru came through. He saved me at the last minute. I am very mad at Him for that. But because He always does it, I am very grateful. I have seen my Guru. I  have seen Him in action. I am grateful.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="subHeader"></span><strong><em>by Siri Singh Sahib Harbhajan Singh Khalsa Yogiji<br />   </em></strong><a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran" title="" target="_blank"><span class="subHeader">Article from &quot;Beads of Truth&quot; magazine, Fall 1980, #5</span></a><strong><br />   </strong>   </p>
<p><img src="http://www.sikhdharma.org/files/images/Discovering/BoTCoverFall80sm.jpg" alt="Beads of Truth - Fall 80" height="323" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="250" align="right">There is a great tragedy going on today. People who have never done simran<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn1" title="_ednref1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>,  who have not experienced simran, who have not reached an acknowledged state of simran, they talk about simran. Simran is not japa<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn2" title="_ednref2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>. Japa gives the power of simran. Japa is the repetition of the Holy Naam<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn3" title="_ednref3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a>, Meditation is not simran. Meditation gives you the power of simran. Yoga, Raaj Yoga<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn4" title="_ednref4" name="_ednref4">[4]</a> is not simran. Raaj Yoga is a technology to achieve, receive and conceive the simran. Sahaj Yoga<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn5" title="_ednref5" name="_ednref5">[5]</a>  is not simran. Sahaj Yoga is a concept through which you can pursue simran. Prayer is not simran. Prayer gives you the power so that your mind can be set for simran.</p>
<p> <span id="more-48206"></span>
<p>&nbsp;When the state of consciousness reaches simran then you do not need to do anything; God follows you. At that stage the Almighty, the Infinite, the Omniscient, the Omnipotent God, the Something which you are so proud  of, and which you talk about and you perceive about and scriptures talk  about and saints and sages sing about, that entire Universal Power is totally looking towards the teeny, tiny individual. That is simran for which Guru Arjan sang: </p>
<p><em>Simarao simar simar sukh paauao </em></p>
<p><em>Kal kales tan maa-ai mitaaoao. <a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn6" title="_ednref6" name="_ednref6"><strong>[6]</strong></a></em></p>
<p><em>(To the one who meditates on Him there comes a perfect peace, And all pain and sorrows depart.) </em></p>
<p> This is hypocrisy of simran where some people want to sing Gurbaanee because of ego. And some people get up in the morning and say, &quot;Wahe Guru, Wahe Guru, Wahe Guru,&quot; and they think they have got the whole world in the palm of their hand. Now, these are symptoms of spiritual ego, and in the entire scripture of yoga there is one definition that states that you can do anything you want, but you should never have a spiritual ego. Out of all the ways that ego can manifest the most dangerous ego is spiritual.</p>
<p> You have seen in the world that normally people who are experts in a certain aspect of life &#8211; like a doctor, an attorney, an executive, a business person, all those who have worked hard in one profession &#8211; you will often find them very much in pain. They are very successful in one aspect of life and very unsuccessful in the other aspect of life. You will find there is not a balance, because the earthly balance and spiritual balance is not there, and that man can never be happy. It doesn&#8217;t matter what you belong to, it doesn&#8217;t matter who you are, it doesn&#8217;t matter what your intentions are. The purpose to live happily is to understand the deep flow of spirituality. And you have to be firm in it. This flow has to be constant.</p>
<p> Some people you may know in a daily way of life are very fanatic. They will love you, respect you, and they are with you and then afterward they&#8217;re all &quot;blown out,&quot; &quot;burnt out.&quot; Their flow is gone, the life is gone, the respect is gone, that adherence is gone, that continuity is gone. This speculative behavior is not in any way, form, and shape, a symptom of spiritual flow. Spiritual flow is just like a river: anything  can be taken out of it, it still continues. And that flow comes out of simran.</p>
<p> Simran is a continuous, meditative, longingly creative feeling. It&#8217;s a feeling, it&#8217;s a flow, it is a touch, it is a substance. &quot;<em>Ang Sang Wahe Guru</em>&quot; (God is with me through every limb, every millimeter, every situation of mine.)</p>
<p> Sikh Dharma is not going to spread because of you or because of me. Don&#8217;t have any misunderstanding.</p>
<p> This planet is going to go through changes where insanity shall rule. On  this earth a period is going to come when insanity shall rule. At that moment Sikh Dharma shall be the way out from that tyranny of insanity. We are trying to tell people that whatever time we have got at our disposal we should just live in a state of consciousness which is divine. I have heard many people quoting:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Kal yug maih keenan pardhaanaa.&quot; </em><br />    In Kal yug, keertan is the president. <a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn7" title="_ednref7" name="_ednref7"><strong>[7]</strong></a></p>
<p> &quot;Pardhaanaa&quot; means president. But if our president doesn&#8217;t have any army, he doesn&#8217;t have a cabinet, he doesn&#8217;t have a White House, where is  he going to go?</p>
<p> Kundalini Yoga is the Yoga of Awareness, it&#8217;s the union of God. It is a short route to achieve a state where you can enjoy keertan. There are twenty-two types of yoga. I&#8217;m not saying any yoga is wrong, but the only  advantage of Kundalini Yoga is that it takes ninety days. It has the shortest effective time limit. If it has been prescribed for a yogi to achieve a state of balanced equilibrium or applied intelligence, that comes through Kundalini Yoga. But I am not saying right now that in ninety days all of you can achieve that. Ninety days are prescribed for that person who&#8217;s perfect in constitution, who&#8217;s perfect in metabolism, who is perfect in devotion. It applies to a normal human being, not an abnormal, subconscious or obnoxious human being. Kundalini Yoga is not for neurotics, psychotics, and idiots. It makes the idiot a human being first, and then a human being a &quot;gurumukh.<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn8" title="_ednref8" name="_ednref8">[8]</a>&quot;  It&#8217;s a way, it&#8217;s a science, it&#8217;s a technology. If you don&#8217;t want to use  it, don&#8217;t use it. Then your glandular system will confuse itself. The glands are the guardians of your health, and without this balancing effort your behavior will fall apart. Don&#8217;t do this yoga, and if you will not become sick and revert back to your normal, imbalanced state of  mind, you can come and grab me.</p>
<p> You&#8217;re making a mockery! Something was given to you as a divine gift from the Guru&#8217;s house, it was from the house of Guru Ram Das, the house of Raaj Yog. Raaj Yog, and Kundalini Yoga, the yoga of Chardee Kalaa, are not different. So it was given to you, but some of you insulted it. You didn&#8217;t use it! You didn&#8217;t make it a part of your life so that it can  keep you as a balanced human and from a balanced human you can go to the state of sanmukh<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn9" title="_ednref9" name="_ednref9">[9]</a>, gurmukh, and then you can reach the stage of simran. It&#8217;s a privilege.</p>
<p>I am willing to challenge the entire planet earth and any wise person and anybody who knows anything about gurmat<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn10" title="_ednref10" name="_ednref10">[10]</a>,  And I want you to challenge everybody because firmness is a blessing. It is a base, it gives you a foundation. You are talking from a state of  mind which is engrossed in maya. I am not talking from a state which is  related to maya. If you are rich, there are people more rich. If you are great, there are people who are more great. If you have six children, somebody has eight. If this is your sixth wife, somebody is marrying tomorrow for the eighth time. You are of no value. You have no firmness, you have no humility. As Americans you have not yet learned what is bhaanaa<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn11" title="_ednref11" name="_ednref11">[11]</a>,  You have not learned obedience. Law of obedience is the law of command.  In our western social structure the law of obedience doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p><em>Halach palach saglee moee, lhoot Dhandahi Moh<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn12" title="_ednref12" name="_ednref12"><strong>[12]</strong></a><br />    </em></p>
<p><em>All shall die, all shall go away doing and loving the wrong things, wrong aspects of life. </em></p>
<p> The real aspect of life is pure, it is pure crystal, it is clear and it is absolutely in its own element.</p>
<p><em>Cur kee mat tooin leh iaane. Bhagat binaa baho doobe siaane.<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn13" title="_ednref13" name="_ednref13"><strong>[13]</strong></a><br />    </em></p>
<p><em>Oh innocent! If you think you are innocent, take the advice of the Guru: Without bhagati (devotional love) a lot of wise people have drowned themselves. </em></p>
<p> Why should wise people drown themselves? Because they have the ego they&#8217;re wise. It is ego to think you are wise. Nobody is wise. The Doer does everything.</p>
<p> We are very blessed. We may not know it, but I tell you today why we are blessed. In Siri Guru Granth Sahib<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn14" title="_ednref14" name="_ednref14">[14]</a>  every aspect of our human life has been addressed, discussed and directions given. This direction given to the mind is not direction to you. That&#8217;s the only difference which you do not understand. Siri Guru Granth does not direct you, it directs your mind and you have to have a control of your mind; your neutral mind, your positive mind, your negative mind. The trinity of mind should be under your control. Now what is the method you have got? The method to control the trinity of mind is called Kundalini Yoga. You are not born as a Sikh so that you have to be a Sikh just to carry on the family tradition. You are reborn!  Therefore you have to understand the very essence of the way of life.</p>
<p><em>Naam ke dhaare sagale ant<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn15" title="_ednref15" name="_ednref15"><strong>[15]</strong></a></em></p>
<p><em>By the Naam all beings are sustained. </em></p>
<p> Naam is not what you think. Some of you are so confused. Some people are  reciting Naam with the breath, some people are doing it with a niolee<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn16" title="_ednref16" name="_ednref16">[16]</a>.  I knew a yogi in India, he would chant the Naam while doing niolee kriya. I knew a person who could create any sound in the very rib cage. You go and listen to any mantra you want. I don&#8217;t tell you the things I have seen. I have seen marvelous things, but to me it is all a circus. Everything is a circus. But beyond the circus there is a stage of continuity. It is a continuous state of fulfillment, where the lasting inflow of the spirit comes in and the everlasting flow of the spirit goes out. It is a state, it is a blue lagoon, it&#8217;s a peace lagoon. There  is peace. In that peace there is tolerance, there is an acceptance of the Will of God, there is the obedience, and there is a tremendous amount of patience.</p>
<p> What God did is God created the human being and told him to go on the earth and to just look after maya and maya would look after him. So the human being came here for an average of sixty-five years. For the first twenty years the human doesn&#8217;t understand who he is or she is and after sixty years he does not know what is going to happen to him. Between twenty and sixty is about forty years. So for the sake of this little period of forty years, God is forgotten and maya overtakes him. I have seen people who are neurotic or chaotic. They create chaos. If you send them someplace they are not happy there, they want to be someplace else.  They run after that scent like a musk deer, who has musk right in his own navel, and they want to find peace somewhere else.</p>
<p> I was shocked when I saw somebody pick up the telephone and slam the receiver on the stand. That bang is still in my ear. And I asked the lady, &quot;What did this telephone receiver do to you? How did it harm you? What language did this receiver speak that you have taken it and banged it on the stand. What for?&quot; No, it is not the telephone, it is the anger  inside. It&#8217;s the imbalance inside. And to reach the balance, simran is the stage of consciousness. It is started humbly. Humbly, you progress to that humble stage for which Guru Gobind Singh is responsible, to that  stage for which Guru Nanak is responsible. For that progress Guru Nanak  gave the mantra &quot;Sat Naam,&quot; because it is a panj (five syllable) shabd.  So, in who&#8217;s destiny it is not written that he can be holy, he can be divine, he can have patience, who can do it? That is why we hear and feel.</p>
<p><em>Virle ke-ee ke<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn17" title="_ednref17" name="_ednref17"><strong>[17]</strong></a></em></p>
<p><em>They are few and far between</em>.</p>
<p> We have a technology in which we can raise the dormant energy within our  own self. It doesn&#8217;t matter who we are. We can raise the dormant energy, and we can live an aware life. There are many people who are hung up on sex. There are many who are hung up on the body. There are many hung up on ego. And there will continue to be many and they will always continue to exist through all times. But that&#8217;s not the end of the world. There are some very beautiful people. There are people who give, there are people who tolerate, there are people who love, there are people who are mighty. There are people who are young and innocent and they can still sing, &quot;We are the Khalsa<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn18" title="_ednref18" name="_ednref18">[18]</a>,&quot;  Mighty, mighty Khalsa. Everywhere we go people want to know who we are,  so we tell them.&quot; They are also children. They are the children of God.  If this state of consciousness will continue, they are the ones who shall be followed everywhere by God. Corruption is corruption, and corruption can eat up anybody and everybody. But Khalsa is born and Khalsa shall live!</p>
<p> That mighty, mighty Khalsa is not a dream any more. It exists. And there  are some divine mothers who know the technology of the Khalsa. And there are some divine mothers who will sacrifice everything, and they will nurse the Khalsa. That&#8217;s the job of the Khalsa Council. That is the  job of the Panth Khalsa. That&#8217;s the job of everyone who believes, feels, and understands that Khalsa is born and it is their job to nurse this Khalsa. That is what Simran means. </p>
<p> My divine majesty today is not mine. It is a state of consciousness. I wonder why you can&#8217;t get there. It is so simple. Your husband cannot give it to you, your mother can not give it to you, your father cannot give it to you, your brother cannot give it to you. Money cannot give it  to you. Possessions cannot give it to you, your spiritual rituals cannot give it to you, your spiritual rites cannot give it to you. It is  a state of gratitude, and it is a relationship between a human and God.</p>
<p> I want to share with you because I experience it all the time, that when  these hyenas and wolves in the body of male or female bite on my skin and their ugly long teeth go deep into my bones, at that time if I don&#8217;t  cry it&#8217;s because:</p>
<p><em>Teraa keeaa meetaa laagai Naam padhaarat Nanak maangai<a href="http://www.sikhdharma.org/pages/simran?page=0%2C3#_edn18" title="_ednref18" name="_ednref18"><strong>[18]</strong></a><br />    </em></p>
<p><em>Thy Will is sweet to me, 0 Lord Nanak asks only for the treasure of the Naam. </em></p>
<p> I feel pleased, I feel happy, and it doesn&#8217;t matter. Their unfortunate plight is their unfortunate plight. Because of Guru&#8217;s Grace they&#8217;re walking towards the Guru&#8217;s gate. So it is my pleasure, it is my happiness. I&#8217;ve no relationship with you. I&#8217;ve not come here to create relationships. I don&#8217;t belong to you. Neither you belong to me. I&#8217;m just  a messenger, a passerby, who while passing is just letting you know who  you are. So you tell them, &quot;We are the Khalsa, mighty, mighty Khalsa, everywhere we go, people want to know&#8230;&quot; and I&#8217;m just telling you what people want to know.</p>
<p> It&#8217;s not my trip. It&#8217;s a simple thing. And there is no sacrifice more divine than that. And there is no meditation more divine than that. And there is no yoga more divine than that. And there is no simran more divine than that, as when a little child can stand out and as a little person, can be in such an aware state of consciousness, being just a seven-year-old, or a nine-year-old. Then there is a standard.</p>
<p> Listen to me, you egomaniacs! Listen to me, fools! Please listen to me! Out of my life I&#8217;m telling you: a standard has been set! The two young sons of Guru Gobind Singh were seven and nine years old when they were bricked alive, and still they could say, &quot;There is One God, One Father and we are all His children.&quot; And they could smile.</p>
<p> It surprises me when I&#8217;m speaking to some young kid, and when I ask his age, I hear the reply as &quot;sixteen&quot;. I feel that when I was sixteen-and-a-half I was a Master of Kundalini Yoga.</p>
<p> There is no beauty, there is no charm, there is no grace in living confused. Leave duality, be one way! Either be like wax or be hard like granite stone. Be nothing or be everything! Death shall come to all, and  it shall come to you! And I tell you that at least today is the day when you can just stand up to yourself and say, &quot;Enough is enough! I am going to be that pure Khalsa.&quot;</p>
<p> I do not know how many times I have to remind you. I know intimacy breeds contempt. And perhaps you are very near to me, therefore you do not understand what I am saying to you. But just remember, one day this voice which tells you to wake up, shall not be heard anymore. And it will be very, very difficult.</p>
<p> When a human being talks the language of the Guru, when he speaks of the  Guru, the Guru flows through that person. When he talks the Gurbaanee and the Truth, then the Sat Guru flows through that person. When he talks the word and the knowledge of Siri Guru Granth Sahib, then the Siri Guru flows from that person. When a person chants &quot;Wahe Guru,&quot; then  Wahe Guru flows through that person. It&#8217;s all for people. There&#8217;s nobody who is condemned in Guru&#8217;s house.</p>
<p> The selfish, egocentric, egomaniac has totally twisted the Sikh Dharma by saying that it is a priestless society. It is not a priestless society. We had Bhai Mani Singh as a priest of the Holy Mandir. We had a  Jathedar of every missal. We had Guru Hargobind to illustrate the temporal and spiritual leader. It is a beautiful and organized way of life. Some don&#8217;t belong to it, that I am willing to agree! But it does belong to everybody.</p>
<p> Khalsa is born, and now you must nurse it, and let it grow, and let it glow. Not only the little ones, but also the tall ones, and big ones with grey beards and with eyes which cannot see and which may have one inch thick glasses to put on even to read the word, &quot;Wahe Guru.&quot; But when they are asked who they are, from one-hundred-twenty-year-old to one-day-old, a stage of consciousness should be achieved when they understand who they are and they say, &quot;I am the mighty, mighty Khalsa.&quot;</p>
<p> With this confirmation and this declaration and this acceptance when there comes a real dear flow of life, that is what Naam simran is. It is  a state of self crucifixion. And it is a state of self exaltation. It is a sublimity. It is a sublime stage of the self in which the fineness and refinement of the Holy Naam sounds and resounds all around. It&#8217;s very simple but it is to be achieved. It is a path, it&#8217;s a way of life. I  understand it, I feel it, I enjoy it, I acknowledge it, and I share it with you. And it&#8217;s my prayer that Siri Guru Granth, in whose court you are sitting, may bless you, as one day I was blessed, so that you can enjoy, you can feel, and you can be. It&#8217;s a work. It&#8217;s a hard work. But it can be worked out. It&#8217;s not impossible. Therefore please try to relate to it, in the essence of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="1"><em><span></span></em></font><em><font face="Arial"><span>&#8220;Between man and God there are two paths: The path of fate and the path of destiny. Those who will give distance to their destiny  shall fall into the path of fate. When you walk on the path of fate, you may feel very happy and be an egomaniac, but when the fatal moment comes&nbsp; -&nbsp; you will be lost again. When you walk on the path of destiny, it doesn&#8217;t matter what distance you cover. When the fatal blow of death comes, you shall be liberated. That is the difference.&#8221;</span></font></em></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>-Yogi Bhajan  from <em>Success and the Spirit: An Aquarian Path to Abundance</em></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>When I was a young child, I remember the adults around me asking, &#8220;What do you want to be when you grow up?&#8221; It was always a daunting question. Even though I felt like I SHOULD have an answer, my replies tended to sound vague and uncertain.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>&#8220;A musician. A writer.&#8221;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>&#8220;You can&#8217;t make a living being a musician or a writer!&#8221; would come the response.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>With no other ideas at hand, I would just shrug my shoulders and be silent.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>In the eighth grade, when our teacher asked us the same question, so she could put the answer in the school year book, the only response I could come up with was &#8220;I want to be myself.&#8221;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>In college, it took me so long to choose a major that the registration department finally had to refuse my enrollment during the second semester of my Junior year. They would only permit me to register  for classes once I decided to major in SOMETHING.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>Lack of focus, one might call it.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>But many years later, when I started studying meditation, it seemed to me that the question, itself, was not framed properly.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>It wasn&#8217;t a question of what I wanted &#8220;to be&#8221; when I grew up. It was a  question of what my soul incarnated on the planet to DO. That question was much more interesting and far more valuable. That question evoked a multi-dimensional answer which continued to evolve as I grew older and, hopefully, wiser.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>Yogi Bhajan calls it the difference between fate and destiny. Destiny  is living according to what the soul took birth to do. It is the deep wisdom within ourselves, constantly illuminating the path before us. Destiny can involve choices that make no sense, risks that we&#8217;d rather not take, challenges that make us want to hide under the covers, and opportunities that push us past our limits. Destiny may not always feel safe and secure. But when we live according to destiny, it gives us a profound sense of satisfaction.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>Fate, on, the other hand, is what we live when we let the time and space around us dictate our reality. When the pressures of society drown  out the voice of the spirit. When other people&#8217;s expectations over-ride  any sense of self-expectation. Or even just simply when we forget about  death &#8211; when we forget how temporary and impermanent our time on the earth really is. If we get lost in the belief that we always have tomorrow, then we may let what&#8217;s important slip through our fingers.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span><em>&quot;All this chanting, the religious rituals and religious ceremonies&#8212; &nbsp;the whole life we live&#8212; is for that last moment. There comes a moment before death when you are judged in the trinity of you, your destiny, and your fate.&nbsp; And that judgment is your decision&#8212;nobody else&#8217;s.&quot;</em>- Yogi Bhajan.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>Nobody can know another person&#8217;s fate or destiny for them. We can only know it for ourselves, through our own self-reflection. The moment of death is the final measure of how the soul used its time on the earth. But every day, through meditation and prayer, we have a chance to  asses ourselves. How much did I live my fate today? How much did I live  my destiny?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>I have two little tricks that I use to reflect back to myself how I&#8217;m  doing in the journey of life. The first is, &#8220;Ek Ong Kaar &#8211; if you were to win the lottery tomorrow &#8211; would you still keep doing what you&#8217;re doing?&#8221; If the answer is yes, I know I&#8217;m on track. If it&#8217;s no &#8211; I know something needs to change.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>The second question is, &#8220;If today was the last day of your life, would you die feeling happy and complete?&#8221; If the answer is yes &#8211; keep going. If it&#8217;s no &#8211; figure out what you need to do differently.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>On the road to success, our family, peers, schools and counselors rarely ask us, &#8220;What did your soul take birth to do?&#8221; And yet, it is the  most important question. When measured against how little time we actually have here, the ultimate success comes from knowing I walked my destiny as best I could.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>With Divine Light.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>&nbsp;Yours humbly,</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><span>Ek Ong Kaar Kaur Khalsa</span></font></p>

<p>&quot;This is the Information Age &#8211; everybody can be informed about anything and everything.&nbsp; There is no secret, therefore there is no sacredness.&nbsp; Life is going to become an open book.&nbsp; When your computer is more loyal, truthful, informed and excellent than you, you will be challenged.&nbsp; You do not have to compete with anybody.&nbsp; You have to compete with yourself.&nbsp; Sooner or later there will be no marriages, and no relationships, because you will not have the mind to control yourself.&nbsp; Computers will take over your life and all you will find is frustration.&nbsp; You have to prepare yourself with a meditative mind and applied consciousness.&nbsp; Taking shelter in faith and hope will not work.&nbsp; It does not matter how successful you are&#8212;money, environments and success will not give you any strength at all.&nbsp; Those who are a slave of these and caught up in emotions and commotions are not spiritual.&nbsp; They have no trust in God.&nbsp; They have not understood the Greatness of the Ever-Prevailing Lord, the Creator of the Universe. </p>
<p>We need a system to energize ourselves and get going.&nbsp; Our sadhana should be so perfect that we get into a solid state.&nbsp; To be simple, to be pure, to Be, is the answer.&nbsp; Touch your consciousness, intelligence, endurance.&nbsp; Touch you.&nbsp; You shall have a mental power, a projection, which must overcome you, yourself and your environments.&nbsp; Emotion, commotion, second chakra pursuits &#8212;a relationship based on these must die.&nbsp; It has to come from here (Yogi Bhajan points to third eye).&nbsp; You have to ultimately respect and value the other person, and reverence has to be maintained.&nbsp; &#8220;Come what may between life and death, between earth and heavens and that of God, we shall stay together for each other.&nbsp; We promise the day, the light of the sun, all stars and moons will be our friends.&nbsp; All humans will be our guides.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll live a very plush, happy life with the trust of God, our Father in Heavens.&#8221; Love other than that is prostitution, debauchery, hateful.&nbsp; Today you love somebody, tomorrow you walk away.&nbsp; Human is as vast, as pure and as full of love as Infinity is.&nbsp; Purity is my first right.&nbsp; Happiness is my original thought.&nbsp; Under One God, unto One God I go&quot;<em>. &#8211; SSS Harbhajan Singh Khalsa Yogiji &#8211; </em><strong>January 10th, 2000 &#8211; Espanola, NM, USA #NM0334</strong></p>
<p><strong>Below is a meditation that was originally taught by Yogi Bhajan after discussing the above topic of information overload. This is a meditation nicknamed &quot;Brain Acupuncture&quot; and will help you relax and deal with the pressure of the times. </strong></p>
<h1>  MEDITATION &#8211; &quot;Brain Acupuncture&quot;</h1>
<p> <iframe title="YouTube video player" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lzhbueBHVg8" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" width="560"></iframe>
<p>Sit straight in a cross-legged position.&nbsp; With the right hand in Gyan Mudra, pinch and pull down the right earlobe with the thumb and the forefinger (this stimulates acupressure points to the frontal lobe and the head).&nbsp; The left hand is on the navel.&nbsp; Eyes are closed.&nbsp; Do Long and Deep Breathing through a pursed mouth, whistling on the inhale.&nbsp; Continue for 31 minutes.&nbsp; To end, inhale deeply, hold the breath and pinch the earlobe as hard as you can.&nbsp; Exhale.&nbsp; Repeat 2 more times, stretching the spine as much as possible.&nbsp; On the last inhale, also press the navel point as hard as possible.&nbsp; Relax.</p>

<p><em><font face="Arial" size="2"><span>&quot;Prosperity doesn&#8217;t mean that you will have wealth, health and happiness. The best way to explain prosperity is to say it is like when a  rosebud flowers and opens up, and it shares its fragrance. That&#8217;s the moment, which lasts a few days, when a rose flower is prosperous. When a  man or woman is prosperous, it is the fragrance of security, grace, depth, character, and truthfulness that a person can share. Like a candle emits light, a human emits prosperity.&quot;</span></font></em></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span>&nbsp;- Siri Singh Sahib, Yogi Bhajan from <em>Success and the Spirit: An Aquarian Path to Abundance</em></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span>Many spiritual approaches to prosperity talk about the power of the mind, of visualization, of intention, and of attracting what you want into your life. All of these are important tools in understanding our relationship with the world around us. Yet very few people talk about the power of a person&#8217;s consciousness, of their purity, of their integrity, grace and character as the source of prosperity. The public conversation about prosperity has been about what I can &#8220;get&#8221; &#8211; rather than what I can &#8220;be.&#8221;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span>Yet when we clear the mind through meditation &#8211; something wonderful happens. The light of the soul starts to shine. And as the Inner Self becomes more prominent, a change takes place in a person. Their fears depart. Joy comes in. And rather than being pushed and pulled by the environments around her, a person can settle into a place of living according to her inner truth. This strength to live according to one&#8217;s inner voice with grace and dignity doesn&#8217;t simply &#8220;attract&#8221; prosperity. It creates it.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span>We can see so many examples throughout history of people who challenged the time and space they lived in. They made a decision to live in the integrity of their own consciousness. Even though they met with challenges along the way, the very act of staying true to themselves eventually made them victorious. It also opened up opportunities for other people. Whether it is the communications vision of Steven Jobs at Apple or the fight for political equality personified in the life of Nelson Mandela&nbsp; &#8211; all those who have created a legacy have done so because they lived committed to their deepest, most genuine  self.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span>In the teachings of the Siri Singh Sahib &#8211; Yogi Bhajan -&nbsp; it is this consciousness of finding and staying true to that deep, spiritual self which is the real source of prosperity. Our spiritual practice gives us a chance to live according to our soul. The purer our minds become, the more the light of the soul shines. The stronger the light becomes, the more we create for ourselves and for others. The power of attraction does not come from what we want. It comes from who we are. And when we can tap into and live in our Divine Self &#8211; the entire universe longs to come close.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span>In the weeks and months ahead, it will be my privilege and blessing to continue sharing excerpts and commentary on a new book being published by KRI titled <em>Success and the Spirit: An Aquarian Path to Abundance</em>.  The book includes lectures, <em>shabads</em>, and Kundalini Yoga meditations taught by Yogi Bhajan on how  to experience success at the deepest level of your being and how to leave a living legacy on the earth.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span>I look forward to the conversation that these columns will create with you.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span>With Divine Light.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span>Yours sincerely and humbly,</span></font></p>

<p>I have to admit that I don&#8217;t listen to Rock music that often these days, but have to say I like what I hear when I listen to the music by young <a href="http://hargomusic.com/" title="" target="_blank">Sikh Rock Musician &quot;Hargo&quot;</a> (<a href="http://hargomusic.com/about/" title="" target="_blank">Hargobind Hari Singh</a>). It&#8217;s always cool to see friends and Sikhs pursue careers and interests that are off the beaten path. It takes a lot of courage and effort to pursue dreams that might not fit in the norm of what parents might consider a career. Keep Going Hargobind Hari! </p>

<p><strong>Well, I&#8217;m posting a little bit early, but it&#8217;s kind of hard to catch Gurumustuk Singh by surprise. March 24th is his 36th birthday and it&#8217;s a milestone birthday. That&#8217;s because age 36 marks the beginning of a new 18-year Cycle of Life Energy. That means&#8230; well, it means lifestyle changes. </strong></p>
<p>Every 18 years we enter a new Life Cycle. 18 years is a combination of 10 plus 8, which reflects the relationship between the soul and the pranic body. The soul or consciousness gives us our mission, our urge to live. The pranic body provides us with the energy to act on that life. In the first two 18 year life cycles, that energy is drawn largely from the physical self, the hormones, nerves and nutrients. But entering the third cycle, we must learn to draw more energy from the mental and pranic bodies. In this way experience, dimension and domain deepen in a way that just doesn&#8217;t happen during those first 35 years. </p>
<p>Gurumustuk is an artist at heart. He brings beauty out through all his work, whether it&#8217;s his amazing photography which sees into the hearts and souls of his subjects, coming up with new ideas or designing new content for SikhNet. His creative touch lives not so much in the language of words (though he does write some great blog posts) but in his relationships &#8211; not only with his family and the Sangat, but with everyone whose life has been touched by SikhNet. </p>
<p>In a way, he simply embodies SikhNet &#8211; its presence, its growth, its constant renewal, its original ideas and content. He is constantly aware of, in tune with and merged into the psyche of our global cybersangat.</p>
<p>Our Guru says that each human&#8217;s destiny is written upon the forehead &#8211; mustuk. And so the deeper meaning of his name is that it is the Guru&#8217;s destiny itself which is his mission and purpose in life. What does that mean? Well, look around&#8230; the old prejudices, fears and habits are dying away and a new consciousness is being born within the Panth all over the world as new generations rise up to take the place of the old. Gurumustuk Singh represents that consciousness of unity, practical lifestyle and human technology and, most of all, the purest love of the Guru and the Panth, which is SikhNet&#8217;s raison d&#8217;etre &#8211; to inspire the unity of the Panth and move all of us forward together into deeper understanding, cooperation, mutual inspiration and service.</p>
<p>So many lives have been touched by his work that I have the blessing to be able to say that I witness the Guru&#8217;s miracles manifested through him constantly.</p>
<p>On his birthday, I want to pause in the midst of our crazy SikhNet work schedule and take this moment to congratulate him. </p>
<p>Not just for SikhNet, but for his compassion, his creativity, his practical wisdom and his incredible service to the Panth and to emerging generations. He has excelled as a father, as a leader, as a sevadar and, yes, as my co-worker as well. </p>
<p>Gurumustuk Singh Ji &#8211; Happy Birthday! In life we rarely find people with whom our destinies are interwoven by such common joy, dedication and purpose. What an immense blessing it is for me to have the privilege to work with you each day. May you always be surrounded by love, joy, prosperity and excellence. You truly are the Guru&#8217;s Mustuk.</p>
<p>~ Guruka Singh </p>

<p>I often get the question from other Sikhs asking why many Sikhs from non-Punjabi background greet each other with a simple &quot;<em>Sat Nam</em>!&quot; rather then the Khalsa greeting of &quot;<em><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2007/07/23/wahe-guru-ji-ka-khalsa-wahe-guru-ji-ki-fateh/" title="">Vahe Guru Ji Ka Khalsa, Vahe Guru Ji Ki Fateh</a>!</em>&quot; or more common greeting of &quot;<em><a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Sat_Sri_Akal" title="" target="_blank">Sat Siri Akal</a></em>&quot;.&nbsp; Typically Sikhs that have <a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Amrit_Sanskar" title="" target="_blank">taken Amrit</a> greet each other with the longer greeting of &quot;<em><a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2007/07/23/wahe-guru-ji-ka-khalsa-wahe-guru-ji-ki-fateh/" title="">Vahe Guru Ji Ka Khalsa, Vahe Guru Ji Ki Fateh</a>!</em>&quot; and most everyone else uses the shorter greeting of &quot;<em><a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Sat_Sri_Akal" title="" target="_blank">Sat Siri Akal</a></em>.&quot;&nbsp; Well, to understand this you have to know a little bit more of the history of the Sikhs who &quot;sprouted&quot; in the western part of the world.&nbsp; Back in the early days (1960&#8242;s and 1970&#8242;s) when <a href="http://sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Yogi_Bhajan" title="" target="_blank">SSS Harbhajan Singh Khalsa Yogi ji</a> came to America/Canada and started teaching, there were no western Sikhs, let alone western Sikhs who had taken Amrit.&nbsp; He used to make fun of our usual American greeting of&nbsp; &quot;Hello&quot;.&nbsp; He pronounced it, &quot;HELL &#8211; oh.&quot; and encouraged a more universal and conscious way of greeting each other which served as a reminder to each other; &quot;SAT NAM&quot;. This greeting has stuck since then and is used by many thousands of people (sikhs and non-sikhs alike) since it is a beautiful, simple and universal greeting that anyone can understand and relate to. It didn&#8217;t matter if you considered yourself a Sikh or not you could relate to and feel inspired by the simple &quot;Sat Nam&quot; reminding you of your &quot;True Identity&quot;.</p>
<p>Comments by Shakti Parwha Kaur (who was one of the first Sikhs from western background): <em>&quot;Sat Nam&quot; means: &quot;Truth is God&#8217;s Name and/or Truth is Our Identity.&quot;&nbsp; By saying this, I establish, however briefly, instant rapport, a common ground acknowledging our shared divine identity &#8211; certainly the best basis for any conversation! Following that initial respectful greeting we are free to disagree about any topic: politics, religion, movie preferences, or the best restaurants.&nbsp; I say SAT NAM to my accountant, my banker and my non-Sikh relatives! I&#8217;ve programmed my answering machine greeting so that it always begins with SAT NAM.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just the most universal and simple greeting to which everyone can relate.&quot;</em></p>
<p>I personally vary which greeting I use depending on who I am meeting or talking to. Sometimes I say &quot;Sat Nam&quot;, Sometimes I greet with full &quot;Vahe Guru Ji Ka Khalsa, Vahe Guru Ji Ki Fateh&quot;, and sometimes I even say &quot;Hell-Oh&quot; <img alt="" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" border="0" height="15" width="15"> (yeah&#8230;can&#8217;t help it sometimes). Ultimately these are just tools to remind and uplift each other, and I don&#8217;t think it is right or wrong to use one thing over the other. So, any greeting that inspires or reminds us of God and our higher self I think would be preferred and best. </p>

<p>We received a number of questions from users on the topic of taking Amrit (Sikh &quot;Baptism&quot;). With this being a central part of the Sikh lifestyle it is no surprise that there are so many questions related to this topic. In this video Guruka Singh answers some of the questions we have received via email related to Amrit Sanchar as well as discussing commitment &amp; discipline in relation to this subject. Everyone who has received the Guru&#8217;s Amrit probably has had a different experience, different motivation and a different calling that inspired them to take this step of commitment to the Guru. <a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2007/07/30/the-blessing-of-receiving-gurus-amrit/" title="" target="_blank">Many years ago I wrote about my experience</a> &amp; I&#8217;m sure others can tell their experiences as well which give a larger picture about the blessing of receiving the Guru&#8217;s Amrit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Question 1 &#8211; </strong>&quot;Importance of Amrit. What personality changes are expected or how Sikhs feel after Baptism?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Question 2</strong> &#8211; &quot;I personally feel that there&#8217;s a different world on the other side of baptism. Once you get baptized you just feel that you&#8217;ve escalated all your problems and worries to somebody who can crack them much more easily and handle my responsibilities in a much better way. But publically, people&#8217;s expectations form my character and conduct increase exponentially. People have started looking at me as a maverick and expect me to do mighty, unimaginable things. So my question is that should a person shed-off that Superman&#8217;s self-image before getting baptized?? Which is the very driving force for many people to get baptized. But getting baptized is like walking on the path of Dashmesh pitaah who is our all time hero, Superman, savior/ God, but after doing so why do I feel scared getting carried away?? or it&#8217;s just those mental locks of bad deeds done by me in my life before baptism.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Question 3</strong> &#8211; &quot;I am inherently a good person; why as a Sikh should I take Amrit? Isn&#8217;t just good karmas sufficient to gain a position in heaven? / I want to know that will guru ji accept me if i am not baptized and cut my hair but still i remember him in everything i do&#8230;don&#8217;t do anything wrong to anyone&#8230;..go to Gurudwara.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Sat Nam and many blessings.</p>
<p>A wonderful 3-day workshop, focusing on the science of Naad as described in Guru Nanak&#8217;s <em>Japji Sahib</em> is coming to the <a href="http://www.ramadasa.org" title="" target="_blank">Ra Ma Da Sa Center</a> in Fujian, China.</p>
<p>The Ra Ma Da Sa Center is located in a beautiful mountain area in southeast China &#8211; perfect for deep meditation and transformation. The center has been created to serve not only the Chinese population who have become interested in Kundalini Yoga, but also as a destination center for people in neighboring countries who would like to immerse themselves in meditation.<br />  &nbsp;<br />  <strong>The workshop will take place from May 5-7.</strong> During the course, we will deepen our practice of chanting and increase our connection to the power of listening. We will also focus on having a more conscious relationship with our words. By understanding the nature of Naad, we will come to understand the creative impact that words and thoughts have on our life.<br />  &nbsp;<br />  It is a rare opportunity and privilege to come do a 3-day workshop in this part of the world and I am very grateful to be invited to do so.&nbsp; If you are anywhere in the vicinity and can attend the course, it would be a blessing to see you there.</p>
<p>The cost for the 3-day workshop is 470USD plus food and accommodations. For more information, please contact katilin at kaitlinliu@ramadasa.org.</p>
<p>With Divine Light.</p>
<p>Yours humbly,</p>
<p>Ek Ong Kaar Kaur </p>

<p>This video addresses a question from a SikhNet user asking about the concept of &quot;Jhoot&quot;, and not sharing food with non-amritdhari&#8217;s. He was wondering why some Sikhs practice this. I tried searching online to better understand the reason some practice this, but found very little.&nbsp; From what little I read online in forums the reasoning was mostly hygiene (sharing food that you have eaten with someone else)&#8230;. and also some reasons given about &quot;non-amritdharis&quot; putting bad vibrations on the food.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Here at SikhNet we often get questions from users on all kinds of topics that normally people might be hesitant to talk about in person. Here is a video of me reading one such question to Guruka Singh. The topic of the video is about homosexuality and what that might mean to people who are Sikhs. </p>
<p>I have no idea how many Sikhs have same gender partners, however this topic is brought up from time to time by people who have expressed a lot of hardship in dealing with other Sikhs who are judging and criticizing their sexual preference.&nbsp; I think it is important that we be open to talking about things like this and not be judgmental. I personally know a number of same gender couples that are really awesome people and would never think to judge or criticize their preferences.&nbsp; A person&#8217;s sexuality doesn&#8217;t make the person.&nbsp; Who are we to judge someone else. In any case&#8230;.here are Guruka Singh&#8217;s thoughts on the topic&#8230;. </p>

<p><em>by Gurprakash Singh Khalsa, <a href="http://www.miripiriacademy.org/" title="" target="_blank">MPA Alumni and Staff Member</a></em></p>
<p>On Sunday, January 9th, I played in Darbar Sahib for the first time with the Cherdi Kala Jatha. It was a feeling that I can&#8217;t really describe, but I&#8217;m going to try. It was extremely foggy. Those of you who have been to India in the winter know exactly what I&#8217;m talking about. I was feeling a mixture of nervousness&nbsp; and total gratitude when i bowed my head on the freezing Parkarma.&nbsp; On the way to Darbar Sahib I couldn&#8217;t feel my feet or my hands.&nbsp; I thought &#8216;I&#8217;m about to play for the first time with numb hands! Oh god!&#8217; I was in awe of how confidently and nonchalantly Sada Sat Simran and Jugat Guru led the way with me, the freshie tabla player in tow.</p>
<p>  It was still Ishnaan Seva time as they were reciting the shabds inside before they let the rest of the sangat in. We bowed and Jugat Guru got prasad for all three of us. He told me to tell Sada Sat Simran, but I&nbsp; totally didn&#8217;t understand him amidst the people reciting the shabds, so Sada Sat Simran got ANOTHER maha-elephant sized prasad serving. I thought &#8220;Oh well, we&#8217;ll just have to eat more prasad than normal.&#8221; Little did I know, it was so cold that when I got the serving of prasad (which pretty much filled both my hands), the ghee solidified into its white hard form, making the prasad much less palatable. Then Sada Sat Simran said &#8220;Hurry up! They only have two shabds left&nbsp; before we play!&#8221;&nbsp; I forced the prasad down my throat, wiped chunks of solidified ghee off on my churidars, and went in to play.</p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/33818_1533096612711_1393678166_31264879_1534390_n.jpg" rel="lightbox[38219]"><img src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/33818_1533096612711_1393678166_31264879_1534390_n-300x225.jpg" alt="33818_1533096612711_1393678166_31264879_1534390_n" title="33818_1533096612711_1393678166_31264879_1534390_n" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-38222" align="right" border="0" height="225" width="300"></a>I was nervous at first, but before I knew it, it was just the kirtan playing. To me there was no microphone, no sangat, no insecurity about people listening to the live broadcast. Just the full gratitude and blessing to be playing in the house of Guru Ram Das.&nbsp; My heart was smiling as we played shabds in honor of Guru Gobind Singh, and when we finished i had a feeling of supreme lightness. It was not like I was spacing out, but as if the air molecules in direct contact with my skin decided to lift my physical body weight off of the ground. I felt clear, nervousness gone, totally clean slate, no fear of dying, no desire to die either and vice versa with living.</p>
<p>  One feeling was fixed like it had been dead bolted to my heart: gratitude. The fact that I was blessed enough to come to Amritsar to this place, having the Guru literally take my anxiety out of my body, and play gods praises in one of the most energetically powerful places on the planet built an experiece so powerful that even if i spend my life as an armpit sniffer working for old spice (The worst job I can imagine!), I would still be able to look back at this experience&nbsp; and say &#8220;Thank you god for letting me do that. I am blessed in my life.&#8221; </p>

<p>Yesterday morning I was at the SikhNet office working and noticed how it was unusually cold. After further investigation I realized that there was no gas&#8230;.and therefore no heat for the office. I didn&#8217;t quite understand the impact of this till later in the day when <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/Gas-shortage-cuts-heat-for-25-000" title="" target="_blank">I found out that there were natural gas outages all over New Mexico</a>. I kept on working most of the day, bundled up in my winter jacket in the office trying to keep my fingers from becoming &quot;ice cubes&quot; with some hot tea from my electric kettle. Every once and a while I would reload the page for the <a href="https://www.nmgco.com/Emergency_Updates.aspx" title="" target="_blank">New Mexico Gas Company</a> to see if there were any updates. </p>
<p>Currently over 25,000 homes are without natural gas, which for most of them means no heat, no way to cook food on stove, and with the coldest temperatures in 30+ years, risk of water pipes freezing and breaking is very high! </p>
</p>
<p>In spite of the gas outage, the sevadhars who organize the weekly Thursday langar were able to still make food using an electric convection oven. I was sure there would be no Langar, but was happy to see that in spite of the gas problems langar went on and everyone really appreciated being able to come together and warm their bellies and talk about what was going on.</p>
<p>By the end of the day I realized that this wasn&#8217;t going to be a quick fix like the power just coming back on and going on as normal. Apparently in situations like this when the gas goes out a person from the gas company has to go to each house/location to restore the gas and reset the meters. Just imagine trying to do this for 25,000 homes!! So even if the gas was/is back now it will likely be many days before most people get their heat back.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have any type of electric heater so was trying to figure out how I can heat our house and prevent pipes from freezing. I managed to buy some firewood from a friend who had just helped deliver trucks of wood to a few others. Mata Mandir Singh the super langar sevadhar was gracious enough to share some of his wood with me. I was wondering what he was still doing in the langar kitchen after having cooked the langar for everyone early in the day. I thought he was still cleaning up (at 6pm), however realized he and a few others were cooking food to bring to some of the local emergency shelters. People may have some warmth in the shelters&#8230;.but no food. It was so inspiring to see them jump to serve in the need of the time while everyone else (myself included) was scrambling to take care of themselves. </p>
<p>Every store in New Mexico was sold out of any type of heating device. No heaters, no pipe heating tape&#8230;.nothing. Even though I have some firewood that was more for emergency because my fireplace wasn&#8217;t very well designed and smoke &quot;spills&quot; out into the house. Also I needed some type of way to heat my boiler room (in the garage) which apparently is the most likely to get frozen/broken pipes. Since there were not heaters I moved down to the lighting isle of the hardware store to look for those bright flood lights. I figured that one of those high wattage lights should do the trick for generating some heat. As I look around in the giant hardware store people are all scrambling around looking for things to &quot;protect their home&quot;.</p>
<p>After I bought some of those lights I found out that my parents house had some electric heaters that we could use. Yay! So I went and picked those up relieved to have something to warm our house.&nbsp; Thankfully we slept with a warm house, though our kitchen cold water pipe is frozen so still working on that so that we can get drinking water.</p>
<p>Unfortunately many of the areas that were without heat/gas were cities/towns that have a lot of poverty. It&#8217;s always interesting that somehow places with people of lesser means often get the short end of the stick. It&#8217;s as if there is behind the scenes politics and decisions being made about who is going to get the little bit or gas/resource that is left. So the wealthy and people who have the means often times are not affected while those that will be impacted most&#8230;are. </p>
<p>This whole situation is one of those wake-up calls relating to our reliance on &quot;the system&quot;. It&#8217;s amazing how we can have water, electricity, gas, food and other things so easily available in our homes and cities. However, when one of those delivery systems break down then it impacts people greatly. It&#8217;s like a stack of cards. You pull out one piece from the system and the cards fall.</p>
<p>I feel like in the coming years there is the possibility of a lot of instability in our world. This could be the result of natural disasters, financial impacts, political problems, wars, or just about anything. Now that we are more and more reliant on &quot;the system&quot; it has the potential to create a huge amount of chaos in the world. It is a wake-up call to me personally to work more on being prepared for any kind of disaster.&nbsp; Just imagine if the water stopped coming out of your faucet, or food supply was cut off. People would freak out! The civility of our communities are very dependent on things being stable. It reminds me of the event that happened in&nbsp; Bolivia (2000 ?) where all water rights were sold by the corporate government to private interests. The company even said that the people didn&#8217;t have the right to collect rain water!! That was the last straw, after which all the people revolted and threw out the current government and reclaimed the water rights. </p>
</p>
<p>So while I sit in my house right now still warm&#8230;typing on my computer with an internet connection&#8230;and a bit inconvenienced by this whole situation here in New Mexico it brings me back to think about our fragile system. We all should be thinking about ways that we can conserve our resources and become less reliant on systems that can break down easily. Much of our food comes from far away places (even other countries!).&nbsp;   Water resources are quickly disappearing as we waste so much water and over develop. I wonder what the world will be like for my grand kids.We are doing a bad job right now.</p>
<p>What can little old me (and you) do about all this? It may seem like an individual can&#8217;t do much with a problem so big, however that is untrue. Every small change that each of us make adds up. Aside from continuing to be more conscious of my consumption and waste, I&#8217;m definitely going to be thinking about things I can do to my future home to make ourselves less reliant on the system. </p>
<p>Just last month I was watching a cool documentary called &quot;<a href="http://www.garbagewarrior.com/about.html" title="" target="_blank">The Garbage Warrior</a>&quot; with the New Mexico (Taos) based Michael Reynolds and his green &quot;disciples&quot; who have devoted their time to advancing the art of &quot;Earthship Biotecture&quot; by building self-sufficient, off-the-grid communities where design and function converge in eco-harmony. We need more &quot;Garbage warriors&quot; and people taking steps to make a chance&#8230;or we&#8217;ll not have a sustainable place to live and survive on.</p>
<p>Enough Doom and Gloom. Just as we sing in Gurdwara in the &quot;<a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2006/02/08/song-of-the-khalsa/" title="" target="_blank">Song of the Khalsa</a>&quot; &#8230;<em>When things are down and darkest, that&#8217;s when we stand tallest</em>&#8230;.&quot;. It often takes tragedy for people to wake up and make some necessary change. So, time will tell how we do. </p>
<p>In the mean time my prayers are with everyone here in New Mexico and other places who might be without heat and food in these cold times. It could be quite a few days till they are able to restore gas/heat to the over 25,000 homes and business. </p>
<p>As my wife posted on Facebook a few minutes ago: &quot;<em>So glad I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2005/12/13/ishnaan-therapy-cold-shower/" title="" target="_blank">practicing taking cold showers</a> for the past year. Makes today a lot easier. It&#8217;s 9 degrees Fahrenheit (-13 degree Celsius)&nbsp; this morning instead of yesterday&#8217;s negative -9 degree Fahrenheit (-23 degree Celsius). Woohoo!</em>&quot;&#8230;I guess everyone is going to be either stinky&#8230;or having a taste of the healing cold shower!</p>

<p><strong>This is part 2 of the previous post on <a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2011/01/28/manifesting-prosperity-abundance/" title="">Manifesting Prosperity and Abundance</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Today I wanted to share another technique that you can use to increase your prosperity.&nbsp; This is a quick practical meditation<strong> </strong>that you can do every day. This was originally taught by SSS Harbhajan Singh Khalsa at the Summer Solstice camp here in Espanola, New Mexico way back in 1996. </p>
<p>I remember him teaching the whole Kriya and feeling great after we were done. Since then, the first part of the Kriya has been widely practiced by many (including myself) to increase prosperity and abundance. I have heard so many stories from people about how after doing this meditation regularly all kinds of prosperity came to them. Practice it on a regular basis and see what happens!&nbsp; You never know until you do it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We used to do this meditation for 3 minutes every day at the SikhNet office. I just started doing it again at home in the morning and hope to get the whole SikhNet team to do it together too. <strong>Why don&#8217;t you join me and practice it for a minimum of 40 days!</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Watch the video below of Guruka Singh teaching how this meditation is done and explaining how it works.&nbsp;</strong> </p>
<p>  <iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qBPHsZuTTTU" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="345" width="560"></iframe>
<p>You can start with the first part of the below kriya (which is the meditation described in the above video) or you can practice the whole kriya which is a five part meditation &quot;set&quot;. The exercises in the below set must all be done for the same length of time, either 3 minutes each or 11 minutes each. Part one of the Kriya can be done on it&#8217;s own and is the meditation described in the video above. Below is the written instructions for your reference.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a complete set. This is all called Subagh Kriya. If God has written with His own hands that you shall live under misfortune, then by   doing Subagh Kriya you can turn your misfortune into prosperity, fortune, and good luck.&#8221; </p>
<p> &quot;To become rich and prosperous with wealth and values, is to have the strength to come through. It means that transmissions from your brain, and the power of your intuition can immediately tell you what to do. You   will be in a position to change gears. If you need to go in reverse, you can go in reverse. If you need to go forward, you&#8217;ll go forward. This is a very old and simple system.&quot; &#8211; <em>SSS Harbhajan Singh Khalsa Yogi ji &#8211; Jun 21st 1996</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h2><strong>Part One</strong></h2>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Position:</strong> </font>Sit in Easy Pose with a spine straight (sit up straight). Elbows are by the sides, forearms angled up and outward with the fingers at the level of the throat. </p>
<p><strong><strong><img src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/subhagkriya4.jpg" alt="subhag kriya" class="imgFloatLeft" align="right" border="1" height="247" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="175"></strong></strong>
<p> The begins with the palms facing down.</p>
<p> Alternately hit the sides fo the hands together.&nbsp; The Mercury (pinky) fingers and the Moon Mounds (located on the bottom of the palms) hit when the palms face up.&nbsp; When the palms hit facing down, the sides of the jupiter (index) fingers touch and the thumbs cross below the hands, with the right thumb under the left.&nbsp; Yogi Bhajan said that the thumbs crossing this way is the key to the meditation.</p>
<p><strong><font size="4">Eyes:</font> </strong>Look at the tip of your nose, through eyes 9/10th closed.</p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Mantra:</strong></font> Chant the mantra &quot;Har, Har.&quot; Alternately strike the Moon area and the Jupiter area as you chant Har with the tip  of your tongue, pulling the navel with each Har. Your eyes are focused at the tip of your nose. Chant continuously from the navel, using the tip of the tongue. (This meditation was taught to the rhythm of Tantric Har by Simran Kaur.)</p>
<p><strong>Here is some <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/playlist/tantric-har-meditation-subagh-kriya" title="" target="_blank">audio that you can use for this meditation</a> </strong>- (click on the &quot;show playlist&quot; option in the player to view the different audio tracks).&nbsp; &nbsp; <a target="_parent" href="http://www.spiritvoyage.com/AffiliateLink.aspx?redirect=true&amp;id=MjAzMTMjaHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcGlyaXR2b3lhZ2UuY29tL21wM2Rvd25sb2FkL1RhbnRyaWMtSGFyLWFuZC1IYXItSGFyYXktSGFyZWUtV2FoZS1HdXJ1L1NpbXJhbi1LYXVyLUtoYWxzYS9BTEItMDAxMTUzLmFzcHg=">You can purchase the Tantric Har MP3 download by Simran Kaur</a></p>
<p><img src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/subhagkriya5.jpg" alt="subhag kriya" class="imgFloatLeft" align="right" border="1" height="257" width="175"><font size="4"><strong>Time:</strong>&nbsp;</font> Continue for 3-11 minutes.&nbsp; Yogi Bhajan has said,<strong> </strong>&quot;You  should not do it more than 3 minutes when you are working during the day, or you will become too rich. I am not joking. Doing it for 11 minutes a day is more than enough. Doing it too much will be greed. It stimulates the mind, the moon center, and Jupiter. When Jupiter and the moon come together, there is no way in the world you will not make wealth.&quot;</p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Note:</strong></font>&nbsp;Part One&nbsp;can be done on it&#8217;s own for prosperity.</p>
<p><em>&quot;This meditation stimulates the mind, the moon center and Jupiter.&nbsp; When Jupiter and the moon come together, there is no way in the world you will not create wealth.&quot;</em>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Part Two</strong></h2>
<p> <strong><strong><img src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/subhagkriya6.jpg" alt="subhag kriya" align="right" border="1" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="243"></strong></strong>
<p><strong>Position:&nbsp;</strong> Stretch you arms out to the sides and up at a  sixty-degree angle. Spread your fingers wide, making them stiff. The palms face forward. Cross your arms in front of your face. Alternate the  position of the arms as they cross: first the left arm crosses in front  of the right and then the right arm crosses in front of the left.</p>
<p> Continue crossing the arms, keeping the elbows straight and the fingers open and stiff. This movement is also done to the rhythm of Tantric Har by Simran Kaur, but this time you do not chant.</p>
<p><strong><img src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/subhagkriya7.jpg" alt="subhag kriya" align="right" border="1" height="207" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="175"><font size="4">Eyes:</font></strong><font size="4"> </font>The eyes remain closed. </p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Mantra:</strong></font> Keep in rhythm with the <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/playlist/tantric-har-meditation-subagh-kriya" title="" target="_blank">Tantric Har tape</a>, but do not chant this time.</p>
<p> &quot;I&#8217;m going to give you a very handy tool, one that you can<br />                  use anywhere, and you&#8217;ll become rich. To become rich<br />                  and prosperous, with wealth and values, is to have the<br />                  strength to come through. It means that transmissions<br />                  from your brain and the power of your intuition can<br />                  immediately tell you what to do.&quot; </p>
<h2><strong>Part Three</strong></h2>
<p> <strong><strong><img src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/subhagkriya8.jpg" alt="subhag kriya" class="imgFloatLeft" align="right" border="1" height="249" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="175"></strong></strong>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Position: </strong></font>This is the English mantra. Keep your arms out and up at sixty degrees as in the previous exercise. With your hands, make a fist around your thumb, squeezing your thumb tightly as if you are trying to squeeze all the blood out of it. Move your arms in small backward circles as you continue squeezing your thumb. Your arms are stretched and the elbows stay straight. Chant the mantra &#8220;God&#8221; powerfully form your navel. One backward circle of the arms equals one repetition of &#8220;God.&#8221; The speed and rhythm of the chanting is the same as  in the previous exercises. Move powerfully so that your entire spine shakes, you may even be lifted slightly up off the ground by the movement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Part Four</strong></h2>
<p> <strong><br />    <font size="4">Position:</font></strong> Bend your arms so that your elbows point to the sides. The  forearms are parallel to the floor and the palms face the body around the level of the diaphragm. The right<br />                  hand moves up a few inches as the left hand moves down.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/subhagkriya9.jpg" alt="subhag kriya" class="imgFloatLeft" align="right" border="1" height="230" width="175"></p>
<p>  The left hand moves up as the right hand moves down. The hands move alternately up and down between the heart and navel. As the hands move, chant &quot;<a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/audio/har-haray-haree-wahe-guru" title="" target="_blank">Har Haray Haree, Whahay Guroo</a>&quot; in a deep monotone with one repetition of the mantra approximately every 4 seconds. Chant from your navel.</p>
<p> If you are practicing the exercises for 11 minutes each, then you will chant the mantra out loud for 6 minutes, whisper it strongly for 3 minutes and then whistle it for 2 minutes. If you are practicing the exercises for 3 minutes each, then you will chant the mantra out loud for 1 minute, whisper it strongly for 1 minute, and then whistle it for 1  minute.</p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Chant:</strong></font> <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/audio/har-haray-haree-wahe-guru" title="" target="_blank">Har haray haree wahay guroo&nbsp; </a></p>
<h2><strong>Part Five</strong></h2>
<p> <img src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/subhagkriya10.jpg" alt="subhag kriya" align="right" border="1" height="218" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="175">
<p><strong><font size="4">Position:</font> </strong>Bring the arms in front of the chest. Bend the arms at the elbows, palms facing down,&nbsp;rest the right forearm on the  left forearm. Keep the arms steady.</p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Eyes: </strong></font>Close your eyes and breathe long and deep. Keep the spine straight and keep the arms parallel to the ground; don&#8217;t let them fall. </p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Breath:</strong></font> Breathe slowly and deeply so that&nbsp;one breathe&nbsp;takes a full minute. Inhale for&nbsp;20 seconds, hold for 20 seconds and exhale for&nbsp;20 seconds. Breathe consciously. </p>

<p>This is the first in the latest series of new SikhNet Inspiration videos with Guruka Singh.&nbsp; SikhNet users sent us questions, which I then&nbsp; used for the interviews. There were so many questions, that we did our best to talk about as many of them as we could! We used two cameras in the videos so you&#8217;ll actually see me asking the question, rather than a mysterious voice in the background. </p>
<p>In this video I read a question from a user who wanted to know about prosperity &amp; becoming prosperous.&nbsp; Guruka Singh, as always, shares his unique perspective on what prosperity really is and how it is not really about having lots of money. &quot;<em>Prosperity is understanding, in each moment, that whatever you need, and even more is at hand at the moment you need it. That you will always have enough to live with grace; that you will always have enough to give to others and share.</em>&quot; </p>
<p>We then talk about the Sikh concept of <a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Dasvandh" title="" target="_blank">Dasvandh</a> (giving back 10%). What dasvandh means and why we should practice this. </p>
<p>The last part of the video goes into the power of projection and answering a question related to documentary called &quot;<a href="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/2006/12/19/the-secret/" title="" target="_blank">The Secret</a>&quot;. Guruka Singh shares what he says is the missing 2/3rds of what they don&#8217;t tell you.</p>
<p>The video is packed with lots of great information and worth watching a few times to let it really sink in. I hope that it inspires you to make a positive change in your life! Enjoy!</p>

<p>The past few days I have been exploring the new world of recording video using a Digital SLR camera (<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos5dmarkii/" title="" target="_blank">Canon EOS 5D Mark II</a>). I&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrsikhnet/sets/" title="" target="_blank">taking pictures for the past 20 years</a> &amp; been dabbling in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/mrsikhnet#g/a" title="" target="_blank">video over the past years for SikhNet</a>, but only recently has video been added to these types of digital cameras with this level of quality. The results are awesome! There are some technical hurdles that I am trying to overcome, but once I get the right hardware I should be good to go.</p>
<p>As a photographer it&#8217;s really cool to see video that is taken with this type of camera. The colors and the perspective that you get with the focus/aperture creates some beautiful video. </p>
<p><strong>A friend just forwarded me a link to some beautiful videos by Jason Taylor who also shot many videos on the same camera.&nbsp; Not only are these videos visually beautiful, but the message needs to be heard by more people.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p><strong>This first short video gives you an overview of&nbsp; his project &quot;<a href="http://www.thesourcefilm.org" title="" target="_blank">The Source</a>&quot; which has to do with farming, sustainability, seeds &amp; food for all. The videos are all set in India and so you see many clips relating to the Sikhs in Punjab. Take the time to watch the below three short videos. </strong></p>
<p><em>Thank you Jason for devoting so much time an effort to share these videos, which hopefully will make many more people aware of what is going on in the world with our food.</em><strong> <br />   </strong></p>
<p> <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/14414038?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=FF7700" frameborder="0" height="309" width="549"></iframe></p>
<p>&quot;Sixty years ago India had more than 100,000 varieties of rice. Today there are little more than 3,000. The demise of seed variety is just one of the many issues farmers around the world are fighting against. Agriculture has become Agribusiness and more than a billion farmers livelihoods and environments are now being threatened worldwide, from Europe to Uruguay. This film is one minute with one of the millions of farmers who truly understand sustainable agriculture. This is The Source&quot; -&nbsp; <a href="http://www.thesourcefilm.org" title="" target="_blank">www.thesourcefilm.org</a></p>
<p><strong>  Here is a longer video with Natabar Sarangi talking about seeds and farming in India.</strong> <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/16508587?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=FF7700" frameborder="0" height="309" width="549"></iframe></p>
<p>&quot;Natabar continues to find, save and share his indigenous rice seed with local farmers. To date he has managed to re-introduce over 350 varieties.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s not just about the indigenous rice seed of India or about the survival of a sustainable agriculture system with the knowledge of over ten thousand years. It&#8217;s about a global phenomenon taking place where a non-sustainable system systematically destroys a sustainable one, where short term profit has the power to overwhelm common sense and the consciousness of many millions, where progress is not progress but the wanton destruction of an eco-system and environment we will never be able to replace.</p>
<p>        Natabar Sarangi is just one of a growing number of farmers throughout the world who realise that if we do not begin to repair the damage taking place to our agricultural systems and our environment, we will lose not just our cultural identity but our fundamental right to a truly sustainable system of food security.&quot; -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.devinder-sharma.blogspot.com/" title="" target="_blank">more information on the Indian agricultural crisis</a>        </p>
<p><strong> This last beautiful video is a scene that most of us are familiar with: Langar being served at the Harimandir Sahib, in Amritsar. </strong> <iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/17239315?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=FF7700" frameborder="0" height="309" width="549"></iframe></p>
<p>&quot;From a culture of sharing we have become a culture driven by possession and profit. The century of self. This short film comes from the kitchens of the Golden Temple (Harimandir Sahib, Amritsar) where every day around 100,000 people, regardless of colour, caste or religion, donate, prepare, consume and clean for nothing more than compassion. Are we really moving in the right direction? This year the world will produce enough food to feed twice the world&#8217;s population, yet every day almost one billion people will sleep hungry. &quot;</p>

<p>Are you a Sikh parent with daughter? Chances are you have gone through the &quot;Princess&quot; phase with her, especially if you live outside of India in countries like USA, Canada, England, etc. My son is 9 years old and after having a second child four years ago (a girl!), I realized more and more how different the boy &amp; girl &quot;species&quot; are from each other. Boys love trucks/cars and physical/rough play, whereas girls love dolls, role playing &amp; dress up. Obviously one can&#8217;t generalize too much, but if you have both a boy and a girl, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll know what I mean.</p>
<p>So lately I have been watching my daughter and the things that she is interested in, and it has made me think about Sikh women and identity as a Sikh.&nbsp; Lately she has been really into dressing up as a princess, wearing plastic crowns and spinning around (like they do in the movies) trying to get her dress to spin and twirl (dresses that don&#8217;t &quot;twirl&quot; don&#8217;t work for her!). She wants to paint her nails and lips and she sometimes hangs things on her ears as &quot;earrings&quot; along with wearing plastic high heals as part of &quot;princess outfits&quot;. She loves dolls of all kinds and can just play on her own making them beds and all kinds of fun creative stuff for them. The thing that I have noticed is that with the limited media out there for girls she has started to mirror characters from movies. </p>
<p><img alt="Disney's version of Princesses" title="Disney's version of Princesses" src="http://disneyexclusiveonline.com/images/Disney_Exclusive_Online_Princess_Merchandise_Shop.jpg">&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fanpop.com/spots/being-a-man/articles/41/title/top-10-hottest-animated-disney-women" title="" target="_blank"><img style="margin-left: 15px" alt="Belle from the movie Beauty &amp; The Beast" title="Belle from the movie Beauty &amp; The Beast" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Belle-beauty-and-the-beast.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="410" width="281"></a>Girls love seeing movies and videos with other girls, especially <a href="http://disney.go.com/princess/#/home/" title="" target="_blank">animated movies by Disney</a> and other film studios. Movies like:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.fanpop.com/spots/being-a-man/articles/41/title/top-10-hottest-animated-disney-women" title="" target="_blank">Aladdin (Jasmine), Cinderella, Beauty &amp; The Beast (Belle), The Little Mermaid, (Arial), Tinkerbell, Barbie, Shrek (Fiona)</a>, etc. There are many other kinds of movies out there, but these are some that are very mainstream and hard for girls not to notice even if you don&#8217;t have the movies. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have an issue with my daughter dressing up, but as I start to see her copy these characters I see things that I don&#8217;t like particularly as a Sikh. In our house we have a rule that when she goes out of the house she needs to have her hair covered and up in a joora (tied up hair in a bun) and covered. We don&#8217;t wear makeup or ear-rings, and dress gracefully. However in the animations all the characters have their hair down, often times low cut dresses and some type of romantic encounter. As a result my daughter doesn&#8217;t want to wear her hair up&#8230;and is adamant about not wearing a turban or head covering because it doesn&#8217;t match her image of a &quot;princess&quot; or what she thinks is pretty. She even wants to copy the kissing from the movies. I try my best to explain these things to her and what our values are as compared to what she is seeing. </p>
<p>So as I am going through all this I think how much different this is than it was raising my son who wore a turban from an early age and didn&#8217;t have this type of influence. It really made me think about how my daughter is going to relate to being a Sikh and how important it is at this time to ingrain Sikh values and an understanding of our lifestyle.</p>
<p>We often talk about &quot;Kaurs&quot; being princesses, but what does that really mean practically for Sikh women? I tell my daughter (charanjeet kaur) that her names means&#8230; &quot;<em>Princess who is victorious in bringing people to the feet of God</em>&quot;. But what does this mean to her at this age? She can only relate to the type of princesses that she knows, sees, and has been taught. As kids they are very visual and want to experience things for themselves through copying and role playing.</p>
<p>This has made me think about how we as Sikhs have some serious work to do in relation to our Kaurs. In general most of the time when Sikhs are explained in terms of identity, we put forward the image of the Sikh Man and a Turban. Sikh women are kind of a shadow in the background not really part of the picture. </p>
<p>This brings up questions of Sikh identity as women.&nbsp; In recent times most Sikh women haven&#8217;t worn turbans and don&#8217;t really have a visually distinct identity as a Sikh. As a result I think Sikh women have blended more into western society falling under the radar and maybe even more easily giving up their Sikh practices because they don&#8217;t have to deal with the outward challenges of looking different like a man does, wearing a turban and beard. You might notice a Kara on their wrist and MAYBE a chuni covering their head, but overall there isn&#8217;t anything distinct for most Sikh women to stand out in society to identify themselves as Sikhs.</p>
<p><img alt="Charanjeet Kaur and her Friend Siri Adi Kaur" title="Charanjeet Kaur and her Friend Siri Adi Kaur" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_1237.jpg" height="367" width="550"></p>
<p>So as I think of my daughter and the things she is learning It makes me more conscious of how I really have a lot of work to do to establish a connection for her as a Sikh; to balance and counter the other influences that she has. She goes to school with mostly non-Sikh kids who wear their hair down and also copy movie characters. She wants to fit in and be like them, though as Sikhs a big part of who we are is to stand out and be uniquely identifiable.&nbsp; </p>
</p>
<p>So again I think, what is the identity of a Sikh woman? What makes her stand out and say &quot;I am a Kaur and daughter of Guru Gobind Singh!&quot; Would Guru Gobind Singh know she was a Sikh if he saw her? When I leave the house this what I ask myself to make sure I represent the Guru and am dressed appropriately. </p>
<p><img alt="" title="" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2713-1.jpg" height="367" width="550"></p>
<p>I think over time we have gotten used to two sets of rules of being a Sikh in relation to men and women and slowly this is eating away the female Sikh identity. As a man, having a beard and turban is something that makes me consciously choose and live a certain way since I stand out. When a Sikh man cuts his hair or stops wearing a turban everyone notices! With most Sikh women compromises are less noticed and they don&#8217;t have the pressure of looking different, so it is often accepted when looking like an every day western woman. </p>
<p>For me I&#8217;m just thinking about what I can do to help my daughter and other young Sikh girls. Most of the stories that kids hear in Sikh history are stories of men, with very few of women. Seeing my daughter and what she is becoming interested in is making it apparent how important it is to create more Sikh media geared towards girls. Yes, there has been one animated Sikh movie so far (<a href="http://www.sundrithemovie.com/" title="" target="_blank">Sundri</a>), which is great, however we need much more and more often.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.sikhnet.com/stories" title="" target="_blank">We already produce fun and educational regular audio stories for kids on SikhNet</a>, however visual media is really key and the next step. We have been planning and thinking about how to produce regular semi-animated video Sikh story episodes cost effectively&#8230;but cost is always the limitation (especially when you are wanting to make it available freely). I estimate that it would cost about $2,000 per video story episode and if we were to produce two each month (24 per year) that would be about $48,000 per year. And that is not even for full animation&#8230;but simple motion based illustrations/moving characters. We&#8217;ll probably need to find people to sponsor episodes to make this work.</p>
<p>I think creating Sikh media for kids is very important and something I personally want to work on, however I think what is most important is what happens at home between the children and the parents. It is making me realize how I have to really spend more quality time with my daughter to immerse her in the Sikh history and lifestyle in a way that she can experience for herself. Sikh media is just one of the tools to help. </p>
<p><img style="margin-left: 15px" alt="Charanjeet trying on Arjan's turban after she took it off." title="Charanjeet trying on Arjan's turban after she took it off." src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_5287.jpg" align="right" height="375" width="250">Every morning myself and my wife get up early in the morning and do our Sadhana (daily spiritual practice of banis, meditation, kundalini yoga, prayers, etc) and our kids see us do this and then want to model and copy that. Teaching by example is probably the best tool. From an early age with my son he has had a daily sadhana routine that he would pick out and do.&nbsp; In the same way we have started that for my daughter. We tell her&#8230;she is 4 years old and so can practice meditating for 4 minutes each day (one minute for each year). We try to involved our kids so that they are a part of what we do as Sikhs so they can have an experience and not just be watching on the sidelines.</p>
<p>If I don&#8217;t spend time and energy sharing this lifestyle with my children in a real way, then the mainstream media will just influence them be like the mainstream.&nbsp; They will have no real base of experience to root them to continuing to live the Sikh lifestyle when they are older. This is a big reason why my son is in boarding school at <a href="http://www.miripiriacademy.org/" title="" target="_blank">Miri Piri Academy in Amritsar, India</a>. He is taking the next step in his journey to really &quot;root&quot; the values as a Sikh, so when he is older he has an experience and understanding that can help guide him when in duality (just as I did when I was his age!).</p>
<p>So, back to my daughter. For me and my family, we feel that a part of&nbsp; being a Kaur is standing out as a Sikh. One of the ways that we do so is by wearing a turban (both men and women). It&#8217;s a tool for change. For me&#8230; by wearing this crown it is like making a commitment to the Guru and offering yourself to be of service wherever you go. It&#8217;s a signboard that says&#8230; I am a spiritual man/women of God. My challenge is to instill these values in my kids so they value it and choose to live the lifestyle of a GurSikh.</p>
<p><img alt="" title="" src="http://www.mrsikhnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Princess.jpg" height="310" width="550">&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think each and every one of us has to go through some form of this for ourselves and our children, and decide how we want to live our life as a person&#8230;.and as a Sikh. </p>
<p><strong><a style="background-color: #ffff66" href="http://www.sikhnet.com/news/becoming-princess" title="" target="_blank">It was very inspiring reading about another young Sikh girl (Harminder Kaur) sharing her experience of &quot;Becoming a Princess&quot;</a><span style="background-color: #ffff66">. </span>Definitely read the article! </strong>It seems that she went through the same type of things that my daughter is going through now. I don&#8217;t think these experience are unique, since I see this happening everywhere. A turban for a women is just another way to crown one self and stand out in a unique way. It is not reserved for men or Amritdhari&#8217;s and so those that want to take this leap will benefit from this tool. </p>
<p>So, I don&#8217;t have the answer or the &quot;right way&quot;, but I share these thoughts for us all to think about since I have often felt it was odd how women take a backstage role all the time in the Sikh world these days.</p>

<p>Shanti  Kaur shares her ideas about the Universality of Sikhism and the specific discipline of the Rehit given by Guru Gobind Singh. Are Sikhs who keep the Rehit better than ones that don&#8217;t?

<p><strong>At this very special and sacred time of year, Sikhs all over the world are about to celebrate Guru Nanak Dev Ji&#8217;s 541st Gurpurab together with great love and affection.

<p>    In thinking and writing about Guru Ji and his life lately, I&#8217;ve been thinking of his constant consciousness of seva, and how he brought people together, despite their apparent differences, wherever he tirelessly travelled. Many SikhNet visitors have been inspired to write to us asking how they can do some seva for SikhNet.

Then you can invite your friends and family to JOIN THE TEAM&nbsp; and/or DONATE to support SikhNet through your project.&nbsp;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong>Use Guru Nanak Dev Ji&#8217;s Gurpurb as a motivating drive to start one of these projects &amp; complete it in the coming weeks.</strong></p>
<p>    All the funds that you raise for SikhNet will go to create more youth related services on SikhNet in 2011, and to carry on sharing the Gurus teachings.</p>
