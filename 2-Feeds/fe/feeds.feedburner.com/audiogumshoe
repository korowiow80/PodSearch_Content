<p><strong>The Minor Leagues</strong> have been on Audio Gumshoe twice as feature artists [Shows <a href="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/2006/07/16/ag-57-the-minor-leagues/">57</a> and <a href="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/2009/12/27/the-minor-leagues-ag119/">119</a>] and twice on review shows [<a href="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/2007/09/23/two-year-anniversary-audio-gumshoe-85/">85 - Two Year Anniversary</a> and <a href="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/2010/01/01/ag120/">120 - 2009 Review</a>]. Why do I continue to add them? Obviously, I like the band. I enjoy the sound that they create and they continue to create more music. I have often mentioned that I play music on the show that I like. That is no mystery. The music I share with listeners comes from all around the globe. For me, it is refreshing that some of these sounds come from less than 30 miles south of my home.</p>
<p><a href="http://theminorleagues.bandcamp.com/"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-1489" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 10px;" title="351" src="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/351-275x250.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="225" /></a>According to Michael Bond at <a href="http://datawaslost.net">Datawaslost.net</a>, North College Hill is the latest release from The Minor Leagues. It was recorded at <a href="http://www.thebutchershoppestudio.com/">The Butcher Shoppe</a> in Nashville, Tennessee. The band recorded the bulk of the tracks during a week in Summer, 2010 with producer Sean Sullivan. In my opinion, the effort has yielded a solid production, full of the gangly Brit-pop that I&#8217;ve so enjoyed from previous TML releases. Vocals are smooth, harmonies are tight and the retro-feel draws me in every time I listen.</p>
<p>Mike Breen, of Cincinnati-area <em><a href="http://www.citybeat.com/cincinnati/blog-2080-new-minor-leagues-single-video.html">CityBeat</a></em> said,</p>
<blockquote><p>The Minor Leagues have not only become known for their amazingly melodic Pop tunes, but also for their dedication to the &#8220;concept album&#8221; concept.</p></blockquote>
<p>So true. What amazes me is the way that the band can build a concept album with themes that are often dark or melancholy and make me feel happy listening. The combination of strings, trumpet, and pop harmonies seem to give it a luster that one wouldn&#8217;t expect from such a theme. I&#8217;m not sure why, but it works.</p>

...this new album continues the streak with ten songs of bittersweet rust-pop about North College Hill, lead singer Ben Walpole's crumbling Midwestern hometown. The band paints a baroque portrait of the neighborhood-as-history, detailing childhood memories in a faded palette of strings, bells, and guitar jangle.
The Minor Leagues have been on Audio Gumshoe twice as feature artists [Shows 57 and 119] and twice on review shows [85 - Two Year Anniversary and 120 - 2009 Review]. Why do I continue to add them? Obviously, I like the band. I enjoy the sound that they create and they continue to create more music. I have often mentioned that I play music on the show that I like. That is no mystery. The music I share with listeners comes from all around the globe. For me, it is refreshing that some of these sounds come from less than 30 miles south of my home.

According to Michael Bond at Datawaslost.net, North College Hill is the latest release from The Minor Leagues. It was recorded at The Butcher Shoppe in Nashville, Tennessee. The band recorded the bulk of the tracks during a week in Summer, 2010 with producer Sean Sullivan. In my opinion, the effort has yielded a solid production, full of the gangly Brit-pop that I've so enjoyed from previous TML releases.

Mike Breen, of Cincinnati-area CityBeat said,

So true. What amazes me is the way that the band can build a concept album with themes that are often dark or melancholy and make me feel happy listening. The combination of strings, trumpet, and pop harmonies seem to give it a luster that one wouldn't expect from such a theme. I'm not sure why, but it works.

<blockquote><p>Sissy Mena (mean-uh) is a three-piece sonic rock band from Chicago. They play loud and quiet and fast and slow, all with their hands</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Record-Machine-COVER.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1462" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; border-width: 0px; margin: 10px;" title="Sissy Mena - Record Machine" src="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Record-Machine-COVER.jpg" alt="Album cover art for Record Machine by Sissy Mena" width="250" height="250" /></a>It was time for me to find another band that had a kick-butt, powerful, presence. I found this with the band <strong>Sissy Mena</strong>. This Chicago three-piece released the full-length LP <em><a href="http://music.sissymena.com/album/record-machine">Record Machine</a></em> in November 2011. The band was gracious enough to provide a copy so that I could share some of the tunes with you. If you like what you hear in this episode, please visit the links below to purchase your own copy of <em><a href="http://music.sissymena.com/album/record-machine">Record Machine</a></em>.</p>
<p>While listening to this band I was glad to hear familiar sounds that I might have heard in the 90s, but I found this fresh and new, as well. There&#8217;s a lot of energy here. The hooks are tight, the production is solid, the rhythm is danceable while maintaining a rock foundation. Nice.</p>
<p><em>Record Machine</em> comes to us 14 months after the release of the band&#8217;s EP <em><a href="http://music.sissymena.com/album/young-girl">Young Girl</a></em>. Here&#8217;s what Sissy Mena promotion material has to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Released in late 2009, the Young Girl EP drew positive reviews from The Onion&#8217;s AV Club, Illinois Entertainer, Loud Loop Press, Timeout Chicago, and many more. Sissy Mena&#8217;s combination of effected guitar and pounding rhythm section drew comparisons to 90&#8242;s heros such as Dinosaur Jr., My Bloody Valentine, and the Smashing Pumpkins.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to check out all of <a href="#links">the band&#8217;s links</a>; they are included below. If you are in the Chicago area, you can <a href="http://sissymena.com/shows.html">find them at the Beat Kitchen</a> in February</p>

Sissy Mena (mean-uh) is a three-piece sonic rock band from Chicago. They play loud and quiet and fast and slow, all with their hands
It was time for me to find another band that had a kick-butt, powerful, presence. I found this with the band Sissy Mena. This Chicago three-piece released the full-length LP Record Machine in November 2011. The band was gracious enough to provide a copy so that I could share some of the tunes with you. If you like what you hear in this episode, please visit the links below to purchase your own copy of Record Machine.

While listening to this band I was glad to hear familiar sounds that I might have heard in the 90s, but I found this fresh and new, as well. There's a lot of energy here. The hooks are tight, the production is solid, the rhythm is danceable while maintaining a rock foundation. Nice.

Record Machine comes to us 14 months after the release of the band's EP Young Girl. Here's what Sissy Mena promotion material has to say:
Released in late 2009, the Young Girl EP drew positive reviews from The Onion's AV Club, Illinois Entertainer, Loud Loop Press, Timeout Chicago, and many more. Sissy Mena's combination of effected guitar and pounding rhythm section drew comparisons to 90's heros such as Dinosaur Jr., My Bloody Valentine, and the Smashing Pumpkins.
Don't forget to check out all of the band's links; they are included below. If you are in the Chicago area, you can find them at the Beat Kitchen in February

The band features a single snare drum and washboard played by RTB2’s Grady Don Sandlin, plus an upright bass, mandolin, fiddle, banjo, guitar, and some of the best vocal harmonies this side of the Red River.</p>
<p>Boxcar Bandits would be comfortable playing on a stage, a street corner, or a front porch. Their mixture of gospel, country, and bluegrass – or “fastgrass” as they call it – is exactly what was needed to get fans to the dance floor at the Boiler Room.</p></blockquote>

Equally at home at a beer joint or concert hall, the Bandits meld old-time, bluegrass, western swing and country with the sounds of string band instruments to create the “North Texas Skunkgrass” sound.
It seemed time to offer something out-of-the-ordinary on Audio Gumshoe. Though this statement itself may a bit ironic. There's not a typical -- or usual -- sound for this show. I've offered big rock, pop, Americana, trance, metal, blues, outlaw country, rockabilly, latin, world-music, looped acoustic, and even "industrial-tinged alternative folk". So, why not a bit of "skunkgrass?"

So, I get a submission from Brooks Kendall, Jr. of Flight Music Group telling me about this band out of Denton, Texas called Boxcar Bandits. I don't listen to bluegrass music, typically, but as soon as I previewed these tracks I was hooked. This is just feel-good music. The fact that these are live tracks gives these selections even more vitality. The ambience of the club, the audience, and the stage conversation lends a feeling of "being there" that makes this a great listen.

Each of the songs on this episode is from the new album "Live from Dan's Silverleaf" released in November by Boxcar Bandits. When you listen to the full album, you'll hear the crowd enjoying the music, you'll hear the band talking to each other, you'll hear warts-and-all. And that's what makes this a fun collection. Get a copy. If you're in the Denton, Texas area -- or near any of the venues listed on their show calendar -- go hear them live. They play at Dan's Silverleaf almost every Monday.

Here's what Pegasus News recently had to say about the band:

<p>- They&#8217;ll Strike You Out<br />
- Hypnotizer<br />
- On Your Way<br />
- Right On<br />
- Wily, Tricky, Foxy, Sharp //</p>
<blockquote><p>Swedish rock act Stone Antica was first described as a local funk/rock band. Over the years their sound has developed into something more unique with rougher riffs and louder songs, though their funky roots can still be heard in their music even today.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.stoneantica.com"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1361" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid; margin: 10px;" title="Stone Antica Logo" src="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/StoneAntica_Logo-250x250.jpg" alt="Logo image for the band Stone Antica" width="200" height="200" /></a>It doesn&#8217;t seem that there&#8217;s ever been a Swedish band on Audio Gumshoe, but I might have to search back through the archives to be sure. The closest that I may have come is when I featured <a href="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/2010/05/16/robert-rolfe-feddersen-audio-gumshoe-126/">Robert Rolfe Feddersen</a>, but that can&#8217;t be right, either. He&#8217;s from Crown Pointe, Indiana. Regardless, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s about time.</p>
<p>If you are into driving rock and roll, tinged with some funk undertones, and a bit of raw blues tone for good measure, this is probably a good fit for you. Stone Antica presented their material to me back in the summer of 2011. They were then working on the final touches of their self-titled debut album. They had released the track, &#8220;They&#8217;ll Strike You Out,&#8221; on iTunes and Spotify. I submitted it for play on <a href="http://amped.musicpodcasting.org/">AMPed New Music Weekly</a> <a href="http://amped.libsyn.com/webpage/am-ped-show-293">Show #293</a>; it is the first song you will hear on this episode of Audio Gumshoe.</p>
<p>With the exception of a laid-back, smooth intro on &#8220;On Your Way&#8221; each of these tracks drives forward with high-energy rhythm, solid guitar work and well sung vocals. The solid production helps take Stone Antica away from their self-proclaimed &#8220;struggling basement band&#8221; status. It is quality rock and roll &#8212; deserving of world-wide audiences.<a href="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/2011/11/27/stone-antica-audio-gumshoe-151/album_cover_small/" rel="attachment wp-att-1365"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1365" style="border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid; margin: 10px;" title="Stone Antica Album Cover" src="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Album_Cover_small-291x250.jpg" alt="Image for Stone Antica album" width="233" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>The band describes the steps taken to help them achieve final release of the album &#8220;Stone Antica&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>[It was] was recorded at three different locations in 2010. Drum sessions were made in a wooden cabin to get that authentic and warm sound they were looking for. Both bass and guitar were later recorded in a borrowed studio an hour drive away. It was a fine place, but unfortunately very time consuming, and it was exhausting to get there. Therefore the band moved to the third and last location, in a studio right next to our rehearsal place, where they laid down the vocals and added the finishing touches.</p></blockquote>

- They'll Strike You Out
- Hypnotizer
- On Your Way
- Right On
- Wily, Tricky, Foxy, Sharp //
Swedish rock act Stone Antica was first described as a local funk/rock band. Over the years their sound has developed into something more unique with rougher riffs and louder songs, though their funky roots can still be heard in their music even today.
It doesn't seem that there's ever been a Swedish band on Audio Gumshoe, but I might have to search back through the archives to be sure. The closest that I may have come is when I featured Robert Rolfe Feddersen, but that can't be right, either. He's from Crown Pointe, Indiana. Regardless, I'd say it's about time.

If you are into driving rock and roll, tinged with some funk undertones, and a bit of raw blues tone for good measure, this is probably a good fit for you. Stone Antica presented their material to me back in the summer of 2011. They were then working on the final touches of their self-titled debut album. They had released the track, "They'll Strike You Out," on iTunes and Spotify. I submitted it for play on AMPed New Music Weekly Show #293; it is the first song you will hear on this episode of Audio Gumshoe.

With the exception of a laid-back, smooth intro on "On Your Way" each of these tracks drives forward with high-energy rhythm, solid guitar work and well sung vocals. The solid production helps take Stone Antica away from their self-proclaimed "struggling basement band" status. It is quality rock and roll -- deserving of world-wide audiences.

The band describes the steps taken to help them achieve final release of the album "Stone Antica":
[It was] was recorded at three different locations in 2010. Drum sessions were made in a wooden cabin to get that authentic and warm sound they were looking for. Both bass and guitar were later recorded in a borrowed studio an hour drive away. It was a fine place, but unfortunately very time consuming, and it was exhausting to get there. Therefore the band moved to the third and last location, in a studio right next to our rehearsal place, where they laid down the vocals and added the finishing touches.

I&#8217;m a closet blues fan (perhaps someone will remember my old show &#8220;Blogs, Views and Blues&#8221;?) and always enjoy tracks that dig in, rock the beat a bit, yet maintain the feel and passion of the genre. <strong>The Blue News</strong> does that.</p>
<p>The band has some great news and credit to their name, too. Recently, they were notified that their song &#8220;Two Lovers&#8221; is featured on the &#8220;Fresh Cuts&#8221; CD Compilation released by Guitar Center. This volume is not yet released, but we&#8217;re told that upcoming Volume 7 will also feature Sublime With Rome (formerly Sublime).

<p>Songs heard on this episode of <strong>Audio Gumshoe</strong> are from the EP <em>Wartime Songs</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The album consists of 6 new songs recorded by legendary studio &#8220;guru&#8221; <strong>Jim Devito</strong> at Retrophonics Recording Studios in St. Augustine, FL. The album was mixed at RadioStar Studios in Weed, CA by Fernando Flores with famed producer <strong>Sylvia Massy</strong>! Sylvia worked with Rick Rubin in the 90s and has worked in the studio with Tool, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Johnny Cash and many more multi-platinum artists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another great credit for the band: The songs &#8220;Hitman Blues&#8221; and &#8220;Just a Game&#8221; can be found on Rock Band 3. Previous releases &#8220;So Easy&#8221; and &#8220;You&#8217;ve Got Someone&#8221; are found on Rock Band 2. Not bad, eh?</p>
<p>Oh, and if you want to be a triva buff, The Blues News are connected to Kevin Bacon through the legendary six steps of separation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes, The Blues News has reached the status of being connected to Kevin Bacon through six degrees of separation.</p>
<p>Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon<br />
1. The Blue News recorded with Jim Devito<br />
2. Jim Devito recorded Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers<br />
3. Tom Petty&#8217;s video for Into The Great Wide Open starred Johnny Depp<br />
4. Johnny Depp starred with actor Benicio Del Toro in Fear &amp; Loathing In Las Vegas<br />
5. Benicio Del Toro starred in 21 Grams with Sean Penn<br />

<h3>The FMC Mission</h3>
<p>Future of Music Coalition is a national nonprofit organization that works to ensure a diverse musical culture where artists flourish, are compensated fairly for their work, and where fans can find the music they want.</p>
<h3>About the Future of Music Coalition</h3>
<p>FMC’s work is rooted in the real-world experiences and ambitions of working musicians, whose perspectives are often overlooked in policy debates. Over the years, FMC has provided an important forum for discussion about issues at the intersection of music, technology, policy and law. Guided by a firm conviction that public policy has real impact on the lives of both musicians and fans, FMC advocates for a balanced approach to music in the digital age — one that reflects the interests of all stakeholders, and not just the powerful few. By documenting historic and emerging trends in the music industry, FMC has become a trusted voice in the ongoing dialog about the challenges and opportunities facing today’s musicians. In fighting for a legitimate digital music marketplace and a broadcast media that values local and independent culture, FMC helps establish a healthier music ecosystem.</p>

<blockquote><p>In late 2009, a recording engineer (Sheldon Gomberg) and a friend of his drove by a garage sale, in Tarzana, CA; and noticed a stack of 2 inch tape boxes. After a brief discussion with the homeowner, he found out that the tapes had apparently been left in a closet, under the stairs of her home, and were there when she moved in. She found the tapes when the wood floors of the house were being refinished. She was the fourth owner of the home, which was built (according to her) in 1972. There were 23 boxes of tape; which Sheldon bought for the forty-seven bucks that he had in his wallet, at the time.</p>
<p>Sheldon took the tapes back to his recording studio The Carriage House in Silverlake, and cracked them open. The only information in the boxes were song lists with the name “Sloan Kramer” written by hand, beside each title. A quick count of the titles totaled slightly over one hundred songs!</p>
<p>Sheldon had the tapes baked (to avoid delamination) and digitized, for playback in Pro Tools.</p></blockquote>

In late 2009, a recording engineer (Sheldon Gomberg) and a friend of his drove by a garage sale, in Tarzana, CA; and noticed a stack of 2 inch tape boxes. After a brief discussion with the homeowner, he found out that the tapes had apparently been left in a closet, under the stairs of her home, and were there when she moved in. She found the tapes when the wood floors of the house were being refinished. She was the fourth owner of the home, which was built (according to her) in 1972. There were 23 boxes of tape; which Sheldon bought for the forty-seven bucks that he had in his wallet, at the time.

Sheldon took the tapes back to his recording studio The Carriage House in Silverlake, and cracked them open. The only information in the boxes were song lists with the name “Sloan Kramer” written by hand, beside each title. A quick count of the titles totaled slightly over one hundred songs!

Sheldon had the tapes baked (to avoid delamination) and digitized, for playback in Pro Tools.
And if you want to know more about what happened to these songs -- and the entire back story behind Secret Skwirl (and Sheldon Gomberg) you should listen to the podcast.

I’ve been likened to Dallas Green, John Martin, Nick Drake and Elvis Costello, but I like to think that I’ve developed my own distinctive sound.
Singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Nick Tann is reaching toward a goal. You can help. I've decided to keep my comments to a minimum on this post (please listen to the audio). Instead, I've let Nick do the talking as seen at his own site:

In 2009 myself and Matt Stevens came up with the idea of me recording an album funded by fans and supporters. To give it a bit of an edge I decided that I wanted to record it live (hence keeping down costs) AND to produce a vinyl copy hence The Vinyl Project was born.

In March 2011 I went into Livingston Studios and recorded eight live tracks in-front of a specially invited audience.

You will get your name on the credits of the finished vinyl plus a small picture of you if you wish.

I still need quite a few more donations to make this happen so I really need your help.

<h3>Songs Played</h3>
<p>- This Is It<br />
- Topsy Turvy<br />
- In a Coffee Shop, When<br />
- Talk About the Love<br />
- Welcome to Your Love</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine a dinner party hosted by the Beatles, with a guest list that includes XTC, Squeeze, the Zombies and Kinks, Aimee Mann and Elvis Costello. Melodic, hook-driven songs with narrative lyrics. Retro and fresh. Drenched in harmony.</p></blockquote>
<p>I first played Andy Stone&#8217;s music on Audio Gumshoe way back in March 2007. I had found a number of musicians that sounded to me to be &#8220;Beatle-esque.&#8221; The song &#8220;In a Coffee Shop, When&#8221; stuck in my head; I found myself humming and repeating the hooks and catchy melody time and again.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to Spring 2011. Andy contacted me to let me know of his new EP &#8220;This is It&#8221;. I listened to the tracks he submitted to the show and again found myself humming and singing the songs. His tunes are catchy. They nod toward a retro-pop sound, yet sound fresh and new. The production is solid and the lyrics will stick in your head better than most new releases today.</p>

I felt, at the time, that there was a true George Harrison quality to his delivery on the EP. Some people might remember Malone from his days as vocalist for Diving for Pearls &#8212; or for his work with Elliot Easton (from the Cars).</p>
<p>On the 2010 full-length album &#8220;You Don&#8217;t See Many of These Nowadays&#8221; Stone brought in the talents of some of Chicago&#8217;s finest vocalists: <a href="http://www.myspace.com/philangotti">Phil Angotti</a>, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/cynics">Mike Przygoda</a>, and Tom Godsman, lead singer/songwriter for the Bethesda, MD based group Accidental Charm. I played the song &#8220;Talk About the Love&#8221; from this album.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll hear all three of the songs from Andy&#8217;s latest EP &#8220;This is It&#8221; on the show. Be sure to pick up a copy of the EP &#8212; and his other releases. You&#8217;ll find all of the links below.</p>
<p>I should mention, also, that Andy Stone is an author. He has two books to his credit. You can find information about both at his book page at <a href="http://andystoneonline.com/books.html">AndyStoneOnline</a>.</p>

Imagine a dinner party hosted by the Beatles, with a guest list that includes XTC, Squeeze, the Zombies and Kinks, Aimee Mann and Elvis Costello. Melodic, hook-driven songs with narrative lyrics. Retro and fresh. Drenched in harmony.
I first played Andy Stone's music on Audio Gumshoe way back in March 2007. I had found a number of musicians that sounded to me to be "Beatle-esque." The song "In a Coffee Shop, When" stuck in my head; I found myself humming and repeating the hooks and catchy melody time and again.

Fast-forward to Spring 2011. Andy contacted me to let me know of his new EP "This is It". I listened to the tracks he submitted to the show and again found myself humming and singing the songs. His tunes are catchy. They nod toward a retro-pop sound, yet sound fresh and new. The production is solid and the lyrics will stick in your head better than most new releases today.

Andy has employed some solid vocalists for his projects. "In a Coffee Shop, When" exhibited the talents of Epic recording artist Danny Malone. I felt, at the time, that there was a true George Harrison quality to his delivery on the EP. Some people might remember Malone from his days as vocalist for Diving for Pearls -- or for his work with Elliot Easton (from the Cars).

On the 2010 full-length album "You Don't See Many of These Nowadays" Stone brought in the talents of some of Chicago's finest vocalists: Phil Angotti, Mike Przygoda, and Tom Godsman, lead singer/songwriter for the Bethesda, MD based group Accidental Charm.

<h3>Songs Played</h3>
<p>- Time Will Heal<br />
- Blood Eyes Sunrise<br />
- U Without Me<br />
- Set You Free<br />
- More Than This</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I really enjoyed your music. You have a great voice and the chord structure of the chorus (Run Away) is very unique&#8230; Thank you for letting me listen.&#8221; &#8211; Jack Douglas &#8211; Producer (John Lennon, Aerosmith, New York Dolls, Miles Davis)</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/33752"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1191" style="margin: 10px;" title="Kristian down the neck" src="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/kristian_jackson_perspective-300x222.png" alt="" width="144" height="107" /></a>Kristian Jackson submitted his music to me after reaching out to Erk at <a href="http://echoromeokilo.com/">ErkFM</a> and <a href="http://australia.insomniaradio.net">Insomnia Radio: Australia</a>. I couldn&#8217;t have been happier. Jackson&#8217;s album &#8220;Blood Eyes Sunrise&#8221; is one of the finest independent productions I&#8217;ve heard this year. As a multi-instrumentalist, he brings a wealth of talent to the album, not only as the singer-songwriter, but as a performing artist. Production by <a href="http://seancarey.com.au/">Sean Carey</a> (Thirsty Merc) is top notch.</p>
<p>Kristian talks about his music on his site bio:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s no reason why popular music can’t be both interesting and accessible. I&#8217;m trying to make music with enough depth to sustain the interest of the most discerning listener while simultaneously capturing the heart of a mass audience.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://kristianjackson.com"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1196" style="margin: 10px;" title="Kristian on keys" src="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/kristian_jackson_keys-300x234.png" alt="" width="240" height="187" /></a>If you live in Sydney, Australia, you&#8217;ve like already heard him perform. If not, you must find out when he will be on stage. He&#8217;s a regular participant on the local music scene; you can find his show schedule at his <a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/33752">ReverbNation profile</a>. Be sure to also follow him at all the regular social haunts. The links are included in this post. You can also follow his latest news on <a href="http://news.kristianjacksonmusic.com/">his blog</a>.</p>
<p>This would typically be the point where I would wax on about the performer&#8217;s skills, their style, or my thoughts on the music. I can&#8217;t really do much more than to recommend that you listen to this show &#8212; and purchase Kristian Jackson&#8217;s album &#8220;Blood Eyes Sunrise&#8221; using one of the links below. If you enjoy it as much as I, you&#8217;ll be glad that you did.</p>

<p><strong>Before you go</strong>: Let me tell you about a cool site for both musicians and listeners alike. <a href="http://thestage.tv">TheStage.tv</a> is the &#8220;world&#8217;s open mic&#8221;. I&#8217;ve been visiting the site from time to time, to listen and to play. Musicians from all around the world get together in an open mic format to share their talent, try new tunes, get critique, and to just have a great time.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some info direct from the site:</p>
<blockquote><p>TheStage.tv is a one-of-a-kind live video open mic format where audience feedback determines how long a performer takes control of TheStage.</p>

"I really enjoyed your music. You have a great voice and the chord structure of the chorus (Run Away) is very unique... Thank you for letting me listen." - Jack Douglas - Producer (John Lennon, Aerosmith, New York Dolls, Miles Davis)
Kristian Jackson submitted his music to me after reaching out to Erk at ErkFM and Insomnia Radio: Australia. I couldn't have been happier. Jackson's album "Blood Eyes Sunrise" is one of the finest independent productions I've heard this year. As a multi-instrumentalist, he brings a wealth of talent to the album, not only as the singer-songwriter, but as a performing artist. Production by Sean Carey (Thirsty Merc) is top notch.

Kristian talks about his music on his site bio:
“There’s no reason why popular music can’t be both interesting and accessible. I'm trying to make music with enough depth to sustain the interest of the most discerning listener while simultaneously capturing the heart of a mass audience.”
If you live in Sydney, Australia, you've like already heard him perform. If not, you must find out when he will be on stage. He's a regular participant on the local music scene; you can find his show schedule at his ReverbNation profile. Be sure to also follow him at all the regular social haunts. The links are included in this post. You can also follow his latest news on his blog.

This would typically be the point where I would wax on about the performer's skills, their style, or my thoughts on the music. I can't really do much more than to recommend that you listen to this show -- and purchase Kristian Jackson's album "Blood Eyes Sunrise" using one of the links below. If you enjoy it as much as I, you'll be glad that you did.

Before you go: Let me tell you about a cool site for both musicians and listeners alike. TheStage.tv is the "world's open mic". I've been visiting the site from time to time, to listen and to play. Musicians from all around the world get together in an open mic format to share their talent, try new tunes, get critique, and to just have a great time.

Here's some info direct from the site:
TheStage.tv is a one-of-a-kind live video open mic format where audience feedback determines how long a performer takes control of TheStage.

TheStage.tv was developed by entrepreneurs who love the arts and entertainment and want to give web audiences the power to share real-time feedback with performers. As well, we did our best to replicate the experience of a contemporary venue where performers can hear the audience cheer, as if they were really performing. And just like in Vaudeville, the audience can still throw them a gold coin! :) The patent-pending queuing process of TheStage.tv allows an audience to interact with performers like never before!

Creators and staff of TheStage.tv are wonderfully appreciative of EVERYONE who has performed (and will perform) on TheStage.tv, and hope we contribute positively to your performance enjoyment. For audiences, we hope you enjoy our merging of entertainment and the "real-time web" to create a fun and addicting form of entertainment.

"Like the Black Crowes, the Muggs make no apologies for their retro influences, but unlike Chris Robinson's crew this band has drawn inspiration from a number of sources and learned to fuse them into something that has a personality of its own..." -- AllMusic.com
We last heard The Muggs on Audio Gumshoe 102 following the release of their album "On With The Show". Their first appearance on Audio Gumshoe was back in October 2007 just as the band was competing on the Fox network show The Next Big American Band.

<p>I have enjoyed many varieties of progressive music through the years.

<p>I&#8217;ll be honest: I wasn&#8217;t impressed by Doug Rausch&#8217;s vocals at first. But that&#8217;s not the only quality that I use to determine what music will be featured on the show.

It&#8217;s not often that I find artists that raise my eyebrows and make me take notice as soon as I listen. If I were to put out shows featuring every submission provided to Audio Gumshoe, you would have two or three shows a week. But, in my opinion, they would be mundane and often full of content that would make you turn away. I sift through many songs to decide if an artist should be featured. Sometimes I find single nuggets that <em>might</em> make the cut for a pinched track episode, but often I scratch the entire submission because I don&#8217;t think one good song is enough to help you become a fan.</p>
<p><strong>Skittish</strong> is one of the groups that made me dig through their entire catalog. They offered a few quality songs that gave me enough clues to understand that there was no formula songwriting taking place here. Instead, they offer so many different textures, so many new sounds in each song that each becomes a new experience. Indie-folk isn&#8217;t enough to describe their kaleidoscope of tunes on the double album &#8220;The Perfect Shade of Green.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://iamskittish.com"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1112" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 10px;" title="Skittish Promo Image" src="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/skittish_duo-236x300.png" alt="duo image of Skittish" width="236" height="300" /></a>The bio on their site at <a href="http://iamskittish.com">iamskittish.com</a> describes this third album release:</p>
<blockquote><p>The two sides that make up &#8216;The Perfect Shade of Green&#8217; play off each other like tennis pros. With themes and references being lobbed back and forth from the rocking first side that sounds like The Pixies if they played in the sixties, to the weirder folky side, which has the feel of the Carpenters scoring a Tim Burton movie.</p></blockquote>
<p>I first heard their music (though they had already submitted tracks to me) when I was putting together the <a href="http://amped.libsyn.com/am-ped-show-270">AMPed New Music Weekly episode</a> that I hosted on February 14. <strong>Justin Wayne</strong>, of the <a href="http://thejustinwayneshow.com/">Justin Wayne Show</a>, had submitted the track &#8220;Love Songs and Lullabyes&#8221;. I was immediately hooked. The celtic sound grabbed me and I knew I had to learn more about the band. I was searching for their info when I realized that I had a folder sitting on my computer with the four tracks I share in this episode. Unfortunately for the artist I submitted to that show, they bumped him down on the queue for this episode of Audio Gumshoe.</p>
<p>Please listen to this show to hear four great tracks of many from &#8220;The Perfect Shade of Green&#8221;. If you like the tunes here, find out more at <a href="http://iamskittish.com">iamskittish.com</a>.</p>

Skittish is one of the groups that made me dig through their entire catalog. They offered a few quality songs that gave me enough clues to understand that there was no formula songwriting taking place here. Instead, they offer so many different textures, so many new sounds in each song that each becomes a new experience. Indie-folk isn't enough to describe their kaleidoscope of tunes on the double album "The Perfect Shade of Green."

The bio on their site at iamskittish.com describes this third album release:
The two sides that make up 'The Perfect Shade of Green' play off each other like tennis pros. With themes and references being lobbed back and forth from the rocking first side that sounds like The Pixies if they played in the sixties, to the weirder folky side, which has the feel of the Carpenters scoring a Tim Burton movie.
I first heard their music (though they had already submitted tracks to me) when I was putting together the AMPed New Music Weekly episode that I hosted on February 14. Justin Wayne, of the Justin Wayne Show, had submitted the track "Love Songs and Lullabyes". I was immediately hooked. The celtic sound grabbed me and I knew I had to learn more about the band. I was searching for their info when I realized that I had a folder sitting on my computer with the four tracks I share in this episode. Unfortunately for the artist I submitted to that show, they bumped him down on the queue for this episode of Audio Gumshoe.

Please listen to this show to hear four great tracks of many from "The Perfect Shade of Green". If you like the tunes here, find out more at iamskittish.com.

I feel a bit ashamed that I&#8217;ve not yet shared the music of <strong>Jesta</strong> with <strong>Audio Gumshoe</strong> listeners. It&#8217;s not as though he just started creating this stuff. And, some of the tunes on his album, Previously&#8230;, have been heard on other podcasts long before I put them on mine. It&#8217;s truly shameful. Really.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t say this lightly: This is one of my favorite albums. I&#8217;ve been listening to this time and again lately. Sure, sure, I&#8217;ve said that I have new favorites before. But tell me where else you can find an album with such diversity, such strong, tight hooks, such refined production? Okay, yes there are others. But this one&#8230; this is my favorite. I mean it this time. <img src='http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Jesta is, in my mind, a musical chameleon. The music on this album change colors as dynamically as a chamelon changes colors. The tones, the styles, the genre &#8212; he includes everything from pop to hip-hop, funk to soul, rock to metal. It&#8217;s all here. You like variety? Get this album (he needs to eat).</p>
<blockquote><p>The concept of Jesta began as a name for Bryan&#8217;s personal music projects at around the same time as he began work in a recording studio, shortly before leaving school. Honing his production and vocal skills over the years, it is now time for Jesta to conquer the world or at least earn enough money to buy a couple of sandwiches!</p></blockquote>

<h3>Songs Played</h3>
<p>- Dire<br />
- Find Myself<br />
- That Sensation<br />
- Rain</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;JP Corwyn isn’t quite “Stevie Wonder blind”, or “Ronnie Milsap blind”. But then, those icons would have made music regardless of what their eyes were capable of. Maybe they did it a little better than those who can see; maybe their intuition is stronger and their sense of the click-click-clicking of the world around them is more keen. JP Corwyn makes excellent music, of which you should really be aware, without his eyes, and with his hands, and with his mouth, and with his mind, and his hips, and his spine, and his legs and fingers and toes and nerves.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://jpcorwyn.sitezoogle.com"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1002" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 10px;" title="JP Corwyn Profile Photo" src="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/jp_corwyn_profile_photo-225x300.jpg" alt="JP Corwyn Profile Photo" width="180" height="240" /></a>Lately I&#8217;ve found myself more discerning and much more critical of the submissions to Audio Gumshoe. I wasn&#8217;t sure why, but I think it was because I was looking for something with a bit more &#8220;edge&#8221;; maybe something with more grit or punch. I needed to kick it up a bit.</p>
<p>As I delved into the many songs that had arrived in my drop box I kept finding music that didn&#8217;t satisfy this quest. Then, as I looked at the many suggestions provided by Sara and Christine at <strong><a href="http://arielpublicity.com/">Ariel Publicity</a></strong>, I found it. I found the music of <strong>JP Corwyn</strong>.</p>
<p>From his site:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;How could you be so blind? You haven’t heard of JP Corwyn? You haven’t seen him live? You haven’t heard his music? How embarrassing for you. Really, though. It’s ok. You’re in the right place. For JP, the rationale for the blind jokes is, well, reasonable. He is legally blind. Born with a degenerative condition, he has been legally blind since birth, with the shades pulling ever tighter throughout his as-yet-brief-but-potent life. This makes his genre tag of Blind Indie Rock make more sense. Otherwise, he’d just be sort of pretentious and snarky, but not in the fun depraved sit-com way. Corwyn’s vocal-driven indie rock style is infectious, reminiscent of Toad the Wet Sprocket’s Glen Phillips co-writing songs with Angie Aparo that get snatched by Adam Levine of Maroon 5, with occasional stomps into Creed and Pearl Jam-esque electric anthem territory.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/jpcorwyn/from/richpalmer"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-996" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 10px;" title="JP Corwyn Album IN PLAIN SIGHT" src="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/jpcorwyn_album.jpg" alt="Album Cover Image for In Plain Sight" width="160" height="160" /></a>It is apparent that JP has a great sense of humor &#8212; or at least acceptance of a life that could have taken him down other roads. Through it all, though, he has produced an EP and two full albums, including &#8220;<a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/jpcorwyn/from/richpalmer">In Plain Sight</a>&#8220;. The latest, The White Cane Conspiracy&#8221; will be released in January 2011. Working with multi-platinum producer <strong>Michael Seifert</strong>, he has grounded his sound more firmly on the acoustic side of indie rock. It has, as mentioned on his profile, &#8220;affirmed the great maturity of [his] songwriting.&#8221;</p>
<p>
I think you&#8217;ll dig the sounds of JP Corwyn. Give the show a listen, sample the four tracks featured, then find yourself at any of the links below to purchase more of his music. Show the love and I&#8217;m sure that JP will continue to give us more great tracks.</p>

"JP Corwyn isn’t quite “Stevie Wonder blind”, or “Ronnie Milsap blind”. But then, those icons would have made music regardless of what their eyes were capable of.

<em>Specifically as seen in film noir featuring <a id="aptureLink_2683IrEJF1" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective">gumshoe detectives</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Audio Gumshoe </strong>Pinched Tracks are songs that have been submitted to the show by artists hoping for play to potential new fans. Often, these artists don&#8217;t submit enough material to be featured artists. Their songs are still good, though, and worthy of playing at <strong>Audio Gumshoe</strong>. If you like these, please visit the artist links to find out more &#8212; and to purchase their music if it is available.</p>

<p>So <strong><a href="http://www.picktoclick.net/">Jersey Joe</a></strong> sends me an email that says that an awesome, young New Jersey band is giving away their CD for free. Tell me, who wouldn&#8217;t take a few moments to investigate the group to find out if it is &#8220;worth&#8221; getting the CD for free? Wait, how can a FREE CD have any worth? Truthfully, this one holds more value than can be realized by monetary gains.</p>

The stand out tracks for me are those that I&#8217;ve played in this episode of Audio Gumshoe, but I found it very difficult to refrain from trying to play the whole album for you. I hope that you&#8217;ll take the time to listen to the entire show &#8212; and if you like what you hear, download the songs for your listening pleasure, as well.

So Jersey Joe sends me an email that says that an awesome, young New Jersey band is giving away their CD for free. Tell me, who wouldn't take a few moments to investigate the group to find out if it is "worth" getting the CD for free? Wait, how can a FREE CD have any worth? Truthfully, this one holds more value than can be realized by monetary gains.

It is obvious that the band Escape Directors is learning from Ariel Hyatt's (CyberPR) "Music Success in Nine Weeks" program. It is a good thing, too. Because of their efforts, they are building momentum, generating buzz, creating hype -- whatever you want to call it. They are getting more listeners and earning more fans. Isn't this one of the points in creating music? Of course there is the gratification of the creative process. But, overall, I think it is always the greatest gratification to know that you've created something that others truly want to hear.

I jumped in with both feet (ears?) and downloaded the CD " Ladders". I found a very radio friendly collection of tunes. As an evangelist for independent music, you might think me an enemy of all things radio friendly. Not so. I simply don't like the same old commercialized, formulated, and often pop music factory assembled drivel that we seem to hear in rotation hour after hour. I can, however, appreciate that a band refines their craft, giving tedious attention to the production process, and building a product that is worth hearing, keeping, and even sharing.

<h2>Jordan Reyne</h2>
<h3>Songs Played</h3>
<p>- The Dead<br />
- The Proximity of Death<br />
- The Brave<br />
- Blood</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;an industrial-folk musician who uses 19th century factory noises, steam sounds, and celtic melody to tell folk tales in a new way.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.arielpublicity.com/">CyberPR</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Jordan Reyne</strong> stopped by my Facebook page to leave me a comment. Obviously curious, I visited her site to learn more about her. The opening of her site stated that Jordan Reyne is &#8220;industrial-tinged alternative folk, from the edges of the earth&#8221;. How could I not listen?</p>
<p><a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/jordanreyne/from/richpalmer"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-923" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 10px;" title="How the Dead Live - Album Art" src="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/13246.jpg" alt="Jordan Reyne - album art for How the Dead Live" width="200" height="200" /></a>What I discovered were songs from her 2008 release &#8220;<a href="http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/jordanreyne/from/richpalmer">How the Dead Live</a>&#8220;. This haunting collection of music is captivating, as well. It drew me in to the story of Susannah Hawes &#8211; an early New Zealand pioneer. When exploring Jordan&#8217;s electronic press kit at Ariel Publicity, I learned that she had been commissioned by the New Zealand Arts Council to tell the story of Susannah Hawes. Here&#8217;s a quote from the press kit:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this concept record sharing a dialogue between Susannah and History and exploring the darker areas of New Zealand’s pioneer past, Jordan makes sharp commentary on culture which culminates in History’s annoyance with the lack of gore and grand narrative in Susannah’s story and its choice to forget her by throwing her name into the sea. As How the Dead Live is a historical piece, Jordan defined the sound of the record with industrial noises that would have existed at the time of Susannah’s life, like hammers and anvils, gold pans, and two-man saws, and visualizes how death is close to pioneers even in the simplest actions of life in a music video for the single “The Proximity of Death.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/#/jordanreyne"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-926" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 10px;" title="Jordan Reyne" src="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/14146-300x225.jpg" alt="Jordan Reyne promo image" width="300" height="225" /></a>It shouldn&#8217;t surprise any of us that Jordan would be asked to write for such a lofty project. She has received three nominations for the &#8220;Tui&#8221; Award in her native New Zealand. You can also find her performances on the soundtrack of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings films.</p>
<p>I am captivated by Jordan Reynes music. Her inclusion of non-instruments as instruments helps to weave textures and sounds that create ambiance within the music. In &#8220;How the Dead Live&#8221; she has woven these together in such a way that we can hear the story and feel the pain and suffering of pioneer Susannah Hawes.</p>
<p>Though you only hear four of the songs from the album (and they are out of context), you owe it to yourself to listen to the complete collection. As described on her site:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jordan combines pioneer-era industrial found sound, with folk instrumentation and etherial vocal melodies. She usually writes &#8220;concept&#8221; albums with stories, old and new, told song by song. This means it makes sense to hear them whole. For that reason, her first 4 CDs are available via the discography listing to the right of [<a href="http://www.jordanreyne.com">Jordan's web site</a>] for private listening purposes.</p></blockquote>

Jordan Reyne
Songs Played
- The Dead
- The Proximity of Death
- The Brave
- Blood
"...an industrial-folk musician who uses 19th century factory noises, steam sounds, and celtic melody to tell folk tales in a new way." - CyberPR
Jordan Reyne stopped by my Facebook page to leave me a comment. Obviously curious, I visited her site to learn more about her. The opening of her site stated that Jordan Reyne is "industrial-tinged alternative folk, from the edges of the earth". How could I not listen?

What I discovered were songs from her 2008 release "How the Dead Live". This haunting collection of music is captivating, as well. It drew me in to the story of Susannah Hawes - an early New Zealand pioneer. When exploring Jordan's electronic press kit at Ariel Publicity, I learned that she had been commissioned by the New Zealand Arts Council to tell the story of Susannah Hawes. Here's a quote from the press kit:
In this concept record sharing a dialogue between Susannah and History and exploring the darker areas of New Zealand’s pioneer past, Jordan makes sharp commentary on culture which culminates in History’s annoyance with the lack of gore and grand narrative in Susannah’s story and its choice to forget her by throwing her name into the sea. As How the Dead Live is a historical piece, Jordan defined the sound of the record with industrial noises that would have existed at the time of Susannah’s life, like hammers and anvils, gold pans, and two-man saws, and visualizes how death is close to pioneers even in the simplest actions of life in a music video for the single “The Proximity of Death.”
It shouldn't surprise any of us that Jordan would be asked to write for such a lofty project. She has received three nominations for the "Tui" Award in her native New Zealand. You can also find her performances on the soundtrack of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings films.

I am captivated by Jordan Reynes music. Her inclusion of non-instruments as instruments helps to weave textures and sounds that create ambiance within the music. In "How the Dead Live" she has woven these together in such a way that we can hear the story and feel the pain and suffering of pioneer Susannah Hawes.

Though you only hear four of the songs from the album (and they are out of context), you owe it to yourself to listen to the complete collection. As described on her site:
Jordan combines pioneer-era industrial found sound, with folk instrumentation and etherial vocal melodies. She usually writes "concept" albums with stories, old and new, told song by song. This means it makes sense to hear them whole. For that reason, her first 4 CDs are available via the discography listing to the right of [Jordan's web site] for private listening purposes.

<h2>Shaun DeGraff</h2>
<h3>Songs Played</h3>
<p>- Everything to Me<br />
- Can&#8217;t Stop Now<br />
- You Had Me at Goodbye</p>
<blockquote><p>“Hi. I&#8217;m Shaun. I&#8217;m known to some folks as Brother Luke. I&#8217;m of Irish, Dutch, and Native American descent and grew up in a sleepy town in Arizona. I was raised Mormon and now live in Vegas and study Taoist and existential philosophy. I have spent at least a month in 13 different countries and believe greed is the virus of humanity. I am a simple man and LOVE music as much today as I did as far back as I remember.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Shaun DeGraff</strong> (aka Brother Luke) wrote to me way back in August to request play on Audio Gumshoe. I had a huge inventory of songs already in the file &#8212; so I wasn&#8217;t able to listen to his music until recently. I&#8217;m very glad I got to it, though! DeGraff leads his songs with strong melodies, fully produced piano-driven music tracks, and dynamics that help keep them fresh and interesting.</p>
<p>He has a fully stocked ReverbNation profile that offers 57 songs, stats that show more than 5600 song plays (as of this writing) and more than 23,000 registered fans. That&#8217;s no soft accomplishment. To add to the impressive nature of his songwriting and recording he has recently signed with newly formed label, <a href="http://jmdrecords.com/">JMD Records</a> (Universal). Shaun is upping the ante on his new album release &#8220;Grey Area&#8221;.</p>
<p>Want more impressive info? According to DeGraff&#8217;s bio:</p>

<h3>Songs Played</h3>
<p>- Davenport<br />
- Men In My Head<br />

- Davenport (Disco Fries Remix)</p>

<p>Are you in the Brooklyn area? Are you anywhere near NYC? I would highly suggest looking for this group&#8217;s live events calendar so that you can attend a show. For the rest of us, we get to listen to <strong>Men In My Head</strong> on <strong>Audio Gumshoe</strong> and from their recordings. And, while we&#8217;re all listening, we get to dance. A lot.</p>
<p><strong>Men In My Head</strong> describe themselves as</p>
<blockquote><p>a mix of alternative rock and funk, sprinkled with hints of blues and soul.</p></blockquote>

Songs like &#8220;Willing Mistake&#8221; on their self-titled album start with a gritty blues guitar intro, followed by a funky-bluesy beat. &#8220;Times Like These&#8221; hit you up front with a power-driving drum intro and enter into an almost retro-style pop/rock beat, complete with jazz organ. Many of their tunes break down with full horns blaring and scorching blues/rock guitar solos.</p>
<p>Songs on this episode of <strong>Audio Gumshoe</strong> give us a full dance frenzy during &#8220;Davenport&#8221; and &#8220;Men In My Head&#8221;. They are followed by a passionate and soul-speaking track called &#8220;Cry for You&#8221;. Then, the first track is visited again with an all-out club dance rendition &#8220;Disco Fries Remix&#8221;.</p>

<h2>Michael Behm</h2>
<h3>Songs Played</h3>
<p>- The Apple in Her Hand<br />
- Where I Belong<br />
- Your My Wonderful<br />
- The Remaining Go<br />
- It&#8217;s My Time</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s show notes come entirely from the promo section of his profile at <a href="http://www.arielpublicity.com">Ariel Publicity</a>. Why? Because I find that these notes say everything that I could say about Michael Behm, except for&#8230;</p>
<p>This guy has a tight sound and a way of grabbing your ears, causing them to beg you to come back again and again to see what he has created next. I found myself playing his ReverbNation playlist over and over.</p>
<blockquote><p>Twelve years of touring through North America have established Behm as a compelling live performer. To a rapidly growing number of fans around the globe, he is best known as a singer/songwriter of real melodic and lyrical intelligence. His versatile take on pop-rock has been showcased on seven albums, including 2008’s acclaimed Saving America.</p>
<p><a href="http://michaelbehmmusic.com"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-839" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 10px;" title="Michael Behm Promo" src="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/michael_behm_promo-300x300.jpg" alt="Michael Behm promo image" width="210" height="210" /></a>Through 2009, Behm has released a series of meticulously-crafted singles that have generated serious traffic on internet radio stations and music websites. Total plays of Behm tunes on <a href="http://www.numberonemusic.com/michaelbehm/">numberonemusic.com</a> now stand at 1.5 million, while 12 songs on the popular <a href="http://www.jango.com/music/Michael+Behm?l=0">Jango</a> site have notched 250,000 plays. Such singles as “If I Could Learn To Fly”, “Love’s Like Numbers,” and now “Where I Belong” have topped charts in Australia and Canada on such sites as mp3.au.com and <a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/controller/user/login#/michaelbehmmusiccom">Reverb Nation</a>.</p>
<p>As a music business entrepreneur, Behm’s credentials are equally solid. He formed a sound company “Premier Productions” in the 1990s that provided live sound and lighting to 22 music clubs in Canada. He owned five successful live venues / clubs, including three in the Caribbean, and he still owns and operates popular Vancouver Island music club, Voodoo Lounge. He has promoted over 100 concerts, including such major-name acts as Nazareth, Nickelback and Default.</p>
<p><a href="http://michaelbehmmusic.com"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-842" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 10px;" title="Michael Behm - Tall Image" src="http://richpalmer.com/podcasts/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/mbehm_tall-199x300.jpg" alt="Michael Behm tall image" width="199" height="300" /></a>Behm’s first recording studio, Premier Studios, located in Vancouver, hosted recording artists from the U.S., U.K., and Europe, Australia and Japan while his current home studio, right on the ocean in Qualicum, British Columbia, is recognized as a true state of the art facility. Michael also is home at top-notch Vancouver studios The Warehouse, Mushroom, The Armoury, and, working closely with such highly-regarded engineers as Mike Fraser (AC/DC, Metallica), Mike Puskas, Delwyn Brooks, Brian Gardner and Ray Harvey</p>
<p>On the songwriting front, Behm’s talent has been recognized by songwriting guru Ralph Murphy (Crystal Gayle, Ronnie Milsap, Cliff Richards). A recent Murphy-Behm co-write, the gently pensive pop song “Where I Belong,” has quickly become a fan favourite. Behm and veteran songsmith Ron Irving recently collaborated on “It’s My Time,” a track that is now on hold with American Idol.</p>
<p>Michael Behm’s versatility as a songwriter, producer has certainly brought him attention in the world of music publishing. He has signed eight publishing deals in the last two years alone, and highly notable movie and TV placements are coming his way. Thanks to a collaboration with affiliates in the U.S. and Australia, a Behm track, ‘Living In The Moment,” will be featured in upcoming Disney feature A Fairy Tale. He was also recently commissioned to provide four songs for the soundtrack to a film biography of AC/DC singer Bon Scott.</p>
<p>“The instrumental aspects of those tracks have already been licensed to a U.S. network,” Behm reports. “Once you create something that’s great and that encapsulates a certain genre, there will always be a use for it. My music is available in many different platforms. The advantage I have is that I can quickly come up with music for any application. I can create it myself or commission it from other producers-that I work with.”</p>
<p>Behm has expanded his reach for 2010, producing and developing international artists, “Chap” and “Dead Eyes Open”. Behm says, “I have been producing this amazing U.K. country band called “Chaps”. We just signed a song “One Straight Road” to a list Publisher Rex Benson to be pitched to Keith Urban and Rascal Flatts. The song was picked from 2600 song submissions validating a production team’s hard work! “Chaps will be featured at MIDEM in my company profile. .</p></blockquote>

Michael Behm
Songs Played
- The Apple in Her Hand
- Where I Belong
- Your My Wonderful
- The Remaining Go
- It's My Time

Today's show notes come entirely from the promo section of his profile at Ariel Publicity. Why? Because I find that these notes say everything that I could say about Michael Behm, except for...

This guy has a tight sound and a way of grabbing your ears, causing them to beg you to come back again and again to see what he has created next. I found myself playing his ReverbNation playlist over and over.
Twelve years of touring through North America have established Behm as a compelling live performer. To a rapidly growing number of fans around the globe, he is best known as a singer/songwriter of real melodic and lyrical intelligence. His versatile take on pop-rock has been showcased on seven albums, including 2008’s acclaimed Saving America.

Through 2009, Behm has released a series of meticulously-crafted singles that have generated serious traffic on internet radio stations and music websites. Total plays of Behm tunes on numberonemusic.com now stand at 1.5 million, while 12 songs on the popular Jango site have notched 250,000 plays. Such singles as “If I Could Learn To Fly”, “Love’s Like Numbers,” and now “Where I Belong” have topped charts in Australia and Canada on such sites as mp3.au.com and Reverb Nation.

As a music business entrepreneur, Behm’s credentials are equally solid. He formed a sound company “Premier Productions” in the 1990s that provided live sound and lighting to 22 music clubs in Canada. He owned five successful live venues / clubs, including three in the Caribbean, and he still owns and operates popular Vancouver Island music club, Voodoo Lounge. He has promoted over 100 concerts, including such major-name acts as Nazareth, Nickelback and Default.

Behm’s first recording studio, Premier Studios, located in Vancouver, hosted recording artists from the U.S., U.K., and Europe, Australia and Japan while his current home studio, right on the ocean in Qualicum, British Columbia, is recognized as a true state of the art facility. Michael also is home at top-notch Vancouver studios The Warehouse, Mushroom, The Armoury, and, working closely with such highly-regarded engineers as Mike Fraser (AC/DC, Metallica), Mike Puskas, Delwyn Brooks, Brian Gardner and Ray Harvey

On the songwriting front, Behm’s talent has been recognized by songwriting guru Ralph Murphy (Crystal Gayle, Ronnie Milsap, Cliff Richards). A recent Murphy-Behm co-write, the gently pensive pop song “Where I Belong,” has quickly become a fan favourite. Behm and veteran songsmith Ron Irving recently collaborated on “It’s My Time,” a track that is now on hold with American Idol.

Michael Behm’s versatility as a songwriter, producer has certainly brought him attention in the world of music publishing. He has signed eight publishing deals in the last two years alone, and highly notable movie and TV placements are coming his way. Thanks to a collaboration with affiliates in the U.S. and Australia, a Behm track, ‘Living In The Moment,” will be featured in upcoming Disney feature A Fairy Tale. He was also recently commissioned to provide four songs for the soundtrack to a film biography of AC/DC singer Bon Scott.

“The instrumental aspects of those tracks have already been licensed to a U.S. network,” Behm reports. “Once you create something that’s great and that encapsulates a certain genre, there will always be a use for it. My music is available in many different platforms. The advantage I have is that I can quickly come up with music for any application. I can create it myself or commission it from other producers-that I work with.”

Behm has expanded his reach for 2010, producing and developing international artists, “Chap” and “Dead Eyes Open”. Behm says, “I have been producing this amazing U.K. country band called “Chaps”.</itunes:summary>

<blockquote><p>“How good is this book? I figured that I would just skim through the book since I already know a good bit about how the social media world works, but I couldn&#8217;t put it down and wound up learning a lot myself since the book covers so much more than social media. Her information is concise, to the point, and easy to grasp, no matter if you&#8217;re a social media veteran or just dipping your toe into the online waters for the first time.”<br />
- Bobby Owsinski, Music 3.0</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“One of Hyatt&#8217;s clients, Michael Lynche, made it to the top four on this season&#8217;s American Idol. And he praises her ability to teach musicians the art and science of social networking. And since the book is less of a lecture and more of a workbook, it&#8217;s helpful in a very hands-on and useful way.”<br />
- CMT Blog</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“The best part of the advice Ariel gives is that it applies to more than just musicians. If you are a freelancer of any kind, these exercises and methods will work just as well for you….Essentially, this is one of the best books of it’s kind around.  Ariel is great at what she does and this is a handy DIY version of her more expansive Cyber PR Campaigns.”<br />
- Jason Shadrick</p></blockquote>
