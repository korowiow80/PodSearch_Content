<p>Many people ask Why do I have to assign my purchase  agreement to my Qualified Intermediary? Even more, they ask Why do I have to  give notice that I am assigning my contract to my intermediary to all of the  other persons involved in the purchase agreement? It seems intrusive to have  to give everyone notice that you are doing and exchange. Why is it anyone  business?</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Old School Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Lets go back in time before the current Treasury  regulations were in place. We would actually deed or transfer our property to  the Intermediary. The Intermediary acted as a straw man, so that they became  the seller of the relinquished property and the purchaser of the replacement  property. So, your Intermediary actually went into title and then participated  in the transfer or the purchase of the property.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Modern 1031 Tax Techniques Allows Mere Assignment</strong></p>
<p>Thankfully, today, our Intermediaries do not have to legally  take title. We can accomplish the same function by simply assigning to the  Intermediary our rights in the relinquished property purchase agreement, or our  rights in the replacement property purchase agreement, and that is deemed to be  the same as if the Intermediary actually took our property from us, or received  the replacement property for our benefit.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Faster, Cheaper¦Direct Deeding for 1031 Exchanges</strong></p>
<p>The benefit here is  that we do not have to deed a property. We do not have to pay for extra  recording fees, and we do not have to go through all of that extra hassle of  actually deeding the intermediary into the chain of title. However, the  Treasury regulations say that if you are going to have direct deeding, that is  the exchanger deeds the relinquished property to the buyer, and the seller of  the replacement property deeds the replacement property to the exchanger. Then,  we have to give written notice of this assignment to the Intermediary to all of  the other parties to the purchase agreement. Remember, in old common law, an assignment  was never considered effective unless all of the parties to that agreement were  given notice.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Why Would the IRS Adopt an Old Common Law Assignment Rule</strong></p>
<p>And so, the Treasury regulations sort of adopted this old  rule. And, I think that is perhaps so that unscrupulous folks cant fabricate  an exchange. They cant say â€œYou know that deal that we did back last  year? That was a 1031 exchange. The way  to catch them in that lie would be to say, œWell, show us where you gave  written notice to the other parties of the purchase agreement. If they cant  show, well then maybe it wasnt a 1031 from the outset.</p>

<p>Contract Deeds or Executor Contracts, basically installment  sales, create a lot of questions. Here is one that I get a lot. I sold my  property ten years ago on an installment sale, a Contract for Deed. And now, I  am being paid off, and I am getting this balloon payment from the buyer.  Question: Can I do a 1031 Exchange on this windfall of cash that I am  receiving?</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Understand the Timing &#8211; When Did the Sale Take Place</strong></p>
<p>If you look at this  transaction, it may appear that the sale is now occurring because when the  balloon payment is given to the vendor, the deed will be delivered to the  vendee. So, it feels like perhaps the sale is occurring now. But, for Federal  Tax purposes, the sale probably occurred ten years ago when the Contract for  Deed or the installment sale was entered into.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Who is Really the Owner of the Property</strong></p>
<p>When a Contract for Deed is given, the purchaser or vendee  is considered to be the equitable owner of the property. They probably bear the  risk of loss if the property is destroyed. They probably bear the burden of  paying the property taxes to the local property tax assessor. And, under the  contract, they probably enjoy the possession, the exclusive use of the  property. So, for Federal Tax Purposes, the Contract for Deed vendee probably  acquired the property way back when the initial Contract for Deed was entered  into. Now, when this windfall is coming in, we are not really selling the  property anymore, we are just receiving payoff like any other lender who has  loaned money to a purchaser.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Section 1031 Does Not Apply to &#034;Evidence of Indebtedness&#034;</strong></p>
<p>When a Contract for Deed vendor holds that legal title, they  don&#039;t necessarily own the property anymore. They really own an enforcement  mechanism. In the event of a default under the Contract for Deed, they can  swoop in and cancel the Contract for Deed. This is an enforcement mechanism  much like a mortgagee&#039;s interest or bank&#039;s interest in a mortgaged property.  They are really a creditor, not so much a property owner for Federal Tax Purposes.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">A lot of people wonder, Can I purchase my replacement  property on a Contract for Deed?â€ As financing gets more and more challenging,  seller arranged financing looks more appealing. So, if we can find a seller  that will convey the property to us on a Contract for Deed, will that property  work as a 1031 replacement property?</p>
<p align="center"><strong>How Can This Work for a 1031 Exchange¦<br />
if I do Not have Full Legal  Title?</strong></p>
<p>The question might be lingering in the back of your mind.  Yes, I know that I am the vendee, but I know that the vendor still has legal  title. I also know that as a purchaser under a Contract for Deed, I dont  receive the actual deed until I am done making my payments. So, query whether this  qualifies as a 1031 Exchange.
</p>
<p align="center"><strong>The Question is¦Who is the Owner for Federal Tax Purposes</strong></p>
<p>The answer is probably because a Contract for Deed vendee  receives the benefits and burdens of ownership. And, you want to make sure that  your Contract for Deed is drafted so that it does give you the benefits and  burdens of ownership because you bear the risk of loss of the property if  destroyed, because you bear the obligation to pay the property taxes, because  you have exclusive possession of the property. All of these factors really  weigh on the side of you being the equitable owner of the property and the  equivalent of the owner of a fee interest in real estate for Federal Tax  purposes.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Put the Exchange Funds Down as the Down-Stoke¦<br />
If You are the Owner</strong></p>
<p>Â So, you can purchase  your replacement property on a Contract for Deed. In theory, you would take all  of your proceeds, all of your net proceeds from your relinquished property and  plunk that down as your down-payment. Then you would make incremental  installment payments going forward until the Contract for Deed is satisfied at  which time you would receive the deed for the property. However, in the  interim, you are the equitable owner of the property, and that should be  sufficient to complete your 1031 Exchange.</p>

<p>Sometimes people want  to do a 1031 Exchange into a property that they plan on immediately occupying  as their home. And, they wonder to themselves  well, I know that I have to treat  my replacement property as either business property, property used in my trade,  or as investment property. Well, I hope that my personal residence goes up in  value, so it must be an investment, right?</p>

I hope it goes up. The taxpayer was trying to make the argument that, even  though it was his second, his lake cabin that he never rented out, never  advertised as a business property that it was held for investment, so that it  should qualify for 1031.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Hoping For an Increase In Value on Your<br />
Personal Use Property  Investment</strong></p>
<p>The tax court did not buy this argument. They said Yes, everybody  hopes that their primary residences and second homes go up in value. But, we  really need to look at how you use the property to decipher what your intention  was. Was your intention primarily to use the property for recreational and  personal use? Or, was your intention to hold it for investment?
</p>
<p align="center"><strong>1031 Lesson Learned  Do Not Hold Primarily for Personal Use</strong></p>
<p>Under the facts of the Moore  case, the taxpayer was found to primarily hold the property for personal use.  So, getting back to our question, Can I call my replacement property  home/personal residence an investment, especially if I move into it immediately  after I have completed my exchange? The answer is probably, no. That would not  qualify because your use as your home is antithetical, completely opposite to  use in ones business, use in ones trade, or holding for investment.</p>

<p>When you are doing a 1031 Exchange, you generally want to  hit three benchmarks called the napkin test. These are generalities that  typically bear out to be good indicators of whether or not all of the gains  will be deferred in a 1031 Exchange. Here are the benchmarks.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Step One &#8211; Equal or Greater Value</strong></p>
<p>One, you typically want to buy a replacement property of  equal or greater value than the relinquished property that you gave up. So, we  want to go up in value, and get a bigger, better property.</p>
<p align="center">Â <strong>Step  Two &#8211; Equal or Greater Equity</strong></p>
<p>Secondly, we want to take all of our net equity, all of our  proceeds from the disposition, the sale of our relinquished property. Imagine a  big stack of poker chips in front of your relinquished property. I want to  slide all of those poker chips over into the replacement property. So, I am  moving all of my equity from A to B. So, the second rule of thumb is I want to  move all of my equity into the replacement property rather than taking any cash  or chips off the table, which would be treated as taxable boot.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Step Three &#8211; Off-set Your Debt Relief</strong></p>
<p>The last benchmark, the third thing that I am trying to  juggle, is that to the extent that I am paying off mortgages and debt on the  relinquished property, I need to offset that debt relief with either new debt  taken out in conjunction with the replacement property. So, I could take out a  new purchase money mortgage, or I could assume the sellerâ€™s existing mortgage  that would satisfy my debt relief if I acquired a replacement property with at  least an equivalent amount of debt. Or, alternatively, I can offset my debt  relief by putting more of my own cash into the replacement property. Cash in  will also offset debt relief.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Coming Up Short on â€œSufficient Valueâ€</strong></p>
<p>Â Well, here is where  things get a little bit crazy. What if a person wants to acquire a replacement  property that is not of sufficient value, but they are willing to gross up that  price, fabricate, inflate the value of the price and report the transaction as  if they acquired a replacement property of greater value. Letâ€™s say that the  real value of the property is $100,000, but the taxpayer grosses up the sale  price to $150,000, so that they acquiring a replacement property of sufficient  value. Suppose that they are buying from a friend who is willing to go along  with it. Perhaps the friend is even willing to split the difference and to send  back some of that inflated proceeds to the purchaser. They will give it back under  the table. <strong>This is not acceptable.</strong> Filing a false or fraudulent tax return is a criminal offense. Knowing and  willful attempts to evade or defeat income tax due is a crime.</p>
<p>There is a big difference between legally deferring your  taxes in a proper 1031 Exchange and stretching the truth to fabricating the  value of your replacement property.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Do Not Do the Crime</strong></p>
<p>Section 7201 says that any person who willfully attempts to  evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title, or the payment thereof, shall in  addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony. And, upon  conviction thereof, shall be imprisoned not more than five years. Or they may  be fined not more than $250,000 for individuals or both together with the costs  of prosecution.</p>

<p style="font-size:8pt;padding-left:40px">(Listen Here 6:01 min)</p>
<p>Todayâ€™s podcast is highlighting some of the changes that  came from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 â€“ otherwise known  as the Tax Stimulus Package. In particular, we are going to be talking about  Section 25A, which is the Hope Scholarship Credit. Remember, a tax credit is  like a negative tax. It offsets dollar for dollar your liability to the  government, and it is better than a deduction.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Old Section 25A on Steroids</strong></p>
<p>Here are some of the enhancements for tax years 2009 and  2010. This has been entitled by the government, The American Opportunity Tax  Credit. But, it is really just an enhancement of Section 25A, which is for the  Hope Scholarship Credit. Under the old Hope Credit, you were able to take a credit  for one hundred per cent of the first $1,200 expended for tuition and related  expenses. Then you were able to take a credit for fifty per cent of the next  $1,200. So, the maximum credit under the old rule was $1,800.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>The New Rule is Better</strong></p>
<p>You get to take one hundred per cent of the first $2,000 and  then twenty five per cent of the next $4,000 that is expended for tuition and  related expenses. (Thatâ€™s a total $2,500 tax exclusion) By the way, that now  includes â€œcourse materialsâ€. So, it is a broader definition for what we can  spend our money on. Under the old Hope Credit, you were only allowed to take  this exclusion for the first two years of Post Secondary Education. The new  version allows us to take it for up to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">four years</span>. So it is a broadening  to include four years of Post Secondary Education. Thus, if you are on the four  year plan, you should be able to cover all four years of college.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>More People Qualify</strong></p>
<p>Another enhancement is that they have expanded the range of  people who qualify to take this credit. Under the old rule, there was a phase  out. If you made two much money, the credit was no longer available to you.  Those phase outs started around $50,000 for single filers and $100,000 for  joint filers. Under the new rule, those phase outs have been raised. So, a  person making $80,000 (Adjusted Gross Income or AGI) for single filers and  $160,000 (AGI) for joint filers is where the phase outs now start to kick in.  Under the new rule, if your income for a single filer equals $90,000 (AGI) or  $180,000 (AGI) for a joint filer, then you are phased out from taking these  credits.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>If Child Claims Exclusion â€“ They Must Provide 50% Support</strong></p>
<p>One thing that continues, though, is that if a child is  going to take this credit for themselves, they have to provide for more than  fifty per cent of their own support. So, unfortunately, if Mom and Dad are  providing for more than fifty per cent of a childâ€™s support, that child wonâ€™t  be able to take this tax credit.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>This Credit keeps Getting Better</strong></p>
<p>One interesting facet of this new legislation is that this  credit applies against the alternative minimum tax (AMT).</p>
<p align="center"><strong>And Partially Refundable</strong></p>
<p>What if you have very little income, and you have very  little tax liability because of the low income, and you get this credit? Can  you take the credit? Normally, a credit offsets your tax liability dollar for  dollar. But, what if the amount of your credit exceeds the amount of your tax  liability or your debt to the government? This is a unique tax credit in that  it is refundable or partially refundable. Forty per cent of this credit can be  paid to you as a refund if the amount of your credit exceeds the amount of your  income tax liability. So, as an example, letâ€™s say that if I have zero tax  liability for 2009, but I fully qualify for one-hundred percent of this credit.  That means that forty percent of the $2,500 credit will be paid to me as a  refund. Remember, forty percent times $2,500 equals $1,000 of cash in my pocket  because up to forty per cent of this tax credit is refundable.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>This is a Good Deal for Taxpayers</strong></p>
<p>In summary, the old Section 25A Hope Credit was a good deal  for taxpayers. The new version under the American Recovery Act and Reinvestment  of 2009 is even better. It has expanded definitions of what we can spend money  on, and it has expanded the range of taxpayers who can qualify because of a  lengthened phase out period, and we can use it for more than two years. We can  use it for four years of Post Secondary Education expenses. This is a wonderful  tax incentive. It is designed to stimulate the economy and encourage education.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><strong>Part Two &#8211; The Death Question</strong></p>
<p>Section 102 of the internal revenue code says that an heir  (beneficiary who inherits property) that receives property as a â€œgift, bequest,  devise, or inheritanceâ€ takes that property tax-free.Â  It states â€œGross income does not include the  value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or inheritanceâ€.</p>
<p>You can read Section 102 at: <a href="http://www2.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000102----000-.html">http://www2.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00000102&#8212;-000-.html</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Basis of an Heir</strong></p>
<p>The question then becomes, what if your heir then sells the  property that they received as an â€œinheritanceâ€ from you? What is the heirâ€™s  basis for calculating his or her gain?Â   Will the heir have any tax liability?</p>
<p>At present, Section 1014 of the internal revenue code allows  your heirs to take your property with a â€œstepped up basisâ€ [roughly Fair Market  Value (FMV)] of the property at the time of your death) so they would not  necessarily take over your low basis in the property.Â  However, the tax code in this area may  change, so you need to talk about this with your CPA or your accountant.Â  Under current Section 1014(a) the general  rule applied to property an heir receives from a decedent is that the heir&#039;s  basis equals the fair market value of the property at the time the decedent  dies.Â  Because of Section 1014, any  appreciation of the affected property that occurred during the decedent&#039;s  lifetime may never be taxed. The current operation of this code section  provides an incentive for taxpayers to defer taxes throughout oneâ€™s lifetime  until death.Â  One strategy that people  refer to with 1031 exchanges is called â€œDefer, Defer, Defer,â€¦Dieâ€.Â  The idea is that one never recognizes any  gains during oneâ€™s lifetime, but instead continually defers the recognition of  gain (compounding and building wealth tax-free) until they die.</p>
<p>Section 1014(f) says that this section shall not apply to  decedents who die after December 31, 2009.Â   This â€œsunset provisionâ€ came from the Economic Growth and Tax Relief  Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA).Â   According to EGTRRA, Section 1014 will be terminated. EGTRRA replaces  Section 1014 with a modified â€œcarryover basisâ€ rule, under which the property  will receive a basis equal to the lesser of the adjusted basis of the property  in the hands of the decedent, or the fair market value of the property on the  date of the decedent&#039;s death. So, your heirs would probably take over your low  basis, and they would need to continue to defer the taxes by utilizing 1031 tax  exchanges. The good news is that they could also continue the strategy of  â€œDeferring, Deferring,Â  Deferring,â€¦Dyingâ€â€¦  generation after generation.</p>

<p>Many people ask me questions along the lines ofÂ  â€œOver the years, I have invested a large  amount of money into an investment property. How does this affect my taxes Â if I sell the property or if I die?.â€</p>
<p>First, I would like to talk about the sale vs. 1031 exchange  part of the question, and then I would like to go into the ramifications of  dying while owning the property.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Part OneÂ  &#8211; Selling ~ The 1031  Question</strong></p>
<p>Section 1031 is a very â€œtaxpayer friendlyâ€ provision of the  internal revenue code.Â  It gives you a  way to â€œsellâ€ your investment property without having to recognize the  gains.Â  This defers your taxes.Â  I just posted a video that you can watch on  1031 exchanges of collector coins at: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgJmxbdPxRw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgJmxbdPxRw</a>Â  (click on this link)</p>
<p>There are some rules and regulations that you must follow in  order to get this tax deferral.Â  One of  the key rules is that your property must have been <strong>â€œheld for investment or for use in your trade or businessâ€</strong>.Â  I have some good information on this at: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIolirun-88">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIolirun-88</a>Â Â  (click on this link)</p>
<p>The other major requirement is that you have to re-invest  your proceeds into â€œ<strong>like-kind</strong> <strong>property</strong>â€.Â  If you have watched the two videos (see hyper  links above) then you have probably picked up that certain property held for  investment can be exchanged for certain other like-kind coins that will be held  for investment.</p>
<p>In a delayed exchange using a qualified intermediary, your  proceeds from the sale must be invested in a like kind property within 180 days  of the sale. Also, your replacement property must be identified within 45  days.Â </p>
<p>Remember, 1031 exchanges are governed under the United  States Tax Code which specifies that if an asset (such as a collector coin,  real estate, business equipment, aircraft, race horses or agricultural  equipment) is sold, and the proceeds of the sale are then reinvested in an  asset of a like-kind, then no capital gain or loss is recognized. This Â allows the deferment of capital gains taxes  that would otherwise have been due on the first sale. You can read this code  section at: <a href="http://www2.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00001031----000-.html">http://www2.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sec_26_00001031&#8212;-000-.html</a></p>
<p>Remember, both your  relinquished property and your replacement property must be held either for  investment or for productive use in a trade or business.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Why is a 1031 Tax Exchange Good For You?</strong><br />
<strong>Time Value of Money</strong></p>
<p>The key benefit is that your  capital gains tax liability that would otherwise become due is deferred under  Section 1031 of the code. The main value to investors is that as long as your  money continues to be re-invested (over and over again) in other qualifying  like-kind property, your portfolio can continue to grow in value (without  taxation).</p>

<p style="font-size:8pt;padding-left:40px">(Listen Here 4:57 min)</p>
<p>Normally in a 1031 exchange, you defer all of your capital  gains (both from appreciation in value and depreciation deductions taken over  the years) by acquiring a like-kind replacement of equal of more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">value</span>;  and equal of more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">equity</span>.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>In Tax Law â€“ Nobody Wants Surprises</strong></p>
<p>There are some situations when the relinquished property  will have some tax complications (snakes in the grass) that could cause you to  unexpectedly Â recognize gain.Â  To make  matters worse, the surprise gains could be characterized as ordinary income and  taxed at higher rates than mere capital gains rates.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>What Do You Need to Check Out?</strong></p>
<p>Here are some things to check out with your CPA, accountant  or tax attorney:</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Tax Credits</strong></p>
<p>When Congress wants to encourage investors to do  somethingâ€¦they provide tax incentives.Â   One of the most effective tax incentive is to offer tax credits.Â  Tax credits are more valuable than mere deductions  because they off-set your tax liability dollar-for-dollar. The problem is that  tax credits on your relinquished property for either Â â€œrehabilitation  expendituresâ€ under Section 47; or from â€œlow income housingâ€ under Section 42 may  be recaptured. Both of these Tax Code Sections allow for recapture of the  amount of the tax credits.Â  It is always  prudent to check with your accountant BEFORE you sellâ€¦just to make sure you do  not have any problems with old tax credits.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Special Recapture for Rapid Deprecation</strong></p>
<p>If you were able to take rapid deprecation under Section 179  or you qualified for bonus deprecation for investment in the Gulf Opportunity  (GO) Zone areas impacted by hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, then you need  to check into the recapture provisions of those specific programs if your property  ceases to be Qualified GO Zone Property.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Section 1245 Gain</strong></p>
<p>Cost segregation engineering studies are often used by  property owner to peel out those components of a piece of real estate that can  be more rapidly deprecated.Â  A typical  commercial building is deprecated over 39 years.Â  That is a long deprecation schedule.Â  A multi-family apartment building can be  deprecated over 27.5 years.Â  Certain  components of real-estate can be re-classified and more rapidly deprecated over  a 5..10..15 year schedule. Those components can cause you to have recapture,  unless you are mindful and when you buy your replacement property you buy  qualifying property that matches up component for component with those Cost  Segregation properties that were more rapidly deprecated.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Be on the look out for recapture that could spoil your 1031  exchange.Â  Talk to your CPA or tax  advisor and have them run a projection to make sure that there are not any <strong>snakes lying in the grassâ€¦waiting to give  you the tax bite.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Cars and trucks are getting more like-kind. The IRS recently  issued a private letter ruling (LTR 200912004) specifically to a tax-payer that  was a rental car company that conducted ongoing 1031 like-kind exchange  programs. So, every time they disposed of their old rental cars, those were the  disposition of â€œrelinquished propertiesâ€. Every time they brought in new cars  into their rental fleet, those were the â€œreplacement propertiesâ€. This was an ongoing  cycle, a program of exchanges that had been incorporated into their business  model to have the most efficient (tax neutral sale) disposition of their  properties. This particular taxpayer had a conundrum, because appreciable  personal property such as rental cars are broken into different asset classes.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Cars and Trucksâ€¦Depreciable Tangible Personal Property are<br />
Â Normally Only Considered Like-Class  to<br />
Other Depreciable Tangible Personal Property in<br />
the <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SAME</span></em> *General  Asset Class*</strong></p>
<p>There are thirteen different â€œgeneral asset classesâ€ set out  in Rev. Proc. 87-56. Two of those asset classes are applicable to this taxpayerâ€™s  property. Asset class 00.241 is for general purpose light duty trucks, while  asset class 00.22 is for cars and taxis. Depreciable tangible personal property  is of a like-class to other depreciable tangible personal property if the  exchanged properties are either within the same General Asset Class or within  the same (North American Industry Classification System â€“ NAICS) Product Class. <strong>The conundrum that this taxpayer had is  that since these general assets had been created, the car industry has morphed</strong>,  and we now have â€˜crossover vehiclesâ€™ and â€˜sport utility vehiclesâ€™ and little â€˜minivansâ€™<strong>.</strong> There are cars that look like trucks,  and trucks that look like cars, and it is hard to determine whether these  automobiles and light duty trucks and crossovers (in the middle) are like-kind.  Especially if they are in separate general asset classes.
</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Throw Out the Mumbo Gumbo â€œGeneral Asset Classesâ€</strong></p>
<p>Alright, this private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue  Service is very taxpayer friendly because this acknowledges that the industry  has changed, and that the regulation of automobiles has changed. The IRS  basically said <strong>â€œLook, even though these  items are not in the same general asset class, they can still be considered  like-kindâ€</strong>. So, this private letter ruling is taxpayer friendly in that it  acknowledges that the car industry has changed, and it gives the taxpayer the  ability to exchange an SUV for a carâ€¦ a light duty truck that is less than  thirteen thousand pounds in weight for another automobile or SUV or minivan  that is in that same general â€˜genre of automobileâ€™.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>1031 Exchanges Just Got Easier</strong></p>
<p>This private letter ruling is good for the U.S. automobile  leasing industry. It is good for consumers, and it is good for America  because <strong>Section 1031 stimulates economic  growth by allowing business owners and investors to move their capital to the  most advantageous replacement property</strong>. It also minimizes a drag that  normally would occur from income tax and capital gains taxes. Section 1031  helps the automobile leasing industry, and it can help other investors and  business owners also. Section 1031 is broader than just real estate. We can see  in this private letter ruling that automobiles, light duty trucks and minivans  all quality for 1031 treatment if they are exchanged for other like-kind  property that will also be used in their trade or business of the taxpayer.</p>
