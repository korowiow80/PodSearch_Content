It is with some sadness and a great bit of relief that we say goodbye to the Utah Sports Cast in its current form.  It's been fun for about a year and a half to get together at some ridiculous hour once a week to bring you a rant or two about sports in our great state.  But the luster has worn off a bit, and even though BYU looks to be winning the conference again in basketball and the Jazz are apparently playoff-bound, our weekly ramblings will cease.  It's been fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is not to say that we may not be back some time.  College football season is our true passion, and we may bring this back as the "Red and Blue" college football podcast.  If the Jazz go deep into the playoffs, we may have to put something together to celebrate.  I'm sure you won't be able to keep us down long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all the radio stations that may or may not be looking for hosts for a weekend show:  We're still interested!  We're only getting tired of this in part because 1) we're doing it for free, and 2) there's no interaction.  No callers, few emailers, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to our loyal fan:  We know you're out there, somewhere.  Thanks for listening.  Now start up your own show.  You can do it.  Fill the void we're leaving behind.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33196860-8752318832399713389?l=utahsportscast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/ctwk/~4/UeC1ZZdtIa0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">2</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://utahsportscast.blogspot.com/2008/02/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-fish.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Episode 56 – Sweet Music From the Jazz</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/ctwk/~3/vf5_TAL3d8Q/episode-56-sweet-music-from-jazz.html</link><author>comments@utahsportscast.com (Bruce and Bruce)</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jan 2008 09:20:57 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33196860.post-2527858095744646135</guid><description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;a target="blank" href="http://www.utahsportscast.com/shows/show_56.mp3"&gt;Listen Here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We are still several weeks away from college basketball taking center stage, and it’s about that same amount of time until the next major &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt; sports team begins their season (&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Real&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Salt&lt;/st1:placename&gt;  &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;Lake&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;).&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So this time of the year the Utah SportsCast is almost all about the Utah Jazz, and we have a lot to say about the team and their recently reacquired position atop the Northwest Division.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Then we spend some time with &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;’s D1 college teams, and do some advanced scouting on their chances of making either of the postseason tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our Top 3 in &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; for this week:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="" lang="SV"&gt;3.

 &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;It’s been a little while since our last show, and while I enjoyed the break, it didn’t do anything for my podcasting skills.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I would like to apologize in advance.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If you are somehow able to only listen to Zach, you will be fine.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We spend most of our time this week talking about the &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; and BYU bowl games, even though they took place a few weeks ago.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Both teams won, which was the outcome we both predicted and hoped for, and they were fitting conclusions to good seasons.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; had a bit more exciting of a second half against Navy, while the Cougars did all of their damage to UCLA in the first half. &lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Both games were competitive until the very end, so they were thrilling, if not satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;As fans, we are anticipating bigger and better things next year.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;For &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;, they will be returning a big portion of their offensive line, Brian Johnson should be healthy, Darrell Mack and Matt Asiata could form a potent 1-2 punch, and their best offensive player, Brent Casteel, will be back from injury.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Defensively, they will be hurt by significant losses: Martail Burnett, Gabe Long, Steve Tate, Joe Jiannoni, Molokai Mokofisi, and Kyle Brady, among others.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A few emerging stars will return, such as Stevenson Sylvester, Paul Kruger, and Brice McCain.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Incidentally, I hate to write this here, but I feel like I need to at least one more time: &lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;I hope McCain gets a few extra reps covering other teams’ best receivers on long throwing situations.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Sorry.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I just had to get that out of my system, again.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;BYU will have most of their offense back, including their very potent tandem of Max Hall, Harvey Unga, and Dennis Pitta. &lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Austin Collie is expected to return as a deep threat, and Travis Bright should be fully recovered from the broken leg he suffered in the UCLA game.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They will be losing all-purpose receiver Matt Allen and a few others, but should have enough good underclassmen to increase their production next year.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;However, and like &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;, they will take their most serious hits on defense.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It would be enough to lose Bryan Kehl – perhaps the best athlete on the team – and Kelly Poppinga among the departing linebackers.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But BYU will also graduate Quinn Gooch, Ben Criddle, Corby Hodgkiss, Kayle Buchanan, and Dustin Gabriel, which accounts for nearly their entire playing defensive secondary.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I am tempted to say that &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;’s losses will be less significant than BYU’s, and that the power could shift in the conference next year.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;After all, &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; will have a senior quarterback behind an experienced line, and perhaps a bit of an easier job of retooling on defense.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;However, BYU is now the two-time defending conference champ, and Coach Bronco Mendenhall proved this year that he can adjust his plans for player departures.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Under a lesser coaching staff this would have been an average season for the Cougars, but Mendenhall and his cohorts simply did not let that happen.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;BYU has not lost in the Mountain West Conference since November 19, 2005, and at the end of this season, they have to be the favorites to win next year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There is more to be had in our podcast, including a little about college hoops and the semi-pro team that plays in the Energy Solutions Arena.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our Top 3 in &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; for this week (a cumulative list):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;3. Austin Collie&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;2.

Miller, for example, or an English-Portuguese dictionary for Freddy Adu), but the others proved a bit more challenging.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Here are some of the highlights: &lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We started our holiday gift giving with the Utah Jazz, and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Jerry Sloan&lt;/span&gt; was first.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;For Christmas he will receive &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Long Overdue Kudos&lt;/span&gt;, for producing one of the most remarkable careers a head coach has ever had in the NBA.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;There is a curious reluctance among basketball insiders to give Coach Sloan credit for his body of work.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It is often mentioned that he has never won an NBA Championship as a head coach, although plenty of others have won awards like Coach of the Year without the hardware.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;When USA Basketball used to change head coaches in the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century, it was always the previous team’s first assistant that was given a chance at the helm.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Remember who had come up through that system and was due to coach the national team when they decided to disregard the long-standing accolade and just give it to Mike Krzyzewski?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Does anyone believe USA Basketball would have made such a drastic change if the next coach had been Phil Jackson or Pat Riley, instead of Jerry Sloan?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Incidentally, how many NBA Championships has Coach K won as a head coach?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A little respect from the national media will do a lot of good for Coach Sloan this year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Next on the list is &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Andrei Kirilenko&lt;/span&gt;, and we are giving him a &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reliable Jumpshot&lt;/span&gt; for Christmas (or whatever they celebrate in &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;Russia&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;).&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This is basically the only thing AK really needs as a basketball player, as his lessons with Jeff Hornacek do not seem to have borne fruit yet.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We want to give him a little jumpstart, and turn Kirilenko into that third offensive option the Jazz desperately need. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;For &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Matt Harpring&lt;/span&gt; we would like to offer him a free &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Turning Back of the Clock&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Of all the problems Harpring has dealt with this year, the most pressing seems to be the slow, steady creep of his odometer.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Perhaps an extra year or two (kind of similar to what the NCAA does for medically ineligible athletes) would heal a lot of persistent pains and rejuvenate the hardest working man on the team.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Paul Millsap&lt;/span&gt; is next, and for him we have picked &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Four More Inches of Height&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Millsap is a talented, strong, and determined player who can be very good for an NBA team, preferably the Jazz.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;However, being just a little bit taller would take him to another level.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Do you think he comes up with some amazing rebounds and unbelievable blocks now?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Wait until he is as tall as Dwight Howard.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We almost gave him a &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Great Nickname&lt;/span&gt; as his Christmas gift, but we thought he could make good use of the height upgrade now, and save that for another year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;For the BYU Football team we began with &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Bronco Mendenhall&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This was an obvious choice, and something we know he really wants.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We would like to give Coach Mendenhall &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;A Few More Non-Conference Wins&lt;/span&gt; as his Christmas gift.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The conference hasn’t been a problem for the last few years, and he seems to have the &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; rivalry figured out.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So the only thing he really needs to take this program to another level is a few more wins in the non-conference schedule.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Of course, there will be a whole new set of arguments from the national BCS apologists when the Cougars go 12-0 next year, but at least BYU will be a part of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We think &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Max Hall&lt;/span&gt; will make good use of the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Quicker Decision Making Ability&lt;/span&gt; we are giving him.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Hopefully it will keep him from being dismembered in the pocket as often as he has in the past twelve games.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In addition to concern for his personal welfare, he should also be able to find smaller passing seams and hit more receivers, which will be nice.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It was either that or &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;A Mustache&lt;/span&gt;, which would make him look more old-school, but we wouldn’t want him to have Honor Code issues. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Bryan Kehl&lt;/span&gt; won’t be playing for the Cougars next year, but we are giving him a gift anyway.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He will be getting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;More National Attention&lt;/span&gt;, which has been sadly missing for an athlete of his caliber.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Not only will this benefit Kehl as a football player (not to mention his soon-to-be-bulging bank account), but an NFL team will find themselves with an exceptional, adaptable defensive player.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;With his size and speed, Kehl could be one of the scariest safeties in the league, or a tough, blitzing linebacker.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Congratulations, Bryan, and you’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;[Note: Here I wanted to give &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Harvey Unga&lt;/span&gt; the gift of &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Becoming the Starting Running Back for the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:place style="font-weight: bold;" st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;University&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;  of &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:placename&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;, but Zach vetoed the idea, rather dramatically.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Sorry, &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;Harvey&lt;/st1:city&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We started our list for the &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;University&lt;/st1:placetype&gt; of &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:placename&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; football team by giving &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Kyle Wittingham&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Season with No Significant Injuries&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Every coach knows that being hurt is a part of football (the game does involve wearing armor and hitting other people, after all) but Coach Wittingham seems to have had unusually bad luck in that department last year.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;There are plenty of theories as to why: some people think it comes from over-practicing, and others claim it is really under-practicing.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We say: no worries either way.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;With this gift, no &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; player will miss significant time due to injury, and then we can really evaluate the season, without disclaimers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The gift of &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Durability&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Brian Johnson&lt;/span&gt; was an easy call.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We wanted to give it to him during the first half of the first game this year, when he was trudging into the locker room with an injury.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This was after just a quarter-and-a-half of competitive football in a little under two seasons.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But we didn’t have that kind of foresight, and besides, Christmas was still a few months away.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;When Johnson came back he was tentative at best, and looked like he thought every hit may be his last.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A little dose of durability should give him the confidence he needs to have a great senior season.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Brice McCain&lt;/span&gt; was a bit difficult to shop for, and you know there is always at least one on your list.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I wanted to give him a &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Time Machine&lt;/span&gt;, so he could go back a few weeks and properly cover Austin Collie on fourth and 17, but that wouldn’t really solve the problem (and I imagined another nixing coming from Zach).&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We finally settled on &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Ability to Stop Making Rookie Mistakes&lt;/span&gt;, which should be beneficial in the future.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We also remembered &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Jason Kreis&lt;/span&gt;, the head coach of &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Real&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Salt&lt;/st1:placename&gt;  &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;Lake&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We are giving him &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Greater Public Support&lt;/span&gt; as his gift, which will help a lot as he struggles in the coming years.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We considered giving Coach Kreis &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;More Offensive Weapons&lt;/span&gt; to help him win over the soccer-ignorant masses, but instead we just went right to the source. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Finally, to &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Nick Rimando&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Real&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Salt&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;Lake&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; we would like to give a &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reliable Back Line&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The best defender RSL has had in their brief existence (Eddie Pope) is now retired, and he was overburdened as it was.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Having one of the best young keepers in the league is great, but he needs to be making one or two great saves per game rather than five or six.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;With our gift of talented defenders, he doesn’t have to be miraculous in order to get a clean sheet here and there.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;That’s it for the holiday gift highlights, and thank you for reading.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Please download and listen to our show for previews of the Poinsettia Bowl and the Las Vegas Bowl, a little ranting and raving about the woes of the Utah Jazz, and a little bit about local college hoops.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our Top 3 in &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; for this week:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="" lang="SV"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;3. Ronnie Brewer&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;2.

 &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;As promised (or threatened, depending on how you look at it), an open letter to the &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Brigham&lt;/st1:placename&gt;  &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Young&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;University&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; football team:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Dear Cougar players, coaches, and administrators, &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;First and foremost: congratulations Champs!&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That’s two in a row, after not having won one for a few years.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Not too shabby, if you ask me.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Fans in other conferences would have liked to see their team chase bigger dreams after a good season, but you guys have your priorities in order.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Besides, that makes two straight undefeated seasons in your conference, which is pretty impressive, and looks good on a resume.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Of course, it would be nice if you could win a few of the higher-profile non-conference games, and get a shot at the real prizes, but don’t worry too much about it.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Besides, the Las Vegas Bowl loves having you, right?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It’s the closest bowl to &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Provo&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; (if I’m reading my map correctly), so everyone can come down and see it.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Besides, nobody wants to travel during the holidays, even if it is &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;New Orleans&lt;/st1:city&gt;, &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;Pasadena&lt;/st1:city&gt;, &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;Phoenix&lt;/st1:city&gt;, or &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Miami&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Get a nice, early bowl game and be home in time for Christmas.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That’s wise of you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I should start by thanking Coach Bronco Mendenhall and his excellent program for putting things together.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;There is a coaching sweet spot where at the end of the year your fans are somewhere between Overjoyed About A Fantastic Season and Wish They Had Done Just A Little Better.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Coach Mendenhall has found that hard-to-reach place for two seasons running, and good for him.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That spells “job security” and “managing expectations,” right?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Hey, the flippin’ stadium is named after the last coach who was consistently good, and Bronco has already learned the scowling reticence bit.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A win or two against some of those mediocre Pac-10 and C-USA teams would probably help the legacy, though.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;As a fan, it was nice to see Bryan Kehl have a good senior year.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He will certainly go down as one of the most athletic defenders to ever strap it up for BYU, and could almost have played any position on the field.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In fact, a few times I thought it was too bad he wasn’t playing every position, particularly when &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Tulsa&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt;’s receivers were 15 yards behind his buddies in the defensive secondary.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Oh well, like the old saying goes, you can’t win them all.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Besides, BYU’s stars have always been on the other side of the ball.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Good luck in the future, &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Bryan&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt;, we hope to see you in the NFL.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We are really, really, REALLY going to miss you next year, when the fans will be hoping that opposing teams elect to neither run nor pass against the defense.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Hey, speaking of offensive stars, how about that Max Hall kid, huh?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It isn’t easy to step into the Legendary BYU Quarterback position, and he did it pretty well, for an underclassman.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Naysayers and doubters thought he wouldn’t be able to handle it, but he looked comfortable in the pocket. &lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Sure, that comfort led to a few rip-roarin’ hits and ugly interceptions by some lucky defenders, but he’s young (that’s “young” as in age, and not a comparison to “Steve Young”).&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Besides, if they ever hold an “NCAA Quarterback Who Looks the Most Like Comedian Will Farrell” contest, he has to be a finalist, at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The real revelation of the season was Harvey Unga, who even set freshman team rushing records.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We were every bit as excited about him this year as we were last year when it was Fui Vakapuna making the headlines.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Now, Fui’s numbers may have dropped off a bit in 2007, but that’s okay, he’s still an exciting player, right?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I would like to offer a word of advice to young &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Harvey&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt;, though.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;You may want to avoid two things in the off-season: (1) Your Sofa, and (2) Buffets.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Given your 1,000+ yards and solid freshman season, we will expect nothing less than the Greatest Running Back to Ever Wear Blue out of you.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We want you to help erase the painful memories of Luke Staley’s Senior Season That Never Was.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So, you know… no pressure and good luck with that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Well, that’s about it.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We sure hope you figure out something for that missing &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Nevada&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; game that will be winnable and impressive to voters.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Obviously, we would like to see you steer clear of any Division II teams, but you already know that.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Ohio&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;State&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; can play cupcakes and still end the season highly ranked, but BYU cannot.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Even if we, the fans, think you should, sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;With more hopefulness than you might expect, &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Nate N.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Co-Host, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:place style="font-style: italic;" st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; SportsCast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There is plenty more in the podcast, particularly considering that we really didn’t talk much about BYU football.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So, tune in for our quarter-season grades for the Utah Jazz, and a few words about college hoops.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our Top 3 in &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; for this week:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="" lang="SV"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;

 &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoNormal"&gt;An open letter to the &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;University&lt;/st1:placetype&gt; of &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:placename&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; football team:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Dear &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; players, coaches, and administrators, &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;First of all, and on behalf of &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; fans everywhere, I would like to thank you for a good season, and for a series of entertaining football games.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We are uncomplicated when it comes to our expectations, and you have certainly exceeded mine.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Congratulations on tying for third in the Mountain West Conference.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The fans of other teams in other conferences would find it odd that three wins short of the conference championship qualifies as a “good season,” but that is how we roll around here. &lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; fans are content if there are more wins than losses, and the team ends up in a third or fourth tier bowl.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Besides, they may be headed to &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;San Diego&lt;/st1:city&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; for the Poinsettia Bowl, and that is one fantastic city.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I was a bit disappointed that you had a chance to beat The Team to the South and choked it away in the final minute (again!), but no hard feelings.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Those pesky Cougars are pretty tough, and they have been ranked both years, so it’s easy to see why you may have been intimidated.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Of course, UCLA was ranked as well, and you managed to obliterate them from the field, but this isn’t the same situation.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Better luck in 2008, when you get them on The Hill.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Thanks go especially to Coach Kyle Wittingham and his staff of football experts.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It was a bold season strategy for your team to look really good in some games and really poor in others.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I don’t know as much about the sport as you guys, so from my perspective it just seems like you didn’t prepare the team properly.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But, you won seven games in a row and were a blown defensive coverage away from beating your arch-rivals, right?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;So whatever you were doing was clearly working well.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Besides, we don’t expect championships as fans of &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; – 5-3 in conference sits well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Speaking of the blown defensive coverage, I would like to thank Brice McCain for being an NFL prospect.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I heard this several times from several different national commentators (well, the Versus and CSTV guys, but still), and it really raises the credibility of the program to have such high caliber players.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I would think a professional-level player wouldn’t leave the other team’s best receiver to try and cover a poor-running quarterback who stands a zero percent chance of shambling for 18 yards, but that’s just my take on it.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I am sure a high-caliber football mind, like yours must be, knows better.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I also want to give kudos to Louis Sakoda, for being the very best player on the team.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Usually when the kicker/punter is the most clutch player on the roster it can be a bit nerve-racking (See BYU circa 2003-04), but you pulled it off.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Maybe when Brent Casteel comes back from season-long injury next year he can give you a bit more competition for that title.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Don’t think I’ve forgotten about you, Brian Johnson!&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We heard a lot about your good decision-making skills in the pre-season, and you didn’t disappoint.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Well, except for the times when your decision was to attempt a pass of over 20 yards.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;As a fan, there is something disheartening about watching a ball sail eight feet over the head of a wide-open receiver, but don’t worry about that.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;At least they were incomplete and not interceptions (usually), so we weren’t as upset as we could have been.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Besides, you still have that senior season to finally live up to your potential.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Anyway, that’s about it.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;There were some great times this season, and I am already looking forward to next year.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Maybe one of these years you guys can go back to being consistently strong on both sides of the ball, although it is great that you are considered a “defensive” team.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It would also be nice if you could challenge for the Mountain West title sometime, rather than losing it in a week four shutout at the hands of the worst team in the conference.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But these are small, nitpicky things, and only suggestions.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Besides, it’s only been a few years since &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; was a national football power, and we don’t want to be greedy fans.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Thanks again, and good luck in your insignificant bowl game!&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Here’s to a good 2008!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;With no bitterness whatsoever,&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Nate N.&lt;br /&gt;Co-Host, &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; SportsCast&lt;span style=""&gt;

 &lt;/span&gt;Visit us next week for an open letter to the BYU football team.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our All-BYU Top 3 in &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; for this week:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;3.

 &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The much-anticipated Rivalry Week is finally here.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;’s next scheduled game is in &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;Provo&lt;/st1:city&gt;,  &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; against BYU, and vice-versa.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Within a week the hype will be silenced, the preparation will be over, the plays will be run, the dust will have settled, and one team will stand triumphant over the other.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I could not be more excited. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Both &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; and BYU stretched their winning streaks to seven games last week, with significant wins over conference teams.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt; played at home, fending off a motivated &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; team with defense and luck.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The Lobos had looked bad-to-shaky in past weeks, and were still fighting for the postseason.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt; was still swaggering after a dominating win over &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;, and with BYU looming on the horizon, was in danger of a potential let-down game. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;As has been the case in the past few weeks, &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;’s defense was the best squad on the field for either team.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;To be fair, &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; also has a good defense, and the offenses for both teams have been somewhat hit-or-miss this season, but it was the consistent play on defense that secured the game for the home team.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; benefited from a few special teams mistakes by the Lobos, notably fumbled punts, and also managed a defensive touchdown as Koa Misi returned a fumble toward the end of the fourth quarter.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The final score was 28-10, which means &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;’s offense was only responsible for three touchdowns.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;All things considered, that was probably not the best way to prepare for your in-state rivals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Meanwhile, BYU was in &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;Laramie&lt;/st1:city&gt; to take care of a fading Wyoming Cowboys team who had lost two of their last three, including the surreal 0-50 drubbing against &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The Cougars had not looked their best in past weeks, with offensive question marks and a shaky defensive secondary, but seemed to right the ship against the otherwise hapless Cowboys.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Max Hall was shaken up by another big hit (note to BYU’s coaches: that’s something you may want to work on), but returned to close out the game and key a 35-10 victory.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;For the record, &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; has now been outscored 85-10 in two weeks, and lost three of their last four.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In terms of offense, BYU looks solid.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Hall still makes a few bad decisions and throws a few bad passes per game, but he looks solid going into the big game.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The excellent backfield pieces of Harvey Unga, Manase &lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Tonga&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;, Joe Semanoff, and Fui Vakapuna anchor a formidable running attack, as well as contributing to a good overall passing game.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The defense has played well, and it’s difficult to argue with allowing only 10 points on the road, but there are some holes in the secondary.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our best guess is that the game will be won between &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;’s vaunted defense and BYU’s potent offense.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Even more specifically, it will come down to &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;’s quick defensive line against BYU’s solid offensive line.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;However, we made almost those same exact predictions last year, and after a crazy, exciting game, realized we were simplifying things a bit too much.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So our best guess is probably that it’s anyone’s game.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Will Kyle Wittingham’s big-game passion trump the clinical detachment of Bronco Mendenhall?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Can &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;’s underrated running game evade the overexposed linebacking corps of BYU?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Is &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;’s brave, powerful defense up to the challenge of BYU’s self-important, overrated offense?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Am I allowing my cheering interest to compromise any objectiveness I may have had?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The answer is yes to all of those questions.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;[Note: I am a fan of Cougar Football as well, but during rivalry games I have to suspend my usual trying-to-sit-on-the-fence trick.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;After this week I will be back to root for the Cougars in the Las Vegas Bowl.]&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I typically write that we have much more in the podcast, but in fairness, there isn’t much.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We are all about the rivalry this week, although we do mention some of the other noteworthy items, including &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:placename&gt;  &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;State&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;’s first win of the season (as reflected in our Top 3, below).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our Top 3 in &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; for this week:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;T-2.

 &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;On the surface, this was a pretty good week for the Utah SportsCast.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The Jazz swept all four of the games they played since our last show, BYU won a critical conference game in &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;Provo&lt;/st1:city&gt;, and &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; completely outmanned their hapless opponent.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That is a 6-0 combined record for the “big three” of this point in the sports season, and a fan could hardly ask for more than four game, five game, and six game win streaks, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;However, results do not always tell the complete story, and there is a deeper level of concern for each of these teams.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The Jazz are off to a quick start at 6-2, but the wins seem to have come against lesser competition (although I still say &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Cleveland&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; is a good team), and the two losses at by the only good conference teams they have played.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;BYU has a perfect conference record and only two early-season losses, but their offense didn’t look great in the second half against TCU.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They still won, and their defense secured the game in the second half, but they did so without much scoring support.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Then, there was the &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; game.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I am the designated &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; fan here at the Utah SportsCast, and while I don’t have a fancy t-shirt indicating as much, I consider myself an invested follower of the team.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I mention this because I have also noticed a vague and uncertain negative emotion – centered on the team – that bubbles up in me on occasion.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I usually just ignore the feeling, and have never bothered to understand it, but it all crystallized early in the third quarter of the &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/st1:state&gt; game:&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Sometimes it’s hard to be a &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; fan, because sometimes they behave despicably.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The latest example was the nationally-covered brouhaha between Kyle Wittingham and &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; coach Joe Glenn, but this isn’t the first time I have felt that way about Coach Kyle’s program.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Every time a &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; player jumps up to strut around after a big play, I cringe.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Each camera shot of &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;’s bench horsing around on the sidelines or laughing at the other team causes me to turn away.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Any on-field mocking conversations cause me to shake my head in disapproval.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Don’t get me wrong, it is just a game and I think players should be passionate about it.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I like the excitement that comes after big plays, and I don’t have a problem with not being buddies with the other team.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;’s brand of attitude sometimes comes across as mocking, and that is intolerable, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Worst of all is when that despicable behavior comes from the top.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I could not have disagreed more with Coach Wittingham kicking onside when they were up by six touchdowns.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;After the game he made a lot of growled excuses about still playing in the third quarter and responding to guaranteed victories from Coach Glenn, but that point was made when it was 40-0 at halftime.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Winning big without going out of the way to embarrass the other team would have been a more powerful statement; instead, the &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; coaching staff came across as petty and vindictive.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The commotion is beginning to fade now that both coaches have apologized, and the Mountain West Conference has publicly reprimanded the obscene gesture.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But deep down inside, anyone who watched it live, saw it on replay, or heard it described felt that Joe Glenn was justified in his one-fingered opinion.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But that is the burden of being a &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; football fan: sometimes you have to deal with despicable behavior from your team and coach.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;As always, we have much more in the podcast, including more about BYU’s big win, a good start for the Utah Jazz, and local college basketball.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our Top 3 in &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; for this week:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;3. Gabe Long&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;2.

 &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;It was good to have &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Brigham&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Young&lt;/st1:placename&gt;  &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;University&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; back on the field after their rescheduling bye.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It was only the second home game for the Cougars since September 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, and they hosted the bottom-dwelling Colorado State Rams.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;As predicted, suspected or hoped-for, BYU won by a large margin: 35-16.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The Cougars are now undefeated in their past 12 conference games.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Max Hall saw a return to earlier excellence, which, according to Zach, was the second most important thing BYU had to accomplish this week (winning being the first, of course).&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The entire passing game was the most potent part of the Cougar offense, racking up 355 pass yards with two receivers going over 100 yards, and seven different receivers touching the ball.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The running game was more subdued, perhaps by design, although five different players rushed for positive yards (the punter being one of them).&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The team rushed for around 100 yards total.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The defense looked good at times, like when they held CSU to one field goal for three first-half trips inside BYU’s 20 yard-line, but they were not impenetrable by any standard.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The secondary was still a bit shaky, and if the Rams running backs could get beyond the defensive line, they usually picked up decent yardage.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It is true that most of the scoring came against second string competition, but the level of effort from the first team may not have sufficed against a better team.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;All in all, it was a good opportunity for BYU to get back on track for the concluding games of the season.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They have a much more stringent test coming up Thursday, November 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; against TCU, who is coming to Lavell Edwards Stadium following a 37-0 demolition of &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The short week for both teams should minimize the impact of strategic preparation, and the respective talent of each team will be exaggerated.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Whether that translates to a BYU win will remain to be seen, although it should be a good opportunity to extend their streak.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Please check out the podcast for much more, including a preview of &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt; vs. &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;, and some Utah Jazz Talk.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our Top 3 in &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;

 &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I am a big fan of sports, which should be evident by the fact that I voluntarily wake up at 4:45 AM once a week to participate in this podcast.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I have a reasonably broad range of sports I enjoy following, as well as some specific teams or players within that range.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The same is true of Zach, I know, and I suspect could be said of most other sports fans in the world.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We enjoy sports, we follow them, and for the most part we have more than one team/sport we follow.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;These are very pedestrian, general facts about sports fans, of course, and I only mention them because 2007 has been an unusual year for Zach and me.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;As purveyors of a “sports media outlet,” we watch and analyze sports much more than we did as everyday fans.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Our once-casual “catch that game last night?” conversations have now become in-depth breakdowns of games, players, and leagues.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We discuss interpretation of rules, quality of coverage, and socio-cultural impact.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This is all on a very amateur scale, of course – the Utah SportsCast is just a free-time activity for us.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;To add to that pleasant confusion, both Zach and I have become soccer fans in earnest during the past year.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We have outlined some of this in a new blog/podcast experiment we are trying to produce (visit at &lt;a style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);" target="blank" href="http://thebeautifulpodcast.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Beautiful Podcast&lt;/a&gt;), so it doesn’t require mentioning for this blog entry beyond the fact that we now have new teams and leagues to follow.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This just means more items to digest from our already groaning smörgåsbord of sports.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;To summarize, we are in a position where we have many different sports and teams to follow, with a semi-legitimate reason to do it.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;With that in mind, it’s not a surprise that I follow sports as closely now as I did as a teenager (I suspect the same is true for Zach, but I can’t speak for him).&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I suppose I could count the sports I follow, along with the associated leagues and teams, but that’s probably unimportant and I would miss some anyway.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The short answer:&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A lot.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So I was very surprised, in the midst of some fantastic sporting competition, when I realized that I have a single favorite team – one that stands above all other teams in all other sports.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It does so in spite of my recent obsession with soccer, and in spite of an exciting year for local college football.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Two NFL teams I enjoy are doing well this year, and “my team” in that league looks playoff-worthy, but it’s not one of those.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It’s not even a national team, and there are few times I enjoy being a sports fan more than when I am following Team &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;USA&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; in anything.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;No, my all-time favorite team to follow is the Utah Jazz.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;[Note: The reader may have expected me something like “the Human Team” as my favorite, and me to praise the Beauty and Complexity of competition as my highest ideal.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That probably would have been more philosophical and meaningful, and I wish I could write it here, but it wouldn’t be true.]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I came to this realization two nights ago, and as mentioned, it was really quite surprising.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I was watching them win their season opener against the Golden State Warriors, and it occurred to me that I invest more emotion and interest in the success of the Utah Jazz than I do any other team.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Further compounding the strangeness for me is that I am not really an over-the-top fan of the NBA, certainly not more than other sports leagues.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If I don’t have a rooting interest, I would probably rather watch a random game from the NFL, NHL, NCAA Football, or Barclay’s Premier League.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;It could be that the Jazz were my “first love” as a young sports fan – the team that got me interested in sports to begin with.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Maybe it’s because they are the only local team of genuine national significance (sorry &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Real&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Salt&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;Lake&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;, and Major League Soccer).&lt;span style=""&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;Maybe it’s because I really like basketball players and coaches with ties to the state of &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Illinois&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I don’t really know.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But I am certain that I am more anticipatory, I celebrate more plays, I bemoan more bad calls, and I am more superstitious about the Utah Jazz than any other team.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;There are other individual games that may reach that high status for me (&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; versus BYU in football, for instance), but as far as daily interest goes, nothing touches the Jazz.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That may not be crucial to me as a fan, but it was nice to find out where my heart lies.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Needless to say, I am looking forward to the 2007-2008 season.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There is much more to enjoy in the podcast, which took a few unusual turns this week.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Hopefully, it will make for entertaining listening.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If not, well, our iron-clad guarantee holds true: you will love this podcast or your money back.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our Top 3 in &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; for this week:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;3.

 &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I should start this blog entry with a disclaimer: I didn’t watch either the &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; or the BYU games this past week.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It wasn’t a lack of interest, but I had other, previous engagements during both games.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I did catch a bit of each on the radio, and read the post-game articles, but that was it.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I only mention this in the interest of full disclosure.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Well, that, and it gives me an excuse when all of my thoughts and opinions are more foolish than usual.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Anyway, I had written &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt; off for the year as recently as the afternoon of Friday, October 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, just prior to their win over &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Louisville&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;At that point they were a shaky 2-3, and already with two conference losses.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Their only wins at that point were a bizarre rout of UCLA that seemed to have come from another team, and a very pedestrian showing against &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;State&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;On that same afternoon, BYU was 3-2, and undefeated in two conference games.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Their two losses were non-conference away games, and they were looking every bit like the team to beat in the MWC.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They had beaten Air Force, who started strong, and opened the year with a nice win against Pac-10 Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Since that afternoon, &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; has rolled off three wins in a row – two of them on the road against teams that were projected to be their respective conference champions.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;BYU has won twice, both in games where they were favored.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;There are a few similarities at this point in the season: both teams have won four games in a row, each with two wins at home and two on the road.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Both teams have five total wins on the season.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Both teams have a win and a loss against Pac-10 schools.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;However, &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; seems to be playing better football than BYU, at least at the moment.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Last Thursday &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; held on for a big conference road win against TCU, and the next day local radio shows were buzzing with talk of the “swagger” returning.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Two days later – and in spite of beating Division 1-AA/Championship Division/Whatever Eastern Washington by five touchdowns – the Cougars did not impress their fans or the local media.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The consensus seems to be that &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; is coming together as a team, and BYU may be losing their focus a bit.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The Cougars have a significant advantage in conference record (BYU 3-0, &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; 2-2), even though the overall standings are fairly close.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; is still alive in the conference race, although they would need BYU to lose at least once before the Utah/BYU game, and then beat the Cougars in Lavell Edwards Stadium, accompanied by Air Force losing both of their remaining conference games.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That is an unlikely scenario, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;For BYU, all they need to do is keep on winning; which could be prove difficult considering they have to play TCU at home and Wyoming on the road in the weeks leading up to the Utah game.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The unplanned bye this week may help them refocus and heal some nagging injuries, but it will also extend their regular season a week longer.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If their level of play doesn’t improve, it could be disastrous.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The final conclusion for both teams is far from clear, and the season is much more interesting than it was on the afternoon of October 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We have more about BYU and &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; in the podcast, as well as a bit about the end of RSL’s season, and even some preseason Jazz talk.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We also rolled out a special edition “Top 3 from &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Real&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Salt&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;Lake&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;” to commemorate the very forgettable season:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our Top 3 from &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Real&lt;/st1:placename&gt;  &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Salt&lt;/st1:placename&gt;

If &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; manages to keep the score close and look good (or, in another shock, win), then we may have to back to the drawing board.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So, I was shocked (as predicted) when &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt; not only beat &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Louisville&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; 44-35 at Papa John’s Stadium, but looked pretty good in the process.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They dominated the first half and scored enough in the second half to hold off the best quarterback in the NCAA.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A big loss would have answered more questions than the highlight win, so I find myself again at the proverbial drawing board.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In one way, this game was even more impressive than the UCLA tilt because everyone watching that knew it was a world-class fluke.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Not so much that &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; won, but that they dominated every aspect of the game.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They took a top-ranked team and made them look like the biggest cupcake they would play all year.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It didn’t help that UCLA gave up halfway through the third quarter, but the damage was done by that point.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;Louisville&lt;/st1:city&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; game was much different.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Again, &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt; dominated the first half, but &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Louisville&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; brought it back to as close as six points in the fourth quarter.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It was a fight to the end, in other words, before Reliable Louie Sakoda booted a 46 yard clinching field goal with about 90 seconds left.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The running game for &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; was spectacular, behind Darrell Mack’s 163 yard, 3 touchdown performance.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Brian Johnson threw for 312 yards and added two more touchdowns (one passing, one rushing), with no interceptions.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;’s line played great on the defensive end, controlling the line of scrimmage and holding &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Louisville&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; to just 26 total rushing yards.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Unfortunately, that opened the field to the Cardinals’ Brian Brohm (the afore-mentioned “best quarterback in the NCAA”), who lit up &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;’s secondary for 467 yards and four touchdowns.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He was sacked three times in the game, which doubled his total sacks on the season, but some of that had to do with his two best receivers being out for the game.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;As a fan, I would be curious to see how different the game would have been with those star receivers playing.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Then again, if &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; had Brent Casteel and Matt Asiata, it would have made a difference, as well.&lt;span style=""&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;It was a great, exciting win, and &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; looked good in the process.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;However, it also reinforced the inconsistency theory, and created more questions about the team.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; has now won three of their last four, including two in a row (their first winning streak of the season).&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Two of those wins came against teams that had been ranked in the top 15 at one point in the season.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The one loss was an embarrassing shut-out to one of the worst teams in the conference (UNLV’s only other win, ironically, was &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:placename&gt;  &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;State&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So, was the &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Louisville&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; game the beginning of a long winning trend?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Was it a sign that the UNLV game, like the UCLA game, was something of a fluke?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Is the real &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; team now emerging, ready to challenge for a bowl game (and with a lot of luck, the conference title)?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Or is this yet another tantalizing hint of what could be?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A peek at how talented and explosive the offense really is, when they have consistent playcalling?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Is another bumbling loss just around the corner?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I would like to say that I have stopped guessing and analyzing, and that I will just take each game as it comes.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That would be completely untrue, but I do wish I could say it.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt; plays &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;San Diego&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;State&lt;/st1:placetype&gt; at home and TCU in &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Dallas&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; for their next two games.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;One of those games should be relatively easy and the other a tough contest, although the way this season is going I’m not so sure which is which.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Time will tell… I hope.&lt;span style=""&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There is much more in the podcast, as always.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Well, maybe not much more, but it’s more entertaining, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our Top 3 in &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; for this week:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;3. Brian Johnson &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;2. Tim Toone&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;1.

 &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Zach and I were able to get together last Saturday and watch both &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt; vs. &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;State&lt;/st1:placetype&gt; and &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; vs. BYU.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It was not the first time we had watched games together, of course, but it’s pretty rare that we have a chance to do it.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It was good to see &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; get a cruise-control victory in the driving snow.&lt;span style=""&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;It was also nice to find out that BYU could stumble a bit against a motivated opponent, and still pull out a win.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;After the game we celebrated by playing a few rounds of FIFA ’06 on my Xbox.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A good time was had by all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The problems surrounding the &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;University&lt;/st1:placetype&gt; of &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:placename&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; have been ground up by the local media (including us, if we qualify as “media”) for several weeks, now.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It started as a bad luck story with key players out with injuries, turned very bright for one week, and now seems to have settled into understanding.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;My current diagnosis is that &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; is just a mediocre team that played dynamite for one week.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Under this theory, the “inconsistency” I have mentioned before is changed to read “mediocrity.”&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Yes, they put up 34 points last Saturday, but that was against a below-average team.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Not to mention &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;State&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; scored 18 in the process.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We should have a handle on this team after five games, but the anomaly of Utah/UCLA still looms large.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If they lose big this Friday at &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Louisville&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; (as, unfortunately, I am expecting) then the “mediocre” definition will probably stick.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; manages to keep the score close and look good (or, in another shock, win), then we may have to back to the drawing board.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I am tempted to hope for a loss, just so we can finally figure this team out.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Of course, my internal fan won’t let me make that mental jump.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The bigger story this week was BYU’s timely win at &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Watching the game as a somewhat less passionate fan (I couldn’t wear one of those “Fully Invested” shirts – it just wouldn’t be right) I can say that &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;New   Mexico&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; has good athletes, they scouted BYU well (point courtesy of Zach), and were excited and prepared.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The Cougars, on the other hand, did not play a great game.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The offense had trouble moving the ball, the defense seemed confused much of the time, and they were relying on athleticism and big plays to win.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Where it becomes good news for Cougar fans is they still managed to win.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The score was close at the end, but BYU played through a bad week, on the road, and pulled out a victory.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I don’t know whether to credit superior talent or better coaching, because I don’t think BYU is much better in either of those categories.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;After the game, UNM head coach Rocky Long said BYU deserved to win, but they are not a better team than &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I can’t say I completely agree with that, but the difference in talent level is much closer than blinkered BYU fans may think.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Not having seen any other &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; games this year I can’t evaluate their relative level of play.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It could be that they stalled a bit, as well.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Regardless, I wonder if Coach Bronco Mendenhall’s emphasis on mental toughness and discipline made the difference against &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;New Mexico&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;BYU has been an oft-penalized team this season and has turned the ball over with disappointing frequency, both of which are always pointed to as a lack of discipline.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The penalties and turnovers were still there, but it could be that his young team finally understood what Mendenhall has been yelling about all this time and won the game on sheer determination. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There is much more in the podcast, including a conversation about the &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt; win, more on BYU and a vaguely-interested discussion of &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Real&lt;/st1:placename&gt;  &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Salt&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;Lake&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our Top 3 in &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; for this week:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;3. Derrek Richards &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;2. Bryan Kehl&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;1.

 &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There is almost always something interesting going on around the Utah Sports Cast, with the possible exception of that slow, dull time in mid-summer when we half-heartedly cover baseball while waiting for a blockbuster Utah Jazz signing.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The rest of the year is split between football and basketball seasons, so we don’t generally have a problem finding things to talk about.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;At this time of the year (early fall) the primary teams/sports we follow are &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Real&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Salt&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;Lake&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;, The University of Utah football, and &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Brigham&lt;/st1:placename&gt;  &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Young&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;University&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; football.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I mention this because last week these three teams tallied one win (&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;) against three losses (BYU and RSL lost twice).&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This week the “Big Three” went 2 – 2, with RSL splitting two games, BYU winning, and &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; losing.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The one team that won last week had their collective heads handed to them, and the teams that lost managed to find some victories.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;So it is being a &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; sports fan. &lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Our teams are often mediocre – enough so that flashes of real, legitimate success are remembered for a long time (what BYU fan doesn’t smile at the simple mention of the year 1984?).&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;More often than not we have teams that look fine one week and shaky the next.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In that sense, September has been a very typical month in &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; sports.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The ultimate expression of this inconsistency was displayed during the past two weeks by the &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;University&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;  of &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:placename&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They started with a significant, career-defining win over a nationally ranked opponent one week, followed by a pitiful shutout loss at the mercy of a team that was at the very bottom of division-one football last year.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; went from looking like a great, underrated team with a potent offense and an iron-clad defense to being throttled by one of the conference cupcakes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;To give UNLV their due, they do seem better this year from last; and they were prepared, motivated, and eager for the game.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;All the same, the &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt; team that kicked UCLA to the curb would have blown the Rebels all the way back to &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Dixie&lt;/st1:place&gt;.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Not that history has much to do with it, but this was the first time &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; had lost to UNLV since the Ford Administration.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;That provided motivation for the Rebels, and left &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; without excuses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I suspect &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; will win another few games.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In fact, they may have a winning streak sometime in the season that will bring their record to more respectable numbers.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Then, like every other Utah Sports fan, I will be predicting brighter days and bigger victories to come.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I will probably even write about it on this blog.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Then, with another bottom-tier bowl in the books, I can look forward to 2008 with much more optimism than the situation deserves.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Not that I mind -- that is the life of a &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; sports fan, after all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In other news, BYU played well and looked pretty good.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I’m not trying to ignore that, but the stuff we have in the podcast about them is very interesting and I wouldn’t want to spoil it.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;This past weekend, the temperature for &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; sports was hot, cold, and lukewarm, all at the same time.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;University&lt;/st1:placetype&gt; of &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:placename&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; football team was very hot, and looked virtually perfect as they trounced 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; ranked UCLA 44-6.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Real&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Salt&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;Lake&lt;/st1:placetype&gt; managed a lukewarm 0-0 draw against &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;Toronto&lt;/st1:city&gt;, but considering they were down a man for most of the game and playing in &lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Canada&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt;, the effort was hot.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;BYU’s offensive statistics were hot (they got in the end zone seven times), but the rest of the team was lukewarm at best (they still lost by more than a touchdown), and the special teams were downright cold.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; State, sorry to say, is neither hot, nor cold.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Following a 54-3 drubbing at the hands of the Oklahoma Sooners, the only word to describe them is: bad.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Not bad that they lost to the #3 team in college football – bad that the overwhelming defeat was expected by everyone.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The question lurking in the midst of all this is: which of the many teams we have seen are the real ones?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Is &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; the team that is capable of demolishing strong Pac-10 opponents?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It wasn’t just a loss, either – &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; beat them in every possible way, and made UCLA hang their heads.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Or are they the team that can’t manage more than one touchdown against a lesser-talented (but very hard-working) Air Force defense?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Which BYU will take the field next Saturday – the team that worked over &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Arizona&lt;/st1:state&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Or will it be the team that racks up lots of offensive yards but also lots of penalties and turnovers?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Even RSL has had flashes of brilliance in the midst of their dismal season.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;At least &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;State&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; is consistent, even if it is consistently awful.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The upcoming games will provide interesting tests for the two biggest college programs.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;’s game will not be as much a test of athletic ability as an indication of preparation and concentration.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The same team that can wipe out a significant Pac-10 school should have no problems with a bottom-of-the-pack conference foe.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:state&gt; does play well and beat UNLV in &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Las Vegas&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt;, then we have reason to hope they could recover from a shaky start and produce a good-if-not-great season.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The injuries have been significant, but &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; has shown that they have enough talent to make up for the missing players.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The Cougars have a bit more significant of a test, hosting Air Force this Saturday.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The Falcons are on a tear right now, having beaten the other two “elite” schools in the Mountain West Conference (&lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; and TCU) in the past two games.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If they could knock off BYU, that would complete the task and put Air Force as the standing favorites to win the conference.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Among the problems BYU will face is that Air Force runs an unusual offense designed to keep opposing defenses off-balance.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If that sounds familiar, consider this reminder: &lt;st1:city st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Tulsa&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:city&gt; 55, BYU 47.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;BYU’s defense has been questionable since the &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Arizona&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; game, and their special teams are just bad.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Field position is important when facing a ball-control offense like Air Force, and the Cougars have had their struggles winning that battle.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;On the other hand, the offense is still high-powered enough that they may just be able to outscore the Falcons.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The bottom line is BYU needs to win this game, and if they can do it with convincing defense, the light at the end of the tunnel may not be a freight train after all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Our Top 3 in &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt;

Real Salt Lake lost on the road against the Houston Dynamo as a follow-up to their first winning streak (2 games) this season.  Utah lost in two ways, not only dropping the home opener against Air Force, but losing their best offensive player – Brent Casteel – for the season to a knee injury.  Utah State lost to Wyoming, which shouldn’t surprise anyone who has followed the team for more than a month.  The Salt Lake Bees lost the conference playoff to the Sacramento River Cats, ending their season.  Even BYU – the team I am counting on to provide some interest for my fall sports season – lost a tough away game to ranked UCLA.  Like I said, it was a rough stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of my own personal loyalties and interests, the toughest of these losses for me to digest was Utah 12, Air Force 20.  Not because of the Falcons, who, in my opinion, are one of the most disciplined and respectable teams in the NCAA, but because of Utah’s poor play and blown opportunities.  It is true that they have opened the season with a stretch of very unlucky injuries, but they have enough depth of talent that playing a middle-of-the-pack conference opponent like Air Force at home should result in a win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead Utah fans were subjected to a game that could have been taken from last year’s campaign.  The offense was shaky due to a terrible performance at quarterback, which was augmented by poor play-calling.  The defense struggled to keep the team in the game, but never really had a chance to catch their breath because the offense was so anemic.  Their tackling became very sloppy and the linebackers played the entire second half back on their heels (Air Force rushed 63 times for 334 yards).  Utah’s best-looking drive came at the very end of the fourth quarter, but they failed on three straight downs to score from inside the five yard line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty of ammunition for finger-pointing.  Tommy Grady’s statistics improved over the previous week, but most of his positive numbers came on one unsuccessful drive.  For most of the game he had trouble with long passes, short passes, shovel passes, pitches, quick handoffs, hot reads, outlets, and screens.  He managed the long, reaching handoffs okay, most of which were quickly stopped by an energetic-if-undersized Air Force defense.  He completed a pass here and there, and seemed surprised when it happened (I might have made up that last part – maybe it was just me that was surprised).  He gave up two interceptions and looked uncomfortable for most of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coaching staff deserves some of the blame, as well.  I am not adept with football strategy, by any measure.  As I have said before on the podcast, any play calling knowledge I may have comes from playing NCAA Football on my Xbox.  I have no experience – on any level – with team or game management.  However, in spite of my towering ignorance, I know it’s not a good idea to call a long-developing wide receiver reverse on third-and-1 during a critical drive in the fourth quarter.  Especially if my running backs were producing, as Utah’s had been at the time.  However, that is exactly what Utah’s offensive coordinator called.  As one might expect, Air Force was already playing up – anticipating some sort of dive or keeper – and blew up the play for an eight-yard loss.  Utah punted on the next down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe coaching is a lot more difficult than most people understand – that the men and women in various coaching positions sacrifice their health, their other prospects, and their family lives for a generally thankless career.  I’m sure Andy Ludwig – the offensive coordinator at Utah – is a very nice man.  I know he is old buddies with head coach Kyle Wittingham, and they have a great working relationship.  But that doesn’t do a thing to address the team’s problems; namely that there is no imagination to the offensive play-calling.  I don’t write that because I can do better, or I know what needs to happen.  I write that because I watch a lot of football, and I know a bad offense when I see it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can’t be easy to lose three of your five best offensive weapons in the first two games of the year, and only hope to get one of them back for part of the season.  It would be very discouraging to have your best offensive lineman go out for the year before the first game was played.  There may be a lot of head-hanging and feeling-sorry-for-themselves going on during Utah’s practices, and I can’t say they would be unjustified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the point of having depth charts and constantly recruiting talent is so there is someone ready for these scenarios.  Even though the fans and the team are disappointed at the injuries, there are a few players who should be thrilled for the opportunity they now have to show what they can do and help the team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the coaching staff can call a good game, keep opposing defenses guessing, and tailor the plays to the available players, then there is still hope for the season.  At this point, an average team would be tempted to concede the season and use the time to develop their younger talent.  A great team, however, would – and hopefully will – rise to the occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is plenty more to hear in the podcast, including discussion of the BYU game and our top three in Utah breakdown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Top 3 in Utah for this week:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Louie Sakoda&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Max Hall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Salt Lake Bees&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much for reading and listening to the Utah SportsCast!

With college football kicking off last week and the National Football League about to start regular season play, it feels a bit like the cool end of a long, hot summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The teams followed by the Utah SportsCast played this last week, with Utah kicking off their season at Oregon State.  This game was most noteworthy – from a Utah fan’s point of view – because of the significant injuries to Utah players.  Starting quarterback Brian Johnson went down with a separated shoulder, which is expected to keep him off the playing field for 3-5 weeks.  He did manage to play almost two whole quarters of football before returning to the injured list, so that was a nice treat for fans.  With any luck, he may be able to start in a few games this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also bitten by the injury bug was Matt Asiata, who was Utah’s big pickup among Juco transfers.  He was going to be the featured running back this season, before a routine tackle broke both bones in his lower leg.  It was one of those potential career-ending injuries, but fortunately, he is expected to recover.  It won’t happen anytime soon, of course; but at some point, in the distant future, Asiata may play again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With two star players out, and the Utah offense terrorized by a big, fast, talented Oregon State defense, they were lucky to escape with only a 24-7 beating.  Brent Casteel scored their only touchdown, hauling in one of Johnson’s early passes.  He was also about the only player in red who seemed to be able to match speed with Oregon State.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later, the story was completely different for BYU.  Not only did they manage an injury-free game, but they discovered another potential star running back, their brand new quarterback looked good, and their defense was smothering (to say the least).  The visiting Arizona team managed a touchdown in the final quarter to avoid the shutout, but still went home on the wrong end of a 20-7 loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cougar fans may have a lot to be excited about this year, as they seemed to have room for improvement, in spite of playing a solid game.  If they can play a respectable game against a ranked UCLA team this week, it may be the start of another great season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to recap, injuries and lack of depth cripple Utah and they lose a winnable game.  Yet another stud running back and an awesome defense drive BYU to an impressive win.  If you switched jerseys on the teams you might wonder if it’s 1994 all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is much more to enjoy (we hope) in the podcast, so please listen!

Temperatures vary based on geographic region, but 100+ degree days are common in just about any part of the state.  In the southern half of Utah, particularly the southwestern section, it isn’t unusual to see 110+ degree days, sometimes for weeks in a row.  It’s usually a dry heat (for example, right now the temperature in Salt Lake City is 91 degrees with 28% humidity), which is less oppressive than heavy, moist conditions, but leaves one feeling a bit dried out by the end of summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mention this because autumn has always been my favorite time of the year for a variety of reasons, and I am very excited to see the end of August/start of September this year.  The growing crispness in the air is nice, and a welcome respite from the heat.  But the cool nights and changing leaves also means football season is upon us – and that is a very good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week all three of Utah’s NCAA Division-1 schools play their opening games.  The University of Utah travels to Oregon State, Brigham Young University hosts Arizona, and Utah State University welcomes UNLV.  The Utah SportsCast aspires to support and report on all local athletics, although we tend to feature those we follow as fans, namely Utah and BYU.  We extend our apologies to Utah State for not giving equal time, but we are trying to cultivate a rooting interest.  So, hopefully we will have more on the Aggies in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Incidentally, it would help if USU could provide a better program.  I’m not trying to be overly critical, and we’re not waiting for the bandwagon to come around or anything, but more than one win would be nice.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Zach and I have been looking forward to the big preview show all summer, and you can find all the good stuff on the podcast.  Here are a few of my thoughts, in addition:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);font-size:180%;" &gt;Utah&lt;/span&gt;:  This year should be a small improvement over last, although I wouldn’t expect anything dramatic.  Another year under the belt is bound to help Head Coach Kyle Wittingham and his team.  I don’t think they will contend for the conference title this year, but they should still make a late-December bowl game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Should be strengths:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Wide Receivers:&lt;/span&gt; Brent Casteel, Utah’s most explosive offensive player, should benefit from playing with the very mobile Brian Johnson.  If the quarterback is a running threat it could keep safeties and linebackers back a step, which would give Casteel more space in which to operate.  Derrek Richards (last season’s leading receiver), Marquis Wilson, and Brian Hernandez will be other key targets in Utah’s deep, talented receiving corps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Offensive Line:&lt;/span&gt; This was predicted to be a weakness last season because of the youth at nearly every position.  They played much better than expected, and so, in theory, should only have improved.  They graduated an All-Conference tackle, but are returning the majority of last year’s line.  Zane Beadles at left tackle should be one of the standouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Linebackers:&lt;/span&gt; Utah will start three seniors this year, including Joe Jiannoni, who was one of the backbones of last year’s defense.  Kyle Brady and Malakai Mokofisi are the other two starters; Stevenson Sylvester – a freshman standout last year – should also see plenty of action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Special Teams:&lt;/span&gt;  Louie Sakoda will be returning as both punter and placekicker.  Last year’s Mountain West Conference Special Teams Co-Player of the Year was a critical component in several key wins last year, including the win over TCU.  Utah doesn’t have specialists as punt returners and kick returners, but they should be better than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Could be weaknesses:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Running Backs:&lt;/span&gt;  Darryl Poston is coming back for his 10th season (or something like that), although he was not very effective last year.  Darrell Mack will redshirt this year, which should mean more carries for junior college transfer Matt Asiata.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Tight Ends:  &lt;/span&gt;Matt Sims and Colt Sampson traded duties last year, and they both return for another year.  Both are valuable as blockers, but neither is a great target at receiver.  A different, mobile quarterback could boost the value of the position, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Defensive Line:&lt;/span&gt;  Martail Burnett is returning, and Gabe Long is expected to be around for the full season.  But graduating two all-conference linemen would hurt any team, and the rest of the D-line seems to be relatively young and inexperienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Secondary:&lt;/span&gt;  It doesn’t matter how good the replacements are, losing a consensus All-American will hurt the team.  Steve Tate is the only senior in the secondary, although all of the projected starters have at least one year of previous playing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The big question mark:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Quarterback:&lt;/span&gt;  It’s been around 22 months since Brian Johnson was carted off the playing field with a wrecked knee.  His physical condition is reported to be excellent, but he still hasn’t taken a snap in regular competition in over two years.  He is an intelligent, poised player, with a strong arm and good running ability.  If he has a great year, Utah could do very well.  If he is inconsistent and shaky, it will be a long season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);font-size:180%;" &gt;BYU&lt;/span&gt;:  It’s very difficult to imagine the Cougars will have as magical a season this year as they did last (unless you are a supporter, of course, and then there is no difficulty whatsoever).  Bronco Mendenhall’s program is running along smoothly enough, but too many key players graduating is likely to spell fewer wins in 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Should be strengths:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Running Backs:&lt;/span&gt;  BYU graduated one of their all-time greatest backs last year.  Applying the same logic as used above, it would make sense that this could be one of the shaky points of the offense.  However, they are returning Manase Tonga and Fui Vakapuna, both of which are strong, exciting runners who had great seasons in 2006.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Wide Receivers:&lt;/span&gt;  This has been a strong suit for the Cougars for several years, and should continue to be this year.  Matt Allen and Bryce Mahuika will be primary targets, as well as Austin Collie, the former Mountain West Conference Freshman of the Year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Linebackers:&lt;/span&gt;  Bryan Kehl and David Nixon are returning to anchor a squad that graduated their all-conference leader last season.  In spite of that, this is one of the deepest and most talented facets of the team, and will be a noteworthy strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Secondary:&lt;/span&gt;  Returning quality players like Dustin Gabriel, Quinn Gooch, and Ben Criddle will help BYU’s defense win a few games for the team.  This was the embarrassing weakness of the team as recently as pre-season last year, but they have improved dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Could be weaknesses:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Quarterback:  &lt;/span&gt;Max Hall has a lot to live up to, and is going to struggle at times this year.  It’s that simple.  He is reported to have a strong, accurate arm and great decision-making ability, but he has never taken a snap in an actual collegiate-level game.  He will probably have flashes of greatness, but the coaching staff will also have to figure out how to lessen his negative impact at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Tight Ends:  &lt;/span&gt;BYU’s tight end was almost as critical as the quarterback last year.  Also like the quarterbacks, both the starter and the backup graduated in this position.  This has been a traditional strength for the Cougars, but the youth and lack of previous playing time will be difficult to overcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Offensive Line:  &lt;/span&gt;The team has been through some struggles with their O-line in recent years, although 2006 signaled a return to good form.  They will struggle to replace a departed all-conference tackle, and will suffer from protecting a less-savvy quarterback.  Guards Ray Feinga and Travis Bright are the only projected starters with more than one year of experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Defensive Line:&lt;/span&gt;  If BYU has defensive struggles it will be at the line, where they are likely to start three sophomores.  The 3-4 defense minimizes the role of the line somewhat, but they still need to plug the middle on runs and provide some pressure on quarterbacks in the pocket.  Last year they relied on linebackers to do much of that, so an improved D-line would really help the overall plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The big question mark:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Special Teams:&lt;/span&gt;  Special teams had a very significant negative impact last year.  Missed field goals in two early games were the difference between their excellent 10-2 year and what could have been: A perfect 12-0 season and Cougar Immortality (as well as a likely BCS Bowl bid).  They don’t seem to have improved on any level, but their new, freshman kicker is named Mitch Payne, which should sound familiar to fans.  If he is anything like the previous Payne, it could be a step in the right direction.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33196860-7201003634839819488?l=utahsportscast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/ctwk/~4/upwZKqIYHbo" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://utahsportscast.blogspot.com/2007/08/episode-38-long-wait-is-over.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Episode 37 – Summer Break is nearing an end…</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/ctwk/~3/Q4rP3P1MkY4/episode-37-summer-break-is-nearing-end.html</link><author>comments@utahsportscast.com (Bruce and Bruce)</author><pubDate>Sat, 04 Aug 2007 15:17:25 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33196860.post-939551041014544202</guid><description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;a target="blank" href="http://www.utahsportscast.com/shows/show_37.mp3"&gt;Listen Here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The first few weeks of August are interesting times in the life of nearly all American sports fans.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Regardless of which sport (or sports) you follow, there is likely something to capture your attention.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Among other things, the playoff races are beginning in earnest in Major League Baseball, the PGA Championship is contended, and most European soccer leagues begin their seasons.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Football fans start to see preseason games and news reports, and basketball fans can watch the off season trades and summer hoops leagues.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;This has also been an interesting summer outside of the competition, on both the national and international stages.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The subject of cheating in sports has been a major topic in the past weeks, between Barry Bonds chasing a hallowed record, the free-fall of the Tour de France, and the game-fixing of at least one NBA official.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;PGA legend Gary Player even said he believed some tour players were taking steroids.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;My reaction was probably similar to others’: I first laughed at the idea that &lt;i style=""&gt;pro golfers&lt;/i&gt; would take steroids, and then stopped and realized it was not as outrageous as I would like it to be.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I am afraid this will be a tip-of-the-iceberg situation.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The Tour de France was an embarrassment to the world of competitive road racing, but the governing body is doing the right thing by being aggressive against cheating.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I wonder how the NFL would fare if they adopted a Tour-style program with regards to blood testing.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If all the players on the various winning teams were tested each week, how many suspensions would the Commissioner have to hand out each round?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Would the National Football League – the most financially successful sports league in the world – survive the purging that would inevitably follow?&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Would Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association (the number two and three most financially successful leagues in the world) endure any better?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;It could be that we, as fans, are not concerned that athletes are accelerating their muscle development and growth with illegal and dangerous drugs.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I wonder how many people watch a balloon-headed home run hitter or a lightning-fast defensive back and really care whether they come by that skill naturally.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I know most of us wish steroids and blood doping was not a part of sports, but we have a hard time summoning outrage about it (and I am as guilty of this as anyone).&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Does our dislike for Barry Bonds breaking Hank Aaron’s record have more to do with his admitted doping or his dislikable personality?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I am not sure if the steroid conversation will dim as football season approaches, but it wouldn’t surprise me.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;There is enough of an issue now that it won’t disappear, but soon there will be more results to discuss.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There is much, much more in the podcast, including &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Real&lt;/st1:placename&gt;

 &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We are now almost two weeks into July, and the sports year (as I choose to observe it) is just about over.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Almost all of the sports I like to follow are in their off-season right now, &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; sports in particular.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Fortunately, we will soon be celebrating the New Sports Year with the beginning of football season, which is only about six weeks away.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Until then, I have at least one &lt;st1:state st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;Utah&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:state&gt; sports item that will have to tide me over.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;At the top of the very short list is &lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Real&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placename st="on"&gt;Salt&lt;/st1:placename&gt; &lt;st1:placetype st="on"&gt;Lake&lt;/st1:placetype&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;, who would be much more exciting if they would just win a few games.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I have been a casual soccer fan for about 15 years and a legitimate fan for the past three years.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This means I am still getting used to &lt;i style=""&gt;The Beautiful Game&lt;/i&gt; being a part of my regular sports rotation, but I’m excited about it.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;However, in the last year or so I have made what feels like a Soccer Breakthrough, and my interest level is now teetering on the brink of “big fan.”&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;If this is the case, and I continue to progress along those lines, then I could graduate to “soccer hooligan” in 5-7 more years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;The genesis of this personal escalation came with the expansion of Major League Soccer into my home town.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I probably would have been happy to labor along as a casual follower for many more years – watching the World Cup and the Olympics, checking on a game if I happen to channel surf past it – but then a tier one team became headquartered a few miles from my house.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Unfortunately, RSL has not given me much of a reason to be a fan this year.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They have taken several large steps backward from last year, when they just missed qualifying for the playoffs.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The addition of Freddy Adu was supposed to improve their midfield play and make the team better.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The results have been much worse, and they have been losing or jettisoning players as they go.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;In fact, they are currently on par to post the worst season in MLS history.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;There are plenty of theories as to why this is happening, and we have considered a few of those in our podcast/blog.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But the point I am trying to make here is that in this year, my Soccer Breakthrough year, RSL could have sewn up a lifetime of good will and impassioned fandom from me.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;It wouldn’t have even taken a championship or anything, but a few exciting wins would have done the trick. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;While I know the issue of my interest level in the team is strictly a personal deal, I believe it’s symptomatic of a greater problem facing RSL.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I’m sure they want to win games just as much as fans want them to, but they are losing potential fans by not producing victories.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Some games have been very close, and they have lost or tied in spite of playing very well.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;But that may not translate to the sports fan who is trying to drum up some interest in soccer. &lt;span style=""&gt; &lt;/span&gt;That casual observer will just see the failures, and probably not come back to see more.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;I guess it’s not too late for RSL to turn things around this year, but I don’t see any reason why they will win more than one or two more games before the season ends.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;A team that has managed one win in 12 games probably isn’t about to roll of seven wins in a row.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They are not yet “mathematically eliminated” from the playoffs, but almost certainly “realistically eliminated.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Meanwhile, my summer of soccer is being fed by the CONCACAF Gold Cup, Copa &lt;st1:country-region st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place st="on"&gt;America&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; (where the US National Team embarrassed itself) the U-20 World Cup (where Freddy Adu is playing extremely well), and my new favorite team, &lt;a target="blank" href="http://www.hammarbyfotboll.se/se/aktuellt/nyheter/"&gt;Hammarby IF&lt;/a&gt; of the Swedish &lt;a target="blank" href="http://www.svenskfotboll.se/t1all.aspx?p=152184"&gt;Allsvenskan&lt;/a&gt;. (A team I have paid attention to for a few years, but rose up this summer to take what could have been RSL’s place as “My Team.”)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;[By the way, I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to everyone I know who has had to endure my blathering and gushing about Hammarby these past few months.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I can’t seem to help doing it, and even the UTAH SportsCast has been inundated now.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;My sincerest apologies.] &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;That’s about it for this blog entry, although there is much more good stuff in the podcast.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We discuss a lot more about the Utah Jazz, who are chasing free agents right now, along with some draft pick consideration.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Please tune in and check it out!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Thanks to our sponsor, Zagg Inc., the makers of the invisibleSHIELD.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Please visit them at invisibleshield.com and protect your new iPhone today!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;We would love to hear from you at: &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:comments@utahsportscast.com"&gt;comments@utahsportscast.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;In fact, Zach promised to read aloud, on the podcast, every listener e-mail that we get between now and our next show.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I am still uncertain why that is incentive to write, although listener comments are bound to be more enlightening than us, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/33196860-1887189168663966508?l=utahsportscast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/ctwk/~4/pPVejduuAGg" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://utahsportscast.blogspot.com/2007/07/episode-36-not-much-is-going-on-to-be.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Episode 35 – A win; for Real</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/blogspot/ctwk/~3/cnV21LYvWEo/episode-35-win-for-real.html</link><author>comments@utahsportscast.com (Bruce and Bruce)</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2007 15:27:38 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-33196860.post-4511548048445324435</guid><description>&lt;a target="blank" href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/bruceandbruce/utsc_show_035.mp3"&gt;Listen Here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We issued the challenge, and Real Salt Lake delivered.  We promised to mention RSL on our podcast if they won a game, and they made it happen.  It took them over 90 days of the regular season to get it; but win they did, so we suspended our summer furlough to make good on our part of the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has not been a good year for RSL, as we mentioned in earlier podcasts and Zach described in his last post.  They had actually won two games this year prior to last week’s victory over DC United, but neither counted for their league record.  So to finally get that monkey off their backs is bound to be a good thing.  At 1-5-6 they are still in the basement of the league, but who knows?  Perhaps this is a turning point.  I wouldn’t bet my house on it, but I will try to remain optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s easy to blame the horrifying season on the departure of certain key players, although that probably doesn’t tell the whole story.  It didn’t help that keeper Scott Garlick decided to retire shortly before the first game, for example, but the lack of offense has been their primary problem.  With that in mind, the decision to give Jason Kreis a permanent seat on the bench was a bit puzzling.  This was followed by trading last year’s leading goal scorer, Jeff Cunningham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most recent deal sent veteran Chris Klein to Los Angeles, which doesn’t leave very many big-name, big-reputation guys on the team.  Combine that with Eddie Pope’s announced retirement and Freddy Adu (who came to RSL primarily to play for fired coach John Ellinger) pining for the European leagues, and the team seems headed for a more of the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the recent win may have given fans a glimmer of hope for the future.  Robbie Findley, who was acquired in the Klein deal, scored two goals in his debut with the team.  Forward Alecko Eskandarian swapped places with Cunningham, and he has shown flashes of his lauded ability while coming back from a concussion.  Nick Rimando seems to be getting comfortable in the net lately.  So, the foundation of a winning team might be there.  They are last in the conference (and the entire league), but only one team in the conference has &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;fewer&lt;/span&gt; losses than RSL.  It is not outrageous to think they could climb right back in the race if they can put a winning streak together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greater question is: will they?  Real Salt Lake has only scored 11 goals in 12 games this season, which is pretty stingy even for the Western Conference where leader FC Dallas has 19 goals in 15 games.  It could be worse, though.  Three different teams in the Eastern Conference have scored 20+ goals in their first dozen games (New England 24, New York 24, Kansas City 23).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice timing if RSL made the playoffs this year.  The dispute over the stadium has polarized a lot of potential fans, and a successful campaign might soften a few hearts.  Even more important is the long-term success of soccer in this market.  There is a great deal of potential between strong youth programs and immigration from soccer-loving parts of the world.  Even the interest generated through returning LDS missionaries is significant.  There is an opportunity to create a strong center of soccer here, and RSL is a major part of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does that mean soccer in the greater Salt Lake City market will fail if RSL only wins 4 games this year?  Well, probably not… but I think we stand a good chance of finding out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is much more in the podcast, including congratulations to the Utah Blaze for making the playoffs.  We discuss the upcoming draft and mention a few names that may be on the back of a Jazz uniform next year.

We issued the challenge, and Real Salt Lake delivered. We promised to mention RSL on our podcast if they won a game, and they made it happen. It took them over 90 days of the regular season to get it; but win they did, so we suspended our summer furlough to make good on our part of the bargain. This has not been a good year for RSL, as we mentioned in earlier podcasts and Zach described in his last post. They had actually won two games this year prior to last week’s victory over DC United, but neither counted for their league record. So to finally get that monkey off their backs is bound to be a good thing. At 1-5-6 they are still in the basement of the league, but who knows? Perhaps this is a turning point. I wouldn’t bet my house on it, but I will try to remain optimistic. It’s easy to blame the horrifying season on the departure of certain key players, although that probably doesn’t tell the whole story. It didn’t help that keeper Scott Garlick decided to retire shortly before the first game, for example, but the lack of offense has been their primary problem. With that in mind, the decision to give Jason Kreis a permanent seat on the bench was a bit puzzling. This was followed by trading last year’s leading goal scorer, Jeff Cunningham. The most recent deal sent veteran Chris Klein to Los Angeles, which doesn’t leave very many big-name, big-reputation guys on the team. Combine that with Eddie Pope’s announced retirement and Freddy Adu (who came to RSL primarily to play for fired coach John Ellinger) pining for the European leagues, and the team seems headed for a more of the same. But, the recent win may have given fans a glimmer of hope for the future. Robbie Findley, who was acquired in the Klein deal, scored two goals in his debut with the team. Forward Alecko Eskandarian swapped places with Cunningham, and he has shown flashes of his lauded ability while coming back from a concussion. Nick Rimando seems to be getting comfortable in the net lately. So, the foundation of a winning team might be there.
