&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;Before I go out to work each time....I give thanks....and hand it all over to Love.  Love pulls my records....and reads the night.  I also Like to do a little musical meditation....Meaning that I will stop with dance music...and listen to something, usually classical.  A short piece like a Rag Slow Drag. (*the Labeque Sisters) or one of my favorite Ravel or Lizst piano pieces....(*Pavane for a Dead Princess &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bocyCWh1rBw"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bocyCWh1rBw&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PQ-H1PjrWQ&amp;amp;feature=relmfu"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PQ-H1PjrWQ&amp;amp;feature=relmfu&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIPrdg2_xNg&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIPrdg2_xNg&amp;amp;feature=related&lt;/a&gt; or something Like them.....Something to clear my head and slow down my breathing....to suspend time briefly away from what is about to happen in the club.  It gives me “Center”. Then....I try...to just pick out a first song....and let the night develop from there.  Granted most times....I walk in and the computer program is playing some dreadful Grunge or 1990’s Techno....which I try to blend out with a breakdown.  Then it’s everybody for themselves.  You get what you get depending on how I read my crowds.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This night....the “crowd”...even the Early crowd....(*which was a Herbicidal Virgin crowd.  Which I overheard talking as I was setting up...”oh that’s Herbie James....he’s Suppose to be good.”)...(*sly)  So...I found my break to break In...and set out to “Train” them....again.
&lt;br /&gt;Herbicidal Addicts. Club seems to be getting a new cross-over metro crowd since like I’ve said before....We Do serve up one of the hottest Big little parties that happen on the drive each week.  You’ll see when you get there.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Listening back though to the set....I see that the night was a bit about big synths...but you know they’ve been asking to get beat lately. (*and the Room has been sounding Much more....Thick....since we put the Rane in.) So, I Let ‘em ‘ave IT.  By the first few songs...which by the way I apologize for, as I cut off about the first 20 mins....but, Hey....More reason you have to BE there soon.  For a few Herbicidal Anthems....a few new hotties....I hook them...sexy Groove them....play ‘em things you May not hear anywhere else....they say. On Friday’s,  I usually have critical mass by midnight and they stay till lights up late, which here, happens around about fifteen minutes from the end of part Four.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So, get ‘em, and put ‘em on the player....the disclavier whatever.....light a candle....dress for a sexxxy night out....(*or an underwear party.)...and crank up the Big knob to high....hoist a tall one....and get there when you can for the real thing.  (deep breath before the plunge.)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Till then....Keep your heads to the sky.  Call your mom.  Support your Local DJ’s.  Stop and Breathe.  Be nice. Yabba Dabba Do.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see you all on a floor near you soon.
&lt;br /&gt;Love all around
&lt;br /&gt;Herbie

Love pulls my records....and reads the night. I also Like to do a little musical meditation....Meaning that I will stop with dance music...and listen to something, usually classical. A short piece like a Rag Slow Drag. (*the Labeque Sisters) or one of my favorite Ravel or Lizst piano pieces....(*Pavane for a Dead Princess http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bocyCWh1rBw or http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PQ-H1PjrWQ&amp;amp;feature=relmfu or http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIPrdg2_xNg&amp;amp;feature=related or something Like them.....Something to clear my head and slow down my breathing....to suspend time briefly away from what is about to happen in the club. It gives me “Center”. Then....I try...to just pick out a first song....and let the night develop from there. Granted most times....I walk in and the computer program is playing some dreadful Grunge or 1990’s Techno....which I try to blend out with a breakdown. Then it’s everybody for themselves. You get what you get depending on how I read my crowds. This night....the “crowd”...even the Early crowd....(*which was a Herbicidal Virgin crowd. Which I overheard talking as I was setting up...”oh that’s Herbie James....he’s Suppose to be good.”)...(*sly) So...I found my break to break In...and set out to “Train” them....again. Herbicidal Addicts. Club seems to be getting a new cross-over metro crowd since like I’ve said before....We Do serve up one of the hottest Big little parties that happen on the drive each week. You’ll see when you get there. Listening back though to the set....I see that the night was a bit about big synths...but you know they’ve been asking to get beat lately. (*and the Room has been sounding Much more....Thick....since we put the Rane in.) So, I Let ‘em ‘ave IT. By the first few songs...which by the way I apologize for, as I cut off about the first 20 mins....but, Hey....More reason you have to BE there soon. For a few Herbicidal Anthems....a few new hotties....I hook them...sexy Groove them....play ‘em things you May not hear anywhere else....they say. On Friday’s, I usually have critical mass by midnight and they stay till lights up late, which here, happens around about fifteen minutes from the end of part Four. So, get ‘em, and put ‘em on the player....the disclavier whatever.....light a candle....dress for a sexxxy night out....(*or an underwear party.)...and crank up the Big knob to high....hoist a tall one....and get there when you can for the real thing. (deep breath before the plunge.) Till then....Keep your heads to the sky. Call your mom. Support your Local DJ’s. Stop and Breathe. Be nice. Yabba Dabba Do. Hope to see you all on a floor near you soon. Love all around Herbie http://www.herbiejames.com http://www.gayinternetradiolive.com</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>DJ house progressive tribal dance music vocal</itunes:keywords></item><item><title>More, Now, Harder, Faster, Slower, Longer, Tighter!! part 2</title><link>http://djherbiejames.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-now-harder-faster-slower-longer_30.html</link><category>nightclubs</category><category>podcasts</category><category>Events</category><category>Radio</category><category>House</category><category>clubs</category><category>progressive</category><category>gay</category><category>DJ</category><category>South</category><category>dance</category><category>music</category><category>playdates</category><category>podcast</category><category>tribal</category><category>Internet</category><category>Florida</category><author>herbie@herbiejames.com (Herbie James)</author><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2011 06:00:10 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-15502526.post-2815177199451242235</guid><description>&lt;a href="http://www.herbiejames.com/podcast_files/mandancebeatdown3.mp3"&gt;play/download mandancebeatdown3.mp3&lt;br /&gt;Windows - Right Click and Save to download&lt;br /&gt;MAC - Command Click and Save to download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15502526-2815177199451242235?l=djherbiejames.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total><enclosure url="http://www.herbiejames.com/podcast_files/mandancebeatdown3.mp3" length="106157548" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.herbiejames.com/podcast_files/mandancebeatdown3.mp3" fileSize="106157548" type="audio/mpeg" /><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:subtitle>play/download mandancebeatdown3.mp3 Windows - Right Click and Save to download MAC - Command Click and Save to download</itunes:subtitle><itunes:author>Herbie James</itunes:author><itunes:summary>play/download mandancebeatdown3.mp3 Windows - Right Click and Save to download MAC - Command Click and Save to download</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>DJ house progressive tribal dance music vocal</itunes:keywords></item><item><title>More, Now, Harder, Faster, Slower, Longer, Tighter!! part 1</title><link>http://djherbiejames.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-now-harder-faster-slower-longer.html</link><category>nightclubs</category><category>podcasts</category><category>Events</category><category>Radio</category><category>House</category><category>clubs</category><category>progressive</category><category>gay</category><category>DJ</category><category>South</category><category>dance</category><category>music</category><category>playdates</category><category>podcast</category><category>tribal</category><category>Internet</category><category>Florida</category><author>herbie@herbiejames.com (Herbie James)</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 May 2011 10:50:52 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-15502526.post-7800833842331307446</guid><description>&lt;a href="http://www.herbiejames.com/podcast_files/drummer2.mp3"&gt;play/download drummer2.mp3&lt;br /&gt;Windows - right click and save to download&lt;br /&gt;MAC - command click and save to download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;Hello my little beat bunnies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my Fave One Hit Wonders was the &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/SpFu0CWDUo0"&gt;delicious porn star actress / disco debutant....Andrea True Connection “More, More, More”. &lt;/a&gt; It was a bit sleazy, but it captures the essence of what seems to be the mantra of many of our lives in the club scene.  More (fill in the blank) Please.&lt;br /&gt;Well I Said it was one of MY faves.  And I have met a few of you that even if you don’t know the song....you know the words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/SpFu0CWDUo0"&gt;“More, More, More....How do you like IT, how do you Like it.”&lt;/a&gt; (*I’m jus’ sayin’)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music over the years changes in style, tempo and beats.

I also realize that listening on headphones in the gym or in the car is a Far cry from what it actually sounds like in the club....when you have a room Full of ambient crowd noise and conversations going on around you.

Again, More, Now, Harder, Faster, Slower, Longer, Tighter, MORE.  (*sly).  Whew.....These two nights....one was from the ‘Drummer” party I played a few weeks ago.  The second is from the last&lt;a href="http://www.herbiejames.com/NewFiles/ManDance-November-2009.jpg"&gt; “Mandance” &lt;/a&gt;that happens every 3rd Friday of each month.  They are both peak night, crazy screaming at me crowds of “Havin’ It” peoples....Just the way I Likes ‘em.  So, hoist one, Crank up the Big knob to High....and shake it like no one is watching.  There’s some fantastic new songs out, I hope you find one or two here to sweat you through the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your heads to the sky. Eat your veggies.  Call your moms.

Already....and it’s just April.  I love the heat of it all. It brings down loads of tourists....and We get to show ‘em how We DO IT in the Big city....so to speak.  Course, I’m spoiled...I get some of the best of them.....the ones who can “Hang” with the best.  The ways in that We serve them.  The Best Sexy crowds....the Best cocktails (*not metered)...and of course...the Best Musics.  Blend all that together...and you’ve got a Vibe that’s as thick as the midnight blue.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;These two podcasts, delivered here....represent Such a Night. &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/3wG55hfh2w0"&gt;(*play Dr. John’s “Such A Night” here.)&lt;/a&gt; This crowd came together out of such a midnight blue ….Not your “Usual” suspects I’d say. Very vocal too....Lots of hands in the air screaming during breakdowns and that.  Just the way I like ‘em.  So, since most of you couldn’t be there....(*and you Wish you were.)  Here’s a coupla sets to wet your whistle.  Just listen how I was Talking to them....subliminally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;Part Two...starts in at around 11:30ish....and Part Four starts at around 2:15ish.....to the end of the night. To a packed house!!  Much like we DO IT &lt;a href="http://ramrodbar.com/"&gt;(*Live) Every Friday&lt;/a&gt; night.  Yes, the music changes..and part Four was on a little more “Alternative” tip than usual...but they were Taking it like pros...and since I had it...They got it!!  And, the Epic Funk kept chugging them right along....holding it’s power on them till the lights come up.  Ok, the ending of this night may seem a little abrupt, knowing that I usually like to “Come Down” a bit slower....but they just kept yelling for more, and just didn’t want to leave.

Already....and it’s just April. I love the heat of it all. It brings down loads of tourists....and We get to show ‘em how We DO IT in the Big city....so to speak. Course, I’m spoiled...I get some of the best of them.....the ones who can “Hang” with the best. The ways in that We serve them. The Best Sexy crowds....the Best cocktails (*not metered)...and of course...the Best Musics. Blend all that together...and you’ve got a Vibe that’s as thick as the midnight blue. These two podcasts, delivered here....represent Such a Night. (*play Dr. John’s “Such A Night” here.) This crowd came together out of such a midnight blue ….Not your “Usual” suspects I’d say. Very vocal too....Lots of hands in the air screaming during breakdowns and that. Just the way I like ‘em. So, since most of you couldn’t be there....(*and you Wish you were.) Here’s a coupla sets to wet your whistle. Just listen how I was Talking to them....subliminally. Part Two...starts in at around 11:30ish....and Part Four starts at around 2:15ish.....to the end of the night. To a packed house!! Much like we DO IT (*Live) Every Friday night. Yes, the music changes..and part Four was on a little more “Alternative” tip than usual...but they were Taking it like pros...and since I had it...They got it!! And, the Epic Funk kept chugging them right along....holding it’s power on them till the lights come up. Ok, the ending of this night may seem a little abrupt, knowing that I usually like to “Come Down” a bit slower....but they just kept yelling for more, and just didn’t want to leave. There was Def something magical in the air. Keep in mind...that you will need to turn up the volume....and maybe pour a Stiff one to try to catch the Love. As this was some great peak night hotness. You know how I live to Mix It UP. I hope you Get Me. Just a reminder. This coming Friday night....being the 3rd Friday night of the month....Which BTW we Do Every 3rd Friday.....IS Mandance!! When they move walls and turn the bar into a dance club. For the bunnies among you. So, Please....If you are nearby....and out doin’ tha DO....(*sly). Stop in the Ramrod for a Herbicidal Shakedown.

I ended up having to spin Christmas Eve....AND New Years Eve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;I’m not complaining...as they were Both some of the best nights Ever in the &lt;a href="http://www.ramrodbar.com"&gt;club&lt;/a&gt;.  Crowds that were Ready, and Willing, to GO there.  They had Me going for sure.  Raising their glasses and their voices.  Must‘ve been the music.  And, they Seemed to have “Started” earlier this year....not waiting to come late....but by 11pm....there was crowd mass.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Now....on That note....you Know, how I love to ‘Come UP”.  Well....I enjoyed the end of the year So much....and 2011 already beginning with a “Bang”....I thought that I’d start this years podcasts....with a little “Taste” of how we “Began.’  Here’s TWO....”Come Up” sets actually....from Two different, Consecutive nights.  So you can see how two nights....back to back....turn out just a bit different...according to how the crowd fills the room.  The 2nd night filling faster....it got harder quicker.....boing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Don’t get me wrong....I love Love LOVE Peak night....when it’s shoulder to well....shoulder....and they are hollerin’ and carrying on....like they Do.  But, early night....when there are only a few “Fans” in the room....gives me a chance to get My groove On....before I have to Push them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;So, here’s a taste....of two Different nights....and how they came UP.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Stay tuned....and keep your panties on....cause next time....I’m thinking I’ll give you Two “Peak” night sets....different nights as well.....to contrast how They work the same....but different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Same bag of music as always....it just keeps coming and coming out …..different....but at the same time.....Herbicidal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Hope these give you a look into the DJ mind of Herbie James....as this Def gives you a look see into my “Bin of Fierceness.”...as it stands to Date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;So, grab the cocktail that you missed since you obviously can’t always BE there week to week.....Turn up the Volume on your home surround sound.....powder your um....”Floor”....and shake a tail feather with me.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Share the house love....and I hope that I get to hang with All of you sometime soon in 2011.

A bit too mundane for my taste as I like to take things a bit more over the edge...(*sly)...and I’m Still trying to get them to put a Bear “Furry” on the street with one of those big Arrow signs pointing to the bar for the night....but noooo.  I mean really...how fun would That be.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Alas...it Still happens...every third Friday of the month....this fanTastic big Little party they call Mandance.  It happens at the Ramrod in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  And it Does go Off too.  No, it can’t compare to the big clubs...as it’s a small room....with a big heart...and a Lot ,a LOT, of Soul.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;You can’t buy this vibe....it creates itself.  The people have to bring it with them to share.  You have to leave the house with it.  Bring enough to spill some they say.  And they do....sometimes all over the place...but that’s the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ramrodbar.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Ram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt; for ya.  They serve it UP.  Just the way I like it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Here, I’m giving up just a taste of this Past month’s Mandance....during what was just about peak night.  This is some of my fave Big Progressive Vocal tracks of the moment.  Loving this sound right now.  Hope you will too.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;So....until I get to “Feel” you in the room the next time....and you Really Do Need to come “Feel” this for yourself....because it Never sounds the same from an mp3 Copy....as it does when you are There....BEing there....with a few cocktails and all that sexiness rubbing up against you....but go ahead....Turn it UP....Turn up the Bass....Put on your Sunday going to church shoes and bust a rug....(*snicker).....Here is Just a taste of what they got last time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Hope you are all having a Great holiday season....and I Hope that you take all that thankfulness and love with  you over the New Year’s Eve...and throughout the new year.  Keep your head to the sky...and share some house love with family and friends alike.  Teach one, and send one to teach.  And all those other down home sayings that your mom taught you when you were seeing this world through your eyes as a child.  Don’t live in fear just because someone tells you that you might get hurt.

A bit too mundane for my taste as I like to take things a bit more over the edge...(*sly)...and I’m Still trying to get them to put a Bear “Furry” on the street with one of those big Arrow signs pointing to the bar for the night....but noooo. I mean really...how fun would That be. Alas...it Still happens...every third Friday of the month....this fanTastic big Little party they call Mandance. It happens at the Ramrod in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. And it Does go Off too. No, it can’t compare to the big clubs...as it’s a small room....with a big heart...and a Lot ,a LOT, of Soul.You can’t buy this vibe....it creates itself. The people have to bring it with them to share. You have to leave the house with it. Bring enough to spill some they say. And they do....sometimes all over the place...but that’s the Ram for ya. They serve it UP. Just the way I like it. Here, I’m giving up just a taste of this Past month’s Mandance....during what was just about peak night. This is some of my fave Big Progressive Vocal tracks of the moment. Loving this sound right now. Hope you will too. So....until I get to “Feel” you in the room the next time....and you Really Do Need to come “Feel” this for yourself....because it Never sounds the same from an mp3 Copy....as it does when you are There....BEing there....with a few cocktails and all that sexiness rubbing up against you....but go ahead....Turn it UP....Turn up the Bass....Put on your Sunday going to church shoes and bust a rug....(*snicker).....Here is Just a taste of what they got last time. Hope you are all having a Great holiday season....and I Hope that you take all that thankfulness and love with you over the New Year’s Eve...and throughout the new year. Keep your head to the sky...and share some house love with family and friends alike. Teach one, and send one to teach. And all those other down home sayings that your mom taught you when you were seeing this world through your eyes as a child. Don’t live in fear just because someone tells you that you might get hurt. Be part of the solution and not the problem....I could go on...(w). When you R in my room....always feel free to stop by and say hi.

Oh yeah!  I AM a delicious, and local, South Florida DJ du jour....and I hold Fabulous court every week.  I stand before you, accused, of dancing to my own drummer. I beat out beats like no other. My tune choices sometimes cross lines not crossed before.  Sometimes it’s music to open a room, but Sometimes, it’s music to change lives.  I open eyes and I open minds.  Sounds big.  But, I hear things.  I know things.  I feel things....differently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;I Believe.  I have Faith.  I preach and I teach.  I have something to say.  What you ask.  In What you ask.  Of what.  Well, I’d say all you have to do is listen to my tune choices....as I was so aptly pointed out to this during this past week.  Because I am always talking to you.....in song.  Every song may not even have a lyric....that’s not the point.  Let the Spirit of the lyric carry you until the next one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;I AM first a dancer.  Yes, it’s been some years, and the steps have changed.  But the 4/4 remains the same, well sorta.  I also have always liked to push the limits of what might be “Expected.”  I love “Songs with Lyrics.”  They tell a story of love and of being loved.  The beats that connect them however can range from your typical drum sounds of bass, snare, hi-hats etal....to 4/4 beats created of sounds Made by Sounds.  Techno.  I Love Techno.  I Love Technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;To me....Techno creates waves of beats.  I begin dancing in Phrases instead of just beats.  Phrases of waves of beats.  They wash over me in sexxxtions of two,  four, and even eight beat sections.  I like to pick out noises to dance to....noises become the ONE....the downbeat.  They become the beginning of where I hang on to the beat.  My step, and feel, is still on the 1,2,3,4....but I hang, bend, sway and lean on the phrase.  I wait for it.  I anticipate the One.  And that’s when the hands meet the air.  But all you dancers out there know this without having to think it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;All That said....Now to the music for this podcast.  Wow.  I have over the years been made in-Famous by getting to, and being able to play some pretty outrageous parties and residencies.  Very lucky I might add.  Recently, I have this Fab little Big gig here in Fort Lauderdale at a very sexy little Big back room club called Slammers.  I’m playing there Because of what I like to play.  The owners there tell me they want less vocals...infact....No Divas at all.  Don’t get me wrong...I still give them vocals....now and again...but mostly the Sexy ones. (sly)  So for this Herbicidal installment, it is with My Pleasure....that I give to You...just a taste.....of the sexual flavor, that I love to bring to that room.  It’s Hotness squared into a wicked maze of rooms and stairs and closets, with great flow, great sound, great sensual lighting ....great staff....and ME.  Serving it Up....on a techno and progressive flava.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;OK....go grab hold of your favorite cocktail...Hoist it high and in my general direction....Turn UP the volume and crank this set into your senses....and take the ride on My wild side.  I should hope that All your big room parties should be This sexy.  (ps...I Need A Dancefloor!!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Keep your heads to the sky....Don’t live in fear....and Love like it’s your first time to Be loved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Love all around&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Herbie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.herbiejames.com"&gt;http://www.herbiejames.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gayinternetradiolive.com"&gt;http://www.gayinternetradiolive.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;P.S.  I know, I know....Now somebody’s going to start up on me that “Oh, all he plays is Techno.”  NOT.  Let’s get this straight once and for all time.  I play the Room.....The Party at hand.  It’s All in the bag and how it comes Out of it at that moment.  (Just take Any of the other podcasts as evidence.)  End of That story.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;Thank you Very much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;(MushyMuah)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: large;"&gt;P.P.S.

is how it Really happened.  No, I mean really....the naked truth....&gt;0  Then, of course, if I Did have the time and space here to ..."Spill the beans."...You probably wouldn't believe me anyway.  Scary as the truth is sometimes.  But, It caught up with me lately.  When a friend of mine, Dennis Jozefowicz, asked me to answer a few candid, all the sordid detail, questions....so that he might do an "E - True Hollywood Story" type interview for the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.southfloridagaynews.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;South Florida Gay News (http://www.southfloridagaynews.com)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt; and I said ...'Sure, E-Me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;Well, and this is the truth, with only a Few sordid details left out to protect the innocent.  And a coupla weeks later, he called and said that I was to be in next week's issue.  Some apprehension in between....and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.southfloridagaynews.com/arts-and-entertainment/music/1856-herbie-james-making-south-florida-dance-for-over-20-years.html"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;paper shows up with Me Center Stage....meaning put your thumb on the paper to open it...and I've been given Center fold, Right side, Full color half page picture, a not so badly spoken interview, with no ad-space around it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;  Honestly, and Humbly, I was Blown away.  (tail wagging....wagwagwagwagwag.)  (*re--Blushing).  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;So, believe this. No, Really.  Some people, who Know me aside from my booth personality, may know that I don't really accept heart-felt compliments like that very easily.  No, really.  So, I thought, Wow....I Am truly blessed to have such great friends, who look after me like that.  What a team we are indeed.  Give yourselves all a big round of applause.....with my love.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;Speaking of.....My buddy, and Love of my life, Wayne and I have been working some time now on the Production side of making music. With some excellent results. This time with Remixes of the new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ronperkov.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;Ron Perkov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt; single &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.masterbeat.com/#artist/ronperkov"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;"It Doesn't Matter."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;  Which, Just got released for a two week exclusive run on Masterbeat.com.  Then to the world.  We did two different styles of the same mix.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.masterbeat.com/#artist/ronperkov"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;The Herbie James Hit mix...and the Herbie James Amsterdam mix (mixes 9 &amp;amp; 10 on this link.)

Making my way in my little corner of the this blue marble of a planet.  I feel so small in the big picture..(been watching a lot of the "Universe" series lately.)...but, I know that my spirit carries a Lot of energy...and energies.  We are All connected...and we All get what we give.  So, Might as well be positive then, right.  That said....please keep your head high to the sky....and don't buy into all the hype of what you hear on TV...(TV is NOT the truth.)....and Please, don't live in fear.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;So, check out &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.southfloridagaynews.com/arts-and-entertainment/music/1856-herbie-james-making-south-florida-dance-for-over-20-years.html"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;my interview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.masterbeat.com/#artist/ronperkov"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;my remixes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;....and look for a new podcast in the mix in a coupla days.

I finally gave in.  But, I went kicking and screaming.  And, I'd Do It again.  Turned out....it was great fun.  Ok.....I didn't Totally give in to evil....the evil that is Cheeze.  I did give them Herbicidal Top 40.  In my own way....and That's the only way I know How to give it.  Don't hate me for the shape of my head....or the music in me.  It just turned Out that way.  I was Trying to give the dark and dirty....because it was a dark and dirty theme party....but the crowd that night just wasn't getting it....and what with the type of requests that I was getting .....I just decided to turn the program around....and let them have what they wanted, and give them the Herbicidal Hits....as it were.  So, here's what really happened.  Here's how the night turned out.  Here's the last two sets of the night that comprised the last hour plus and then the come-down to the end.  Which I loved.  I Loved the come-down.  Which....is mostly why I thought the night totally worked.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;Don't get me wrong....it was a packed house....and they were ONIT....but it was a completely different crowd from the night before.....when they Did get the hard dark nastiness.  (that will just have to be anOther podcast....soon.)  But here ya go....the Herbie at the Top.  The top of the bottom of the Top 40 charts....the songs that are always in the bag.....they just don't find their way out as often....I love it all.  Great tunes....Great songs.  Hope you Enjoy the Ride.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;So....the scene of the crime....was my latest trip to Columbus OH when I played the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.exilebar.com/exile/content"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;Exile Bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;.  This time it was for the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gaysoftballworldseries.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;Gay Softball World Series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;....Hot Hot Hot....The room is hot and so was the crowd.  You would so Love this Room.  Ok...and the Men that make it home.  HOT. I'm sure that the locals appreciate all the promotions and adventures that the Exile provides.  This weekend they even had a portable 100 foot shower set up out back....With a mirror ball inside.  I think it was because of the fact they had "Honey Wrestling," (Bears + Honey = Tasty Bears) but, who cares why....just the fact that they had a huge truck that was a Shower....wagwagwag. Not to mention they roasted a whole pig....oink.  And, they had Me....and I let them Have It....and they love me.  Or so they say ...(w).  I do love BEing there....and they are putting a Lot into the space. Changing it up...and before it's all said and done....it will be even more fantastic.  And Talk about friendly....boing.  Fun all around.  Stay tuned....as I'm going back soon. Tail waggin.....wagwagwagwag.  So,  If you R Ever in the Columbus area....Do stop in and give your best to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.exilebar.com/exile/content/staff"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;Rob and all the handsome crew that keep the flames burning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;Ok....it wasn't That horrible....and you'll probably really like it....just take it like a man.  After all....it Is Herbicidal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;Love all around&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;Herbie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.herbiejames.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;http://www.herbiejames.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gayinternetradiolive.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:large;"&gt;http://www.gayinternetradiolive.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15502526-2156294255406202652?l=djherbiejames.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total><enclosure url="http://www.herbiejames.com/podcast_files/exilewinsworldseries3.mp3" length="85463240" type="audio/mpeg" /><media:content url="http://www.herbiejames.com/podcast_files/exilewinsworldseries3.mp3" fileSize="85463240" type="audio/mpeg" /><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:subtitle>download eXile wins World Series part 3 mp3right click and save to download (Windows)Command click and save to download (Mac) GASP!!Say it isn't true!!Herbie....Top 40!!The Horrors of it All!!

Don't get me wrong....it was a packed house....and they were ONIT....but it was a completely different crowd from the night before.....when they Did get the hard dark nastiness. (that will just have to be anOther podcast....soon.) But here ya go....the Herbie at the Top. The top of the bottom of the Top 40 charts....the songs that are always in the bag.....they just don't find their way out as often....I love it all. Great tunes....Great songs. Hope you Enjoy the Ride. So....the scene of the crime....was my latest trip to Columbus OH when I played the Exile Bar. This time it was for the Gay Softball World Series....Hot Hot Hot....The room is hot and so was the crowd. You would so Love this Room. Ok...and the Men that make it home. HOT. I'm sure that the locals appreciate all the promotions and adventures that the Exile provides. This weekend they even had a portable 100 foot shower set up out back....With a mirror ball inside. I think it was because of the fact they had "Honey Wrestling," (Bears + Honey = Tasty Bears) but, who cares why....just the fact that they had a huge truck that was a Shower....wagwagwag. Not to mention they roasted a whole pig....oink. And, they had Me....and I let them Have It....and they love me. Or so they say ...(w). I do love BEing there....and they are putting a Lot into the space. Changing it up...and before it's all said and done....it will be even more fantastic. And Talk about friendly....boing. Fun all around. Stay tuned....as I'm going back soon. Tail waggin.....wagwagwagwag. So, If you R Ever in the Columbus area....Do stop in and give your best to Rob and all the handsome crew that keep the flames burning. Ok....it wasn't That horrible....and you'll probably really like it....just take it like a man. After all....it Is Herbicidal.

And yes....I Wish the world revolved around me....alas that rude awakening came quite a long time ago.  So now, and for This time, it's not about me....it's about another friend who needs a vote of confidence.  Seems She is in the running for her own TV show on the Oprah network....and it's a bit of a competition and she needs as many "Votes" as she can get.  So,  I thought....how nice it might be to ask a slice of My universe for some of that.  So, If you have a quick moment, go to this &lt;a href="http://myown.oprah.com/audition/index.html?request=video_details&amp;amp;response_id=15255&amp;amp;promo_id=1"&gt;shared link&lt;/a&gt;....and give back some &lt;a href="http://myown.oprah.com/audition/index.html?request=video_details&amp;amp;response_id=15255&amp;amp;promo_id=1"&gt;Love to Becky and let's get one of our own Out there.&lt;/a&gt;  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Here's the mail that She sent out, with the &lt;a href="http://myown.oprah.com/audition/index.html?request=video_details&amp;amp;response_id=15255&amp;amp;promo_id=1"&gt;voting link.&lt;/a&gt;...just so you get the gist of her show.

And so, I am asking you all to support me in my never ending quest to spread love and sunshine. Oprah Winfrey has a competition for someone to win the opportunity to create their own show on her network and be the new Oprah!!!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;My show concept is "Love Today" and as you know me well, are probably not surprised by this! From the little girl skipping and tap dancing, to the "Hello Love" Cruise Director, I really believe that I have something to offer. The show would be fun and exciting, emotional and inspiring, educational and at times surprising....but always fun! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;What the world needs now is a feel-good TV show. What the world needs now is "Love".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;So, I need your help and the help of ALL of your friends, family, neighbours, collegues, facebookers and twitterers.....it is a voting process and so please have you or your friends log on to the below website and search for Becky Thomson Foley, "Love Today" and vote for me. Some have a million + votes and so the more people you could ask to help would enable Oprah to see that Becky and Love need to be on her network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Here is the link so copy and paste it:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://myown.oprah.com/audition/index.html?request=video_details&amp;amp;response_id=15255&amp;amp;promo_id=1"&gt;http://myown.oprah.com/audition/index.html?request=video_details&amp;amp;response_id=15255&amp;amp;promo_id=1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Thank you for inspiring me.......thank you for supporting me.......&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Whatever you do, do it with love,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Becky "Hello Love" Thomson :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.....Hope you didn't think I was going to just leave without posting some choons for ya.
