Win a great prize package! Details at the end of this post!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, I launched my &lt;a href="http://www.the50vs50.com/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;50 vs 50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project again.  For those of you not familiar with the project, I'm drawing 50 heroes and 50 villains (100 drawings total) in order to pay for my trip and accommodations to &lt;a href="http://comic-con.org/"&gt;San Diego Comic Con in July 2012&lt;/a&gt;.  I was able to do this last year with much success and I'd like to try to do it again this year. Going to Comic Con in July is quite important in that I am in the process of designing an EXCLUSIVE ITEM for a pretty big Comic Con presence. (I'm not at liberty to say who it is quite yet, but trust me...it's pretty cool.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this being Leap Day and all and the fact that we have &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;an extra day&lt;/span&gt; to do something awesome, I've decided to launch a neat little promotion to help meet my goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm giving a special &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;PACKAGES OF AWESOME&lt;/span&gt; to two winners who participate in this promotion.  Take a look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nrpPnTNdFAo/T01tXSE49YI/AAAAAAAAB5g/bB1-whF457c/s1600/WINNER%2521.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 270px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nrpPnTNdFAo/T01tXSE49YI/AAAAAAAAB5g/bB1-whF457c/s400/WINNER%2521.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5714343748959794562" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This package includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;A full set of my &lt;a href="http://geekaweek.net/"&gt;Geek A Week&lt;/a&gt; cards. &lt;/span&gt;This includes all of Season 1 and Season 2, including the cards that are out of print! (Finally, you'll have that Scalzi card you've been looking for!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;An original&lt;a href="http://w00tstock.net/"&gt; w00tstock 1.0 &lt;/a&gt;robot poster signed by me.&lt;/span&gt; This one is pretty rare.

You want to get your nerdy hands on this stuff. So here's how you enter:  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;(OBLIGATORY PURCHASE OPTION)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Purchase a 50 vs. 50 Hero or Villain and your name and e-mail will be placed in a special drawing. To do this, &lt;a href="http://www.the50vs50.com/"&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;(NO PURCHASE NECESSARY OPTION)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Follow my Twitter account @jawboneradio. Write a creative tweet using the hashtag #50v50.  The funniest, most original and creative tweet will be chosen to win the package. Tell me why you want to win this nerdy package. Make me laugh. Whatever you do, &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;stand out!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deadline for entry is 3/7/12. The winner for both packages will be chosen on 3/8/12.  (As of this writing, there are 47 heroes and 48 villains left to purchase. Surely we can get these sold soon, right!?) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So get out there, promote 50 vs 50, help support my nerdy travel plans and win some pretty awesome rare stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huzzah!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10746170-4192483945167965172?l=jawboneradio.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2012-02-29T09:37:51.906-05:00</app:edited><media:thumbnail url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nrpPnTNdFAo/T01tXSE49YI/AAAAAAAAB5g/bB1-whF457c/s72-c/WINNER%2521.jpg" height="72" width="72" /><feedburner:origLink>http://jawboneradio.blogspot.com/2012/02/support-nerdy-travel-support-50v50.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>What's Up With Len</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JawboneRadio/~3/wd8MV-B1Ibg/whats-up-with-len.html</link><category>site news</category><author>jawboneradio@gmail.com (Len and Nora)</author><pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2012 07:03:30 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10746170.post-1472007895934666835</guid><description>Apologies for the lack of updates. I really have been moving on since the loss of my father in the fall.  And I've been very busy.  Both Nora and I have had very limited time to do the podcast, what with the upcoming baby (!) and my current work schedule.  I was just talking to Nora about possibly recording a new show...aaaand that's about as far as it went.  I'm sure if I brought it up again, we might be able to carve out some time, but for now consider us on hiatus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, there is a lot going on. So let's get right to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Monster By Mail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The monster drawing service that I created to pay for the hospital bills for the birth of my last child turns five years old next month.  And I've decided to breathe some new life into it by adding &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;GUEST ARTISTS!&lt;/span&gt;  The first guest artist is my good friend, Sunday Williams. She's an incredible unknown artist whose stuff I've adored for years.  I've been trying to get Sunday to put more of her art out there, and this is my selfish way of bringing more of her wonderful cartoons to the world.  I mean, look at this piece for Punk Rock Flea:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7040/6875632315_e7df0e1d31.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 333px; height: 500px;" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7040/6875632315_e7df0e1d31.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know, right?! I've removed the video option to make it easier on the guest artists, but you can purchase Sunday's original art for a limited time &lt;a href="http://www.monsterbymail.com"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt; for a mere $50!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Geek A Week: Legends of Videogames&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7029/6803099005_d78cc351bd.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 500px; height: 313px;" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7029/6803099005_d78cc351bd.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've launched Season three of my Geek A Week project.  This time around, I've narrowed the focus to showcase some of the most interesting geeks in Videogames.  At the time of this writing, I've released two new geek cards.  Last week's was &lt;a href="http://geekaweek.net/2012/02/1783/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Cliff Bleszinski or Epic Games.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  This week, it's &lt;a href="http://geekaweek.net/2012/02/legends-of-videogames-dan-paladin/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Dan Paladin of The Behemoth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Next week's geek should be a definite crowd favorite.  So stay tuned for that.  And if you miss my sweet, sweet podcasting voice, you can subscribe to the Geek A Week podcast &lt;a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GeekAWeek"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole set should be between 15-20 cards and once again, like with Season 2, I am planning a Kickstarter to pay for the production of the cards.  This should be happening later this spring.  And I'll be sure to let you all know when that happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, I am looking for some people who do machinima or 8 bit graphics for a video I'm working on.  If you fit this bill, please send me an e-mail at monsterbymail at geemail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;DotCon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between all the art and interviews and whatnot, I'm also appearing at a con!  Well, sort of.  It's an online convention, called &lt;a href="http://dotconfest.com/"&gt;Dotcon.&lt;/a&gt;  A few internet folks got together and wanted to bring the convention experience to your desktop. It's a pretty small thing right now, but the hope is that if it's popular enough, we'll be able to do this several times a year.  My panel is Saturday, February 25 at 5 PM EST/2 PM PST.  I'll be drawing live with actors &lt;a href="http://www.taraplatt.com/"&gt;Tara Platt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.yurilowenthal.com/"&gt;Yuri Lowenthal.&lt;/a&gt;  Both Tara and Yuri do a webseries called &lt;a href="http://www.shelflifeseries.com/"&gt;Shelf Life.&lt;/a&gt; But between the two of them, they've been voices in cartoons, anime and pretty much every video game ever created.  (No joke.&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Lowenthal#Video_game_roles"&gt; Look at this list.&lt;/a&gt; And that's just Yuri's!)  In any event, the plan is to have them voice characters I draw live and also create a voice live and then have me create the look of that character right there in front of God and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, there will be appearances and performances from other great folks like&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/joshacagan"&gt; Josh Cagan&lt;/a&gt; (hilarious!), a concert with &lt;a href="http://www.mikephirman.com/"&gt;Mike Phirman&lt;/a&gt; (doubly hilarious!) and &lt;a href="http://www.thedoubleclicks.com/"&gt;The Doubleclicks&lt;/a&gt; (adorable!), geek ice cream making with Virginia Corbett  of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/SugarBean-ice-cream/271353312925140"&gt;Sugar Bean Ice Cream&lt;/a&gt; (delicious!) and online gaming with &lt;a href="http://critical-hits.com/category/critical-hits/columns/minor-quests-columns/"&gt;Logan Bonner&lt;/a&gt; (challenging!).  You can read all about the events and everything &lt;a href="http://dotconfest.com/"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And one last thing I'm excited about, I created the mascot of DotCon, the robot icon we've nicknamed Robit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mrPu8rAfUmk/TzvDTFZTRRI/AAAAAAAAB5E/Gnum2rbYOA4/s1600/Screen%2Bshot%2B2012-02-15%2Bat%2B9.37.32%2BAM.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 109px; height: 177px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mrPu8rAfUmk/TzvDTFZTRRI/AAAAAAAAB5E/Gnum2rbYOA4/s320/Screen%2Bshot%2B2012-02-15%2Bat%2B9.37.32%2BAM.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5709371685255464210" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He may not look like much, but there was a really cool creative exercise that took place to create him. Tune into my panel to hear the whole story!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;50 vs. 50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of all of this, &lt;a href="http://www.the50vs50.com/"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;50 vs. 50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is coming back to help me raise funds to get to San Diego Comic Con.  I wasn't planning on attending this year, and then I found out I was going to create something EXCLUSIVE for Comic Con!  (!!!)  I can't say too much more, but  I'm way excited to be working on it.  I had told Nora I can't go this year because of the baby and then when she found out about what I was asked to do, she said " Well, you HAVE to go now."  So, you see, this is all about fulfilling my wonderful wife's wishes for me to attend one of the largest nerdy conventions of the year. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jawboneradio"&gt;my updates on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to keep updated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now back to radio silence...&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10746170-1472007895934666835?l=jawboneradio.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2012-02-15T10:03:30.542-05:00</app:edited><media:thumbnail url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mrPu8rAfUmk/TzvDTFZTRRI/AAAAAAAAB5E/Gnum2rbYOA4/s72-c/Screen%2Bshot%2B2012-02-15%2Bat%2B9.37.32%2BAM.png" height="72" width="72" /><feedburner:origLink>http://jawboneradio.blogspot.com/2012/02/whats-up-with-len.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>A Tribute To My Dad</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JawboneRadio/~3/BdQi-OcP8Oo/tribute-to-my-dad.html</link><category>writing</category><author>jawboneradio@gmail.com (Len and Nora)</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2011 06:54:30 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10746170.post-4749657130373861298</guid><description>It's been 40 days since my dad passed away.  This is pretty significant in Filipino culture.  Tonight, we are having a mass and dinner for my dad.  There will be quite a few friends and family there. I've been asked to say a few words, which has caused me to stress out a little bit. But it reminded me of a piece I wrote the day after my father died.  This was meant to be more cathartic than anything else, but I find it appropriate given the significance of the day.  I also allows me to put a little bit of closure on the open-ended blog post from a little over a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be reading this at the event tonight, but I felt, at the very least, this tribute should be read by those who would like to read it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, without further ado, here is the tribute I wrote for my dad: Dr. Demetrio L. Peralta Sr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been asked to write a tribute to my father. I will attempt to do the man justice, but I feel out of all the family, I am the least qualified to write about him. Being the youngest child, the baby of the family, I have obviously known Dad the least amount of time. I do, however, have a bond that no one else has: I was born a mere hours after his forty-sixth birthday. We will forever be linked in this way, as will my daughter be linked with me.  (She was born on Dad’s seventy-sixth birthday).  As I write this, all our birthdays were this past weekend, with my father passing on All Saints Day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past four months, I have spent more time with my dad than I have in the past four years. I’m not particularly proud of that fact, but then again my dad was not an easy guy to know. Sure, for the past decade, he and mom were gone most of the year in Las Vegas. But he has always been a man of few words; stoic, usually sitting near the picture window in our dining room looking out on our wooded backyard.  Occasionally, there would be bursts of absurd silliness that did not jibe with the rest of his personality. (My dad attempting to hypnotize lobsters, for example, would be near the top of that list.) Obviously, meeting dad later in his life, close to his 50s, my view of him is vastly different than some of the other folks in the family.  But here is my recollection...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will perpetually have this image of my father wearing his straw cowboy hat and using his riding mower to cut the grass at his office. I remember his sneezes - yes, sneezes - always coming in threes and loud as all get out. I will remember the way he pulled up his pajama bottoms - a small twist and a pull up, the same way I do today.  I’ll remember the funny way he would deal with wrong numbers, yelling the word “NOBODY!” into the phone, leaving my brother  and I wondering what the question could have been to elicit that answer. I remember him devouring macadamia nuts by the jar. I remember flying kites and tossing Frisbees in our backyard. The way he packed his luggage months in advance for a trip. I remember watching him interact with friends or guys at a hardware store or repair shop. The way his voice would raise an octave when he spoke to them and how his jokes always seemed a little bit off. I remember him watching Big Time Wrestling, sitting forward in his seat and miming the body slams ever so slightly by raising and lowering his shoulders. I remember traveling through Europe with him and mom, thinking back that I was totally unappreciative of it at the time. Being seven, all I cared about was getting a new toy from the marionette shop in Paris or a metal train set from Austria. I remember him leaving a wake up call in Monte Carlo and in his thick Filipino accent asking the front desk to be waken up at “Pour o’ clock” and getting increasingly annoyed when they couldn't understand him.  I remember doing the rounds with him at Southwest General on Saturday afternoon and then heading to a matinee of a movie that was I’m sure a penance for him to watch. I remember him getting lost between the over-sized punching bags at Sea World’s Capn’ Kids World.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I will always remember the look on his face whenever he interacted with one of the grandchildren, most especially my own children. His demeanor would change, his face would light up and he would instantly become a young man right before my eyes.  I’m heartbroken that I won’t be able to experience that with my new child due in the spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the Dad I knew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This marks the first time I have had anyone in my immediate family has passed away. Over the years, I’ve always wondered how I would deal with it.  Would I be scared?  Would I feel ridiculous or embarrassed as if I were part of some cheesy Lifetime flick? Looking back, I am glad I was afforded the luxury of going through the dying process in this way. Dad gave us so many memories in the last days of his life, so many moments to look back on.  I am thankful beyond measure for that. I am grateful that Dad allowed us time to accept his departure and process it. I am also thankful that he allowed me the opportunity to share the experience of the death of a loved one with my own children in this loving and peaceful way. Dad has taught me that there is nothing to fear of death.  That death is simply a transitional period that can be full of love and light. I am somewhat envious of him as he begins this new exciting journey without us. I can only imagine what he may be thinking, what we would want to tell us and what the look on his face would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I begin this new day, one without my father, I think to my own family, my own mortality and how this pattern of loss and sadness will be destined to be repeated again. Surrounded by my loved ones:  My children, keeping watch over me, perhaps to the point of pulling their hair out from frustration. There would be frantic outbursts of emotion ranging from doubled-over laughter from unearthing some long forgotten memory, to unquenchable sadness, realizing that an end was inevitable. My wife, somewhere in close proximity, would be sighing and wringing her hands, mentally reviewing the ornate tapestry that we have woven together for over half a century. And even though I won’t necessarily be able to react and interact like you would all like me to, the love will be palpable.  If I could speak, I would tell my children all the lessons my father tried to impart to me: to be good to one another and to other people. To take care of each other. To have confidence in themselves, always. To work hard and live their lives honestly. Most of all, I would remind everyone to pray for one another and to pray for me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had used my time more wisely with you Dad.  But I am thankful for the time I was afforded. Thank you for everything you have done for all of us over the years.  I love you and we will all miss you immensely.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10746170-4749657130373861298?l=jawboneradio.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2011-12-09T09:54:30.841-05:00</app:edited><feedburner:origLink>http://jawboneradio.blogspot.com/2011/12/tribute-to-my-dad.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Condolences and Congratulations</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JawboneRadio/~3/yhOnGBrfC6k/condolences-and-congratulations.html</link><category>site news</category><author>jawboneradio@gmail.com (Len and Nora)</author><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2011 07:15:57 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10746170.post-2185433177931831544</guid><description>This weekend is my dad’s birthday, my oldest daughter’s birthday and my birthday. I am trying to maintain some joy around these events.  However, I am currently watching my dad succumb to cancer in a hospice facility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add to this, as I am watching one life end, I am also preparing for a new life to enter the world.  My wife, Nora, and I recently found out that we are expecting our seventh child in the spring. Unfortunately, the first trimester is usually pretty rough on my wife, and this pregnancy is no exception. She has been battling some serious morning sickness most of the past month, meaning  I have had to pull some double duty around my household to keep things in order.  It also feels like most everyone I have been dealing with recently has been in a horizontal position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not lost on me - the symbolism between this end and beginning. I was able to tell my dad about his impending grandchild and even in his diminished state, he was able to communicate that he thought it might be a boy. He also sounded happy about the news, which was good, because I think if this were a few years ago, he may have thought my wife and I were insane and been overly worried on our behalf. Believe me, there is enough worry to go around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a good thing I draw pictures for a living, because all this art has been very therapeutic for me. I certainly appreciate how busy you have all kept me over the past few months. Thank you for that. Also, keep going! With another child on the way, I will definitely need all the help I can get. (You don’t know how much my wife and I dread being beholden to the diaper and wipe industry yet again.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t have much else to say except thank you on behalf of me and my family for the support you have given my art.  It fills my days and has enabled me to make a real living, something my dad always wanted for me.  I know that he didn’t really “get” what I did for a living.  Occasionally I would show up at my parent’s house with a new book I had illustrated or a deck of cards with my art on it or  my computer open showing them how many people were ordering monsters or superheroes or whatever the heck I was drawing that week. They remain puzzled, but at the very least my dad knows that I’m not sitting at home pretending to be busy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s it.  My update. I’ve struggled with the issue of letting complete strangers know what is going on in our lives. I don’t know why I feel obligated, but I do.  Maybe it’s my coping mechanism; talking to the people inside my computer.   I’m off again, for who knows how long, to try and “get the big contract” as my dad told me to. Wish me luck. With everything. And say a few prayers for me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lord knows I need it.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10746170-2185433177931831544?l=jawboneradio.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2011-10-27T10:15:57.927-04:00</app:edited><feedburner:origLink>http://jawboneradio.blogspot.com/2011/10/condolences-and-congratulations.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>In Search Of...</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JawboneRadio/~3/z_05Ju7Q4mc/in-search-of.html</link><category>site news</category><author>jawboneradio@gmail.com (Len and Nora)</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2011 09:15:35 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10746170.post-169067611257062089</guid><description>Hello.  First off, let me apologize for the lack of podcasts. It's a lame excuse to give, I know, but &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;"I've been busy."&lt;/span&gt;  Once you read this post, maybe it will shed some light on why I had to take some time off from Jawbone Radio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have following me on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jawboneradio"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, you may know that I am currently in the market for a Business Manager/Brand Strategist.  I've been searching for a person like this for over a year now. Someone to help rudder the Len Peralta brand. I've had spots of luck here and there, but for the most part, I've been doing everything on my own.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been reluctant to post anything formal because I was unsure about the type of responses I'd get from taking such a scatter-shot approach on a major social media platform. Also, to be honest, I wasn't completely sure what I was looking for. I've talked to other brand strategists and managers for some friends in new media and they have all given me valuable advice.  (I would hire any of them given the chance)  However, none of them really do exactly what I'm looking for. Not to sound self-important, but I feel in some ways that I am creating a new category here.  This person would not be an artists rep.  This person wouldn't be an agent.  In a perfect world, this person would help me build and extend my illustration business and help me navigate through projects. I'm sure this person exists, but I can't for the life of me seem to find them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is a document I've been working on that was helping me clarify what I've been searching for. I admit when I was writing it, I felt like I was trying to write a personal ad. I have to admit, this is sort of tough for me to share.  In some ways, taking a step back and admitting I need some assistance with my personal brand goes against what I feel I should do.  But I think it may be time for me to take this step forward, if I have any chance of moving past where I am right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take a look and if it sounds like something you can do, or you know someone who fits this bill, please pass it along. I'm willing to talk to all sorts of people, providing they are serious about helping me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, Here goes nothing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;SEEKING BUSINESS MANAGER/BUSINESS DEVELOPER/BRAND STRATEGIST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently looking for someone to assist me in building my personal brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past 10 years, I have worked tirelessly to help forge a strong brand identity for myself.  I have had the great fortune of being able to work on some high-profile projects and the opportunity to work alongside well-known IPs and growing franchises. I am at a point now, however, where I feel I have done most of what I can do on my own. I am looking for someone who will work in tandem with me to help bring my brand to the next level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To that point, I am not looking for someone who can just answer e-mails for me and free up some spare time (although I’m sure to start, there may be some of that, but this is not a secretarial position).  I need someone I can throw the ball to, and they can throw it right back to me and challenge my expectations. I am looking for someone who can represent me in a positive light to potential clients. Someone who can run interference when negotiating and help set an equitable rate standard for my services. Someone who can be proactive in identifying, pitching and securing upcoming projects.  And finally, someone I can trust completely to help rudder my brand amidst growing competition and uncertain financial times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for someone who can assess the sub-brands under my main brand and build and maximize their earning potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ideal candidate must:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be fearless and be willing to work outside their comfort zone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be flexible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possess proven skills in marketing and branding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be able to think quickly on their feet.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possess impeccable communication skills. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a broadband connection with current communication tools and ability to conference. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Current contacts in the entertainment, publishing or animation industry are a plus, but not mandatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for someone to keep in step with me throughout the entire process. I promise you, this will be fun. I won't settle for less. Does this sound like you? Write me at monsterbymail at gmail dot com. Please use the phrase “Business Manager Inquiry” in the subject line. Please provide a phone number for contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phew!  *fingers crossed*  Let's see what happens.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10746170-169067611257062089?l=jawboneradio.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2011-10-05T12:15:35.463-04:00</app:edited><feedburner:origLink>http://jawboneradio.blogspot.com/2011/10/in-search-of.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>DragonCon 2011 Schedule</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JawboneRadio/~3/uT72FUIcppc/dragoncon-2011-schedule.html</link><category>site news</category><author>jawboneradio@gmail.com (Len and Nora)</author><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2011 10:44:51 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10746170.post-5582579172609800235</guid><description>Wow, this place is dusty.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the lack of updates. Lots has been happening on the personal life front, and it's been hard for Nora and I to dedicate anytime to the podcast.

It's been a while, I know.  We are planning on recording a show soon, for those of you who are still with us. There is certainly a lot to talk about and the next show will be jammed packed.  But in the meantime, I want to talk a little about my art project called &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;50 vs. 50.&lt;a href="http://the50vs50.com"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past two months, I've been drawing heroes and villains for people with the hopes of making enough money to make it to make it to San Diego Comic Con.  The good news is that I was able to sell all 100 drawings.  The better news is that I am making the original pen and ink drawings available for sale to all those who purchased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some artists, I still haven't made the switch to all digital yet. I still draw all my artwork on Bristol board, scan it in and then color digitally.  This means after I scan in the drawing, it just ends up on the floor of my office never to be seen again.  I'm a big fan of original art because I feel it tells a story.  You can see the pencil sketching, the mistakes, and the notes to myself about what to fix in post online.   Occasionally, you will get a failed sketch or two on the back of the bristol board that didn't make the cut. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am making all 100 pen and ink drawings available for sale today.  The drawings will be signed by me and can be personalized if you specify it. When you order, just let me know the name of the drawing you are interested in and I'll package it up and send it off to you Priority Mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like your original signed pen and ink 50 vs 50 drawing, simply use the paypal button below to purchase. Make sure you list which drawing you would like  in the special instructions field.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a question?

In the interest of full disclosure, I got the idea from internet musician and friend, &lt;a href="http://mikelombardomusic.com/"&gt;Mike Lombardo&lt;/a&gt; who is doing something similar with online music lessons. (Thanks Mike!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in order for me to get a handle on how much real interest there is in me teaching online art classes, I am soliciting some responses from you. If you are interested in doing a Pay Per View art class with me as your teacher, send me an e-mail at &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;artclass AT lenperalta dot com.&lt;/span&gt;  Make sure you use the Subject Line: &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;PPV Online Art Class.&lt;/span&gt;  When I figure there are enough people interested, I'll make another announcement and give you all the details. For time being, the age limit would be 18 and over.  If there is enough interest for a kids class, then I'll give it some thought and offer that in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, rather than put up a survey, and because I want to elicit some back and forth response on this endeavor, feel free to write in the comments of this post what kinds of things you'd want to learn,  what techniques you think would be interesting to cover and if you'd want to do all digital illustration.  Because of technical limitations, it might just be digital illustration, but I guess it all depends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your input and I look forward to (perhaps) being your online art teacher!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10746170-3028860791782356385?l=jawboneradio.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2011-02-16T14:24:14.646-05:00</app:edited><feedburner:origLink>http://jawboneradio.blogspot.com/2011/02/online-art-classes-show-of-hands.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>An Update Of Sorts</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JawboneRadio/~3/jyviw251IKI/update-of-sorts.html</link><category>site news</category><author>jawboneradio@gmail.com (Len and Nora)</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2011 05:57:00 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10746170.post-2553428486823359259</guid><description>This is just a post to say that we know we haven't done a show in a while, and we apologize.

I didn't think I had any more of them, but lo and behold I was able to dig up four of them! It's called Vampire Waitress and was a lot of fun for me to draw. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jawboneradio/27021605/" title="Vampire Waitress by jawboneradio, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/22/27021605_f95c8fd49c.jpg" width="398" height="500" alt="Vampire Waitress" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because these are so rare, I'm pricing it at $45.00. I will post when all four are gone. So order now!

Some of this art are the ONLY PRINTS AVAILABLE.  I had one printed off and then I never did another one.  Here's what I have.  First up, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Mummy Returns:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jawboneradio/26700483/" title="The Mummy Returns by jawboneradio, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/23/26700483_aca4c1c249.jpg" width="397" height="500" alt="The Mummy Returns" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember in the earlier paragraph that I said this was the ONLY PRINT AVAILABLE?  Well, this is THE ONLY PRINT AVAILABLE.  It depicts a mummy coming to life a la Jack Davis style.  It's beautiful and you must own it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Creature Walks Among Us:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jawboneradio/25182762/" title="The Creature Walks Among Us by jawboneradio, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/22/25182762_af27ae38bf.jpg" width="500" height="273" alt="The Creature Walks Among Us" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are only three of these prints that I know of.  One is framed and hanging in my basement.  The second was given as a gift to Joel Hodgson of MST3K. And the third can be yours!  I don't know why I didn't get more of these printed up.  They were very influenced by "&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Horror At Party Beach."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the extreme rarity of these prints, I am pricing it accordingly.  But come on, you'll be one of only 3 people who have the one print and THE ONLY PERSON who has the other.  I'm going to let these rarities go for $130.00.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So go forth and buy!  As soon as it sells, I'll close this post.  Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="CSBPXSYQEYCUY"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;input type="image" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_buynowCC_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/10746170-135950849784156735?l=jawboneradio.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2011-01-23T09:02:30.345-05:00</app:edited><media:thumbnail url="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/23/26700483_aca4c1c249_t.jpg" height="72" width="72" /><feedburner:origLink>http://jawboneradio.blogspot.com/2011/01/pax-art-sale-rare-monster-art.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Art Sale: Marian Call Posters</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/JawboneRadio/~3/byEAFFTp0Ds/pax-art-sale-marian-call-posters.html</link><category>fundraiser</category><author>jawboneradio@gmail.com (Len and Nora)</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2011 06:04:15 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10746170.post-6505707397159702464</guid><description>Ok, here we go again folks.

It's also the night we usually record our podcast.  Frankly, I don't see that happening. If you've noticed, it's been harder and harder for Nora and I to record a show. Plus the holidays have only compounded that feeling of shirking our normal duties.  So with that, I feel it would be easier just to write an end of year blog post.  It will be much more succinct than me recording a show and I can do it in roughly the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm nothing if not efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel this year,more than any other year in recent memory, deserves a proper blog post only because 2010 has been more unexpected and amazing for me and my family than I had ever anticipated it being.  So much so, that this may be the first time I can remember that I kind of want the remnants of the old year to hang around long enough to permeate into the new year.  For the first time, I'm not anxious to rush the old out so quickly. I know this sounds so strange, especially given the fact that there are lots of people I know who want to see this past year taken out back, beaten and burned alive.  This year has been full of hardships for many of my friends and family. And we've struggled with some really, really scary moments this past year. But overall,  I'm genuinely happy with the past year, with all it's complexities, fear and uncertainty. And I hope that more of the good is to come in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, if you have been following me on Twitter or been watching my extracurricular outside of Jawbone, you would know that my &lt;a href="http://geekaweek.net/"&gt;Geek A Week&lt;/a&gt; project has been an incredible success, moreso than I ever imagined it being.  This may be the first time in my creative life that I feel something I have started has turned into precisely what I wanted it to be. Even with all the unexpected success of my other projects like Monster By Mail and Flipface, Geek A Week seemed to be the culmination of years of work and days and days of artistry, persistence and creativity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geek A Week still has another two months left on it, and I don't want to write everything about it right now.  I want to save that up for the end of the project.  But suffice to say, I couldn't imagine a more wonderful and fulfilling project to work on that Geek A Week.  I look forward to seeing what it has to bring in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I can't let a year end blog post go by without mentioning the incredible support of the fans of my work who have helped motivate me and fill my inbox with such wonderfully kind words.  Certainly, all the support of Trace Beaulieu's book "&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://tracebeaulieu.com/sillyrhymes/"&gt;Silly Rhymes For Belligerent Children"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has been overwhelming and tremendous.  Trace and I are so profoundly proud of that piece of work.  I am honored to have been given the chance to work on something like that.  It's the kind of project I dreamed of working on growing up,  It's as if all my years of goofing off and cartooning has finally paid off.  It was an honor to have my heroes from MST3K read portions of the book at DragonCon in Atlanta, and it was so edifying to see all the positive response to something that Trace and I not only worked so hard on, but also had so much fun creating together.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all those people who came out to the three &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://w00tstock.net/"&gt;w00tstocks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I was so lucky to be a part of, saw me create and work and were introduced to my artwork, thank you so much.  w00tstock was a such an incredible experience, and as I was working on them, I tried to savor as much as it as I could. I know opportunities like that don't come around that often, especially for a relatively unknown cartoonist like myself.  I'm so proud to have been able to participate in them, I'm glad to meet all these new fans and I'm so happy so many people liked my stuff enough to purchase a poster or two from me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have met so many wonderful people this past year, made so many new and amazing friendships in 2010, done things I never thought I'd be able to do&lt;a href="http://jawboneradio.blogspot.com/2010/10/so-friday-there-was-this-house-concert.html"&gt; like have a live concert in my house&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jawboneradio/sets/72157624469197851/"&gt;attend Comic Con&lt;/a&gt; and meet and talk to so many of my personal heroes, it's easy to understand why I'm a little reluctant to let it leave.   If you've been listening to the interviews I've been doing for Geek A Week, you'll know that one of the questions I've been asking the people I've been interviewing is "If you could have two superpowers, what would those be and why?"  I've never formally answered my own question, but here at the tail end of the year, if I am asking myself that question my answer would be something like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;"My superpowers would be to stretch time.  Not in the literal sense where I am stretching it to give me more time to do the things I want, but a physical sense.  I want to be able to pull the momentum of the wonderful experiences from this past year and finger paint them into the new year.  I want to apply some of that magic and happiness and brilliance to the new year and watch it continue.  I can only imagine what could become of that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for my second superpower, I'd like to teleport. Not only because it would be cool, but then I could avoid TSA screeners..."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Year everyone. Thanks for helping make 2010 one of the best years of my life.

I was going to write a silly diatribe on Twitter about what happened to me this morning, but I felt this needed a bit more weight. A proper blog post is in order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, I rolled out of bed, checked my Twitter mentions and I get a tweet that says this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;@jawboneradio I understand that art is expensive, but do you have to charge a jobless HS student upwards of $115 an hour for monster art?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, by this person's own admission, they are jobless.  So I wouldn't put monster art on such a high priority.  But whatever, to each his own. Secondly, I don't charge anything &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;near&lt;/span&gt; $115 an hour.  If I did, I could probably take some time off for once in my life.  I'm hoping to charge that, one day, and I can assure you, it's not going to be without a greater or equal amount of sweat equity to get to that point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even if I did charge $115.hr, what the hell does it matter? I looked at my roster of commissions over the past few weeks and as far as I can remember, I didn't "charge" this person anything per hour.  I only charge people who commission me to do my work.  And if you're going to query me for what it would cost to do a piece or artwork or several pieces of artwork, I will tell you.  If you think I charge too much, then you are free to look elsewhere. If you really want my art, then maybe we could work something out.  Trade or barter for services has been an acceptable form of payment on occassion. But I hardly think it's fair for this person to say I have some nerve to charge "upwards of $115/hr for monster art."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Like any artist or musician, I spent a lot of time crafting my style, my workflow, my art.  I feel I've done a lot of work to come up with a price that is not only fair to me, but to my family as well.  I am the primary breadwinner in a family of eight.  Now, I don't expect a jobless High School student to appreciate this fact, but I'm working my ass off to provide for them.  I have a mortgage and bills like everyone else.  I've spent a great deal of time over the past five years establishing my reputation as an artist. And I'm extremely fortunate to have the opportunity to be able to find people who not only appreciate the work I do and like it, but are willing to pay me cash dollars for it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give a lot of content away for free.  All of Geek A Week has been free for you to enjoy (or not enjoy) and I'm not charging you a red cent for any of it.  Just last night, I posted an image of &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jawboneradio/5276221058/"&gt;Quorra from TRON&lt;/a&gt; all because I wanted to share my art with you. &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;FREE OF CHARGE.&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I have been doing Live drawing events on the net and you can watch me draw for free. There is an entire YouTube Channel devoted to just me drawing art. &lt;a href="http://flipface.me/black-and-white/"&gt;You can order a FlipFace from me for as low as $10.&lt;/a&gt; If you want to commission me for an ORIGINAL PIECE OF ART - NOT A DIGITAL FILE,&lt;a href="http://www.monsterbymail.com/"&gt; prices start at $35&lt;/a&gt;. If you want something more complicated, then I'll have to judge how long it will take me, what is involved in creating the art and I can quote you a custom price.  If you want to hire me for a week to create pieces of art for you, my cost is $1200/day*.  Certainly there is some price point in there that you can fall into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end is this: If you like what I do and you want to have a piece of it for you own, then I'd be happy to talk to you. There are lots of ways to enjoy my art and if you save up, you can afford a piece of your own. Just don't get on Twitter and complain how "expensive" I am when you have no idea how much time and effort goes into what I do.  I think I speak for all artists when I say valuing oneself and your services is one of the toughest things for an artist to perfect. Don't make it harder but de-valuing the art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I know I should take it easy because, after all, this person is just in High School and perhaps doesn't know any better.
