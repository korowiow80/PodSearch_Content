But, mentally tough baseball players are able to limit and contain slumps.  Mentally tough players have 3 game slumps, other players have 3 week long slumps.  We discuss four steps to limiting and containing slumps:&#xD;&#xD;1. Maintain perspective - slumps start and end.  &#xD;2. Maintain your confidence.  If you don't feel confident, then at least act confident.&#xD;3. Relax - don't put extra pressure on yourself.  Don't try hard, instead try easy.&#xD;4. Contain the slump to just one part of the game.  If you are in a hitting slump, leave the slump in the batter's box.  Don't tale your slump onto the mound, or onto the field with you.&#xD;&#xD;Remember - everyone has slumps.  The secret is to make them short and contained.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DiamondEdge/~4/_znvOKExo3k" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

It is used at advanced levels of baseball, but is rarely taught to high school and youth players.  Visualization is essentially playing baseball in your own mind.  Done effectively, it prepares you to step on the field and directly impacts muscle memory and the mind-body connection, which is so important in baseball.  There are two types of visualization in baseball. Visualizing a situation - like standing in the batter’s box or on the mound.  This is done with as much breadth and detail as possible.  The player tries to totally create the entire scene in his head - using all senses, sight, sound, smell, taste and feel.  The second type of visualization is performance-based, where the player actually visualizes the act of hitting the ball, throwing the pitch or fielding the ball. This is more narrowly focused visualization that directly links vision with muscles.  Both are important tools to help players improve mental toughness.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DiamondEdge/~4/RK_TD1eErkU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

Don't let your success be defined by the scorebook.  Instead, create your own definition of success based on what you can control and how you play the game.  If you focus and get better at the process of playing baseball, your winning percentage and personal stats will naturally improve.&#xD;&#xD;The homework assignment is to develop the metrics that you will use this season to measure your success after every game.

Self-talk is the conversation you have with yourself, either silently or out loud.  Positive self talk helps you become a confident, relaxed and focused baseball player.  Positive messages focus on what you can do, while negative self talk focuses on what you cannot do.&#xD;&#xD;Self-talk is 100% within the control of the player.  You control what you say to yourself.  Positive self-talk is not easy.  It takes self-discipline.  Positive self-talk is skill that you need to work on. &#xD;&#xD;The homework assignment is to write down three core positive statements about yourself as a baseball player this season.  The second part of the homework assignment is to start creating game situation self-talk statements during practice drills.  This is a skill and a routine that you can develop now, if you work at it.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DiamondEdge/~4/h5SgzIFd9YQ" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

To control fear, you must directly confront your fear.  What potential consequences are you most afraid of?  &#xD;&#xD;Fear is something that you create in your own mind.  Your mind creates exaggerated consequences of failure that must be confronted and challenged.&#xD;&#xD;In the homework assignment, players are asked to identify and analyze the fear that they have experienced on the baseball field.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DiamondEdge/~4/B7gg_lfXeZ0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

Goals are important because they give us direction, force commitment and because they are an important part of building confidence.   You need to have both long term goals for the season, and shorting term goals.  Goals should be within your control and focused on "how" you play, not just results. Also, don't forget to set goals for the mental side and improving your team skills.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DiamondEdge/~4/NhE844fe8KE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>
