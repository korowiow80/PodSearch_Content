			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Is your overprotective parenting hurting your child and damaging your marriage? Before we had government agencies in place to advise us on what was good or dangerous for us, we only had one way of finding out this information…through first hand experience. Bumps, scrapes and broken hearts were all part of the novelty that is childhood. However, like anything else, with enough information this has gone away. It seems like parents today want to protect their children from the ails of the world and prevent them from experiencing any of it. This “over parenting” could be harming your child more than helping them. Does your marriage have what it takes to overcome this?</p>
<p>Edie Raether, a self-proclaimed “Change Strategist” is an international keynote speaker, relationship and parenting coach, as well as a bestselling author of several books, including <a title="Sex for the Soul" href="http://www.amazon.com/Sex-Soul-Secrets-Intimacy-Spiritual/dp/1931219001" target="_blank"><em>Sex for the Soul</em> </a>and <a title="Stop Bullying Now" href="http://stopbullyingwithedie.com/products.php" target="_blank"><em>Stop Bullying Now</em></a>. Focusing on a child’s role in a family unit became a passion of Edie’s. So much so that she developed a character building program from children called “I Believe I can Fly!” As a behavioral psychology expert, Edie has been a psychotherapist, hypnotherapist and marriage and family counselor for 30 years and has addressed all relationship, behavioral, health and healing issues. To find out more about Edie Raether you can visit their <a title="Edie Raether Website" href="http://www.raether.com">website</a> or call 704-658-8997 for an appointment.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>How important are chemistry and connection in a relationship? When we met that special someone we felt the chemistry to keep it going. It was new. It was exciting. When we fell in love we built a connection that made us feel invincible and as if we could conquer anything as a team. When that connection dwindles in a marriage the effects become apparent in all aspects of the relationship. Is there a way to keep the marriage going when the connection is gone?</p>

		<itunes:summary>How important are chemistry and connection in a relationship? When we met that special someone we felt the chemistry to keep it going. It was new. It was exciting. When we fell in love we built a connection that made us feel invincible and as if we could conquer anything as a team. When that connection dwindles in a marriage the effects become apparent in all aspects of the relationship. Is there a way to keep the marriage going when the connection is gone?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Could a week long couples cruise be the key to saving your marriage? Gilligan had it all wrong; it takes more than a 3-hour tour. In fact, it takes 7 days. A simple, relaxing 7 days on the water could be the solution you’ve been searching for to save your drowning marriage from ending up like the Titanic. When a marriage is in danger, most couples attend couples counseling as a possible solution. But what if there was an option that would allow for deeper discovery and understanding without the constrictions of a one-hour time limit?</p>
<p>In addition to being an experienced sailor, Dr. Bryce Kaye received his Bachelor’s in psychology from Columbia University, and his Masters and Doctorate in psychology form the University of Illinois. Bryce has published a book on marriage improvement called <em><a title="The Marriage First Aid Kit" href="http://www.marriagefirstaid.com/" target="_blank">The Marriage First Aid Kit</a> </em>and is currently working on his new book, <a title="When Love &amp; Anger Got Married" href="http://www.loveodyssey.net/captain/book.php" target="_blank"><em>When Love &amp; Anger Got Married: Human Paradox &amp; Spiritual Growth</em></a>. Bryce now has two private practices, the<a title="Cary Counseling Center" href="http://www.carycounseling.com/" target="_blank"> Cary Counseling Center</a> in Cary, NC and the <a title="Oriental Counseling Center" href="http://www.counselingnewbern.com/" target="_blank">Oriental Counseling Center</a> in New Bern, NC. From the nearby town of Oriental, NC, Bryce and his wife, Helen, run a company called <a title="Love Odyssey Charters" href="www.loveodyssey.net" target="_blank">Love Odyssey Charters</a> in which they take one couple at a time on a week-long cruise to different ports of call along the rivers and sounds of North Carolina. While cruising with each couple, Bryce and Helen intensely coach the couple on how to save their troubled marriage. To find out more about Bryce Kaye and Love Odyssey Charters you can visit their <a title="Love Odyssey Charters" href="www.loveodyssey.net" target="_blank">website</a> or call 919-460-2516 for more information or to make your reservation.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Does your spouse’s mid-life crisis mean the end of your marriage? A motorcycle, a bright red convertible, or maybe a new young girlfriend; all of these just scream mid-life crisis.

		<itunes:summary>Does your spouse’s mid-life crisis mean the end of your marriage? A motorcycle, a bright red convertible, or maybe a new young girlfriend; all of these just scream mid-life crisis. We seem to be able to recognize the obvious signs of a mid-life crisis but how do we handle a situation like this? In a marriage, a mid-life crisis is never a stage that affects only one person.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Is your spouse having an affair with their co-worker? They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, but does it really?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Ever feel like your spouse isn’t listening? Some people think that dating and getting to know someone can be the hardest part of a relationship. It requires a great amount of effort on both parts to keep things progressing. However, the hardest part of a relationship is actually the stage that most largely encapsulates a relationship, the “comfortable phase”. We know our partner so well we could tell you their schedule without hesitation. We know all of their stories and have heard all of their jokes. It’s at this point in a relationship that a lot of people tend to tune the other spouse out and begin navigating on autopilot. This lack of effort can lead to feelings of disconnection with your spouse. Our guest today believes that mindfulness is what can will help to keep your relationship fresh and to keep you heard.</p>
<p>Dr. Jessica Barry of <a href="http://www.wynnsfamilypsychology.com">Wynns Family Psychology</a> in Cary, NC joins us today. Jessica earned her doctorate in Clinical Psychology from Argosy University in Washington D.C. Jessica predominantly works with children, teens, couples and families that have difficulty coping with a wide range of social, emotional and behavioral issues. Jessica’s doctoral dissertation, which will prove especially useful today, was written about the use of Mindfulness techniques. When Jessica isn’t busy working with couples she enjoys spending time hiking, drawing, and cooking with her fiancé. To find out more about Dr. Jessica Barry you can visit the <a href="http://www.wynnsfamilypsychology.com">Wynns Family Psychology website</a> or call 919-467-7777 for an appointment.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Are baby blues hurting your family and spouse? Some of us have spent our entire lives dreaming of what life would be like once we were all grown up. We planned out our weddings, our ideal mates, and our perfect nuclear family with 2.5 children. It is when life does not go exactly according to plan that we begin to panic and loose control of our lives. Childbirth can be one of those hazy moments in life. We plan for months about a new addition to the family, but once we welcome this new little bundle into the world, life doesn’t always become the sunshine-filled dream we expected.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Are baby blues hurting your family and spouse? Some of us have spent our entire lives dreaming of what life would be like once we were all grown up. We planned out our weddings, our ideal mates, and our perfect nuclear family with 2.5 children. It is when life does not go exactly according to plan that we begin to panic and loose control of our lives. Childbirth can be one of those hazy moments in life. We plan for months about a new addition to the family, but once we welcome this new little bundle into the world, life doesn’t always become the sunshine-filled dream we expected.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Is your friendship with your child hurting your marriage? Only a few shorts years ago, or so it seems, we were all children ourselves; laughing and playing with our friends, disobeying our parents, and tormenting the family pet. Before we knew it we were adults who were getting married and having children of our own. When time seems to fly and get away from us, we often forget that we, ourselves, are not children anymore. This can be especially hard when dealing with our own children and a parent’s natural desire for acceptance and love. Sometimes it may seem that the easiest path is to be a friend, rather than a parent but these actions could be harming your marriage.</p>
<p>To give us more insight into the situation we have Dr. Laura Green of <a href="http://www.wynnsfamiliypsychology.com">Wynns Family Psychology</a> in Cary, NC.  Dr. Greene specializes in child and family therapy and child evaluations. Before joining Wynns Family Psychology, Dr. Greene received her Bachelor’s degree from The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, MA and her Master’s and Doctorate degrees in Psychology from Rutgers University in New Brunswick, NJ. She has worked in a variety of settings, ranging from outpatient mental health centers to school systems.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>“Relationships aren’t destroyed by cataclysmic arguments. They are eroded by the little things that happen over time. We’re all excited when a relationship starts. We watch what we do. We edit our actions and mind our words. We gloss over the details because we love the dream of what could be. We sacrifice the now for what we want in the future. As our relationship grows, we get comfortable. We stop editing ourselves and return to our old habits&#8230; Respect is eroded through the forgetful actions that make you feel as if you don’t matter like you once did…. Yes, relationships usually end in cataclysmic fight, but that is not where they are torn apart”. This insider view of the deterioration of a relationship comes from author Jeff Cannon who believes that meditation is the solution to resolving this age-old dilemma.</p>
<p>Jeff Cannon is the author of the book <a href="http://simple-truth.com/"><em><em>The Simple Truth: Meditation and Minfulness for the Modern World</em></em></a>. Jeff was a fast-track entrepreneur with a portfolio of successful businesses, multiple book publishings, produced documentaries and ran his own public relations agency. Then it all came to a crashing halt at the end of 2009. That day he woke up on a hospital bed recovering from a ten-hour surgery that removed six of seven brain tumors. A long time devotee of the marital arts and yoga, Jeff used meditation to reboot and retrain his brain. He learned firsthand how the brain is hard wired just as it had been 40,000 years ago. More important he learned how it could be reprogrammed through such practices as meditation and mindfulness. Jeff&#8217;s book is now available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Simple-Truth-Meditation-Mindfulness-Modern/dp/061556268X">Amazon.com</a>.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Are your diverse parenting styles breaking apart your marriage? Being part of a couple and getting married can be a very difficult process. You have two people from different backgrounds and lifestyles, coming together to start their life together. Their differences in opinion and lifestyle can be a relationship hot spot for conflict. Things tend to get even more complicated when children are brought into the picture. Although we love our children, all parents have different ideas for how they want to raise and discipline their children. Whether our preferences came from personal experience or gained knowledge, each parent may have a different idea for what it means to bring up their children. Dr. Kristen Wynns believes that it is not about how your raise your children, but that you do it together as a team.</p>
<p>Dr. Wynns is a child and adolescent psychologist who owns a specialty practice in Cary, NC called Wynns Family Psychology. She has a Ph.D. and Master’s in Clinical Psychology from UNC Greensboro. Dr. Wynns recently debuted a new parenting website called <a href="http://www.nowimpyparenting.com">No Wimpy Parenting</a> with services available to help parents struggling with behavior and discipline problems at home. To find out more about Dr. Kristen Wynns you can visit the <a href="http://www.wynnsfamilypsychology.com">Wynns Family Psychology</a> website or call 919-467-7777 for an appointment.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Are your diverse parenting styles breaking apart your marriage? Being part of a couple and getting married can be a very difficult process. You have two people from different backgrounds and lifestyles, coming together to start their life together. Their differences in opinion and lifestyle can be a relationship hot spot for conflict. Things tend to get even more complicated when children are brought into the picture. Although we love our children, all parents have different ideas for how they want to raise and discipline their children. Whether our preferences came from personal experience or gained knowledge, each parent may have a different idea for what it means to bring up their children. Dr. Kristen Wynns believes that it is not about how your raise your children, but that you do it together as a team.

Dr. Wynns is a child and adolescent psychologist who owns a specialty practice in Cary, NC called Wynns Family Psychology. She has a Ph.D. and Master’s in Clinical Psychology from UNC Greensboro. Dr. Wynns recently debuted a new parenting website called No Wimpy Parenting with services available to help parents struggling with behavior and discipline problems at home. To find out more about Dr. Kristen Wynns you can visit the Wynns Family Psychology website or call 919-467-7777 for an appointment.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Are you the outcast in your stepfamily? Dating and marriage is a process that is complicated enough on it’s own, never mind coming into a family that has already been established. Marrying someone with children from a previous relationship can be a delicate mind field that requires a certain finesse to master.</p>
<p>Certified Master Stepfamily Coach, Claudette Chenevert, found herself in a similar situation over twenty years ago when she, a single mom to a 6 year old boy, married her husband. She became a stepmom to two girls. After several years worth of failures and successes Claudette was able to determine what steps needed to be taken to successfully integrate oneself into an established family and make it function on its own. From the constant presence of an ex to taking on a parenting role over night, Claudette knows how to handle it all. To find out more about Claudette or her approach, you can visit her <a href="http://www.stepmomcoach.com">Stepmom Coach</a> website.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Are your actions as a parent sabotaging your child and spouse for life? Dr. Mike Daniels joins us to discuss the new phenomena of “teacup parenting”. We do our best to make sure that we raise our children to be responsible young adults. We nurture and care for them the best that we know how. However, there is a fine line between parenting and obsession. It seems that there are parents today who have too active a role in their childrens life that it is actually stunting the social, intellectual, and emotional growth of the child, not to mention sabotaging the romantic relationships in a parent’s life.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>They say that hindsight is 20/20. We often never see the real problems in a relationship until after they have exploded. With couples divorcing at an alarming rate, it may be time to call on a new relationship expert- someone who deals with divorce. There is no better way to learn than from your mistakes; or even better, the mistakes of others. Judge Lynn Toler has worked with divorcing couples for years. She has seen couples at their worst and has been able to use this experience for the good of all relationships.</p>
<p>Judge Lynn Toler is a graduate of Harvard University and The University of Pennsylvania Law School. She has elected and served as judge on the Cleveland Heights Municipal Court. Lynn has hosted such shows as <em>Power of Attorney, <a href="http://www.divorcecourt.com/">Divorce Court</a>, </em>and <em><a href="http://www.hulu.com/decision-house">Decision House</a>. </em>Lynn is also a frequent guest on the NPR show <a href="http://www.npr.org/search/index.php?programId=11&amp;prgTitle=News+%26+Notes+&amp;searchinput=lynn+toler"><em>News and Notes</em></a>. With all of this going on, Lynn has somehow managed to write two books. Her first, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/My-Mothers-Rules-Practical-Emotional/dp/1932841229"><em>My Mother’s Rules: A Practical Guide to Becoming an Emotional Genius</em></a>, as well as <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Put-Writing-Creating-Agreements-Between/dp/1402758707">Put It In Writing</a>, </em>a book that gives readers concrete, conflict-free solutions to difficult situations that arise.  To find out more about Lynn, please visit <a href="http://www.judgelynn.com">www.JudgeLynn.com</a>. You can catch Judge Lynn in action on <a href="http://www.divorcecourt.com">Divorce Court</a>, airing weekdays in syndication nationwide.

		<itunes:summary>They say that hindsight is 20/20. We often never see the real problems in a relationship until after they have exploded. With couples divorcing at an alarming rate, it may be time to call on a new relationship expert- someone who deals with divorce. There is no better way to learn than from your mistakes; or even better, the mistakes of others. Judge Lynn Toler has worked with divorcing couples for years. She has seen couples at their worst and has been able to use this experience for the good of all relationships.

Judge Lynn Toler is a graduate of Harvard University and The University of Pennsylvania Law School. She has elected and served as judge on the Cleveland Heights Municipal Court. Lynn has hosted such shows as Power of Attorney, Divorce Court, and Decision House. Lynn is also a frequent guest on the NPR show News and Notes. With all of this going on, Lynn has somehow managed to write two books. Her first, My Mother’s Rules: A Practical Guide to Becoming an Emotional Genius, as well as Put It In Writing, a book that gives readers concrete, conflict-free solutions to difficult situations that arise.  To find out more about Lynn, please visit www.JudgeLynn.com. You can catch Judge Lynn in action on Divorce Court, airing weekdays in syndication nationwide. To find out where to watch, check your local listings or go to www.divorcecourt.com.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It is possible that the expression “opposites attract” could be as old as the concept of dating itself. We hear stories of good girls going for the bad guys, or a tight laced accountant falling for an outgoing actress. In these relationships there seems to be a balance between the two personalities that makes the relationship harmonious. This sensitive balance, if disturbed, could mean terrible things for a relationship. Relationship therapist Dr. Stephen Betchen joins us to discuss how keeping a balance of conflict between partners is the key to happy and healthy relationship.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Do you ever feel like there are not enough hours in the day? Sure, we all say this, but it seems with each passing day our plates are loaded with more and more activities that we have to try and cram in. Remember the good ole&#8217; days where you had time to go out to a nice dinner date with your loved one? Those were the days pre-children. Once children came into the picture, time seemed to fast-forward. We no longer had time for ourselves, let alone our spouse. All too often this is an issue that plagues many couples. The romance and marital bliss seem to deteriorate once children enter the equation. However, according to Dr. Julia Jacobs, this does not have to the be the case.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It takes a lot of moving pieces to make a relationship work; such as patience and compromise. However, perhaps the most important element to any relationship is trust. Without trust a relationship can become stunted from growth. When trust is taken away from a relationship, it can crumble on it&#8217;s very foundation. Trust is one of the hardest items to attain and even more difficult to earn back once it is lost.</p>
<p>Dr. Abigail Hirsch, an accomplished scholar of such prestigious academic institutions as Harvard, University of Colorado, and University of Massachusetts,  joins us to discuss how to put trust back into your relationship.

The results from her online counseling service,<a href="http://poweroftwomarriage.com/"> Power of Two</a>, have been so successful that the project has received a $2.5 million federal grant dollars.

<p>Dr. Molly Parks returns to the show to examine what some of the common triggers are for affairs, what kind of specific impact that usually has for each spouse, and what good, if any, can come to couples who choose to deal with the issues and work through an affair.</p>
<p>Molly has over a decade of experience helping both adults and children deal with emotionally challenging issues ranging from social isolation and relationship issues to PTSD and trauma victims.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Are money issues making you feel like your marriage is bankrupt? Money issues pop up in every marriage at some point and when the economy is in a recession, these problems are intensified.</p>
<p>Many people expect their spouses to have exactly the same view of spending and finances and have difficulty accepting the differences in their spouse&#8217;s approach to the bank account. Dr. Nicole Imbraguglio joins us to discuss what factors cause issues with most couples and why they create problems regardless of how comfortable a family is financially.</p>
<p>Dr. Imbraguglio practices with Lepage Associates in Durham, NC and helps both adults and children with a wide range of emotional issues. She has provided counseling for individuals, groups, couples, and families. You can learn more about Nicole at <a href="http://www.lepageassociates.com">LepageAssociates.com</a>, or by calling 919.572.0000</p>

		<itunes:summary>Are money issues making you feel like your marriage is bankrupt? Money issues pop up in every marriage at some point and when the economy is in a recession, these problems are intensified.

Many people expect their spouses to have exactly the same view of spending and finances and have difficulty accepting the differences in their spouse's approach to the bank account. Dr. Nicole Imbraguglio joins us to discuss what factors cause issues with most couples and why they create problems regardless of how comfortable a family is financially.

Dr. Imbraguglio practices with Lepage Associates in Durham, NC and helps both adults and children with a wide range of emotional issues. She has provided counseling for individuals, groups, couples, and families. You can learn more about Nicole at LepageAssociates.com, or by calling 919.572.0000</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Are the unresolved conflicts in your marriage less about an unwillingness to compromise and more about the differences in your families of origin and how you were raised? Is the all too common reaction of assuming that our own approach is right, so our spouse must be wrong making the rift bigger? Marilyn Harding joins us to take a look at what kinds of common arguments are likely caused simply by differences in expectations of how the family should operate and how to manage these differences constructively.</p>
<p>Marilyn Harding has been providing counseling services to the triangle for 20 years and holds specialized training in sex therapy and crisis and trauma therapy, as well as serving on the National Response Team for the American Association of Christian Counselors.

Marilyn Harding joins us to take a look at what kinds of common arguments are likely caused simply by differences in expectations of how the family should operate and how to manage these differences constructively.
