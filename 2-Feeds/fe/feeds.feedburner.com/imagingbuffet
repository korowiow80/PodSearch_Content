<p><span>The New York Photo Festival (NYPH &#8216;12) officially starts today in DUMBO, Brooklyn, NYC. I&#8217;ve attended the event a few times over the last four years and have always enjoyed it. The sheer number of exhibitions in the area, live presentations on big and small screens, and opportunities to meet other artists is incredible. Whether you are a collector, aspiring or established fine-art photographer or just someone who just loves to see what people are creating with their imagery, I would recommend visiting. For more information and schedules, visit: <a rel="nofollow nofollow" href="http://nyph.at/explore" target="_blank">http://nyph.at/explore</a></span></p>
<p><span>The powerHouse Arena is always an incredible place to browse books on many topics. In fact, it&#8217;s worth a trip to DUMBO any time in my opinion.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For more than two years I&#8217;ve been teaching photographers and other artists how to get the most from Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, including editing, organizing, presenting and printing images using the application. It&#8217;s a very powerful tool, but it definitely takes time to learn, and Lightroom 4 brings with it many new features and a new processing engine.</p>
<p>In the upcoming weeks and months I will be teaching some Lightroom workshops in New Jersey. Here are some details and a link to more info on one of them. I will post information on some others as they get closer (<a href="http://www.imagingbuffet.com/workshops" target="_blank">my workshop/events page will generally have all of them listed</a>):</p>
<p><strong>Class Title: LIGHTROOM 4 WORKFLOWS: How to Organize, Retouch and Print Your Images</strong></p>
<p>Location: duCret School of Art, Plainfield, NJ</p>
<p>Date: Sat. April 7, 2012<br />
Time: 10AM-2PM</p>
<p>Fee: $50 ($39 for those who register by April 4)</p>
<p>A full description and online registration information is available here: <a href="http://lr47.eventbrite.com/ " target="_blank">http://lr47.eventbrite.com/</a></p>
<div id="attachment_1721" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 451px"><img class="size-full wp-image-1721  " title="darlowworkshopm1" src="http://imagingbuffet.com/http://www.imagingbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/darlowworkshopm1.jpg" alt="darlowworkshopm1" width="441" height="298" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Andrew Darlow conducting a Lightroom workshop in Princeton, NJ</p></div>
<p>To show an example of what I&#8217;ll be covering, this particular image will be shown step-by-step from raw capture to the final edited image. I think it shows what&#8217;s possible when you use Lightroom&#8217;s Develop Module to recover highlight data and use the application&#8217;s selective adjustment options:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many (including me) have been anticipating the release of Photoshop CS6, and it has officially arrived as Photoshop CS6 Beta. That means you can download it for free<a href="http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/photoshopcs6.html" target="_blank"> from this link on Adobe&#8217;s website</a> (the download is 984 MB for the Mac OS, and 1.7 GB for Windows). There are quite a few new features, as well as a new interface (that came as quite a surprise to me, and I&#8217;m slowly getting used to it). This important note about the Beta from Adobe&#8217;s site is worth highlighting:</p>
<blockquote><p><span>Photoshop CS6 beta includes all the features in Photoshop CS6 and Photoshop CS6 Extended. Take this opportunity to try out the 3D image editing and quantitative image analysis capabilities of Photoshop Extended*, but note that—while these features will be included in the shipping version of Photoshop CS6 Extended—they will not be included in the shipping version of Photoshop CS6.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span>Until I have more time with the Beta, I thought I&#8217;d share some impressive videos and helpful links to more information about it. First, below is a fantastic 10 minute video by Russell Brown of Adobe, who covers six new features of PSCS6:</span></p>
<p><iframe width="490" height="279" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/PTYcRWPsZUg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Next, <a href="http://www.photoshopcafe.com/cs6/index.htm" target="_blank">is this page with great information (including videos and screen shots) </a>on Photoshop CS6 Beta by Colin Smith of PhotoshopCAFE.</p>
<p>And last for now is <a href="http://www.photoshopuser.com/cs6">NAPP&#8217;s excellent coverage of Photoshop CS6 Beta (free for members or non-members of NAPP)</a>:</p>
<p>What surprised me most about Photoshop CS6 Beta? The video capabilities. Russell Brown&#8217;s video shows a quick overview, and I&#8217;m guessing you&#8217;ll be surprised as well when you see what&#8217;s inside. </p>
<p>And while you&#8217;re learning more about Photoshop, I have a number of Lightroom 4-related workshops coming soon in New Jersey and New York City. Links for full descriptions and registration information can be found below:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After yesterday&#8217;s post about Lightroom 3 being sold at Adorama.com for $79, I was surprised to see that today only (Wed. 2/15/2012), B&amp;H is selling the same full version of Lightroom 3 for about $10 less, or $69.95. If you were thinking of purchasing Lightroom, and if you don&#8217;t already own a full version of Lightroom, this is a great way to own a full version so that you can purchase an upgrade to Lightroom 4 when it ships (if you decide to upgrade).</p>
<p>To visit the page on bhphotovideo.com with the $69.95 offer, <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/720705-REG/Adobe_65081059_Photoshop_Lightroom_3_Software.html/BI/2160/KBID/2893" target="_blank">Visit This Page</a>.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just came across this offer and wanted to share it with you. Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 (Full Edition, not the Student/Teacher Edition) is available today only (2/14/2012) for $79 <a href="http://www.adorama.com/ABLRV3MWE.html?utm_term=Other&amp;utm_medium=Affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=Other&amp;utm_source=rflaid62748" target="_blank">at Adorama.com</a>. Lightroom 4 will probably be released sometime in the upcoming 8 weeks or so, but if you don&#8217;t have a full edition, you will need to pay for a full version. I assume any full edition of Lightroom to date (LR1, LR2 or LR3) will be eligible for the upgrade price, but I don&#8217;t know that for a fact. Having a full edition allows you to upgrade for less than the application&#8217;s retail price. In the past (as shown in the screen shot below from the Adobe Store), the upgrade from LR1 to LR3 and LR2 to LR3 has been $99 (it may be less elsewhere). It is both Mac and Windows compatible.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello! This quick note is to let you know that some spaces are still available for my full day color management and fine-art printing workshop being held this Saturday 1/28/2012 at Calumet Photographic in New York City. In addition to a full day of color management and printing information, I will be showing more than 30 different fine-art paper types, as well as some metal prints.</p>
<p>The first 12 people to register will also have a print prepped and printed by me on a fine art paper of your choice. Below are two testimonials from recent attendees of the same workshop at Calumet Photo:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Andrew gave a clear and detailed overview of printers, inks and most importantly settings that control the final quality of the prints.  I love knowing that there is such a vast range of papers to choose from and how to get the best results from them. I stayed up quite late last night experimenting with the settings discussed in the class and I ended up with a print that I am pleased with! This is great, thanks so much for unlocking this mystery! The workshop more than exceeded my expectations.&#8221; </em> - Polly W.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I am a platinum printer with the need to make enlarged digital negatives and have been contracting this work out because even though I have followed the various blogs, I didn&#8217;t understand the requirements of what it means to be a digital printer.  Andrew&#8217;s class gave me the framework to understand the process.  He discussed the various options for hardware (equipment AND papers) and software from an unbiased, user viewpoint. This is VERY important.  The week before I took Andrew&#8217;s class I went to the NY PhotoPlus Expo hoping to get a handle on my digital printing questions by talking to the various company reps and came away even more confused! </em></p>
<p><em>Andrew clarified all the sales hype and in a very straight forward manner showed what is needed to make great digital prints.  Using participant&#8217;s digital files, he printed the images on various papers demonstrating the strengths of each and he also demonstrated the power of using Photoshop in such a clear manner that it is no longer a scary, black box, but a tool to be used. I highly recommend this class for anyone wishing to make digital photographs, and for experienced digital printers who wish to make better digital photographs.&#8221; </em> -Lyle Allan</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.andrewdarlow.com/DarlowCart4.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="346" /></p>
<div><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>About this image: While looking through my collection of photos from 2011, I thought that this one would be appropriate. I was in New York City one day and drove by a few carriages parked on the side of the street. After being very impressed by this one in particular, I decided to park for a moment and capture what I saw through my rain-drenched window. I think the photo represents many of my thoughts on 2011: It was a bright and colorful year, with some tears mixed in. </em>Photo © Andrew Darlow</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br />
</span></div>
<div>2011 was quite a year. As I look back at 2011, here are a few things that come to mind both personally and professionally (I apologize in advance if you receive this note twice-you may if you receive my newsletter and blog post updates )</div>
<p></p>
<div>1. Throughout 2011 I was fortunate to have conducted many lectures and workshops, sharing my images, experiences and tips with people of all ages and skill levels on the subjects of photography, printing, Lightroom, Photoshop, etc., in settings that included public libraries, camera club meetings, radio, online podcasts and international trade shows.</div>
<p></p>
<div>2. In 2011 I also photographed many families and their pets, which is a real joy (especially when I receive wonderful feedback about what the photos mean to them).</div>
<p></p>
<div>3. Throughout the year I also wrote many articles, including buyers&#8217; guides for various inkjet printer categories. You can read five of the articles here: <a href="http://photo.net/photodb/user?user_id=1541375" target="_blank">http://photo.net/photodb/user?user_id=1541375</a> . I&#8217;m happy that after spending many hours testing and using different printers, I&#8217;m able to help people choose the right printer for their home, studio or office.</div>
<p></p>
<div>4. In 2011 I also conducted many private consultation sessions, in person and via phone and internet. It is very rewarding to be able to help people solve long-standing problems, including helping them organize their images, find new and better quality papers, get their screens and printers to closely match, etc.</div>
<p></p>
<div>5. A close family member had some serious health issues in 2011, but thankfully, things have improved dramatically, and every moment I have a chance to spend with this important person in my life is even more special.</div>
<p></p>
<div>6. In July, 2011 I had a solo exhibition of my work in New York City. The work is entitled GRANDmarks - NYC, and you can see an installation photo and a photo from the opening here: <a href="http://imagingbuffet.com/2011/07/25/free-lecture-and-exhibition-tour-of-grandmarks-nyc-7272011/" target="_blank">http://imagingbuffet.com/2011/07/25/free-lecture-and-exhibition-tour-of-grandmarks-nyc-7272011/</a></div>
<div>Most of the images, as well as some photos from the first exhibition of the work from 2009 can be viewed on this page: <a href="http://www.andrewdarlow.com/GrandMarks6" target="_blank">http://www.andrewdarlow.com/GrandMarks6</a> .</div>
<p></p>
<div>7. In 2011 I also had the honor of curating a solo exhibition of photographs from China by my friend Ron Wyatt. To see some of the photos from the show, visit this page: <a href="http://www.ronwyattphotos.com/#/ron-wyatts-china/RonWyattPoster" target="_blank">http://www.ronwyattphotos.com/#/ron-wyatts-china/RonWyattPoster</a></div>
<p></p>
<div><strong>Some Lightroom Tips &amp; Info</strong></div>
<div>Much of my private consulting and many of my workshops this year, including one at the PhotoPlus Expo in New York City, were related in some way to Adobe Photoshop Lightoom. I use the program extensively, and I thought I&#8217;d share some links to Lightroom resources for those who use the software or who are thinking of testing it out:</div>

<p></p>
<div><strong>Closing Thoughts on 2011</strong></div>
<div>On a more somber note, my sincere condolences go out to all those who lost their lives in 2011. Due to my time spent in Japan as an exchange student just after high school and during college, I feel a particular connection to the people of Japan, who suffered greatly after the earthquake and tsunami in March of 2011. The country appears to be recovering well, and I hope for the best as the months and years progress.</div>
<p></p>
<div>All the best for a Happy and Healthy 2012!</div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the PhotoPlus Expo 2011 in New York City, I had an opportunity to sit down with Paul Pierson of the Carbone Smolan Agency (CSA) to learn about a new iOS app on which his company is working. It&#8217;s called Canon Idea Mine, and according to the company, &#8220;it was developed through CSA’s extensive research and interviews with dozens of notable photographers. By working closely with Canon, CSA built a versatile tool that’s fine-tuned to the way real artists create amazing images. Through this app and its Digital Learning Center, Canon is building on its role as a dedicated partner for photographers along every step of their creative process.&#8221;</p>
<p>If I were to summarize what the app does, it helps to expand one&#8217;s ideas for what to photograph by suggesting a variety of specific criteria, such as a place, as well as other content, such as one or more feelings (<em>energetic</em> is one feeling that you&#8217;ll see in the screen shots below). Paul Pierson explains the app in more detail: “By incorporating just the right amount of randomness, CSA’s goal was to help photographers evolve and expand their ideas. If you’re stuck, the app can generate billions of unique image concepts from scratch in just two taps. We think this tool will help today’s photographers, who are now expected to conceive ideas, not just execute. It’s a serious tool in a fun and distinctive package.”</p>
<p>During a hands-on demo, I was impressed by the way in which the app guides you through the criteria, resulting in a beautiful graphic using black and red text, as well as some graphics. Now that I look more closely at the screen shots and other materials, I realize that the inspiration for the graphics came from Canon&#8217;s L-series lenses, which is very cool (almost as inventive as those Canon L-series lens mugs!).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure when the app will be available for download, but I&#8217;ll announce it on my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/andrewdarlow" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/andrewdarlow" target="_blank">my Twitter feed </a>when I find out.</p>

It&#8217;s on the same floor as the exhibition I recently curated by Ron Wyatt, entitled <em>Ron Wyatt&#8217;s China</em>. In addition to a full day of color management and printing information, I will be showing more than 30 different fine-art paper types, as well as some metal prints.</p>
<p>The first 12 people to register will also have a print prepped and printed by me on a fine art paper of your choice. One of the printers I&#8217;ll be using for the workshop is the Epson Stylus Pro 3880. <a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/inkjet-printing-and-color-management-using-photoshop-with-andrew-darlow/event-summary-76357d2d468b420692f552c303491e05.aspx" target="_blank">For more information or to register, visit this page.</a></p>
<p>If you are not planning to attend the workshop, you may still want to stop by on Saturday 11/5 or Sunday 11/6. Ron Wyatt will be answering questions and doing free 30 minute tours of the current show on exhibit at 11am, 1pm, 2pm and 3pm (no registration is necessary). There are 31 prints total in the show, including 11 framed prints from the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For more than 20 years I&#8217;ve looked forward to late October in New York City. Not only is the weather often fantastic, it&#8217;s the time of year that the PhotoPlus Expo is held. And this year, they&#8217;ve upped the ante by adding a number of new events, including the inaugural WPPI 2011, which features a full day of educational seminars on Wednesday, October 26, 2011. The WPPI NYC show will be followed by the PhotoPlus International Conference + Expo from October 27-29, 2011. <a href="http://www.photoplusexpo.com/expo-events/why-attend" target="_blank">This page has an excellent overview of the events</a>, including information about a Wednesday evening &#8220;Test Drive Rally,&#8221; and a Friday night Bash and Benefit For Japan Relief. Registration for WPPI 2011 costs $99 for those who register by October 25, 2011 (on-site registration will be $150). For more information or to register, <a href="http://www.photoplusexpo.com/" target="_blank">visit this page</a>.</p>

<p>Last year I wrote an article entitled: <em>10 Tips for Navigating the PhotoPlus Expo in New York City, </em><a href="http://www.pixiq.com/article/10-tips-for-navigating-the-photoplus-expo-in-new-york-city" target="_blank">which you can find here</a>. With the exception of some specific events that I mentioned from last year&#8217;s show (and booth numbers from last year), the information still applies.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also very happy to be speaking again at the PhotoPlus Expo 2011. My seminar, entitled <em>Lightroom Power Printing: Tips for Getting the Most from Lightroom&#8217;s Printing Capabilities,</em> is on Thursday, October 27 from 3:30-5:30PM. During the seminar, I&#8217;ll be sharing a lot of the techniques I use to prepare, proof and make final prints using Lightroom, whether outputting to inkjet printers or photo labs. A two-and-a-half minute video promo of my seminar <a href="http://vimeo.com/30108369" target="_blank">can be seen here</a>, and to go directly to the registration page and a full description of the seminar, <a href="http://n2a.goexposoftware.com/events/pp2011/goExpo/user/listSeminars.php?ff_form_refresh=&amp;categories=&amp;location=&amp;filter_3=&amp;filter_4=&amp;filter_5=&amp;new=&amp;date=&amp;type=&amp;track=&amp;speakers=Andrew+Darlow&amp;filter_1=&amp;filter_2=&amp;search_str=" target="_blank">visit this page</a>.</p>
<p>I hope to see some ImagingBuffet readers there! If you see me on the show floor, drooling over the latest lighting gear, lenses, etc., please say hi!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned <a href="http://imagingbuffet.com/2011/10/12/upcoming-world-photography-in-nyc-an-exclusive-interview-and-a-contest-for-imagingbuffetcom-readers/" target="_blank">in my last article on The Imaging Buffet</a>, I recently had the opportunity to interview award-winning photojournalist and &#8220;reportage artist&#8221; Jez Coulson. Coulson is one of the instructors for the three day &#8220;City Project&#8221; workshops happening as part of a series of events sponsored by the WPO (World Photography Organisation). We did the interview via e-mail, which, as you&#8217;ll see, allows Jez to share his thoughts and comments in a style that he also uses on his extremely popular blog, <a href="http://www.jezblog.com" target="_blank">jezblog.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Darlow:</strong> <strong>Your upcoming City Project focuses on New York Diners. What are a few things people can do to prepare themselves (mentally, physically and equipment-wise) for the City Project workshop, a similar workshop, or even a &#8220;Photo Walk&#8221;?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jez Coulson:</strong> Well I think anyone attending a photography workshop&#8230;&#8230;.  but especially one led by me, should be ready to have fun&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;  but also be ready to work really hard&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; it&#8217;s a chance to try to do something really &#8220;lifted&#8221; and come away exhilarated by having made fantastic pictures. Consequently it&#8217;s good to be in a place where you are feeling energized and ready to roll. It&#8217;s also good to be feeling ready to interact with others&#8230;&#8230;.  as reportage photography often needs a little rapport with the general public.</p>
<p>You will need a reasonable digital camera. I myself always use two SLR&#8217;s when I am shooting&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.  one with a long zoom one with a shorter zoom&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. this in my view is the best way to work&#8230;&#8230;. but it&#8217;s by no means essential&#8230;&#8230;.. one camera ideally with a couple of lenses or just one reasonable zoom would be fine&#8230;&#8230; someone was asking if they could do it with their iPhone camera&#8230;&#8230;.. it could be done&#8230;&#8230; you would still learn and have fun  &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.  but I feel you will probably get more out of it &#8230;&#8230;.  if you have a slightly better rig&#8230;&#8230;.  ideally something you can control a little&#8230;&#8230;  like a classic SLR.</p>
<p>It is also good to have a good number of digital camera cards…&#8230;. so that you can really shoot and not be constrained by the amount of digital information you can write to your cards.  If I am shooting all day, it is not unusual for me to shoot 3 or 4 thousand pictures&#8230;&#8230;.. or more. I often emphasize the importance of good clothing when out shooting &#8230;&#8230;. for me reasonable rain protection is part of my essential equipment&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;  If it rains I want to carry on shooting&#8230;&#8230;.. I know I have often shot fantastic pictures in the rain when I know most people would have  gone home :-))</p>
<p>But equally, you do not want to be bulked down with things to carry&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;  so it&#8217;s essential to remain mobile without stuff to carry in hand bags&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.  as your hands must be free&#8230;&#8230; and you must be able to move about freely. I have, as part of my shooting kit, small umbrellas and rain jackets that I wear in a belt bag/ fanny-pack/bum-bag arrangement&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;  so if it does not rain you don&#8217;t need to hold coats or wear them if it&#8217;s too hot&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. I have rain covers for my cameras too&#8230;&#8230;. for me they are essential&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..  in torrential rain I always want to shoot&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;  these covers are great things&#8230;&#8230;..  but entirely optional on this workshop (certainly not a requirement).</p>

<p><strong>AD:</strong> <strong>I was especially drawn to the photos in which you&#8217;ve employed the use of shallow depth of field and motion techniques (located in the inspiration gallery for the workshop, as well as your photos on insight-visual.com). Is there a specific way in which you like to teach either of these concepts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> I do a lot of things that a classic photography text book will tell you not to do. I will make sure everyone understands what are more normally accepted parameters as a starter. But as I shoot totally wide open (aperture at widest setting, often f/2.8), I also often shoot hand held at very slow shutter speeds (Shutter speeds of say 1/8th sec., for example) . I will talk to people in the workshop about the risks of this and the potential pit falls&#8230;&#8230;.. but also the sometimes amazing images that can be achieved by doing this&#8230;&#8230;. I will be showing them how I do it&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; there are useful tricks to some of this&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.  and I will encourage attendees to be brave&#8230;..  to attempt things that may not work&#8230;&#8230; but equally might be amazing&#8230;&#8230; I will get people to aim to be successful at things they may not have attempted before in low light with movement, etc. This will be done through demonstration, and people trying the suggested methods.</p>
<p>In diners, there is often not tons of light as in many other urban situations &#8230;&#8230;. and I will not be emphasizing the use of photographic lights or strobe&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; so we will be exploring how to see and use the ambient light to best effect &#8230;&#8230;.. and combine that with raised ISO, wide aperture and low shutter speeds (all hand held). I will also cover how to steady a camera using supports like tables and chairs, and the stances to adopt, etc. &#8230;&#8230;.. these things are not rocket science&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;  but need a little instruction with practice and confidence in real situations to master them.</p>
<p><strong>AD: Can you talk a bit about the content of the 3-4 hour Masterclass on the first day?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> The Master Class will really look at my philosophy and practice as a photojournalist and reportage artist ……..  and the kind of stories that I am drawn to. This will take the form of looking at examples of my work, running through the stories and my approach. The human aspects of making the images. Both in terms of the concepts I am trying to illustrate and the emotions and physical realities involved for both the subjects and myself during the actual shooting process. I will talk at some length about the human aspects of interacting with others in a public space, plus being accepted with your cameras. I will run through the way I talked with and won the confidence of the subjects in certain pictures.</p>
<p>We will be looking at the resulting images in terms of the reaction of viewers at the end stage, and the how pictures can be displayed and used. I will help the photographers who take the course produce a range of images that would properly constitute a story submission for a magazine or other editorial outlet.</p>
<p>Putting to one side the vitally important human skills and approach required by photojournalists, I will also run through the images in terms of how they are achieved in the camera. The camera techniques&#8230;&#8230;.the settings&#8230;&#8230;. the forethought&#8230;&#8230;  I will analyze images in terms of why they work&#8230;&#8230; normally emphasizing the primacy of the composition &#8230;.. even in images that appear to be working by depicting all action or by demanding an emotional response. I will talk about how composition and ambient light are, for me, normally the primary consideration in approaching most photography (if you put aside human interaction considerations). Action and movement can be essential, but even then you cannot put aside considerations of light and composition, so these need to become almost second nature. We will discuss how to read and understand the composition and light that can be seen to work in existing images&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;  and how you can apply that knowledge of controlling composition and understanding light in photographs you are about to shoot.</p>
<p>We will also be looking at how photography meets the World Wide Web…… How photographers can be involved with social media and blogging to gain exposure and to be in contact with others for support and learning&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. and for those wishing to take it further, how to reach potential clients through digital projection and networking.</p>
<p>There will be a relatively small section on how one might become a freelance photojournalist and reportage artist in terms of the type of work a professional in these fields might undertake. The kind of clients and the type of jobs one might expect, especially given the demise of some of the classic photojournalism outlets.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> <strong>If one of your students had 10 minutes of time with a news magazine editor (in person or via e-mail/online), is there a specific way in which you would recommend he or she present a specific body of work for each situation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> If someone is approaching a news magazine editor&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; The most important thing is to make sure the work you are showing is specific to what the magazine is actually running&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. Picture Editors will be polite (normally) without waking up about images that are not specific to them. They will say nice things and you will never hear from them again&#8230;&#8230;. they will have forgotten your name by the time you are in the elevator&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. you must show them stuff specific to them&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; ideally you must show them stuff they actually want right now&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; if by the end they are ringing the features editor to say they have a fantastic set in that she must see, and is then introducing you, they have registered your presence&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>I know that sounds obvious&#8230;&#8230;.. but I have been asked to look at other photographers&#8217; work by the picture editor of certain magazines&#8230;&#8230;.  because after 30 seconds he knows his time is being wasted&#8230;&#8230; and the picture editor knows I will say nice positive things about where that folio should be shown&#8230;&#8230;..  or how a change could be introduced. If the magazine is unrelentingly positive and &#8216;up beat,&#8217; they do not want depressing stories&#8230;&#8230;.. If they only run color, they don&#8217;t want B&amp;W&#8230;&#8230;.. If they only run women&#8217;s issues, why are they looking at a set of men&#8217;s wrestling instead of a set of women&#8217;s wresting? &#8230;&#8230;. Again totally obvious but its amazing how this can be overlooked by some. If you do not have a set of pictures that could be bought by the magazine immediately&#8230;&#8230;. you must at least have an idea for one&#8230;&#8230;.. &#8220;Well you know you always run those engineering stories on the back 2 pages&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;. &#8220;I have access to the new dam project on the Hudson if you are interested in commissioning it I could&#8230;.blah blah&#8221; &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..  If you leave it to the Picture Editor to think of the stories&#8230;&#8230;..  he will give them to other photographers&#8230;&#8230; people who have already established a relationship with him&#8230;…. they will only give you a chance because you have already shot it &#8230;.. or you have an inside track on a story that is your idea.</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong> <strong>Can you share a favorite quote that might apply in some way to the workshop, or photography in general?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> My favorite quote is from Nelson Mandela. It&#8217;s not directly about photography&#8230;&#8230;. but it is indirectly &#8230;&#8230;. because it&#8217;s about a philosophy for living that suits me and my photography :-))</p>
<p><em>&#8220;For to be free is not merely to cast off one&#8217;s chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.&#8221;</em> -Nelson Mandela</p>
<p>One of my favorite photography related quotes comes from Richard Avedon &#8230;&#8230;.. it applies to this &#8220;Diner on the Edge of America&#8221; workshop, and to my whole life:</p>
<p><em>“If a day goes by without my doing something related to photography, it’s as though I’ve neglected something essential to my existence, as though I had forgotten to wake up.”</em> -Richard Avedon</p>
<p><strong>AD: Do you have any additional comments to share about the upcoming City Project workshops in New York ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> I am really excited about leading the WPO &#8220;Diners on the Edge of America&#8221; workshop. I enjoy so many aspects of New York City&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. and the classic Diners are one small, but fascinating aspect&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; I like to just be in them to grab breakfast &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; or sometimes lunch&#8230;..  or more often, a coffee and a meal in the middle of the night, having been out shooting on an assignment &#8230;&#8230;. and I never go in one of those places without taking a camera and shooting something &#8230;&#8230;.. either of the Diner and its staff and customers, or the scenes of the streets from inside&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. it&#8217;s a bit of an obsession&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; so I am looking forward to introducing others to the joy of this passion :-))</p>
<div><strong>AD:</strong> <strong>Do you have any comments to share about the upcoming City Projects in Chicago?<br />
</strong></div>
<p><strong>JC: </strong>I am totally delighted with the news that the buzz around this &#8220;Diner on the Edge of America&#8221; 3-day &#8220;City Project&#8221; workshop in New York City has been so great that the WPO have asked me to do another one in Chicago &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; of course I am thrilled&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; and it&#8217;s good news for a few friends of mine from that neck of the woods that follow my blog at www.jezblog.com too &#8230;&#8230;. they will be able to attend now&#8230;&#8230;. Having said they could not afford the travel costs to NYC from Chicago &#8230;&#8230;.. they had been asking if I was going to be doing one in Chicago&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; well now I am :-)) &#8230;&#8230; Yes, for me it&#8217;s fantastic news!! &#8230;&#8230;.. I have shot pictures in the diners of Chicago in the past &#8230;&#8230;. they are also just perfect for this &#8230;&#8230;. but I don&#8217;t go there everyday myself&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.  so it&#8217;s great to get more time to hang out and shoot in Chicago&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.  and have all the fun and excitement of another WPO Festival, and of leading another workshop.</p>
<p>For me, looking through a viewfinder is like entering another world, my world, and I would love others to come to these workshops and join me in my enthusiasm for a life in photography.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The World Photography Organisation (WPO) has a number of events planned in New York City in October and November, including an opening reception on Thursday, 10/13/2011 and a series of three-day workshops. After corresponding with a representative from the WPO, I was asked if I would like to interview any of the workshop leaders. I chose to ask Jez Coulson a few questions about his upcoming New York and Chicago workshops, as well as tips for becoming a more successful photographer, which you can read in a separate article to be published soon (update: <a href="http://imagingbuffet.com/2011/10/13/interview-with-photographer-and-wpo-city-projects-leader-jez-coulson/" target="_blank">the interview is available here</a>). I was also offered the opportunity to give away four workshops worth a total of about $1,000 to readers of ImagingBuffet.com, which I describe below.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1567" title="nyinvitewpo" src="http://imagingbuffet.com/http://www.imagingbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/nyinvitewpo.png" alt="nyinvitewpo" width="490" height="296" /></p>
<p><strong>World Photography Events and Opening Reception in New York City</strong></p>
<p>The World Photography Events will be taking place in New York from October 13-November 6, 2011. The events include an exhibition of photographs from the 2011 Sony World Photography Awards, a free Student Focus program, and other events. Opening night for the World Photography Events is Thursday, 10/13/2011 from 6-9 pm at the <a href="http://www.ChelseaArtMuseum.org" target="_blank">Chelsea Art Museum</a>, 556 W. 22nd St., NY NY. The event is free, but an RSVP is required for entry. To RSVP, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto: giulia@worldphoto.org" target="_blank">giulia@worldphoto.org</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1576" title="3up500" src="http://imagingbuffet.com/http://www.imagingbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/3up500.jpg" alt="3up500" width="490" height="154" /></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;City Project&#8221; Workshops</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, a series of three-day workshops will be offered in New York City under the title &#8220;City Projects.&#8221; This text from the WPO offers a good overview of the City Projects.</p>
<blockquote><p>The <strong>City Projects</strong> are the most exciting events on our New York programme, for budding and established photographers alike. These workshops will enable you to improve on your photographic skills and connect with other equally passionate photographers. You will also be given the unique opportunity to display and promote your work to a global audience.</p>
<p>The global theme is &#8216;Portraits of a City&#8217;, which over the year will see <strong>City Projects</strong> taking place in London, Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, San Francisco, Chicago, São Paulo, with plenty others to be announced throughout the year, see our <span><a href="http://www.worldphoto.org/festivals-events/city-projects/">City Projects page</a></span> to see if your City will be involved.</p>
<p>All the projects will culminate in an exciting exhibition of all participants work, &#8216;<em>Portraits of a City, a Mirror of the World</em>’, exhibited in London, April-May, 2012.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p><strong>City Projects Workshop Itinerary</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>Day 1: Introductory Seminar and Workshop - the technical bit! </strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">In a 3-4 hour masterclass, the workshop leader will deliver the brief to the participants. The workshop leader will then discuss technical and creative approaches, exploring lighting and composition, location scouting and subject matter.</span></p>
<p><strong>Day 2: Independent Shooting – the creative bit!</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">The participants will go solo and use the knowledge gained from the masterclass to execute their assignments on the streets. The workshop leader will be at &#8220;base camp&#8221; for part of the day, should participants wish to return to get further advice and feedback. </span></p>
<p><strong>Day 3: Editing and Critique – the post-production bit!</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Each participant will have a two-on-one, 90 minute editing session with a professional editor on Adobe Lightroom software, teaching you how to get the most out of your photography in post-production.</span></p>
<p>Additional information re: Day 3: Before arriving at their 90 minute editing session, participants will need to narrow down their work to no more than 30 images. During editing, 10 images will be selected as their &#8220;shortlist&#8221; of best images, and then one single image will be selected and showcased throughout various WPO platforms, including for display and review during a group discussion led by the workshop leader.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My first experiences with computers was playing games at a friend&#8217;s home on an Apple II computer in the early 1980s.  Since 1984 my family has owned Macintosh computers, and to this day, Apple products have helped me to communicate, do the work I love and share my thoughts and images with others. To get a sense of how far we&#8217;ve come over the last 25+ years, below is a video of the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984:</p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2B-XwPjn9YY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In 2006 at the Macworld Expo San Francisco (just after his Keynote address, which was quite an experience), I had the opportunity to speak with Steve Jobs for a few moments. To paraphrase, I thanked him and let him know that Apple had a major impact on my career. That was the year Apple moved to Intel chips, which must have been a difficult decision. It seems to have been the right decision based on the products that have come out since that announcement, and if you listen to Steve Jobs and Intel&#8217;s CEO&#8217;s Paul Otellini onstage at the 2006 Macworld Expo, you can get a sense of how much work went into creating the new product line using Intel processors. Below is a video of that segment:</p>
<p><iframe width="490" height="279" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cp49Tmmtmf8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In case you have not heard seen this video of Steve giving a speech at Stanford University, I think it is worth watching if you are interested in learning more about Steve Jobs:</p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/UF8uR6Z6KLc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>And below is a photo that I took at the 2006 Macworld Expo Keynote of Steve Jobs onstage, showing him and Steve Wozniak in a photo from 1976, the year the Apple Computer Company was founded. The photo was shown to mark the 30 year anniversary of Apple:<br />

<p>I&#8217;d like to extend Steve Jobs&#8217; family and the Apple organization my sincere condolences. Thank you Steve and the people at Apple for the work you&#8217;ve done to make a difference and &#8220;Think Different.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>May 26 is the late Dorothea Lange&#8217;s birthday. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with Dorothea Lange, you are probably familiar with some of her photographs from her time as a photographer with the FSA (Farm Security Administration), including one with the title: Migrant Mother, shown below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1503" title="dorothealangemigrantmother1" src="http://imagingbuffet.com/http://www.imagingbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/dorothealangemigrantmother1.jpg" alt="dorothealangemigrantmother1" width="407" height="545" /><em>Migrant Mother</em>, photograph by Dorothea Lange</p>
<p>I finished this 560 page book, entitled, <em>Dorothea Lange: A Life Beyond Limits</em> a few<em> </em>months ago, and now seemed like an ideal time to put together all my notes and write a review.  It&#8217;s a fantastic book, and one I recommend for anyone who has an interest in the history of photography or 20th Century U.S. history.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1497" title="langecover" src="http://imagingbuffet.com/http://www.imagingbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/langecover.jpg" alt="langecover" width="266" height="407" /></p>
<p>As a biography, you might assume the book is about the life of Dorothea Lange–and you&#8217;d be correct. But it is much more than that. The book covers her life chronologically, from her birth in Hoboken, NJ in 1895 until her death in 1965.  What separates it from many other biographies is that it discusses and educates the viewer about the world that surrounded Dorothea throughout her life (and in some cases, the years prior to and since her death). The book&#8217;s author, Linda Gordon, speaks to the reader in very frank, honest terms, and explains that in many cases, there was no written or oral record of events to chronicle. At times, Ms. Gordon speculates about how Ms. Lange might have felt based on her research and knowledge of history.</p>
<p>To best explain why I found the book to be outstanding, listed below are some of the many topics into which the book delves:</p>
<p>- Life as the child of an immigrant in the USA;</p>
<p>- Life as a student in the lower-east side of New York City in the early 1930&#8217;s;</p>
<p>- The experiences of a child growing up without a father in the home;</p>
<p>- The devastating effect that alcoholism can have on families;</p>
<p>- How travel to a new place often completely changes one&#8217;s life plans;</p>
<p>- The effects that divorce can have on families;</p>
<p>- The common struggle of families and individuals to make a living;</p>
<p>- The tensions between labor and management throughout history;</p>
<p>- Agribusiness, and the &#8220;big growers&#8221; (especially in California);</p>
<p>- Class struggles in the United States over the last 100 years;</p>
<p>- The Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Its causes and ramifications for so many (especially those who traveled west for work from Oklahoma and other affected states);</p>
<p>- The story of Japanese Americans uprooted and sent to relocation camps in the 1940s;</p>

<p>- The issues surrounding the captioning (text descriptions) of photographs throughout history.</p>
<p>As noted in the last line above, one of the most important issues discussed in the book, and central to Dorothea Lange&#8217;s experiences as a photographer, was the issue of uncaptioned photographs. As I learned from the book and from my own observations over the years, without a proper description for a photograph (preferably written by an observer at the scene), a still photograph can be deliberately or mistakingly captioned, thus conveying a message quite different from what actually occurred.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s world of digital photography with instant feedback and the ability to backup data quickly and inexpensively, I can only imagine the frustration that Ms. Lange and many other FSA photographers felt who were forced to send their film to Washington, D.C., (often thousands of miles away), not knowing if it would arrive safely, and in many cases, never seeing the final product. The book also mentions that many negative were intentionally destroyed by  Roy Stryker, head of the &#8220;Historical Section&#8221; of the <span>FSA. You can find out more about that and other information about the FSA <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ug97/fsa/fsabio.html" target="_blank">on this website</a>.</span></p>
<p>The references in the back of the book are extensive, and well worth reading. I consider the references a &#8220;text-book lesson&#8221; in how one should do research for such a project. Because Ms. Gordon was not an expert in photography, I believe it was a very different type of book compared with other biographies written by people with a vast knowledge of the subject&#8217;s field.</p>
<p>After reading this book, I had an opportunity to watch <em>Black Blizzard</em>, an outstanding video documentary about The Dust Bowl, and it gave me a much better understanding of the terrible conditions that so many faced in the 1930s, as well as its causes. <a href="http://shop.history.com/detail.php?p=292687&amp;v=history&amp;ecid=PRF-2104031&amp;pa=PRF-2104031" target="_blank">You can find the video here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Printed Photographs and Related Photos</strong></p>
<p>On the topic of photographs reproduced in the book, there is a mix of glossy pages and photographs printed on uncoated paper. The images printed on glossy pages are far superior, and it would have been wonderful to have had more of them. To get a better sense of the detail and sharpness in her work, there are thousands of photographs by Dorothea Lange available online for viewing and/or download <a href="http://www.loc.gov/pictures/search/?q=dorothea%20lange&amp;sg=true" target="_blank">on this page of the Library of Congress&#8217; website.</a></p>
<p>The book is available on Amazon.com <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393057305/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andrewdarlowi-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0393057305">via this link</a><img style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0393057305&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago, I was contacted by a representative from AcrylicPix.com, a Montreal, Canada-based company that produces innovative direct-to-acrylic and direct-to-metal digital prints. I was intrigued, and asked if they would send me a few samples using images that I provided (in the case of their metal prints, they sent me a printed sample of something they had already produced). Below is an overview of what Acrylicpix.com offers, followed by my personal observations and some additional information.</p>
<p><strong>AcrylicPix.com Options: </strong>AcrylicPix.com&#8217;s acrylic options include direct printing onto 1/8 and 3/16-inch thick acrylic, as well as direct printing on aluminum. They offer a wide range of sizes <a href="http://www.acrylicpix.com/prices/" target="_blank">on their pricing page</a>, and they will do custom sizes as well. Finishing options include a one-inch or two-inch mount that looks a lot like a wood frame, as well as float mount that allows the piece to &#8220;float&#8221; once inch off the wall. The company also offers direct printing on aluminum, and <a href="http://www.acrylicpix.com/aluminum" target="_blank">you can find out more about their metal options on this page</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.acrylicpix.com/custom-options/display-options/" target="_blank">This page has an excellent overview of their display options.</a></p>
<p>According to the company, turnaround time is about a week to most locations in the USA and Canada, and shipping cost per piece for most sizes to the continental USA is US $15. You will need to contact the company for information on shipping costs for large packages, or for shipping rates to other countries.</p>
<p>The company has done a good job explaining why most people will want to opt for the &#8220;Sintra sandwich&#8221; <a href="http://www.acrylicpix.com/custom-options/construction/" target="_blank">on this page</a>, compared with just having the hanging hardware attached directly to the Acrylic. See below for an example of what a 1/8&#8243; plexi and 1/16&#8243; Sintra sandwich look like  from the side (the print of the dog below looks exactly like this when viewed from the side).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1464" title="withsintra2" src="http://imagingbuffet.com/http://www.imagingbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/withsintra2.jpg" alt="withsintra2" width="400" height="300" /></p>

<p><strong>1. Ordering:</strong> In my case, I sent files directly to my contact at AcrylicPix.com in RGB with an AdobeRGB(1998) working space profile. However, most people will order through their online upload system, and there are many options apart from just the finishing options listed above, including converting to black and white or sepia, photo retouching and restoration, or background replacement. The company also suggests ways to make your images pop, such as <a href="http://www.acrylicpix.com/custom-options/border-options/" target="_blank">using a custom border</a>, which ends up looking a lot like a frame.</p>
<p><strong>2. Packing/Print Protection: </strong>The two acrylic prints I received were very well packed. Each one had corner foam protectors and each was individually shrink-wrapped. After removing the plastic, there was a small amount &#8220;dust&#8221; to clean off (mainly from the packing material and small pieces of foam). Also, some static electricity was generated, so I recommend using a smooth static-free wipe to clean the surface of the prints.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>3.<strong> Output Quality:</strong> I would rate AcrylicPix.com&#8217;s overall print quality on acrylic as very good. Most people will be able to see very fine dots in their printed images from a close distance, but from any normal viewing distance (even with prints as small as 11&#215;14 inches), the image looks great. I will admit that I&#8217;m not a big fan of super-glossy prints, but the super-smooth, glass-like look and feel of these prints is stunning. Sharpness was spot-on, and color accuracy in my test prints was excellent when I examined the overall color and greyscale ramp under a daylight-balanced lamp. I used the popular PhotoDisc target to judge overall image quality, color and contrast, which you can see a part of below (behind the dog print). The prints have a slightly lower black point (Dmax) when I observed them next to my pigment-based reference semi-gloss inkjet prints produced on an Epson Stylus Pro 3880, but the prints still have plenty of contrast. Also worth noting is that the images have a nice even contrast range from the highlights to the shadows, with no banding observed in my test prints.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1448" title="acrylicpixfront" src="http://imagingbuffet.com/http://www.imagingbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/acrylicpixfront.jpg" alt="acrylicpixfront" width="500" height="340" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1447" title="acrylicpixback" src="http://imagingbuffet.com/http://www.imagingbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/acrylicpixback.jpg" alt="acrylicpixback" width="500" height="322" /></p>
<p><strong>4. Finishing Quality: </strong>The build quality and workmanship of both of my prints is excellent. In the case of the acrylic print with a two-inch mount, the hardware is extremely sturdy and feels a lot like heavy-duty stretcher bars. However, it feels more stable than a canvas wrap, due to the acrylic/Sintra sandwich on the front. Of course, it is also heavier than a stretched canvas (about 3.5 lbs for a 16&#215;20-inch piece with a 2-inch mount, shown above). The firmly attached hanging wire on both wood frames gives me confidence that it will stay on any wall when properly hung. The 11&#215;14-inch one-inch floating print of the dog weighs in at just about 1.5 lbs. To best explain what the black edging looks like on the one-inch and two-inch mounts, it looks and feels like a high-end gaffer&#8217;s tape that has been very carefully applied.</p>
<p>One minor complaint I have is that a caulk-like substance is used to adhere the Plexi to the frame, aa well as the wood brace to the back of the floating frames. The caulk is clearly visible from the back, and that detracts from the clean look of the whole piece. If I were to present these to a client, I would simply use a few pieces of acid-free tape such as Lineco&#8217;s Self-Adhesive Linen Hinging Tape<strong> </strong>and carefully cover the caulk-like substance.</p>
<p><strong>5. Permanence: </strong>As with any paper and ink combination, I was curious about expected permanence/lightfastness, so I inquired about any permanence testing that has been done on the ink and media combinations. I was directed to aPDF document <a href="http://www.fujifilmusa.com/shared/bin/uvijetko.pdf" target="_blank">which you can see at this link</a>, that explains some standard testing that was done. That text is reproduced below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Accelerated weathering tests have been carried out in a Xenon Arc Weatherometer set to the SAEJ1960 standard. Under these conditions the accelerated weathering of Uvijet KO inks equates to approximately 12 months outdoor exposure in a temperate climate, such as North America. If finished prints will be subjected to outdoor exposure exceeding 12 months, the use of an overprint clear or over-laminate is strongly recommended.</p></blockquote>
<p>A representative from AcrylicPix.com recommended against outdoor display of their prints, but the testing above gives some idea of what might be expected with regard to fading over time indoors. Other companies have equated 12 months outdoor display life before noticeable fading or color shift with about 30-40 years of indoor display life before noticeable fading or color shift, but there are many variables. I wanted to give you some hard facts, and until testing is done by a company like Wilhelm Imaging Research (www.Wilhelm-Research.com) or Aardenburg Imaging and Archives (www.aardenburg-imaging.com), any expected fade data will probably be based on the outdoor testing noted above, or real-life testing by companies or individual users.</p>
<p><strong>7. Conclusion: </strong>Overall, I recommend AcrylicPix.com&#8217;s acrylic printing service as a source of affordable, high quality, professional-looking acrylic prints. As with any print sandwiched or printed directly on acrylic, care must be taken when handling the pieces, and when dusting/cleaning them. I recommend using the same acrylic cleaners made for protecting and cleaning acrylic used in the picture frame industry. Print quality does not quite match the results I&#8217;ve seen from services who provide high-end face-mounted C-prints or inkjet prints to acrylic. However, the print quality is very good, and definitely worth considering for wall art (portrait, weddings, families, etc.), as well as fine-art and commercial (print-for-pay) projects.</p>
<p>Also, I really liked the look and feel of the direct to metal print I received from the company, but I am going to hold off on my review of their metal prints until I can have a print of my own done by them. It&#8217;s the best way I know to properly review this type of product. What I will say is that it is a unique look that allows the brushed metal feel to come through–almost like the look of sandwiching a photo of metal with another photo.</p>
<p>Disclosure: I received two acrylic prints from my supplied files and another sample metal print at no cost from AcrylicPix.com so that I could properly do this review.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently received an e-mail from Safangelo Sadeghpour who recently launched a Kickstarter project with a very interesting goal. The project&#8217;s main focus is creating a publishing system that combines the tactile feel and power of a printed color book (illustrated with high quality photography) with an audio track that is played through a website URL or via a phone number. It may not be a completely new idea (many children&#8217;s books have for years come with audio tapes, CD&#8217;s etc.), but with the advent of smartphones, I think it is a new and interesting approach, and I hope he achieves his goal of raising $6,000.</p>

<p>&#8230;and below you can see a sample of how the final book and audio will look and sound:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From time to time I like to recommend outstanding blogs, podcasts, etc., and this is one of them: <strong>The Typical Shutterbug Podcast</strong>. I just listened to three recent podcasts on my iPod Touch and I highly recommend them for photographers of any level.</p>
<p>Victor Cajiao is someone whom I&#8217;ve known for years, and we&#8217;ve met on a few occasions at trade shows. His smiling face on the home page of his other Podcast, <a href="http://www.typicalmacuser.com" target="_blank">Typical Mac User</a> (also highly recommended), depicts his very friendly, easy-going manner. I really like how he interviews people from many areas of the photo and video world. The product picks and suggestions from Victor and his guests, from inexpensive accessories to plug-ins and hardware at the end of most shows are particularly interesting. You will also find screencasts and slideshows on the site. A few years ago, I was also a guest on the show, <a href="http://typicalshutterbug.com/wordpress/2009/10/06/tsb10-printing-101-with-andrew-darlow/" target="_blank">which you listen to here.</a> I also contributed a short photo tip <a href="http://typicalshutterbug.com/wordpress/2009/03/07/tsb02-interview-with-author-michael-freeman-the-photographers-eye/" target="_blank">for this show</a>.</p>
<p>On the site, which you can find at <a href="http://www.typicalshutterbug.com" target="_blank">www.typicalshutterbug.com</a>, you can explore by either clicking on the play buttons inside each blog post to listen right away on your computer, or you can subscribe via iTunes (see the link in the sidebar) . Enjoy!</p>
<p>and I also contributed to this show.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I returned home late last night after a very enjoyable visit to International Artexpo New York 2011, held at Pier 94 in New York City. For many years, I visited the show when it was held at the Jacob Javits Center about 20 blocks south of Pier 94. Pier 94 is located at 55th Street and 12th Ave, and this year&#8217;s event has over 400 exhibitors from more than 20 countries. According to the show catalog, &#8220;This year, Artexpo New York celebrates 33 years of collaboration with the fine art community and art enthusiasts from around the globe.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1409" title="artexpo1" src="http://imagingbuffet.com/http://www.imagingbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/artexpo1.jpg" alt="artexpo1" width="480" height="216" /></p>
<p>What I like most about Artexpo is the huge diversity of art throughout the show, including sculpture, painting, photography, mixed media and more. As in the past, original oil paintings as well as reproductions (usually described as &#8220;giclée on canvas&#8221;) dominate the walls of the show. Artist originals are one-of-a-kind works, so the reproductions offered by many artists and/or galleries make it possible for a larger audience to own art that they like. The multiple print concept is not new (for example, photographers who sell prints almost always sell multiple prints of a specific image), and in booths where both original paintings and reproductions were located, I found it interesting trying to guess which prints were originals and which were reproductions before reading the placards that described the prints. In many cases, it was very difficult to tell.</p>
<p>Below are just a few of the exhibitors whose work caught my eye. In this overview, I focus mainly on photography-related artists and exhibitors, but I also included the work of some painters and mixed media artists. If you are planning to attend Artexpo in the future, I&#8217;d give yourself at least six hours to properly take in the whole show (with a few much needed breaks for your eyes and feet in between). The many educational workshops (free with your show admission fee) offered during the show should also be considered by anyone who is in the business of creating or selling art.</p>
<p><strong>Artist: </strong><strong>Blaise Arnold</strong><br />
<em> Lili-Ubel Gallery, Paris - Booth 752</em><br />
<strong> Website:</strong> <a href="http://www.lili-ubelgallery.com" target="_blank">www.lili-ubelgallery.com</a><br />
<strong> Comments: </strong>This gallery is exhibiting a group large-scale photographs (about four feet tall) featuring exquisite night scenes in Paris. They are super-glossy (I believe they are face mounted to acrylic).  <a href="http://www.lili-ubelgallery.com/en/artists/arnold-blaise" target="_blank">You can view the images online here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Artist: Kwan-Woo</strong><strong> Lee</strong><br />
<em> Able Fine Art, New York - Booth 929</em><br />
<strong> Website:</strong> <a href="http://www.ablefineartny.com" target="_blank">www.ablefineartny.com</a><br />
<strong> Comments: </strong>This gallery is exhibiting a number of artists, including an artist whose work stopped me in my tracks – Kwan-Woo Lee. Lee&#8217;s works are large-scale assemblies of rubber stamps, arranged in ways that create a larger overall image (similar to photo mosaics). In most cases, the stamps contain Chinese characters, but I&#8217;ve also seen some pieces containing stamps of animals and various objects.  <a href="http://www.ablefineartny.com/bbs/board.php?bo_table=g04_b001" target="_blank">You can find more work (including some close-ups that show amazing details) by Kwan-Woo Lee here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Artist:</strong> <strong>Sean Flynn<br />
<em><span style="font-weight: normal;">Coral Canyon Publishing, Los Angeles - Booth 911</span></em><br />
</strong><strong>Website: </strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/seanmflynnphotography?v=info" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/seanmflynnphotography?v=info</a><br />
<strong>Comments: </strong>Photographer<strong> </strong>Sean Flynn is showing about 20 images-most of them framed and about 16&#215;20 inches in size, and some about 30&#215;40 inches in size. Sean Flynn utilizes HDR (High Dynamic Range) photography, and I found many of his images to be quite stunning. You can view the photos from the show, as well as many more of his photos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/seanmflynn/" target="_blank">on his Flickr page here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Artist:</strong> <strong>Malteste<br />
</strong><em>Malteste Expressionist Photography - Booth 1006<br />
</em><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="http://www.malteste.com" target="_blank">www.malteste.com<br />
</a><strong>Comments: </strong>This photographer is exhibiting about twenty large-scale photographs featuring outstanding nature and wildlife imagery. Like the work of Arnold Blaise, they are super-glossy, with no frame (Maltese calls the finishing technique &#8220;Plexi-arts&#8221;). His website contains over 70 of his images, but as with most artwork, seeing them in person is the best way to experience them.</p>
<p>One of the areas at Artexpo is called the SOLO pavilion. It&#8217;s not unlike other areas of the show, but the booths are generally a bit smaller, and reserved for independent artists to show their work. I was very impressed by the work I saw there, including the paintings of Vanessa Sheldon, who showed just a handful of pieces that were both beautiful and quite &#8220;calming,&#8221; thanks to their muted colors and nautical themes. For more information, or to see more of her work, visit her website below:</p>
<p><strong>Artist:</strong> <strong>Vanessa Sheldon</strong><br />

<p>Below is a link to the Artexpo SOLO photo gallery over the years on Flickr.com. It really gives a sense of what it&#8217;s like at the show (you can view it full-screen by clicking on the button in the bottom right corner of the gallery below):</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently wrote two pretty long articles for Photo.net covering factors to consider when choosing an inkjet printer. When all was said and done, I wrote about 7000 words total for both articles thanks to the number of printers on the market, as well as the many topics to consider before making an investment in a printer (from costs to RIP options). I added information about my personal experiences with inkjet printers, and I included a number of printer model names and specific suggestions throughout the article. The first covers printers up to 17 inches in width, and the second covers printers up to 44 inches in width (the widest paper size that can fed into a printer).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peter Read Miller is one of the most acclaimed sports photographers in the world, and this workshop looks like a great opportunity for anyone who wants to learn more about how to shoot sports-related assignments. Four additional instructors and speakers are joining Peter Read Miller during the workshop, which will undoubtably add to the value of the workshop (see below for more details). The workshop, being held in Denver, CO, is limited to 25 participants, and the press release for the event, containing additional details, is copied below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1390" title="491721_eventimage" src="http://imagingbuffet.com/http://www.imagingbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/491721_eventimage.jpeg" alt="491721_eventimage" width="448" height="248" /></p>
<p>Los Angeles, CA – March 8, 2011 &#8212; World Class Sports Illustrated Photographer Peter Read Miller has announced he will conduct his annual Sports Photography Workshop in Denver, Colorado on April 4-10, 2011.  The workshop, now in its 7th year and limited to only 25 attendees, will provide a personal and hands-on approach to teaching a variety of shooting and lighting techniques that have helped Miller&#8217;s photos grace more than 100 Sport Illustrated covers.  Workshop participants will have an opportunity to apply their new skills to live sporting events throughout the weeklong workshop.  Photographers interested in learning more about the workshop or registering to attend can visit Peter Read Miller Sports Photography Workshop.</p>
<p>In addition to receiving expert tutelage from Miller, attendees will also receive additional instruction from other industry notables including Steve Fine, Director of Photography at Sports Illustrated, Grant Leighton, advertising / portrait photographer and instructor at U. of Colorado (Denver), photographer / videographer Max Morse, and Shawn Cullen, lighting technician at Sports Illustrated.</p>
<p>Learning to take better &#8220;action&#8221; photographs is only one aspect of the workshop.  Attendees will also learn how to properly light subjects using strobes &#8212; in the studio and on location &#8212; arena lighting and how to set up and use remote cameras.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very rewarding for me to see the quality of work students are producing toward the end of the workshop and their enthusiasm and passion for photography makes the entire experience both educational and a lot of fun,&#8221; explains Peter Read Miller.  &#8220;Everyone leaves the workshop a better sports photographer and some have gone on to find work with professional sports teams, Getty Images and other newswires.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tuition for the workshop is $1,495 and includes all instruction, one-on-one portfolio review with Peter Read Miller, and all model/location fees.  Workshop attendees are responsible for their own travel arrangements including air and hotel.  Special hotel rates have been made with the Marriott in Denver.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi folks! It&#8217;s been a while since my last post, and that&#8217;s partly due to the fact that I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://www.facebook.com/andrewdarlow" target="_blank">my Facebook page</a> as a way to share links to articles, contests, gallery shows and other items I find interesting. Even if you don&#8217;t have a Facebook profile, you can see the most recent highlighted stories and links directly to them on ImagingBuffet.com and one of my other sites, PhotoPetTips.com (look for the blue box in the right column of the site).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been writing for some other sites, including Photo.net and Pixiq.com. But I haven&#8217;t forgotten about you. Look for some reviews and other articles soon, right here on The Imaging Buffet. And with Valentine&#8217;s Day in the recent past, I thought I&#8217;d share one of my photos: an adorable Boston Terrier named Cupid, who graced the pages of Studio Photography Magazine (February issue of course) a few years back.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1364" title="darlowpz02b" src="http://imagingbuffet.com/http://www.imagingbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/darlowpz02b.jpg" alt="darlowpz02b" width="350" height="489" /></p>
<p>Below are some highlighted articles from the recent past, as well as some upcoming workshops that I&#8217;ll be conducting in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Articles</strong></p>
<p>I just wrote an article for Photo.net entitled: <em>Factors to Consider when Choosing a Photo-Quality Inkjet Printer.</em> To read the article, <a href="http://photo.net/learn/printing/guide-to-buying-a-printer/small-printers/" target="_blank">visit this page</a>.</p>
<p>A few months back, I had a pet photography article published on Phoozl.com (and if you haven&#8217;t played any of the Phoozl photo games, I highly recommend them). To read the article, <a href="http://www.phoozl.com/index.php?loadpage=./includes/photo-tips_7.php" target="_blank">visit this page</a>.</p>
<p>I recently wrote an article for Pixiq.com entitled: <em>The 13-inch-wide Epson Stylus Photo R3000 Announced: Overview and Comments</em>. To read the article, <a href="http://www.pixiq.com/article/new-13-inch-wide-printer" target="_blank">visit this page</a>.</p>
<p>and to see all my articles on Pixiq.com, including one that describes changes to the Photoshop CS5 Print Dialog Box, <a href="http://www.pixiq.com/contributors/darlow  " target="_blank">visit this page</a>.</p>
<p>I was also quite honored to be one of four photographers and a commercial printer interviewed for a recent (PDN) Photo District News Article by Dan Havlik entitled <em>Living Large: Photographers use the latest large-format inkjet printers and materials to print big for maximum impact</em>. You can find it in the March, 2011 issue of PDN (pages 29-34).

<p><strong>Upcoming Printing Workshops in NJ, NY and PA</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to announce that I&#8217;ll be trekking across the tri-state region in the upcoming months with workshops in New Jersey, New York City and Philadelphia. Below are some quick links to four upcoming workshops (and there are more to come)</p>
<p>1. I&#8217;m teaching a full-day color management/fine-art inkjet printing workshop on Saturday March 19, 2011 in Philadelphia, PA at Calumet Photographic. I expect to use an Epson Stylus Pro 3880 (17-inch-wide) and/or a Canon PIXMA Pro 9500 Mark II (13 inch wide) for attendee prints and for explaining a step-by-step Photoshop workflow. For more information, <a href="http://www.cvent.com/EVENTS/Info/Summary.aspx?e=e0870f58-47f3-4792-a239-234ea24351e0  " target="_blank">visit this page</a>.</p>
<p>2. I&#8217;ll be teaching a very similar workshop with similar printers at Calumet New York City on April 23, 2011. For more information, <a href="http://www.cvent.com/Events/info/Summary.aspx?e=3EFD24E8-9835-43C3-BF81-21AB284F08DB" target="_blank">visit this page</a>.</p>
<p>3. And to round out my tri-state tour for now, I&#8217;ll be doing a two-day weekend workshop in Northern New Jersey at Peters Vallery Craft Center May 21-22, 2011. I expect to use an Epson Stylus Pro 3880 for this workshop. For more information, <a href="https://www.pvcrafts.org/online_store/index.php?_a=viewProd&amp;productId=335  " target="_blank">visit this page</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also available for private instruction in your home, studio, via phone, or via remote desktop (with your permission, I can take over your screen and mouse-actually we can both use the mouse). All ImagingBuffet.com readers who mention that they saw the offer here can take 20% off any of my private consulting services if reserved by 3/1/2011. For more information, <a href="http://imagingbuffet.com/consulting-info/" target="_blank">visit this page</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me directly here:  <a href="http://imagingbuffet.com/contact-us/" target="_blank">http://imagingbuffet.com/contact-us/</a></p>

		<description>About a month ago at the 2010 PhotoPlusExpo in New York City, I had a chance to sit down with a representative from Vimeo.com, a video hosting site that I&amp;#8217;ve been familiar with for a few years. If you&amp;#8217;re not familiar with Vimeo, here is a short blurb from the company&amp;#8217;s press materials:

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago at the 2010 PhotoPlusExpo in New York City, I had a chance to sit down with a representative from Vimeo.com, a video hosting site that I&#8217;ve been familiar with for a few years. If you&#8217;re not familiar with Vimeo, here is a short blurb from the company&#8217;s press materials:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Leading video sharing site Vimeo provides the easiest way for people to host and share their videos in high quality&#8230;Launched in 2004 and headquartered in New York, NY, Vimeo offers users a video sharing experience that is both entertaining and easy to use. Vimeo is a 2010 &amp; 2009 Time Magazine Top 50 Website.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Back in February, <a href="http://imagingbuffet.com/2010/02/17/970/" target="_blank">I wrote this article</a> about <em>The Story Behind the Still</em>–a user-generated HD video contest sponsored by Canon and hosted by Vimeo. It is truly mind-blowing to see the quality of many of the videos, including the story lines, acting, direction, artistry, sound quality, editing and overall impact of the videos. I highly recommend taking a look <a href="http://vimeo.com/groups/beyondthestill" target="_blank">at the videos and contest details here</a>.</p>
<p>And for some &#8220;backstory&#8221; from Vincent Laforet, who worked with Canon and Gray Advertising to create the contest, <a href="http://blog.vincentlaforet.com/2009/12/29/canon-vimeo-film-contest/" target="_blank">visit this page-a post about the contest before it began</a>, and <a href="http://blog.vincentlaforet.com/2010/09/09/final-beyond-the-still-winner-announced-next-a-collaborative-shoot-with-all-7-winners-location-tbd/" target="_blank">this page-Laforet speaks about how he and the seven Chapter winners will work together to create the final chapter of the story.</a></p>
<p>Below are a few other videos on Vimeo I recommend checking out (I&#8217;ve embedded one below as well):<br />
<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/13557939" target="_blank"> http://www.vimeo.com/13557939</a><br />

<strong>The Vimeo Vibe</strong></p>
<p>When I started browsing Vimeo videos, I read many of the comments by other content creators and viewers, and noticed a vibrant community that was very supportive and overwhelmingly positive. I would liken it to something akin to a university film class discussion, with a lot of sharing of technical information and gear. That&#8217;s what generally sets it apart from other sites like YouTube. Though it depends on the quality of the source material, I&#8217;m almost always impressed by the video quality, even when the HD option is not checked. However, HD is usually a better choice for large or full screen video viewing.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://vimeo.com/forums" target="_blank">Community Forums</a> on the site are also a great resource for content creators.</p>
<p><strong>Hands-on Couch Surfing</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.vimeo.com/couchmode"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1334" title="20101204vimeo" src="http://imagingbuffet.com/http://www.imagingbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/20101204vimeo.png" alt="20101204vimeo" width="450" height="253" /></a></p>
<p><em> Vimeo.com&#8217;s Couch Mode menu when the info box is selected.</em></p>
<p>Recently, Vimeo launched a new feature on its site called Couch Mode. It works with Google TV and the GTV remote, and an iPad app is in the works. The interface can also be activated from a browser. Couch Mode just requires a browser that supports HTML5 (the latest version of Apple Safari and Google Chrome both support HTML5). Couch Mode creates an environment similar to most people&#8217;s TV experience because the videos run full screen, and continuously, one after another, without user intervention. To experience couch mode on a computer, visit: <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/couchmode" target="_blank">http://www.vimeo.com/couchmode</a></p>
<p>The Couch Mode experience is fantastic. I especially like the info box view shown in the screen shot above because you can browse other media while a video is playing. The volume of content, however, is pretty limited (featured and  unless you create your own collection of &#8220;Liked&#8221; videos, which requires a free &#8220;Basic&#8221; account or paid Vimeo Plus account. Once you have an account, you can navigate Vimeo.com, tag something as a video you like or as a video to watch later. Then when you enter Couch Mode, all of the videos are waiting for you. It&#8217;s a bit like navigating the iTunes directory for podcasts and content, without the need to download anything. A few additions to the user interface in Couch Mode, such as a search bar, selectable list of topics, etc. could largely eliminate the need to go into Vimeo.com&#8217;s general interface. I guess there is a balance though in making it easy to navigate from the couch with a bowl of popcorn on your lap :).</p>
<p><strong>Vimeo Basic vs. Vimeo Plus</strong></p>
<p>Without going into too much detail, there are two subscription options: Vimeo Basic and Vimeo Plus. Vimeo  Basic is free and Vimeo Plus is fee-based (about US $60/yr). You can compare the plans here: <a href="http://vimeo.com/plus" target="_blank">http://vimeo.com/plus</a></p>
<p><strong>And the Awards Go To&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Also, on October 9, 2010, Vimeo announced the winners of its 2010 Vimeo Awards in New York City. Below are the winners of the contest&#8217;s nine categories. Just enter any of the titles below on Vimeo.com to view the videos:</p>

2.	Documentary: “Last Minutes with ODEN” by Phos Pictures<br />
3.	Music Video: “Liars ‘Scissor’” by Andy Bruntel<br />
4.	Animation: “Between Bears” by Eran Hilleli<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever read a book or seen a movie and said to yourself: &#8220;This is so unbelievable, it must be true!&#8221; Well, this book: <em>The Accidental Millionaire: How to Succeed in Life Without Really Trying</em>, by Gary Fong (BenBella Books), contains quite a few &#8220;scenes&#8221; that fit that description quite well. If you are not familiar with the book&#8217;s author, Gary Fong is a well-known photographer, inventor and entrepreneur who has become one of the most recognized names in the photo industry. I really enjoy biographies of people who have gone through great lengths to achieve success, and this autobiography is an excellent example of that.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1299 alignnone" title="fongbook" src="http://imagingbuffet.com/http://www.imagingbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/fongbook.jpg" alt="fongbook" width="200" height="284" /></p>
<p>The book starts with Fong&#8217;s early childhood–much of it spent in a haze of hairspray due to his mother&#8217;s wig business. When he wasn&#8217;t in school or helping his parents with their work (including prepping and delivering newspapers from about 3:30-6:30AM every day of the week during high school), it seems as though young Gary was always contemplating how he could do things a bit better (or just survive). For example, he worked out in his mind how he would survive if his family became homeless, and he tested the theory by spending a whole night until dawn outside his home without his parents&#8217; knowledge…at age 12! He also worked out elaborate ways in his mind and on paper which he could protect his family from potential burglars during the time when they ran a retail store in Los Angeles. When Fong talks about many of the experiences he has had, he gives the reader a good sense of what it was like to be in his shoes at specific times in his life. He also reminds us that there are many who do very difficult jobs every day for very low wages.</p>
<p>Once I started reading the book, I found myself always looking forward to getting back to it, and I was frequently amused and/or stunned by the situations in which Fong found himself–including a shocking story of how one of his mentors helped a bride deal with wedding jitters. And that brings me to the many female heroines in the book. I must admit, I sometimes felt like I was getting a little TMI (too much information), but that didn&#8217;t stop me from reading all that Fong had to say about his dealings with girlfriends, assistants and online women with whom he found himself involved in one way or another. Let me sum it up by saying that &#8220;As the World of Gary Fong Turns&#8221; might be a good title for the 8-part TV mini series!</p>
<p>The book has a small number of black and white photos to help illustrate the events and information Fong covers in the book. One of the photos is of a tiny room in his parents&#8217; home where he started and built his wedding photography business. Another shows a photo layout from 1986 illustrating his Storyboard approach to wedding photography and album layout.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know Gary Fong very well, but we&#8217;ve met on a few occasions over the years, and one event that sticks in my head was a photography trade show in San Diego, CA in 2004 or 2005. He was doing a photo lecture and the room was filled. People appeared to be listening intently at his every word. At the end, he took orders for some of his products, and people could not hand over their cash and credit cards fast enough! I think that Fong has a great sense of knowing what people want and need based on his struggles and experiences throughout his life.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a bit of a garage inventor/product developer (<a href="http://www.gallerypouch.com" target="_blank">GalleryPouch™ is one example</a>), and I&#8217;m also a longtime portrait and still-life photographer, so I found Fong&#8217;s advice regarding how his ideas for software, photo albums and camera gadgets like his popular LightSphere products came to be. While reading the book, I felt almost as though we were having a few drinks and chatting about stories from his life. You don&#8217;t need to be a professional photographer or play one on TV to be entertained and learn a lot from the content in this book. I believe that anyone who is building a business or who wants one person&#8217;s perspective about how to be successful should seriously consider reading it.</p>
