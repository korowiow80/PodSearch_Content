<p></center>Jason and Kelly are new parents! On July 8, 2011, Chase was born and is the newest addition to the newparent411 family. </p>
<p>Today we update everyone on our vacation. We have been back for one week and are trying to get everything back in order. </p>
<p>Going on vacation is both fun and exhausting.  Two days were spent on airplanes and there was a lot of driving around.  The vacation was great, but it&#8217;s difficult getting back into the daily routine, especially for our two and a half month old son.  But we survived, and family loves new babies.</p>
<p>We have several websites that we wanted to throw in here because I (Kelly) had researched the travel aspect and guidelines for flying with children. The websites are:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.faa.gov/passengers/media/childsafety.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.faa.gov/passengers/media/childsafety.pdf</a></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/children" target="_blank">http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/children</a></p>
<p>These website were very helpful and give you an idea of what to expect at the airport. Obviously everyone&#8217;s journey will differ, but we were happy with ours. The one thing I want to remind you of, and it&#8217;s perfectly normal to have that &#8220;we&#8217;re those parents&#8221; moment, but babies and children cry. So don&#8217;t apologize to people about it. Yes it can be embarrassing but you know what, that&#8217;s life. We may do a show on etiquette later but for now, if someone cannot deal with a crying child, then they have a problem and they need to deal with it. Ok, whew, defensive moment over&#8230;..moving on.</p>
<p>So, with traveling to see family comes stress. Typical and non-typical. People are going to want to hold the baby and that can get a little anxious. Make sure you let people know when you need time with your baby. Also, because you may not have your typical diaper bag, make one up so that way you have a little more control over what&#8217;s going on. With your baby in the car seat more than usual, they will sleep at odd times because of that, but they also need time to stretch and relax and move on their own. Our biggest issue was getting him comfortable at night in the playpen. He slept better on a pillow in bed with us. Not really recommended but when you can&#8217;t sleep, you will do desperate things. Just don&#8217;t do unsafe things.</p>
<p>It may seem customary to stay with family and friends when visiting home, but we needed a hotel room to have place of &#8220;our own&#8221; for several days, which was nice. We may have had the most secure hotel anywhere because the Michigan State Bomb Squad was staying there after for training! Granted it made me nervous when we first pulled up to get a room, but it made me feel great when I found out they weren&#8217;t sweeping the building.</p>

<p></center>Jason and Kelly are new parents! On July 8, 2011, Chase was born and is the newest addition to the newparent411 family. </p>
<p>Today on the new parent podcast, we talk about our week. This includes our son turning two months old, getting his vaccinations, our first cross country flight as a family, and Jason’s expectations of becoming a stay at home dad while Kelly goes back to work. Oh how the time flies.</p>
<p>Our son is two months old and we had to take him in to get his vaccinations. Now, not everyone believes in vaccinating their child(ren), which is their opinion, but we give some facts and statistics why vaccinations are important. Our son received some oral drops, three shots and one heel stick. The oral drops are for Rotovirus, and the shots consisted of Hib, Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis, Pneumococcal, Hepatitis and Polio. The heel stick was a just an exam where they had to collect blood to send to the state health department. </p>
<p>Chase did very well with his shots. He still cried, but once he calmed down he totally forgot about them and fell asleep. The doctor told us to watch for redness, hardening of the affected area and a low grade fever to present itself. If you’re not sure about vaccinations, ask your doctor, and check out the website <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/default.htm" target="_blank">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/default.htm</a>.</p>
<p>We are getting ready to take our son back home to meet the rest of the family. You know, family that includes the great grandparents that will pinch your cheek and sweetly threaten they’re going to eat you but never do, which is a good thing right? Eh, Chase is on his own, I’m sure he’ll fend them off bravely. </p>
<p>I think it will be interesting at the airport and on the plane. We are taking certain precautions such as, liquid benadryl, (which we have to test), mailing our clothes so we don’t have to check anything, bringing our stroller so it’s easier to move around the airport and begging an pleading with the airline to switch our seats so we can sit together. We’ll let you know how that goes.</p>
<p>Jason is now a stay at home dad and Kelly is going back to work. We’re not sure who has the better end of that stick. Jason gets to see how he grows and change his sleeping habits every week, but then I get to enter the race halfway and am completely confused. </p>
<p>Here is a great site for working parents. <a href="http://www.workingmother.com/new-mom-work/planning-tips-first-day-back-work" target="_blank">http://www.workingmother.com/new-mom-work/planning-tips-first-day-back-work</a></p>
<p>We signed up to get those monthly how-your-baby-grows informative emails. We get them from several different places and here’s one of them <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/0_your-2-month-olds-development-week-1_1477191.bc" target="_blank">http://www.babycenter.com/0_your-2-month-olds-development-week-1_1477191.bc</a></p>
<p>Bullying has become more prevalent at school and even online. So, we thought it was important to bring to light a new ANTI-bullying program called the <a href="http://www.kivakoulu.fi/frontpage" target="_blank">KiVa </a>program.  It originally started in Finland, and this year several Kansas city high schools are testing the program in the States.  Check it out at:<br />

<p></center>Jason and Kelly are new parents! On July 8, 2011, Chase was born and is the newest addition to the newparent411 family. </p>
<p>Today we talk about the goings on of the past several weeks. This includes our son getting circumcised, Kelly&#8217;s mom coming to visit (and the book they bought), and some interesting news we want to share with you. </p>
<p>Kelly&#8217;s mom was recently in town and sadly left. Sadly because you realize that it&#8217;s nice to get time to yourself whether it&#8217;s an uninterrupted nap or to go on a date, and Grandma was more than willing to watch the boy. There were also several days where Kelly took her mom sight-seeing around town and Chase got to go with them (even though he slept). They came across this new children&#8217;s store in town named T<a href="http://thecuriouscaterpillar.com/" target="_blank">he Curious Caterpillar</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, besides the typical children&#8217;s items, Kelly came home with this book called &#8220;<a href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&#038;bc1=000000&#038;IS2=1&#038;bg1=FFFFFF&#038;fc1=000000&#038;lc1=0000FF&#038;t=hilltpodcanet-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=8&#038;l=as4&#038;m=amazon&#038;f=ifr&#038;ref=ss_til&#038;asins=1617750255" target="_blank">Go the F**k to Sleep</a>&#8220;. This book is not a children&#8217;s book but an adequate description of the anguish and frustration tired parent(s) go through when it comes to getting their child to go to bed. The author Adam Mansbach &#8211; we salute you! You can check out the book for yourself but going to our web store: <a href="http://www.newparent411.com/store" target="_blank">www.newparent411.com/store</a></p>
<p>We did decide to get our son circumcised and he&#8217;s doing great! Everything is healing nicely, but we wanted to include the other options out there for people to be aware of. So we have the Gomco, Mogen Clamp and Plastibell procedure to talk about. <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/procedure/" target="_blank">This website</a> explains the procedures easily (I think), but there are graphic pictures so please be aware when clicking on the link. </p>
<p>We also posted some information on the pros and cons to consider about circumcision on our <a href="http://www.newparent411.com/circumcision/" target="_blank">website</a>. So check that out as well as the links there.</p>
<p>The News articles we talk about include a new app from the FBI, toxic car seats, and diapers that are causing chemical burns? Yikes! We read that article first because we weren&#8217;t sure if we had purchased any of THOSE diapers. Thank goodness we didn&#8217;t, but we got the story from WXYZ.com in Detroit, MI. <a href="http://bit.ly/p0u0CQ" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/p0u0CQ</a>. So go check your diaper stash and make sure you don&#8217;t have the Drymax, and if you do, just keep an eye on things. </p>
<p>The next article is also from WXYZ.com, and it talks about car seats being toxic. <a href="http://www.bit.ly/nC2qvV" target="_blank">http://www.bit.ly/nC2qvV</a><br />
You can also read a really great article going through the actual chemicals responsible and what affects are related. <a href="http://www.bit.ly/qk5zJ" target="_blank">http://www.bit.ly/qk5zJ</a>E</p>
<p>The <a href="http://1.usa.gov/p878Ng" target="_blank">Child Identification App</a> from the FBI is a new Iphone app to keep current details of your child, should they go missing! Jason and Kelly agree, this has been a long time coming and this app is going to change the way parents and caregivers deal with an abduction (hopefully not) or missing child. But seriously, this would be really handy in a scary just-in-case kind of way. Heck you could even take a picture of your child every day before they leave just so you have the clothing they&#8217;re wearing in the photo. So this is an app we are advocating, it&#8217;s a free app which is nice too, so there is no excuse to not have it or at least check it out.</p>

<p></center>Jason and Kelly are new parents! On July 8, 2011, Chase was born and is the newest addition to the newparent411 family. </p>
<p>In this episode, we talk about the labor and delivery, the shots and tests Chase had to go through (including the APGAR test), and being discharged from the hospital. The APGAR test is used to check the baby when it&#8217;s born and to make sure they are healthy and responsive. Follow the link to learn more: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apgar_score" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apgar_score</a>.</p>
<p>And who would have known that when you are discharged from the hospital, some hospitals check to make sure you have a child seat installed and it is installed correctly. Some of the regulations may have changed recently as well, so check out the link and find your state to make sure you are protecting your kids. <a href="http://www.iihs.org/laws/childrestraint.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.iihs.org/laws/childrestraint.aspx</a> </p>
<p>Along with car seat safety is how life has changed by bringing home baby. We talk about safety issues regarding SIDS, schedule changes, breastfeeding vs. formula, and allergies. More information on SIDS can be found at: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002533/" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002533/</a>. </p>
<p>During Chase&#8217;s first visit to the doctor, we discovered that kids can be born with allergies as well as develop them over time.  Interestingly and new study from Europe shows children that live in the country and on farms deal with more allergens but have less allergic reactions.  Read the full story at: <a href="http://fyiliving.com/health/allergy-asthma/why-farm-kids-dont-have-allergies-but-city-kids-do/">http://fyiliving.com/health/allergy-asthma/why-farm-kids-dont-have-allergies-but-city-kids-do/</a>.</p>

<p></center>Jason and Kelly talk about their upcoming due date and some of the things that they have done to get ready as much as possible. From birth-plans, to labor medications, to the unexpected surgery? Jason talks about Oxycontin vs. Oxytocin, while Kelly talks about epidurals and not strangling your significant other. </p>
<p><strong> Also;</strong> changes that can come with pregnancy such as snoring, Braxton-Hicks contractions, and a teaching manual on rough-housing. A manual on rough-housing? Yes indeed and it&#8217;s silly to think about things like that, but in this day and age&#8230;..you never know who&#8217;s going to complain about what. </p>
<p>Jason also discusses some of the challenges of raising a child in a computer age. Being aware of what your child is doing on the computer, setting up child locks and being able to mediate what your child can and cannot be exposed to can be very tricky. He also points out not only can your child find ways around some of these safety controls, but other online users can get access to your child without them knowing who they are or what their true intentions may be. </p>

<p>In the first official New Parent Podcast, we (Jason and Kelly) introduce ourselves and talk about why we started this podcast.  </p>
<p>This podcast was started as a way to connect parents to exchange information, stories, experiences, and guidance.  It&#8217;s not just a way for us to ask you questions, but also a way for you to ask us and each other.  We want this to become a community of parents helping each other to raise the next generation.</p>
<p>Kelly also discusses her pregnancy progress and about our son practicing breathing.  Jason gives his reasoning for leaving his fulltime job as a multimedia producer to become a stay at home dad.</p>
