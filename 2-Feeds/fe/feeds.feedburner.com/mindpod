            <title>Rod Rodriguez, So long old friend...</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Where to begin...</p>

<p>Today Rod Rodriguez passed away.</p>

<p>He left this reality and moved on.</p>

<p>I wish I could have spoken to him before he left, but I had no idea how ill he really was, and I had always thought that we would meet up again sometime, have a beer and talk about old times.</p>

<p>This was not to be, as he died this morning.</p>

<p>I met Rod back in 1995, not long after I had arrived in the United States.  I would visit Music Plus to rent movies and buy the occasional CD, and Rod worked there.  I remember he had long hair and was a musician, a cool guy.</p>

<p>Soon after we both ended up working together in Tower Records, and thats when we became fast friends. Mainly due to our passion was Star Wars, music and beer. Plus we also shared the same sense of humor and routinely cracked each other up while at work.</p>

<p>Long after we left Tower we remained in touch and routinely would go to our local "Shakeys" for pizza and beer.  And it was during one of these visits in 2005 that I talked to Rod about doing a humorous weekly news podcast, and as we shot ideas back and forth the Nervous Teeth show was formed.</p>

<p>The show ran for four years and was very popular.</p>

<p>The interview presented here, was recorded in <strong>March 2006</strong> and in it I talked to Rod about waking up from the "matrix" and discovering that the world may not be as it appears.  At the time these thoughts where very new to Rod, and in this interview he discusses the effects of this new world view had on his life.</p>

<p>For those of you who remember Rod and his time on Nervous Teeth, you already have a mental sound image of his humor and wit.  Rod was a great man, and one that I'm proud to have known.</p>

<p>So sit back, drink a beer, and remember Rod Rodriguez.</p>

We will miss you Rod...

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we have a very special Mind Set Podcast as we discuss the tragic events of September 11th, 2001.</code></p>

<p>Gareth and Alex are once again joined by Reeve and Venerina, in a "no holds barred" conversation about 9/11.</p>

<p>Many different angles of the events are covered and talked about in a very frank and honest way, sure to create many eye rolling events from the non-thinking populace, and nods in agreement from the Choir.</p>

<p>We only have hope that this podcast will spark thoughts and conversation, and not condemnation from new listeners. Please listen with an open mind and post thoughts below...</p>

<p>Until Next Week, Peace Out Humans...</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast: London is Burning...</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It is the 10th of August 2011 and London has suffered from riots unlike ever before. Like any major city there are always disturbances – but this is different. The violence took place on a far greater scale and seemed to move fluidly from place to place, perhaps illustrating how technology shapes our world. </p>

<p>It has been so intense, including looting, rioting and fires that the police appeared to be unable to cope. As a result last night London streets were ‘kept safe’ by 16,000 police officers. We are now into the 5th and I offer you my perspective. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes...</p>

<p>Slight format change on this weeks show, as the news takes a back seat and the strange rides shotgun!</p>

<p>Mamoth discussions take place covering a wide verity of the unusual and the parapolitcal.</p>

<p>Some of the topics discussed:</p>

<p><strong>Comet Elenin:</strong>  As the comet gets closer to Earth we talk about it's possible origins, purpose and meaning.  This spiraling conversation also touches on the origins of man and the secret NASA Space Program.</p>

<p><strong>Beatlemania!:</strong>  The Fab Four burst onto the Mind Set Scene as we talk about the famous "Paul is Dead" Conspiracy, and the assassination of John Lennon.</p>

<p><strong>Robocop and Freedom:</strong>  The privatization of the police force and the proliferation of CCTV.  When did this start?</p>

<p>...and so begins another Mind Set Podcast.</p>

<p>Headlines this week:</p>

<p>Eyes Wide Shut and The Catcher in the Rye, Connection?</p>

<p>The Key is explored once again, more information tied to extremes in weather.</p>

<p>Clips:</p>

<p><strong>The Tragedy in Norway:</strong> Conspiracy, Manipulation or Lone Nut?</p>

<p><strong>Arkansas Town To Ban Free Speech: </strong> Could this be true?  In the land of the free, where free speech is protected by law, a small town walks down the path toward censorship.</p>

<p><strong>Sinkhole Strangeness:</strong>  The dramatic appearance of huge holes in the ground.  Are they increasing?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Whew! Another amazing podcast this week, and one that could have gone all day, so get ready for a conspiracy/controversy ladened podcast that almost hit the 2hr mark!</p>

<p>Price differences on both sides of the pond where investigated, dissected and analyzed. Control once again appears to be the culprit in these sometime huge price variants.</p>

<p>Then it was on to the Clips.</p>

<p><strong>Carmageddon:</strong> Traffic gridlock panic hit the street of Los Angeles this past weekend as the media shifted its  focus solely on the possible traffic jam of the century!  Or was something else a foot?</p>

<p><strong>Bohemian Grove:</strong> Once a year in mid-July, the world elite have a little get together in northern California to discuss world affairs, network, and partake in Satanic Ritual.  This is discussed...</p>

<p><strong>Murdoch, Murdoch and more Murdoch:</strong> What is really happening to the news media empire owned by Aussie Billionaire Rupert Murdoch?  This weeks event are discussed and explored.</p>

<p><strong>DNA Databases and the CIA: </strong> This is an enlightening clip that details the fact that the elites are building a DNA database.  But for what reason?</p>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 71</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A truly mammoth show for you this week, as we clock in a staggering 2 hours of mind altering, conspiracy shaking conversation!</p>

<p>The initial conversation touched on Antarctic bases, earthquakes, and the arrival of our makers through a spinning portal!  You have to listen folks...</p>

<p>Then it was onto the clips.</p>

<p><strong>World Wide Check Points:</strong>  Are we being conditioned to accept Police/Military checkpoints?  There seems to be a push to normalize these illegal stops.</p>

<p><strong>Terrorism Surgery:</strong>  Are "terrorists" about to add surgical bombs added to their arsenal?</p>

<p><strong>The 5 Percent Solution:</strong>  A staggering economic thought has occurred to Alex, and one that literally reeks of the truth.</p>

<p><strong>Murdock, Power and Newspapers:</strong>  Media Mogul and Billionaire Rupert Murdock, has shut down an extremely old and popular UK news paper.  This story really has more to it than meets the eye...</p>

<p><strong>The Key:</strong>  Gareth and Alex get all Metaphysical, and discuss Alien Abductee Whitley Strieber's new book, The Key.  A book review rapidly spirals into an incredible discussion on belief, the soul and consciences.</p>

<p>Until Next Week, Peace Out Humans...</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 70</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The terror attacks of September 11th 2001 loom large in this weeks episode, as we discuss the discovery of truth.  The events of 911 was a seminal moment or truth seekers, as it either opened previously unseeing eyes, or opened wide those previously looking.</p>

<p><strong>Charlie changes his mind:</strong> Well known activist and truth seeker Charlie Veitch, recently had a revelation concerning 911.  Charlie's mind changing event is discussed at length in this weeks episode.</p>

<p><strong>Free Flying Terror: </strong> Apparently all of the TSA's new security efforts, including body scanners, pat-downs and no-fly lists proved inaffective against one passenger.</p>

<p><strong>Libia and Gaddafi: </strong> Turmoil in the middle east is something that has sadly become commonplace.   As these events continue to unfold and build on the last the world looks on.  We ask as simple question.  Where is Russia?</p>

<p><strong>The Fake Pop Star: </strong> It has finally been made public.  We have the technology to create virtual people that are completely indistinguishable from the real thing.  How long has this technology existed, and how much of what we see does not exist?</p>

<p><strong>Nuclear Power: </strong> Which came first, the bomb or the power plant?</p>

<p>Until Next Week, Peace Out Humans!</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 69</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Better late than never, the Mind Set Podcast blasts it's way onto the internets!</p>

<p>Controversy, mind control and political correctness are the food presented to the hungry mind in episode 69.</p>

<p>This week Gareth and Alex dive head first into the conspiracy pot, and chew of morsels like:</p>

<p>Surveillance, the secret service, and political correctness in the UK and the birth of Big Brother.</p>

<p>Could the emergence of the "Gay Agenda" be part of a much larger plan to diminish the masculine?</p>

<p>And how does Benny Hill tie into all this?</p>

<p>And did I mention the clips?</p>

<p><strong>Brian Haw: </strong>The long time London protester, passes on.  We Talk about his time on the streets speaking the truth.</p>

<p><strong>Failed Terror Flight:</strong> Those pesky terrorists are apparently up to no good again, and arrests are made...</p>

<p><strong>Ecoli Scare: </strong>Viruses spread. But is it by accident or design?</p>

<p><strong>Same Sex Marriage: </strong>Gay Marriages are now legal in New York.  What was once considered unnatural is now becoming normal.  The Norms in society are changing.  Political correctness?  Mind Control?  or both...</p>

<p><strong>Water for Fuel: </strong>Suppressed technology.  High oil prices.  Cars that run on Water.  We tie it all together.</p>

<p>Until Next Week, Peace Out Humans!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Grab it quickly before the government bans Free Speech!</p>

<p>This week the mind set duo tackle all manner of "new" in the conversational style you've all grown to love.</p>

<p>Talked, Tackled and ranted about this week:</p>

<p><strong>Anonymous Hackers:</strong> The ultra-secret soon to be political hackers group known as "Anonymous" are back in the news, this time with a three-phase plan.</p>

<p><strong>Political Wieners:</strong> A new politcal sex scandal hits the headlines.  But what is really going on behind this soap opera lovers dream News?</p>

<p><strong>Bin Laden Burial:</strong> The U.S. Naval ship that "buried" Bin Laden at sea, returns to Port.</p>

<p><strong>Freeman in the UK: </strong> This is probably one of the most disturbing clips played on the show.  We talk about this issue in depth.</p>

<p><strong>Blue Peter Nazis: </strong>BBC Television Centre is up for sale. Is there a Nazi connection?</p>

<p>And so much more...</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>And we're back!</p>

<p>After a 2 week hiatus, the Mind Set Podcast is back in a big way, as we provide you with a truly mammoth show!</p>

<p>Kicking the show off, Gareth and Alex talk news, conspiracy and surveillance and come to the conclusion that if George Orwell and Aldous Huxley had a child, it would be our currant world.</p>

<p>Lady Gaga, Bono and Symbols are all thrown into the mix to great effect.</p>

<p>Then it was on to the clips:</p>

<p><strong>Delusional Conspiracy:</strong> The "Conspiracy Researcher" has become the crackpot-lunatic over the past 20 years.  Intentional?</p>

<p><strong>Facebook Face recognition: </strong> The massive social network gets the conspiracy treatment, as the continue to compile data on every members life.</p>

<p><strong>Speed Cameras ending?:</strong> Probably wishful thinking on our part, but this "debate" on the relevancy of speed cameras caused food for thought.</p>

<p><strong>Solar Flares: </strong>Amazingly powerful solar flares give rise to talk of Global Warming, and what kind of high tech gadgetry exists in space?</p>

<p><strong>Japan Sinking: </strong>The aftermath of the Japanese earthquake has dropped from the news.  While the disaster continues.  Is this  a news blackout?</p>

<p><strong>Securing the Watchers:</strong> TSA agents about to get scanned.  Background checks, tagging and even the "chipping" of personnel.</p>

<p>Finally the show is wrapped up with a short discussion of Synchronicity.</p>

<p>Until Next Week, Peace Out Humans...</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>And so begins our weekly excursion into all things strange and conspiratorial.  Gareth and Alex delve into this weeks news and spin out in directions unseen.</p>

<p>This discussion begin with the Rapture, a topic that has apparently been on the minds of many over the last week or so. Is the rapture real?  Was the 21st just signaling the beginning of the end?  This topic then spiraled into:</p>

<p><strong>The nature of Good and Evil
<br />UFO's
<br />Alien Abductions
<br />Religion</strong></p>

<p>Then it was onto the clips.</p>

<p><strong>UK farming and the G20:</strong> New UK farming proposal seemingly has its roots in the G20, but British ministers place a very different spin on this fascinating topic.</p>

<p><strong>Earthquakes and Volcanos:</strong> Despite the apparent non-arrival of the Rapture, the Earth may have other ideas.  Just in the last few days quakes and eruptions appear the world over.</p>

<p><strong>Ancient Koran and Bible finds:</strong> In the space of one month, two unrelated religious finds could shed new light on two of the worlds religions.</p>

<p>This of course is nothing but the tip of the parapolitical iceberg, as many more topics are touched on and dissected.</p>

<p>Until Next Time, Peace Out Humans!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Another Mind Set Podcast hits the internet in the hopes of planting seeds and shedding light!</p>

<p>This week Gareth and Alex rambled along a path that is apparently neglected by most, and talked about comfort, pain and what ultimately is real?</p>

<p>Then it was on to the clips.</p>

<p><strong>Spanish Earthquake:</strong> What to make of this one?  All manner of theories are discussed, but what is the true nature of these quakes that seem to be shaking parts of the world regularly.</p>

<p><strong>Borders and Refugees: </strong> This clip sheds some light on the recent refugee influx into Europe, and spurs Alex to present a theory that makes sense, way too much sense...</p>

<p><strong>NY Terror Arrest:</strong> Terror was apparently arrested recently.  A discussion ensured...</p>

<p><strong>Legitimate Governments: </strong>Who decides which world Governments are legitimate or not?</p>

<p><strong>Osama Porn:</strong> In depth discussion concerning Osama's death and his apparent porn collection.  Was this all just a movie playing out, or just more spin to damage a religion?</p>

<p><strong>Tenerife Decapitation:</strong> Very disturbing story concerning a resent public beheading.  A random killing? Or is there a larger story here?</p>

<p>Until Next Time, Please Out Humans...</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 64</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Mind Set Podcast returns with its 64th episode, and what an episode it is!  Gareth is joined by Alex Fate to discuss and deconstruct the latest news headlines.</p>

<p>First up is the sad departure of Mind Set Co-host Peter Glynn from the show, and the reasons behind it.</p>

<p>Also discussed in great depth was the emergence of "pre-crime" arrests in the United Kingdom prior to the Royal Wedding, then it was on to the clips.</p>

<p><strong>The Death of Osama Bin Laden:</strong> Clips were played and Bin Laden's death was examined. Did he really die in May 2011?  Or was this just another example of media manipulation.</p>

<p><strong>The Mississippi River is running backwards: </strong> As strange as this may sound, this famed river is in fact running backwards!  This and other Earth changing events are discussed.  Are we approaching end times or just another phase of control and manipulation?</p>

<p>Images used in this discussion are <a title="May28th-Alignment-London" href="http://www.mindsetcentral.com/images/alinment.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> and <a title="Memphis Pyramid" href="http://www.mindsetcentral.com/images/memphis.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a></p>

<p><strong>Bail out for Portugal:</strong> Another mythical "bail out" hits the headlines, this time for Portugal.  This is just another example of "problem, reaction, solution", as the illusion of finance once again rears its ugly head.</p>

<p><strong>Billboards for GOD:</strong> We end this weeks show with a little religious advertisement.  It's round two of the Atheists Vs. the Theists - Billboard style...</p>

<p>Until Next Time, Peace Out Humans...</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Yeah, we know its a few days late, but we think you'll agree that it was well worth the wait.  With Peter on assignment, Gareth is joined by conspirator extraordinaire Alex Fate to comment on the nonsense that masquerades as news.</p>

<p>Fist up Gareth and Alex take on the up coming Royal Wedding and the coverage that is rapidly impacting all media outlets world wide!</p>

<p><strong>Ali G and Buzz Aldrin: </strong> This is an old clip, a funny clip and above all a very strange clip.  Upon re-watching this old TV Comedy, Gareth asks an important question concerning the Space Program.</p>

<p><strong>Facial Recognition:</strong> This advanced form of software is not only becoming foolproof, but widely availible.  Can not just for governments and law enforcement.</p>

<p><strong>Gun Control:</strong> In the United States the seeds of gun control are once again being planted, as this recent protest in Pasadena, California shows...</p>

<p><strong>Smog: </strong> This form of pollution isn't only restricted to Los Angeles, as Alex lets us in on a new form of fear and control.</p>

<p><strong>Obama Fund Raising: </strong> How can you raise over 4 million dollars in 2 days?  Ask President Obama, he knows.</p>

<p><strong>Saddam and Gaddafi:</strong> The final clip of the show is a bomb shell, and not to be missed.  Here Alex provides some though provoking evidence as to why we are really invading the Middle East.</p>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 62</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Episode 62 of the Mind Set Podcast once again hits the internet with a show that deals with all the weird and wacky conspiracy stories floating around the media outlets.  But unlike the mainstream, Gareth and Peter dissect and reassemble in order to reveal the hidden truths behind the agenda being played out before our very eyes.
<br />
<!--more-->
<br />First up - in depth discussion about two major characters involved in the Truther Movement.  Alex Jones and Jesse Ventura are two of the popular broadcasters on air - but how much of a difference are they making in waking up the majority?</p>

<p>Next - the News.</p>

<p><strong>Gender Agenda: </strong> The first gay caveman has been unearthed in the Czech Republic. How is this tied into a one world sex to compliment a one world religion and a one world order?</p>

<p><strong>Census Returns:</strong> 29,000 enforcers are starting to knock on doors. Is this a prime example of how we, the minions, are policing / controlling each other?</p>

<p><strong>Ufo-tastic:</strong> Where will YOU be booking your vacation this year?  Mindset provides the fabbest places on Planet Earth to catch sight of an Alien Craft.  Not 'arf!</p>

<p>Finally - The Clips.</p>

<p><strong>It's Full Of Peppery Goodness: </strong> - No, not a finger of fudge but a story around a little boy with behavioral problems who was pepper sprayed in class after kicking off in an aggressive manner towards his teachers.</p>

<p><strong>This Is Not A Drill..  repeat... : </strong> Actually it is.  NYC is locked down in a 24 style drill to prepare or prevent a radiology attack.</p>

<p><strong>Space Race:</strong> Exactly why is the space race over? Or indeed, is it actually over?  And who was the Mayan female unearthed on the Moon?</p>

<p>Below is the clip Gareth talked about on the show.  What do you think?</p>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 61</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Random yet structured discourse in order to destroy the big machine that is The New World Order.  Yes folks, The Mindset Podcast is back with Episode 61 in which Gareth and Peter discuss all the crazy news stories hidden in plain sight.</p>

<p><strong>Birth Decrease: </strong>Why are the Powers That Be pursuing the misconception (pun intended) that people are no longer having babies because of the 'recession'?</p>

<p><strong>Outdoor Kids: </strong>A Seattle Kindergarten provides children with an outdoors experience as they receive an important education rolling around in the mud and learning about birdsong.</p>

<p><strong>Census UK 2011:</strong> Any hidden agenda behind this 10 yearly event?  Or is it a sly way to grab info hidden from the Government(s)</p>

<p><strong>UK Flagship on Ebay: </strong> HMS Ark Royal up for sale, start price $1.  Buyer beware! Highest bidder wins.  What if it's Libya?</p>

<p><strong>The Price is Right:</strong> Goods are going up up up. So how do we bring the prices down?  Mindset has the definitive answer.</p>

<p><strong>Italian UFO:</strong> Poor footage of lights over Naples has sparked mainstream interest on aliens from another world.  But why will they not show incontrovertible filmed evidence?</p>

<p><strong>Sammy Hagar's Aliens: </strong>Rock Legend Sammy discusses his experience on a talk show.  What is the real question that should be asked?  And why is it never asked?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Unholy Trinity of Gareth, Alex and Peter present for you delectation, Episode 60 of The Mind Set Podcast!</p>

<p>A show designed to stimulate thought, discussion and open-mindedness.</p>

<p>And what an AWESOME episode we have lined up this week.</p>

<p><strong>Death!</strong> Always a good place to begin, and our genial LA Host Gareth describes his near fatal collision and some weird occurances in the lead up to his Grim Reaper moment.</p>

<p><strong>Taxes: </strong>The other certainty in life is the revenues collected by the Government Collective. So how does tax fit in with the Global Conspiracy to destroy a section of our once cohesive society?</p>

<p><strong>Gas Prices:</strong> The UK Government has acted quickly to reduce the price of petrol - discover here how much the price has reduced this week.</p>

<p><strong>Libya and Brocolli:</strong> What evidence is there that the NWO Region called the EU is orchestrating the attack on Libya. Only a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Japan: </strong> Natural or Unnatural?  Is it feasible that dark forces caused the tragedy now unfolding in one of the West's closest allies?</p>

<p>Alex's article predicting the financial meltdown of Japan is <a href="http://www.mindsetcentral.com/archives/2431" target="_blank">Here</a></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Episode 59 of the Mind Set Podcast continues to bring cutting edge conversation, news and views to those of a conspiratorial bent.</p>

<p>We kick off this weeks show with an in-depth discussion concerning Peters exit from his very popular "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/peterjohnglynn" target="_blank">Political Rant</a>" video blog on YouTube, and how paranoia can adversely affect the truth seeker.

<strong>The Japanese Earthquake:</strong> Described by the PM of Japan as the worst catastrophe to hit the country since the end of the Second World War, Gareth and Peter look at the shocking devastation and dissect what could be at play.</p>

<p><strong>Libya:</strong> Colonel Gadhaffi seemingly clings to power as battles rages betwixt the armed forces loyal to his regime and 'The Militia'.  - but is all as it seems in the civil war now playing out on our television screens?</p>

<p><strong>Bully for you:</strong> President Obama and Michele Obama initiate a Facebook campaign to counter bullying in schools. How far ahead (or behind) is this initiative?</p>

<strong>Mister Freeze: </strong>LA has been hit by freezing conditions, compounded with hailstones. Weather Wars? Proof of Climate Change?</p>

<p><strong>Cross My Palm With Silver ( Paypal accepted):</strong> Psychic phenomena and ability. Is this real, manipulation or complete bullshine? The guys discuss and agree to disagree.
<br />
<strong>
<br />A Fishy Tale</strong>: Old favourite,  the Loch Ness Monster, has made an appearance in another body of water in the UK. Bowness on Windermere in Cumbria now boasts a sighting ( and decent photographic proof ) of a humped water creature, going by the media led moniker of Bownessie. This made the news in the USA and the UK.</p>

<p>Next it was clip time!</p>

<p><strong>Bahrain Demonstrations</strong> - the agenda is rapidly coming to a climax , with pro-western Middle Eastern states now undergoing 'popular' revolutions. What IS the end game for the powerful elite?</p>

<p><strong>President Palin</strong> - USA picks for the next Supremo is heading towards a shoot off betwixt the fragrant Sarah and the former firm female favourite Hillary.
<br />
<strong>
<br />UK Voting System Change</strong> - no change as it happens , tinkering at best and at worst cementing the UK in to the one party system that is controlled by the NWO.</p>

<p><strong>ISS Enterprise</strong> - the European Arianne Rocket blasts off from French Guiana... It's mission - to boldly collect rubbish and recycle in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>With Peter on assignment, Mind Set Alum Alex Fate jumped in to save the day and provide us with a superb show, a show sure to kick start the thinking part of the brain.</p>

<p>Diving straight into the unusual without missing a beat, Alex talks in depth about a recently discovered Moon mystery, and what a mystery it is!</p>

<p>Moon Pictures <a href="http://www.mindsetcentral.com/images/moon-move.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>An unseen hand in Egypt?</strong>: With the Egyptian revolution over, and a new beginning for the country on the horizon, we talk about a possible end game for the restructuring of the Middle East.  Could this be the start of NWO empire building?</p>

<p><strong>Algeria Next?:</strong> Building on the previous story, it seems that the country of Algeria might me next in the plan to re-shape the Middle East.</p>

<p><strong>Clinton and the Mysterious Ambassador recall:</strong> With the United States collective eyes firmly planted on the "ball", something very sinister took place during Super Bowl Sunday.  We discuss this very strange event, and wonder what really maybe going on.</p>

<p>QDDR document <a href="http://www.mindsetcentral.com/documents/QDDR.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a></p>

<p><strong>High Speed Rail:</strong> Whats the deal?  Strange current push for high speed trains in the United States and Europe, we wonder why the move from Airlines?</p>

<p><strong>Russian Terrorist:</strong> From the United States and Europe, all the way to the Middle East and Russia, terrorism is the current boogey man.  To illustrate the this fact, we present a photograph of the number one Russian Terrorist currently at large.</p>

<p>Russian Terrorist Doku Umarov <a href="http://www.mindsetcentral.com/images/RussianTerrorist.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a></p>

<p><strong>United Kingdom Big Society: </strong> A new push by the UK government to place power in to local committees.  Sound too good to be true? We talk about why this move is nothing more that a con, but an ingenuous one at that!</p>

<p>The Anonymous Hacking Group:  The hacking group who defended Wikileaks, and have attacked major corporations and the FBI are discussed.  We also touch upon the Internet kill switch, and deep underground computer networks.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Episode 54 of the Mind Set Podcast, and Peter is back from his deathbed to join Gareth in a rip roaring show to tickle your paranoid nerve endings.  Yes, Lazarus may have come forth, but the MSC is first amongst equals when it comes to conspiracy discussion.</p>

<p>A number of political resignations have stirred the Westminster village pot - Shadow Chancellor Alan Johnson resigns his post, quickly followed by Andy Coulson, Director of Communications for David Cameron PM. Lord Strathclyde - mention of whom was made in connection with our owners ( Foundation X) - hits the tabloids.</p>

<p>And finally the arrest of next door neighbour of the murdered Jo Yeates.  No, not the old geezer, but a different one this week.</p>

<p>Finally we had time for the clips:</p>

<p><strong>Journey's End:</strong> A plan by US Pastor Terry Jones, of Koran burning notoriety, to travel to the UK has been thwarted after the British Government banned his entry into the country.  Whilst tumbleweed blew and crickets chirruped in USA media outlets in response to the story, the UK media milked it like a swollen cow.  Why?</p>

<p><strong>Lasers On Stun:</strong> Accounts of lasers lights from ground level aimed at aircraft is being reported as an epidemic in the USA.  What are the purposes of these laser lights?  And what technology is out there to track from whence these beams are shone?</p>

<p><strong>The Enemy:</strong> Bin Laden threatens French hostages unless France withdraws from Afghanistan.  But who pulls the strings on this development?</p>

<p><strong>Lonely Among Us:</strong> Hidden agents within protests groups are now to be considered 'the norm', this following the disclosure of an undercover officer assigned for se7en years in the ranks of Environment protestors in the UK.</p>

<p><strong>Cost of Living: </strong>Changes to the NHS in the UK have released Big Pharma into the equation which adds up to the destruction of that quintessential UK concept - free health care for all in the UK at the point of need.</p>

<p>Until Next Week, Peace Out Humans!</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 53</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Mind Set Podcast once again springs in to weekly life, with another fact filled show aimed squarely at the thinking part of your brain!</p>

<p>Unfortunately fellow mind-setter and co-host Peter Glynn was a little under the weather this week and unable to make it to the show.  But luckily for us all Mind Set alum Alex Fate volunteered to fill Peters very large shoes, and provided us with an entertaining and thought provoking Episode 53.</p>

<p>We talked about all manner of subjects, from Gabrielle Giffords attempted assassination by "maniac" Jared  Lee Loughner and visual spin placed on this news item, to the possible beatification of Pope John Paul II and UK Thug Dogs roaming the British streets.</p>

<p>Then it was on to these tasty morsels.</p>

<p><strong>Tunisia-Revolution:</strong> Violent Chaos has recently erupted in this African country, prompting President Zine El Abidine Ben Al to be removed from power and flee the country.  Public awakening or a stepping stone to NWO?</p>

<p><strong>Obama's Sermon:</strong> A recent speech by the President concerning the attempted assassination Gabrielle Giffords, has painted his presidency in a very positive light.  We dissect the speech and talk about its religious overtones.</p>

<p><strong>Haiti-One year on:</strong> Has it really been one year?  One year and what has happened to the country?  Is is it on the road to recovery?</p>

<p><strong>New Astrology:</strong> A new Astrological sign has recently been "discovered", or has it?  Here we talk about astrology and serpents...</p>

<p><strong>China's Stealth Fighter: </strong>The contradiction of a stealth fighter in public news is talked about here, the the possible posturing by China on the world stage.</p>

<p>Thanks again to Alex, and get well soon Peter.</p>

<p>Until next week, Peace Out Humans!</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 52</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to 2011 and welcome to The Mindset Podcast, after a short break to celebrate the festive season.</p>

<p>And what a show we have for our avid listeners this week.</p>

<p>A two hour special saw the dastardly duo joined by occasional co-presenter Alex Fate, creating an Unholy Trinity of Conspiratorial Connoisseurs.</p>

<p>First off - the future:  Ok, so the Mayan Calendar suggests we have little over a year before the world as we know it will cease to exist.  So what do the guys believe will happen once that date is reached?</p>

<p>Latest news was discussed by Gareth and Peter, including the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords and 12 others in a mass shooting in Arizona USA.
<br />Fear is the key as London undergoes lock-down as the terror threat is raised.
<br />And the murder of Joanna Yeats is investigated and dissected.
<br />Tough topics all, and a sorry old start to the New Year.</p>

<p>Add to this discussion on food price rises, the whys and wherefores of de-skilling and cash-for-gold shark infestations across the western world, and THIS is one bumper show.</p>

<p>We also had time for some clips!</p>

<p><strong>Flu! </strong>Yes, this old chestnut is back.  Two different takes on the news reporting from the US and UK, and a possible motive, tied into Big Pharma is up for consideration.</p>

<p><strong>Which Tax?</strong> 'Spell' it right! Witches are now being targeted for tax in Rumania, a country which takes its supernatural beliefs very seriously.</p>

<p><strong>Censor!</strong> No, not the things you walk through in airports and at crossing points in the road.  This (spelt correctly) deals with the Huckleberry Finn book censorship now hitting schools and homes in the USA.</p>

<p>And a splendid time was had by all!</p>

<p>Until Next Week, Peace Out Humans!</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 49</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Mindset Podcast has been up and running for a whole year and to celebrate this amazing achievement, Gareth &amp; Peter bring you a fascinating show dedicated to all the real news behind the fake news from the past, er, week.</p>

<p>So much has been happening in the world of conspiracy, with some dark dangers reported by the mainstream. G&amp;P delve waist deep to break the stories down to their very basis.</p>

<p><strong>Cold Snap:</strong> Up go heating prices just in time for the big freeze in the UK.  Big Bear may be rubbing it's hands but in Britain, granny may be forced to turn off the gas.</p>

<p><strong>Life's A Bitch:</strong> The EU features heavily in latest news stories.  The bankrupting of the Irish Republic and the bail out from the UK is discussed and explained.</p>

<p><strong>Local Shopping Defeats The NWO:</strong> Pastor Billy rants on cue for the mainstream.  Is this a truth that is best hidden by having circus performers doing the explaining?</p>

<p><strong>North and South:</strong> No, not the classic TV show by John Jakes, but the ongoing tensions in Korea, where reports are saying that recent shelling of a disputed island is the worst incident since the end of the Korean War in 1953.  Four people ( two civilians) were killed.</p>

<p><strong>Christmas Tree Jihad:</strong> A Fed Sting Op over many months has secured the arrest of a Somalian born teenager, cultivated by the authorities to set off a FBI bomb in Portland, Oregon.  What is the end game?</p>

<p><strong>Taliban Imposter: </strong>Who he?  No one knows but MI6 presented him at peace talks as a representative of the Talibani Resistance.  The murky Mullah then disappeared with heaps of cash, leaving eggs on faces.  All done in our name.</p>

<p>Until Next Week, Peace Out Humans!</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 48</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Mindset Podcast returns with a longer than usual offering, detailing and discussing many of the para-political stories that infests this wild, crazy and sometimes disturbing planet of ours.</p>

<p>But first, here is the news....</p>

<p>Prince William is to marry long time sweet heart Kate Middleton. The heir to the heir to the Throne has the MSM in a frenzy.</p>

<p>Recession? What recession?  An elitist gives the game away.</p>

<p>NICE replaced by Nasty. The Mindset Gang of Two reveal all.</p>

<p>Spirits are high as Peter discovers a non mainstream meeting of like minded folks.</p>

<p>Next, the clips are dissected:</p>

<p><strong>TSA:</strong> The minions are revolting and the PWB are insistent that bodies will continued to be groped.  We ask the purpose of it all.</p>

<p><strong>Green Obama:</strong> Golf Carts seem a environmentally friendly way of travelling to meetings.  But what was it that the USA Head of State used to meet and greet the Portuguese Premier?</p>

<p><strong>Not So Bonny:</strong> Loch Lomond, Scotland, was the scene of a potential terror event. Gareth and Peter don the tartan to investigate this incident.</p>

<p><strong>President Palin:</strong> Obama's gaffes may pale into insignificance (geddit) is the soccer Mom enters the White House.  Is this actually possible?</p>

<p><strong>Quick, Let's Hide!:</strong> An unknown tribe has been discovered in Amazonia.  What (apart from KFC) can modern day man offer these poor unfortunates?</p>

<p><strong>Sex and Fear:</strong> Chainsaw wielding offenders are gathering in SoCal.  Not really, but the TV News reports it anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Agenda 21:</strong> Sustainable Development.  Fluffy bunny UN mandates or a threat to mankind?</p>

<p>Until Next Week, Peace Out Humans!</p>]]></description>

<p>Alex is a self described Free  Thinker, Artist and Author who has added greatly to the growing tapestry of this site and its media projects.</p>

<p>But Alex is also very much a man of mystery, concealing his true identity from only a tiny few.</p>

<p>His videos are not only thought provoking and entertaining, but there is also a dark quality to them that boarders on the disturbing.  This of course does nothing more that make you think about not only who Alex is, but to also to focus on his message.</p>

<p>Back in September 2010, I sat down with Alex Fate and discussed his views, origins and his conspiracies...</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Coming At Ya!</p>

<p>Yes, the Mind Set Podcast returns for it's weekly show where news items are dissected and discussed from a conspiracy viewpoint.  Episode 47 is chock full of clips and opinions and a few rants to help liven up proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>Food Prices:</strong> What is the REAL story behind these incredible rises in the cost of food commodities.  Is there an agenda at play? Is it SOLELY about the money?</p>

<p><strong>The Destruction Of Art and Theatre:</strong> Why is funding of this essential human trait being cut?  Why were Local Authorities so keen to buy into projects in the first instance?  Is it SOLELY to save money in this fake recession?</p>

<p><strong>India - USA Trade: </strong>A glimpse of what is happening across the planet as Globalization digs deep into the pilfering of local economies.  Is this story an indication of the long term destruction of Western Economies?</p>

<p><strong>USA Printing Money: </strong>Tin pot dictatorships and Fascist regimes all loved to use 'quantative easing' in order to pursue their nasty agenda. The UK printed like crazy last year.  Now the USA are following suit.</p>

<p><strong>The Michael Jackson Conspiracy:</strong> Is there a dark, meaningful reason behind the life and death of the Prince of Pop?   Gareth may have uncovered a truth.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Spook-tastic! - Halloween Special
<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>Episode 46 of The Mindset Podcast, recorded on All Hallow's Eve (Halloween), is chock-a-block full of the para-political, together with the paranormal that abounds on Halloween, almost a public holiday in the USA and the UK.</p>

<p>First though, Gareth and Peter discussed the week's news, including the One World Government agenda, the EU and the letter bomb events in US and UK airports.
<br />
<strong>
<br />Carry On Screaming: </strong>Al Qaida is reported as being behind the airmail bomb threats to US Synagogues. G&amp;P dissect the many questions behind this story.</p>

<p><strong>Thriller: </strong> TSA pat-downs aplenty at the Airports and again this needs putting into context.  Is all that it seems?</p>

<p><strong>Dressed To Thrill:</strong> Huge supermarkets are springing up to bring the costumes that the masses are demanding.</p>

<p><strong>Walking Dead: </strong>West Hollywood is sealed off so that people can party on. Is there a refuge?</p>

<p><strong>Zombieland:</strong> How do you survive an attack of the brain munchers?  The answer lies within.</p>

<p><strong>Who's Afraid Of The Dark?:</strong> The dangers of Halloween - and who is behind the fear factor.</p>

<p><strong>Witch Form?</strong> Catching old hags is a business that is as old as the Salem Witch Hunts.  How relevant is the past to present day business of Government?</p>

<p><strong>Sam Hain!: </strong>The traditions of Halloween are discussed and poked at with a long stick.</p>

            <title>Mind Set Radio: Halloween Witch</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this interview from October 2004, I talk to Patricia Trujillo about being a practicing Witch in 21st Century Los Angeles, and what drew her to Wicca and the practice of Magic.</p>

<p>Pat also talks in depth about the significance of  Halloween in the Wicca calendar, and her innate skill in using the Ouija Board to contact the dead.</p>

<p>A truly fascinating conversation from the 2004 Halloween season that is still more that relevant today.</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 45</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Episode 45 brings you Gareth and Peter once again in conversation about many of the stories making the headlines across the globe - together with a sprinkling of news being hidden from view.</p>

<p>Updates from the Taliban news of months ago was reported, and it appears that Mullah Baradar, the 'enemy's' Chief of Military Operations, has been released by the Pakistani authorities, seemingly on the say so of the US and Western Alliance Administration.</p>

<p>Haiti makes the news, albeit hidden deep in local outlets. Cholera is now decimating the capital city, this on the heels of the devastating earthquake earlier in the year.</p>

<p>Next we entered the clip zone:</p>

<p><strong>Obama Rally</strong>: A change of emphasis for the US President who is attacking the 'Government' in order to keep his own position tenable.</p>

<p><strong>Diva Bot</strong>: Aliens walk amongst, so why not robots? Japan have released Diva Bot, an all singing, all dancing chick-bot that is hard to differentiate from a human - except for the metal legs.</p>

<p><strong>Proposal 23 Advert:</strong> Not allowed in the UK, political propaganda messages pop up all over the USA mainstream.</p>

<p><strong>Kids and Alcohol:</strong> The Alcohol Awareness Government funded body in the UK seems to be ignoring the target and simply demonizing drinkers and alcohol in general.</p>

<p><strong>Earthquake Alert!: </strong> Light hearted news reports in LA of ' not when but if' helped push Quake Packs to survive the imminent cataclysmic event.</p>

<p><strong>Space Port: </strong>New Mexico is home to Earth's first airport to the stars. Is this a confidence trick?  How relevant is it to Man's conquest of space - the final frontier?  And what is the name of the craft to take tourists into sub orbit?</p>

<p><strong>Gay Army Issue:</strong> Bill Hicks says it best and that was in 1994.  A deep meaning discussion helps unravel some of the crazy opinions around this topic.</p>

<p>Spook out  dudes! Next week we hold a Halloween Special!</p>

<p>Do NOT miss it!</p>

<p>Until Next Week, Peace Out Humans!</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 44</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Gareth and Peter clambered out of their respective underground chambers to bring you Episode 44 (dig the numerology) of The Mindset Podcast.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of Presidents and cameras, the twosome brought out some great clips and presented some epic discussions for the awaiting masses.</p>

<p><strong>French Take To The Streets:</strong> The cuts and price rises has brought out over 3.5M people onto the streets across the country.  But why only in France?  The worldwide shenanigans of the Powers That Be has failed to ignite the imaginations of the masses in the UK and USA. Again, why?</p>

<p><strong>Wind-power To The People!:</strong> Google is funding a massive green initiative.  G&amp;P consider the confidence trick around this agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Mormonics:</strong> Adverts are now airing between News Shows.  Though not allowed in the UK, the USA does seem open to this sort of thing.  A rabid discourse about advertising in general made this an unmissable topic.</p>

<p><strong>The World's Longest:</strong> Crazy times for Mother Earth as more and more drilling takes place across the globe. What is the Masonic / Esoteric influence behind these events.  And how does the story of the Chilean Miners fit into these rituals?</p>

<p><strong>The View:</strong> Eyes right as ultra conservative celebrity broadcaster Bill O'Rielly causes a furore which caused some "Whoopie" (pun intended) in the studio.</p>

<p><strong>Walk For AIDS:</strong> What a difference an issue makes. Health and Big Pharma is hot for discussion, with no breakfast consumed during the pair's ramblings.</p>

<p>Until Next Week, Peace Out Humans.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Gareth and Peter emerged from their slumbers to bring Episode 43 to the masses, crying out for real news analysis and commentary.</p>

<p>Illness prevented genial host Gareth for staying too long away from his sick bed.  Administering nursing care from afar, Peter supplied clips and news stories from across the globe and the twosome exchanged some words of wisdom, paranoia and naivety on the following topics.</p>

<p><strong>Taking the Biscuit:</strong> Amazing! What on earth has happened to society when a worker paid to look after children at meal times is harassed by the very people paying her, simply because she gave a cookie to a child?</p>

<p><strong>Taser Quest:</strong> Stunning! Cops in Australia taser a guy for refusing to strip.  Is it time for tasers to be banned?</p>

<p><strong>Terror Tactics: </strong>Bullshine! The EU became annoyed after the Obama Admin issued terror attack alerts to Berlin, Paris, London and Japan.</p>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 42</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>"There are more questions than answers."
<br /> 
<br />So the old song goes and maybe, just maybe, The Mindset Podcast Episode 42 goes some way to providing an explanation on many of the crazy stories springing forth from the Mainstream News.
<br /> 
<br />This week, Gareth and Peter discuss matters relating not only to the parapolitical but also the paranormal together with the downright weird as reported on the news outlets.
<br /> 
<br />Last week's discussion about The Dark Shadow provided a springboard for the hosts to talk about the recent health of the UK and reports of strange dreams being experienced by the populace.
<br /> 
<br />Next, the dominant sex. Another female becomes leader of a powerful nation. Is there a purpose behind appointing women figureheads?
<br /> 
<br />And then - the EU experiment project in the Republic Of Ireland. Is the country now about to implode from their seven years of fat?
<br /> 
<br />End Times - a plague of locusts may be devastating one of the biggest harvest providers on Planet Earth- a symptom of weather change is effecting those pesky varmints gobbling all the crops in Australia.
<br /> 
<br />Phew! Then we got onto the News Clips:
<br /> 
<br />M.Othman : The reference is obvious (so they are laughing at us) but what exactly is going on with the appointment of a UN Astrophysicist as Ambassador to Alien Visitors? Does this tie in with the volte face mainstream thoughts on UFO and ET?
<br /> 
<br />Weather Alert: Gareth is hot!  Extreme searing heat and rapid flood conditions hit South California. Is there a reason for these record breaking, off the scale phenomena?
<br /> 
<br />One World : Language is the latest target of the NWO. What does it mean for immigrants and natives?
<br /> 
<br />WW2 Experiments: Just when you thought it was the bad guys who were doing all the nasty stuff, an official statement is released admitting similar atrocities in the Allied Countries.
<br /> 
<br />Terror's Back!  Usama Bin Laden, Al Quaeda and Government Warnings abound in news transmissions. What is the reasoning behind this sudden increased in supposed threats?
<br /> 
<br />Until Next Week, Peace Out Humans!</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 41</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This oft-times disturbing planet of ours sometimes - nay, ALWAYS- throws up some strange stories and phenomena.  And Episode 41 began with the weird story of The Dark Shadow, courtesy of co-host Gareth Davies.  Are unexplained happenings occuring to us all - are some more prone- or are some just more open minded to delve deeper into events that have no rational explanation?
<br /> 
<br />News out of the UK is headed by the mainstream with the election of Ed Miliband (he's the other one) as leader of New Labour - part of the one party state Government in the Totalitarian State that was once called the United Kingdom.
<br /> 
<br />Tweeting can be bad for your life, so be careful.  Twitter's Paul Chamber found himself in deep waters after joking in exasperation that his planned flight from the UK was delayed by snow. Convicted under Terrorism Legislation, Mr. Chambers is undergoing an appeal against his conviction - and has lost two jobs simply in the process.
<br /> 
<br />Next we head out to the clips.  Donning hoodies, G&P delved into Anti Social Behaviour.  Why is this (again) raising its head in Government circles?  Is the rise in this behaviour caused on purpose or by accident?  And what could this umbrella term mean for you and your life style.
<br /> 
<br />Halloween is almost upon us.  Stores are popping up everywhere as more and more are celebrating what was 'All Soul's Day'.  Is the UK about to follow suit to this celebration which lies big in the USA calendar?
<br /> 
<br />We have lift off!  A not-so-secret secret rocket launch was reported on mainstream but what is the real purpose of revealing secrets to a gullible populace?
<br /> 
<br />And finally... God And Guns...
<br /> 
<br />What will become of the right to bear arms in the USA?  The UK has a culture of non-ownership, whilst a sub-culture runs riot with illegal arms.  Fully loaded, the guys discuss the implications of a Christian protest outside of a gun shop in Philly.
<br /> 
<br />Until next week, Peace out Humans.</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 40</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>All aboard the Mindset-Mobile for a one way journey to Conspiracy-Ville!  Yes, the Mindset Podcast is back after a week's break to discuss all the news and events - but with an open mind and a different slant.</p>

<p>Cross your legs!  The trip began with news that Southern Railway Company is now building trains without toilets.  The whys and wherefores of this bizarre initiative were investigated.</p>

<p>Flushed with success, the next stage of the voyage was spent talking about the Powers That Be in the UK encouraging drivers to report the transgressions of fellow road users. Amazingly, Sussex Police have received 20000 reports from minions resulting in over 2500 letters being sent out to perps.</p>

<p>Finally, asteroid alert!  A meteorite hit the country of Columbia, but there is high suspicion surrounding this news item.  Discover the real story behind this event which the Mainstream refused to cover.</p>

<p>The Clips were mainly dominated by the visit of Pope Benedict to the UK.</p>

<p>The Papal Visit.  Is there a conspiracy within a conspiracy?  What is the purpose of the Pontiff visiting the one country where he is likely to be protested against?  Does MSC have the answer?  Let us know your thoughts.</p>

<p>Smokin'! 2 year old caught smoking drugs.  Nasty, yes. But why is this presented as national news?  Is the MSM worthy of it's name?</p>

<p>Run, run, run!  A parrot was arrested along with some humans by police agencies in Columbia.  More deflections from our news organisations.</p>

<p>Until next week, Peace Out Humans!</p>]]></description>

            <title>Mind Set Radio: The Reptile Ritual</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this interview from September 2005, I talk to TV host Wayne Johnson about all things Spiritual and Conspiracy. Wayne was the creator and host of the San Deigo base Cable show "World Peace Now!", in which he interview a large number of conspiracy researchers including the likes of David Icke and Brian Desborough.  In this interview Wayne talks in depth about the reptilian phenomenon, and how it relates to Satanic ritual abuse.</p>

<p>Sadly Wayne passed away in March 2006 from Cancer, at the time of this interview Wayne did not know he was ill and was making plans  to bring his cable show to the internet.  Unfortunalty this did not happen...</p>

<p>Wayne was committed to peace and exposing the hidden agenda that permeates all of our lives.</p>

<p>Brian Desborough wrote about Waynes death on his site, and you get read it <a href="http://www.briansbetterworld.com/articles/Wayne%20Johnson%20Obituary.htm" target="_blank">Here</a></p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 39</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Episode 39 entered stage left with a show about the circus and drama that seems to engulf the world wide political system and elite.  All the world's a stage and we are the puppets on a very fragile string.</p>

<p>After genial greetings, Gareth and sidekick Peter discussed news from around the planet Earth.</p>

<p>Quake-Watch!  No, not a new TV Nature Programme featuring Bill Oddie but an eye on earthquake activity around the globe. This time New Zealand has been 'attacked' with the same force that devastated Haiti.</p>

<p>Tax!  Her Majesty's Revenue has severely messed up, owing a few a little, and now demanding of the majority the most.  If we boob on our tax returns, it's Bubba plus soap - however, they can do whatever.</p>

<p>Methane Alert!  Heaps of the stuff has been discovered under the Antarctic and it is twelve times more deadly to the climate than carbon.  And it's leaking out.</p>

<p>Next we entered the clips:</p>

<p>Offensive Bumper Stickers: Honk your hooters for Palin! Beep if you love the Lord (not Mandelson).  Sears have managed to upset a lot of parents with a sexual reference to Honours Students.</p>

<p>Oil Alert! Another US Oil Rig goes BOOM! and no one asks the obvious..." Who blew it up?" Once we know who did, we will know the reason why.</p>

<p>Blair Book Signing: The Circus rolled into Dublin with a seemingly howling mob baying at the former PM and showering him with eggs and sandals (none hit or got anywhere near.)</p>

<p>Elite and Genealogy: Cameron PM has presented his offspring to the common herd, but who voted for the child? Why do British PM's now have to have a baby whilst in power?</p>

<p>Until next week, Peace Out Humans!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's Round Table time again here on Planet Mindset, and with not a little green man in sight.</p>

<p>Hosts Gareth Davies and Peter Glynn were joined in their capsule by regulars Dorian Bryan, Alex Fate and Steve "Piration" in the ultimate discussion on all things 'Space'.</p>

<p>Everything (well, almost) was probed along a linear timeline.</p>

<p><strong>The Origins of Man:</strong> Who are we?  How long have we been here?  Where have we come from?  And where are we going?</p>

<p><strong>The Moon:</strong> Earth's nearest companion and our fascination with her - but what dark secrets does she hold?</p>

<p><strong>Mars: </strong>The Red Planet with new hidden treasures now being unearthed.  Has evidence of a past civilisation been uncovered?</p>

<p><strong>The Secret Space Program:</strong> Extra terrestrial officers, invisible moon shots - what is being hidden from us?</p>

<p>And of course...</p>

<p><strong>UFOs:</strong> But do we want to believe a little too much?</p>

<p>Until next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>Mind Set Radio: The Bell Ringer</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this evening I received a phone call from someone I had not spoken or heard from in almost five years.  I was very surprised to hear from this person, but also very pleased.  The person I'm referring to is Truth Seeker/Bell Ringer Jesse Easter.</p>

<p>Jesse has been asking questions about the "Grand Conspiracy" since the late sixties, and was close friends with Wayne Johnson, creator and presenter of the classic San Diego cable TV show "World Peace Now!".</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to meet and interview Wayne before is untimely death back in 2006, and both Jesse and Wayne opened many eyes to reality of the "lie".</p>

<p>Back in 2005 Mind Set Central was just beginning to dip it's toes into the then fledgling media of Podcasting, and I interviewed many people involved with the Parapolitical, and published the audio online under the heading of Mind Set Radio.</p>

<p>So here is an interview from the past, an interview that is sadly still very relevant.  Jesse Easter talks to Mind Set Radio in May, 2005.</p>

<p>Enjoy...</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 37</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Gareth and Peter were off and running with this weeks show,  investigating a lot of serious issues effecting the planet, while also exploring  some dark topics.</p>

<p>With UK collage A Level results published this week, the guys dissected the education system of the UK and USA.  Also the Dr. David Kelly suicide story keeps rumbling on - and the 70 year gagging order only adds fuel to the fire and screams 'cover up' to any that care to listen.</p>

<p>The clips began with the Bonnie and Clyde arrest in the USA.  This generated further discussion on the Rauol Moat affair.  Gareth tried to get his head around why anyone would feel that Moat is a hero to many eyes.  Peter offered an explanation, but the LA based guru wasn't buying it.</p>

<p>Elections are in the offing in the USA and Terminator star A. Schwarzenegger has been ranting about the border between the USA and Mexico.  What is the agenda here?</p>

<p>Next up a Mickey Mouse tale of a woman who is taking the company to court for preventing her from wearing the Hijab. The story is covered from every angle.</p>

<p>Iraq - the last combat troops have withdrawn.  So presumably the remaining tens of thousands are there without weaponry?</p>

<p>Israel and Palestine have had the pleasure of Hillary Clinton.  Has the NWO gone back to basics after the 'war without end' scenario that the planet was facing over the past 15 years?</p>

<p>Until next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 36</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Gareth and Peter exited Carls Jr. and hit the airwaves once more to bring news and discussion about the stories hitting the mainstream media - and Episode 36 went large with all sorts of issues up for dissection.</p>

<p>Bees seem to be making a comeback. Forget honey, it is now all about the sting. Bee Venom is apparently the new Botox, all at the great price of £11 a shot.</p>

<p>What lies above the political structure? Is there a Mister Big? A Doctor Evil? A 'Pindar'? Gareth gives his considered opinion on those that control the agenda.</p>

<p>Next up - the clips.</p>

<p><strong>Gay Marriage </strong>- whilst not on the radar in the UK, this has been a big issue in the USA as California bids to allow same sex couples to marry.</p>

<p><strong>Ground Zero</strong> - both presenters has selected this as a topic. What is behind this idea that a Mosque be erected near to the September 11th site?</p>

<p><strong>Obama's Oil Swim</strong> - the 'here today  gone tomorrow' oil spill in the Gulf is suspicious on a number of levels. We discuss the scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Kelly Inquest Call</strong> - the UK Weapons Inspector suicide is suspicious, though is their a whiff of political revenge? And will this help muddy the waters still further?</p>

<p><strong>Pakistan Floods</strong> - what will become of what was last month a HUGE problem area in the fight against 'international terrorism'?  20 million folk displaced and homeless will mean that Pakistan will not be the same country as it was.</p>

<p>We ponder weather control. Half the planet burns, the other half drowns.</p>

<p>On that happy note</p>

<p>Until next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 35</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Greetings Earthlings!</p>

<p>Gareth and Peter - separated by an ocean once again - are back to enthrall you with reports and news clips of a conspiratorial nature.</p>

<p>Avoiding probes of earthly (and unearthly) origin, the para-political partnership opened Episode 35 of The Mindset Podcast with news on Gareth's security tribulations on returning to LAX, USA.</p>

<p>The Mid Wales Meet Up was also discussed as were some thoughts on control through words and music.</p>

<p>Next we dived into the clips - with an extraterrestrial theme running through the show.</p>

<p>What have Wales, Churchill and Tony Blair got in common?  Three stories that hit the main-steam concerning the cover up of UFO sightings - and in one case an actual crash landing.   As the UK opens up its 30 year and 50 year history embargo to the common man, we discuss the whys and wherefores.</p>

<p>Food, the ultimate weapon.  How to dominate mankind?  Turn off his food supply.  Grain is now in the control of one company - reports indicate that a trader for this company has ordered one Superpower to stop exporting it.  Why?</p>

<p>Reports are emerging of an attempt on the life of President Ahmadinejad of Iran.  Puppet or Puppet Master, we know not which he is, but he appears to be a target for either his enemies or his friends.  False flag?  Set Up?  Black Ops?  Bull-shine?</p>

<p>Remember to leave your comments and opinions - feel free to drop the link across the internet.</p>

<p>Until next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 34</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Gareth and Peter hoisted sail on the Good Ship Mindset to sally forth into chartered as well as some unchartered waters in Episode 34,  an hour long podcast.</p>

<p>But what an hour it was...</p>

<p>After splicing the main-brace, the daring duo began by detailing much of the news and probable agenda (seemingly hidden) to the wide awake (and still slumbering) masses across the globe.</p>

<p>Gareth, armed only with a bottle of Stella Artois, commented on his experiences over here in the UK - is it better or even worse than he imagined?</p>

<p>Peter, and his glass of orange squash, presented a number of news items that seem to link together, though these are all presented as separate and unconnected events in the Mainstream Media.</p>

<p><strong>Wikileaks - Pakistan - Iraq War Inquiry.</strong></p>

<p>Whilst agreeing that there has to be a bogeyman to keep us in a perpetual state of fear, we pondered the next tool to keep us in our boxes.</p>

<p>With the Powers That Be now signaling that Al Quaida never existed, with wars grinding to a halt, with armies being withdrawn, backed up by Wikileaks that again influences public opinion against the idea of war without end, the NWO now needs a new tactic.</p>

<p>Has Mindset uncovered the next fear implement?</p>

<p>Until next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 33</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Armed with a can of <a href="http://www.stellaartois.com" target="_blank">Stella</a> and (in Peter's case) a chilled glass of Cherry Lambrini, the podcasting pair hit the internet highway with Episode 33 of the Mindset Podcast.</p>

<p>Gareth described his entry into the Totalitarian State formally known as the United Kingdom and was pleasantly surprised by his experience.</p>

<p>No clips this week, but a HEAP of topics up for discussion.</p>

<p>Including:</p>

<p><strong>Gun culture: </strong>Another tragic event has raised the debate yet again.  The differences betwixt the USA and the UK were discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Drones: </strong>The subject has hit the media in only a small way, but it seems that unmanned stealth aircraft will soon be patrolling above the streets of Britain.</p>

<p><strong>Counter Terrorism: </strong>Is this being reined back in order to save funds now that the UK economy is going down the pan?  It appears so as the UK Government begin swinging cuts to projects that seemed (according to them) indispensable only a few weeks back</p>

<p><strong>British Television:</strong> How has Gareth coped with what is served up on the hundreds of channels that are on offer to subscribers to Sky and Satellite TV?</p>

<p><strong>Beer: </strong>Ahhhh. Painfully expensive but pure delight as Gareth samples the extra cold being pumped out at exorbitant  prices in the good old British pub.</p>

<p>Until next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 31</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This weeks episode was recorded at a more sensible hour (for Gareth), as we once again ploughed ahead with Episode 31 sought to uncover yet more conspiracies and nutshells.</p>

<p>To that end,  three main issues were discussed in depth.</p>

<p>Putting aside their megaphones and dodgy accents, Peter and Gareth discussed the arrest of Charlie Veitch at the G20 in Toronto Canada, what it means to be a truth seeker, and the dangers and pitfalls surrounding it all.</p>

<p>Next the dependable duo landed at the G20 Summit itself.  Ground-shaking in some respects, a blatant NWO propaganda exercise in others, Peter and Gareth discussed why the circus was held in one of the most accessible places on the Planet.</p>

<p>In a " And Now Finally..." moment, our genial hosts donned camouflage jacket and face paint in order to chase down a story involving a Rambo type figure who single handedly set out to seek and destroy Osama Bin Laden. Cutting a swathe through red tape, armed with pistol, sword and night vision, his mission began on... (to be continued after re-analysis by his brother, a qualified medic.)</p>

<p>And finally a big one...</p>

<p>It's over to the poppy fields of Afghanistan (put that cigarette out) to investigate the sacking of General Stan McChrystal.  His replacement seems to be a safe pair of hands and a team player.  But nothing is as it seems in this weird, wacky, crazy world.  Has The Mindset Podcast once again just busted open the REAL story?</p>

<p>And so it came to pass that the show of shows was wrapped up in a nutshell...</p>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 30</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Gareth and Peter welcome you to Episode 30 - yes THIRTY- of The Mindset Podcast!</p>

<p>Tribalism and the FIFA World Cup and professional sports ( the consequences of which) were dissected and discussed.  What truly controls sports and who benefits and how were dealt with before the duo delved into the clips:</p>

<p><strong>Swine Flu - TNG: </strong>This raises its head again in sporadic headlines across the globe.  Is it about the vaccines that lie cooling in fridges and how can taking the vaccine help defeat terrorism?</p>

<p><strong>Air Heads:</strong> A fellow opens a wrong cupboard on board a flight to Little Rock, Arkansas and discovers 70 severed heads.  A hurried press release states these were en route to a medical facility for research.  Sniffy at best and sinister by any account.</p>

<p><strong>Big Foot: </strong>No, Gareth hasn't stuck his foot in it again.  This is the reappearance of Sasquatch, with reports coming out of North Carolina of a greying yellow headed 10 foot humanoid trespassing on a mountain man's terrain.  Though popular in the 70s, the big guy seems to be coming back into human contact.</p>

<p><strong>Chemtrails: </strong> This old chestnut - to be fully discussed in a future episode - was defined by Gareth in order to avoid confusion betwixt Chem Spraying and contrails.</p>

<p><strong>Obama's Oil Speech:</strong> The President's too little too late intervention in this episode has opened a number of theories.  Transfer of money, the debunking of peak oil, purpose leakage and a new plot for the NWO to control fuel supplies.</p>

<p><strong>Times Square Bomber: </strong> Why is this story resurfacing?  Have the spoon-fed populous any memory of the details?  Are trails positioned long enough so that we, the sheep, only remember the three key words - Time, Square and Bomber?  And how is the date significant?</p>

<p>Until next week , Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 29</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>First up, we would like to apologize for the sound quality on this episode.  From about 30mins into the show a strange crackling noise continues through out.  The show is still very listenable, but initially the noise is a little annoying.</p>

<p>Sorry...</p>

<p>Gareth and Peter, recovering from last week's epic Round table event, present a podcast devoid of mention of the FIFA Soccer World Cup...ok, not really.</p>

<p>Gareth was delighted to receive the latest book of David Icke, and gives some feedback on it, whilst Peter admitted he didn't read any more. Not even the Beano.</p>

<p>We then got onto the clips:</p>

<p><strong>UK seems to be about to pull out of Afghanistan.</strong> The new UK Premier visited his brave soldiers seamen and airmen - and women- but is this part of a strategy that is being introduced to manipulate our minds?</p>

<p><strong>The British / USA 'row' over BP was investigated</strong> - what is behind the event, how is it being related and what is the REAL conspiracy behind Middle East Oil?  OMG!  Has Mindset uncovered the true NWO agenda?  Word up to Nancy Pelosi, her message was loud and clear to us conspiracy buffers.</p>

<p><strong>Feeling blue</strong>? Put a magnet on your head.  Ok, it costs a heap load of dollars and it may (or may not) work.  Peter and Gareth discuss health matters along a lunar cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Small fry in danger of heart problems</strong>.  Again, fact or fib?  Or regurgitated science?  Or simply a filler for news stations with nothing better to report.  But can body shape determine predispositions to health issues?</p>

<p>OK, ok, the <strong>World Cup</strong>. Special reports from LIVE in South Africa by our local correspondent plus discussions about poverty, sacrifice, hive mentality ( Google Vuvuzela) and tumbleweed as far as the USA is concerned in this global event.</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 28</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Round Table Special:</strong></p>

<p>The All-Seeing Eye that is The Mindset Podcast delved deeply into the issue of Mind Control and Symbolism in this mammoth and fascinating episode.</p>

<p>Gareth and Peter were joined by Alex Fate , Steve (Piration) , Orion-starr and Dorian Bryan, an eclectic mix of nationalities and knowledge in this complex and sometimes dark, disturbing topic.</p>

<p>The concept and purpose of Mind Control was dissected, and the Gang of Six talked about how it affects individual lives, our communities and past to present day societies.</p>

<p>Closely intertwined with Mind Control are hidden and not so hidden Symbols that seem to play a key part in making us what we are as a human being.  Are Symbols passed down from civilizations now long dead?  Why are Symbols all around us?  Have Symbols the power to control a docile public?   Do Symbols continue work on our minds as we go about our every day lives?</p>

<p>Listen to this truly fascinating discussion, as we probe the walls of reality.</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 27</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Greetings, conspiracy buffs!</p>

<p>The Mindset Podcast was in danger of severe overload this week.  Reason? A HEAP of topics and clips to keep the parapolitical pair from now until End-times.</p>

<p>Daily news and views were first up, especially with regards to China's unwillingness to condemn North Korea for the supposed sinking of a South Korean ship.  And next, why would a multi-millionaire and second in command of the UK Economy fail to note that it was wrong to pay £40K rent to this partner with House of Commons expenses?  Stupidity?  Idleness? Thievery?  None of these reasons make any sense.</p>

<p>Next we moseyed on down to the clips.</p>

<p><strong>Abortion Adverts Hit The UK: </strong>The difference in attitude to abortion in the UK and USA was dissected and tossed back and forth, and who exactly are the people showing the advert on prime time TV?</p>

<p><strong>Obama Oil Spillage: </strong>Hey!  Obama's daughter asks the President if he has plugged the hole yet.  All of a sudden the FEDs are taking responsibility.  Why?</p>

<p><strong>Thousand USA Deaths In Afghan War:</strong> A side note on news casts but the figure is significant.  Where next for the War Without End?</p>

<p><strong>The Duchess And The Fee:</strong> Pay £0.5M and you get to see Prince Andrew ( a perceived buffoon and socialite golfer).  And we thought Royalty were purely ceremonial.  The facts are - or may be - revealed in a tell all conversation.</p>

<p><strong>Whoops Apocalypse:</strong> Childhood illnesses are part of, um, childhood.  No more!  Now these common ailments are a cause for fear.  At the same time as an increase in Whooping Cough was reported in LA,  so was the same reportage occurring in New South Wales, Australia.  A non news item simply to encourage a take up of vaccines globally and reported as local news.  Happy memories of Whooping Cough were related by Peter Fun times!</p>

<p>Next week we are looking at <strong>ROUNDTABLE!</strong></p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 26</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome mere minions, to Episode 26 of The Mindset Podcast.  Join Minions-in-Chief, Gareth and Peter, as they dissect the news that is creating the headlines in the mainstream.</p>

<p>The show kicked off with the usual banter betwixt the two, including the news coming out of the UK.</p>

<p>Then we got deep into the clips:</p>

<p><strong>MP Stabbed: </strong> What is the story behind this event? MP Security? Muslim Extremism? False Flag? Sympathy Vote? Mind Control? A number of points were discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Depression Drugs:</strong> Happy times ahead for the low in spirit. Take a pill but stop taking it if you feel suicidal. Adverts on TV, the power of the video and the conflicting messages within a subliminal framework.</p>

<p><strong>UK Troops under US Command:</strong> When is a Brit not a Brit?  When under the authority of a foreign Superpower.  PM Cameron fails to answer the question, it being " Why are UK Troops Under The Command Of The USA?"</p>

<p><strong>Miliband(s) Leadership Bid:</strong> Two for the price of one.  What is there between them to vote for? Labour's decline into totalitarianism and token democracy is discussed.</p>

<p><strong>iPod Zombies:</strong> There you are, listening to your tunes and a big fat plane lands on top of you, recycling you into strawberry jam.  Who is to blame? you?  The aircraft?  Nay, it's the iPod wot done it!</p>

<p><strong>Life On Mars:</strong> Farewell to Gene Hunt and hello to molecular life forms than non existant rockets are investigated in non existant space exploration ( NASA is broke).  But what are they hiding?  Aliens among us?</p>

<p><strong>NY Bomber 2:</strong> A quick reinforcement from the Mainstream Media outlets in order to keep our minds on the fear factor so needed to keep us confined.  A ranting Gareth gave full force to this little beauty.</p>

<p><strong>North Korea:</strong> As the UK withdraw from Afghanistan, so must BAE find another arena to use their weapons of mass destruction.  Is China complicit?  Or is war with the Red Empire on the horizon.  Everyone (Peking) duck!</p>

<p>And finally...
<br />
<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Paris Simulations:</strong> No, not that kind.  False Flag and Black Ops usually co-incide with Terror Attack Sims.  Curiously ( or not) the Paris version took place just as the NY Times bomber was adjusting his back pack.  Makes you think, don't it. No?  Ok, what's for supper..?</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 25</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Greetings Matrix dwellers ( yes Mrs, that's you I'm talking to.)</p>

<p>Today we had an awesome show, with MSC Member Alex Fate reporting on the David Icke Event in Brixton Academy.  You will not want to miss Alex's feedback from this, with hopefully some photos to be put on the www.mindsetcentral.com site.</p>

<p>Gareth and Peter talked about a number of interesting news items, including the possibility of Gary McKinnon no longer being extradited to the USA to stand trial for computer hacking. But why is it taking so long to be sorted out when the then opposition, now in 'power' were demanding his right to trial in the UK? Hmmm.</p>

<p>The power of Facebook - for good and for evil - was delved into following reports that over 20,000 French youngsters gather for a FB meet-up.  Police pointed to the death of a 21 year old who died in what authorities report as an 'alcohol drenched' gathering.</p>

<p>The death of Parliamentary Democracy is facing the UK was touched upon, with coalition one party politics now positioning itself to remain for ever in power. All in the name of .." what's best for the country."  Yesterday it would take 51 percent of  MPs to force a General Election on the grounds that the House had no confidence in the Government of the day. That percentage has risen to 55 percent.</p>

<p>Next, after being joined by Alex Fate for an in depth discussion on David Icke and his event, we delved into the clips:</p>

<p><strong>California Budget:</strong> Cuts for the poor and needy, weapons for the Military Industrial Complex. Is Government too huge to cope with the financial system?  And is money, and its concept, the control mechanism which keeps us from being free to express ourselves and our abilities?</p>

<p><strong>Greeks Buying Weapons:</strong> Follow the money is a mantra and in this clip we hear how the NWO tells Greece to cut services whilst at the same time buy billions of dollars worth of military equipment to aim at a non existant enemy.  And they have no fuel to launch anyway, it's WAY too expensive.  The mind numbing of the EU and political NWO system we find ourselves locked into today displays itself bare faced and in your face.  Pure evil and treasonous.</p>

<p><strong>Gulf Mexico Oil Rig Disaster:</strong> Why was the Top Hat Rig Cap delayed?  Do The Powers That Be  want oil pumping out day after day?  What are BP hiding?  Why is Mexico rattling it's sabers?  Why were SWAT Teams first to arrive at the emergency?  Was this an act of war or an accident?  What are the chemicals that he US Coast Guards and BP spraying?  What are the initials BP?  And who owns one third of the dispersants used to clear up BP's mess?  So many questions.</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>

<p>"Dispatch War Rocket Ajax to bring back his body."</p>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 24</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week's show was rather like an Election Special, breaking down the thrills, spills and black ops of what is laughingly called the democratic system in the Totalitarian State formally known as The United Kingdom.  We also had old favourites such as tasering kids, royal news and false flag terror events to help brighten a mind numbing weeks of election overkill.</p>

<p>But first - The News:</p>

<p><strong>Uk Headlines included:</strong></p>

<p>NHS Cutting Costs To Meet New Swine Flu Outbreak
<br />Flights to USA from UK Cancelled Due To Ash Volano.
<br />And finally , Britain's biggest companies saw £35billion wiped off their value yesterday as fears of a power vacuum in Westminster sent financial markets into free fall together with the Greek Crisis.#</p>

<p>Then we got into the  Clips:</p>

<p><strong>UK General Election</strong>:  Many independents, incl Green Party candidates, stand for parliament and barely get a hundred votes, and then suddenly one takes a whole seat out of nowhere.  Wow! Some people voted once, some twice and some not at all.  We dissect the situation that befell the gullible electorate.</p>

<p><strong>Farage Plane Crash:</strong> Of course it was a hit. He should be dead by now.  The why's, wherefores , do's and don't's of standing against the Controlled Opposition.</p>

<p><strong>Times Square Bomb:</strong> We smell False Flag.  Federal officials had placed him on a "no-fly" list hours before his arrest.  Why?  We discuss.</p>

<p><strong>Prince Harry's Chopper:</strong> Why now?  How is this linked to War On Iran?  Find out here!</p>

<p><strong>Greece IMF:</strong> The Greek People's response it amazing and joyful.  Ruined by people killing other people.  Who is being put to blame?  And why?</p>

<p><strong>Baseball Fan Tasered: </strong>Fun times as Police read guidelines then taser a boy in front of a massive crowd.  But who were the crowd boo-ing?</p>

<p>And finally...</p>

<p>Neanderthals - hot or not?  If you know any, or are one, email in and give your opinion.</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Another politically charged episode of the Mind Set Podcast, and one were Alex Fate dropped in on Gareth and Peter to discuss some heavy duty issues of the day.</p>

<p>Clips:</p>

<p><strong>Dan Ackroyd and the UFO</strong>:  An amazing outburst by the actor gets Gareth all of a lather.  Discover why!</p>

<p><strong>Noahs Ark Found</strong>:  Chinese and Turkish Evangelicals find a Biblical Relic.  What is the agenda behind this news report?</p>

<p><strong>Brown Calls Woman A Bigot</strong>:  Designed by Brown's enemies? Done on purpose? Accidental slip? Why did such a senior politician make such a fundamental error?</p>

<p><strong>Militia:</strong> US Militia organisations now under threat from this latest series of arrests and court appearances.</p>

<p><strong>Oil Slick:</strong> Is this a eco-weapon, used against the masses? Is this retaliation? What are the implications for the Planet?  What is the conspiracy behind this devastation?</p>

<p><strong>Times Square Bomb:</strong> Very amateurish but one to keep us in lock down perhaps?  What is the 'Pink' connection?</p>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 22</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Peter and Gareth were on  top form the week, as no stone seemed unturned in this ongoing political/Spiritual/Conspiratorial discussion.</p>

<p>Episode 22 began with:</p>

<p><strong>The News:</strong></p>

<p>Slow return to normality as British airspace reopened. But what is the weird stuff appearing on cars? And that burning smell? Also chemtrails were discussed</p>

<p><strong>Polish President Death :</strong> Is this connected to all aircraft being grounded?</p>

<p><strong>The Fake Election</strong> - discussion raised interesting ideas and information.
<br />England named as least patriotic country. Only one-in-three people know when St George's Day - why?</p>

<p>We then got on with the clips:
<br />
<strong>
<br />Ozzy Quakes:</strong> No, not The Prince Of Darkness, but The Land Down-under has experienced a tectonic moment.
<br />
<strong>
<br />Allies Withdraw:</strong> You won't see this reported in Western Media outlets. Various rumours abound.
<br />
<strong>
<br />Election Wives:</strong> Glamour and the UK General Election. We discussed.</p>

<p><strong>End of Space Flight:</strong> What is the <em>REAL</em> story?</p>

<p><strong>Pope Apology:</strong> It the Pope really going to be arrested? Or will he be replaced.</p>

<p><strong>Fat Threat: </strong>Feed the Taliban!  It makes them easier to catch!</p>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 20</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The 20th Episode of The Mindset Podcast dived into some heavy duty discussion right from the very off which continued throughout the show with some interesting and thought provoking concepts, opinions and ideas.</p>

<p>First up we had the latest news including comment on the death of Polish President Lech Kazinsky, killed in a plane crash in Russia.
<br />UK DNA databases raised its ugly head and mention was made of Gareth having another quake, whilst the UK is in the middle of a heat wave.  And its snowing in New York.</p>

<p>Then it was into the news clips.</p>

<p><strong>Pre Historic Find:</strong> What is the secret of life?  How did we get here?  Where is the missing link?  Who are we?  What is God?</p>

<p><strong>KFC Sandwich: </strong>The origin of the word sandwich.  How dangerous is this food?  Is there a NWO of fries?  Of burgers?  Why do we eat this stuff?</p>

<p><strong>LAX Scare:</strong> How come a fool skips security when in all airports you cannot take a whizz without being spied upon?  Why hold up flights? Who let him through?</p>

<p><strong>Racist Ads: </strong>The USA and UK differ wildly in permitting freedom of speech, no matter how abhorrent.  Is this guy a patsy in order for the NWO to introduce the laws into the USA that we have in the EU state?</p>

<p><strong>Twitter Candidate:</strong> A tweet caused a Labour Candidate to get dropped from the Election.  A one world order of politicians who them, selves have no freedom of speech.</p>

<p><strong>Terror Flight: </strong>Smoking or non smoking?  Peter and Gareth agreed to disagree with different takes being aired.  Peter used the word fag.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Economy Bill:</strong> Danger danger!  They want us criminalized so allow these honey traps called piracy laws to ensnare us.  Since when do our police work of businesses?</p>

<p><strong>Register To Vote:</strong> The UK election is in full swing and a few words about how, who and what to vote for if you do decide to put you X by a name.</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 19</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Mindset Podcast began with reference to last week's roundtable discussion and the feedback received from it.  Hopefully this can become a monthly event.</p>

<p>Mention was made of it being Easter and we discussed some aspects of Christianity, deciding that an in-depth discussion on the basis of religion could be a show in itself.</p>

<p>Peter spoke of the news making the headlines in the UK, including the return of Doctor Who. Gareth spoke of The Love Police, which is gaining huge audiences on You Tube.</p>

<p>Latest News from the UK:</p>

<p>Archbishop of Canterbury (Church of England) has said the RC Church in Ireland has lost credibility because of the sex scandals.  It was agreed that his institution should keep its head down in case the media started snooping around their members.</p>

<p>Financial Institutions are now being forced by the UK Government to employ more women or face legal quotas.</p>

<p>Cancer drugs are still not reaching patients due to the Government body NICE.  One of the political tribes, The Tories, are promising to release these drugs if they win the election.</p>

<p>Gordon Brown and Barack Obama along with The Mindset Podcast have given Easter Greetings along the lines of a Papal Message.</p>

<p>We then dived into the clips:
<br />
<strong>
<br />Earth Hour:</strong></p>

<p>Gareth stated it hardly scratched the surface in the USA, with folk going about their business as per usual.  Peter stated he turned his lights off every night when going to bed, naming the procedure 'Earth Eight Hours' and thus saves the planet every night eight times over.  Earth Hour was dissected and discussed at length.</p>

<p><strong>Abortion:</strong></p>

<p>Whacked out on religion, some people do dreadful things.  We discussed the case of the man jailed for shooting an Abortion Doctor in church.</p>

<p><strong>Fat Tax:</strong></p>

<p>Tax - they love it.  But why not make bigger seats if its for our own good? We discussed diet , food, and other issues relation to sitting next to super sized people in enclosed areas.  Air Security</p>

<p><strong>Airport Security:</strong></p>

<p>It is a change and it smells fishy.  Are security actually picking up things that would be embarrassing to officials.  What is the story behind the story?</p>

<p><strong>Meow Meow:</strong></p>

<p>It wasn't a drug till users started to take it after googling it and discovering that it makes you high. Its a plant food.  But why are youngsters turning to narcotics? And how is all this stuff getting past security?  Suspicious!</p>

<p><strong>Micro-chipping:</strong></p>

<p>The Health Care Bill, soon to become Law, will require users of the free health care to be micro chipped.  36 months have been allotted to try and sell this to an asleep public.  Peter suggested a two tier society through this measure.</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 18</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><h2><strong>Special: New World Order Roundtable</strong></h2><p>
<br />One topic, one panel.  This week the Mind Set Podcasts hosts and open forum discussion on the New World Order or NWO.</p>

<p>Gareth opened the show with an brief introduction of the panel, before diving into the topic.  The panel consisted of  Peter Glynn , Dorian Bryan and Alex Fate.</p>

<p>The show began with a selection of media clips containing references to The New World Order as a prelude to discussions on the following topics:</p>

<p><strong>1. What IS the NWO?</strong>
<br />Breaking it down and building it up again - the panel dived into this with relish.</p>

<p><strong>2.What is its End Game?</strong>
<br />The panel had a few differing ideas on where it is leading us.</p>

<p><strong>3.How is it implemented?</strong>
<br />The Guys produced a number of hypotheses as to how ( if indeed it really is) being forced upon the planet.</p>

<p><strong>4. Is Occultism part of the NWO makeup?</strong>
<br />Molochs. It's true I tell you! Bohemian Grove , Owls , Dalai Lama and Ritual Abuse were all discussed.</p>

<p><strong>5. Surveillance, Fear, Media, Identity, Religion</strong>
<br />A number of opinions were offered.</p>

<p><strong>6.Where does the power within a human being come from?</strong>
<br />I think we all bowed to Alex Fate's deep insight on this one.</p>

<p><strong>7. And So It Ends..</strong>
<br />But what has the NWO have in store? Population control and the tools of the NWO.</p>

<p>Big thanks to all the panelists for a great show.</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 17</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Episode 17 began with news that Gareth had been caught in the shower during the latest Earthquake to hit LA. Things shook apparently.  Then we moved hurriedly on to discuss some UK news making the headlines, most notably the SAS Headquarters identified by Google Street View and the fallout from this.  Peter related his latest paranormal 'event' and next we began the clips:</p>

<p><strong>LA Earthquake:</strong></p>

<p>The News Anchor is really milking certain words " Tuesss-day"  "Four point FOUUURRR"!  Is this a media driven story?  A portent of doom for LA / The World?  In depth was this clip discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Obama Birth Certificate Requests:</strong></p>

<p>A clip reported rather sniffily as if the people requesting it are 'odd' or ' nutjobs' or ' childish'.
<br />Without these requests , they'd probably not have too much to do. You'd think they'd enjoy the overtime.  If the law states requesting Birth Certificates are allowed, then people are in the right.  Gareth and Peter dissected this to its bare bones.</p>

<p><strong>Pope Abuse:</strong></p>

<p>No, not Gareth verbally abusing the Pontiff ( well , actually he did! ) but the stories and scandals that continue to rattle the Catholic Church, and adults viciously abused as children speak out.</p>

<p><strong>Boy suspended for playing Guns:</strong></p>

<p>Another interesting clip, with Peter and Gareth agreeing to disagree on aspects of this story.</p>

<p><strong>Hospital Bed Cuts:</strong></p>

<p>"It doesn't sound like reform, it sounds like murder."  - Quote of the day from The Glynn!
<br />The Reform Group are tied closely to the Government in Waiting, the Conservative Party. There is a hint there of what is to come.</p>

<p><strong>Georgian Invasion:</strong></p>

<p>Wars and Rumours of War and End Times is appearing on the horizon.  Here we have Media manipulation at its best - or worst!  Peter suggested that the War In Afghanistan is about to end and a new phase may begin - with conflicts in the former USSR, around Jerusalem and between India and Pakistan.</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 16</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Gareth and Peter opened the show with news that Peter had yet another 'haunted' type event, along with a day long 'Mother of all Head Colds."  Gareth attempted to throw some light on what may or not be a paranormal happening.</p>

<p>Next we discussed some of the news making the headlines in the UK.</p>

<p>Neil Armstrong, Jim Lovell and Gene Cernan have been at a conference in Suffolk UK, and have been critical of Obama's decision to cancel Moon Flights.  Peter set this weeks quiz question.  For what is Gene Cernan best known?  Answers on the forum please!</p>

<p>Google Street View has hit the UK but Cheese rolling enthusiasts from around the world have been dismayed to find their annual competition cancelled due to Health and Safety.</p>

<p>We then got into the Clips:</p>

<p><strong>Walmart and the Latino Boycott:</strong></p>

<p>A fascinating subject that was speculated upon by Gareth and Peter.  Is there smoke without fire?</p>

<p><strong>UK High Rise Apartment Death Plunge:</strong></p>

<p>Immigration and Asylum - the issue that dare not speak its name.  Is this a story about the shambles that is the UK policy on asylum and immigration?  Three people threw themselves from high rise flats in Glasgow Scotland.  They were identified as three Russians, one of whom claimed to be a former Russian Secret Service Operator.  With Russia reporting the incident as 'fallen from ' rather than 'jumped from ' and with apparent Border Police banging on the apartment door moments before the two men and woman died, this report raises some questions.</p>

<p><strong>Dangerous Dogs:</strong></p>

<p>Man's Best Friend.  Dog Bites Postman. The same old story.  A few idiots cause problems and the Government tell us there must be yet more tax on it.  Ouch!</p>

<p><strong>Sanctions:</strong></p>

<p>The sanctions were punishment for Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, and aimed to prevent the country from gaining weapons of mass destruction.  Why can we only hear about this on Al Jazeerra and not the Western Media?  Why, when we google this, do stories of Sanctions against Iran keep coming to the fore?  Fake elections, Iraq still not in charge of its own country, oil fields are controlled by the Western Businesses are possible motives - or has someone simply forgotten to lift them?</p>

<p><strong>White Soccer Mom Terrorist Arrests:</strong></p>

<p>Terrorist used to be a bloke with a beard wrapped in a blanket.  Now we have the opposite of this, i.e. Hot White Chicks or soccer mom types.  Now, anyone, especially you, can look like a terrorist.  An interesting clip, dissected.</p>

<p>Coming soon. A special round table event that will be fed LIVE on CAM ( or CCTV), scheduled for 27 March 2010.  With special guests.</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 15</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The show started with Gareth &amp; Peter mentioning the weather and then Peter updating listeners with a development of his haunting experience in Staffordshire last week.  Gareth gave some insight.</p>

<p>Next was mentions of some news that has been happening in the UK and beyond.</p>

<p>Basic supermarket groceries in the UK which are currently immune from VAT could soon have this tax levied in order to raise billions of £(pounds) for the Government.</p>

<p>Also being mooted is a Pay as you Throw tax which has seen the increase of Trashcans or Recycling Bins being fitted with chips to weigh how much refuse is being put out by households. It's purpose? To impose fines obviously to those who throw out too much.</p>

<p>The Mindset Podcast always likes to bring Breaking News to listeners, and this weeks episode was no exception.  Peter reported the latest developments around Sri Lanka's General Fonseka, who is currently languishing in a Naval Jail for daring to take on the incumbent President in the recent democratic election.</p>

<p><strong>Threat to Web Users:</strong></p>

<p>Next we discussed the Digital Economy Bill and its potential affect on you tubers and shows such as The Mindset Podcast.</p>

<p>We then got into the clips:</p>

<p><strong>John Patrick Bedell and the Pentagon Attack:</strong></p>

<p>A human story and tragedy. But what is behind this event?  What are the consequences?  Gareth and Peter discuss.</p>

<p><strong>The Starbucks Gun:</strong></p>

<p>The massive difference between the USA and UK  in relation to firearms was explained by Gareth and the story behind the gun lobby meetings in starbucks and the anti-gun lobby trying to get the Company to ban carriers.</p>

<p><strong>Giving Police The Finger</strong>:</p>

<p>Peter and Gareth agreed to disagree on this topic , Gareth supporting the guys freedom to respond to perceived harrassment whilst Peter thought that new powers might be enacted on the back of this to prevent further actions taken against the law agencies.
<br />
<strong>
<br />Body Scanners in Airports</strong>:</p>

<p>No machine is 100 percent certain to detect anything.  Is better technology being sought to increase success...  we get the answer in this important clip.</p>

<p><strong>Patience Choice of Doctors in the UK</strong>:</p>

<p>At the moment, no choice.  You have to have a GP that is in your zone or area.  This is a flawed idea and is probably cheap electioneering to convince people they have Freedom of Choice.</p>

<p><strong>President Zuma State Visit to the UK:</strong></p>

<p>Mr Zuma got his state visit off to a sticky start by branding the British as old-fashioned imperialists in response to the UK media focussing on his colourful private life.</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 14</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Gareth and Peter opened the show by referring to some self-censorship from Episode 13 and asked for feedback on this topic. Peter described some 'paranormal' experiences during his three days away in the Midlands, UK. (photos on the Mindset Forum Paranormal Section.)</p>

<p>Next the clips were played:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_14481401" target="_blank"><strong>Teachers Sackings:</strong></a></p>

<p>A school in South Los Angeles is losing all its teachers , counsellors and even maintenance men. Is it about the money? Or are there other ingredients to this story? Gareth and Peter discuss the minutiae and possible consequences for Fremont High school.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Man-Suspected-Of-Being-A-Paedophile-For-Taking-A-Photo-Of-His-Own-Son-While-Out-Shopping/Article/201002415560029?" target="_blank"><strong>UK Child Picture Uproar:</strong></a></p>

<p>A father is threatened with arrest for taking a photo of his son in a public area.  are we living within a mindset that will be impossible to break? It is a mindset. Are people with cameras terrorists , burglars or child snatchers. Are there no longer any tourists?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.infowars.com/paul-bernanke-waxman-and-12-billion-in-cash-squandered/" target="_blank"><strong>$12 Billion Lost</strong></a></p>

<p>The US has so far spent $226 billion on the Iraq war. $12 Billion has simply vanished , having been plane-loaded over to Baghdad for whoever to do whatever with. Who cares? Where is this reported? What is the agenda here?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/24/AR2010022402272.html" target="_blank"><strong>Child Migrants:</strong></a></p>

<p>Are we talking about the political systems of Pol Pot? Stalin , Hitler? Mao Tse Tong? No , this is the UK. Are we talking centuries ago?  No , a policy was in place until the late 1960s to migrate children from care or from struggling familites to the outposts of the old Empire. Most were abominably treated. PM Gordon Brown apologises. But who should he apologise on behalf of?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7309123/Row-over-pay-off-for-NHS-scandal-hospital-boss.html" target="_blank"><strong>NHS Scandal</strong></a></p>

<p>Dehydrated patients forced to drink water from flower vases, accident victims left untended for hours, clinical judgements being made by receptionists. Is the mindless chasing of targets , set by the Political Parties , culpable in the early deaths and shocking treatment of over 400 patients at a Mid Staffordshire Hospital?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-security-service-faces-police-torture-probe-1904747.html" target="_blank"><strong>Secret Service Torture and Secrecy:</strong></a></p>

<p>Britain's top three judges released a devastating finding that MI5 officers have a 'dubious record when it comes to human rights and coercive techniques'. After calling such claims ' ludicrous lies ' Miliband wishes future findings , especially if found complicit , held in secrecy. Gareth and Peter discuss.</p>

<p>and finally....</p>

<p><a href="http://www.news10.net/news/watercooler/story.aspx?storyid=76175" target="_blank"><strong>Holy Smokes!</strong></a></p>

<p>The Newscaster deserves 'pun of the week ' prize for "Holy Smokes". Mr. Kennedy lost his house and all his possessions  in a fire, apart from a painting of Jesus. (film on Mindset Forum in Paranormal Section)</p>

<p>Is it a miracle of divine intervention? If so, the ultimate question- why did Jesus let his house burn down?  Not very Christian of Jesus...</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 13</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Episode 13 may be unlucky for some, and in someways it was for us.  We'll discuss our Ep 13 'issues' in depth next week.  But for now we'll leave you with another excellent episode of the Mind Set Podcast.</p>

<p>This addition this the usual intro we touched on, a UK human Rights Watchdog are calling for an independent probe into claims that British Security Services had been complicit in the torture of 20 terror suspects.  The Falkland Islands are in the spotlight again, because of oil, and a 5 year old was called fat by a local Health Authority.  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang star Lionel Jeffries has died aged 83.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=118993&amp;sectionid=3510203" target="_blank"><strong>Fed Building Crash</strong></a>
<br />Joe Stack has done a big favour for the NWO. 'Violent revolution is the only answer' according to Stack. If you follow his reasoning, you will be targeted and arrested in crack down.  Any group that doesn't agree with the government are called "Extremist Groups" and "Hate Groups".  Domestic Terrorist is a new handle. They want us to be violent so <strong>A.</strong> they can arrest us and <strong>B.</strong> because they can introduce still further measures to control us.</p>

<p>CNN Report : "Citizens should be aware of those who talk of or hold grudges against the government, and intervention should be made for the safety of the person with the grudge, as well as the person hearing about the grudge, and for the overall public at large" - FBI profiler</p>

<p>"Perhaps we need stricter checks on all pilots, and mandatory mental health evaluations at various points in a career...."  - Aviation expert</p>

<p><strong>Super Quakes</strong></p>

<p>Keeping Quakes in the news, albeit a non story of what might occur.  Super Quakes are associated with End Times and possibly those who are trying to usher End Times in.  No one survives the EndTimes Super Quake as per the Book of Revelations so why worry?</p>

<p><strong>Taliban Roads and Taliban Arrest</strong></p>

<p><strong>Taliban Roads:</strong> A pumped up reporter and how the news is reported in the USA and UK. Breaking news on the War on Terror in Afghanistan.  The Netherlands' coalition government has collapsed after the two largest parties failed to agree on whether to withdraw Dutch troops from Afghanistan later this year, as had been planned. The Christian Democrats wanted to stay beyond Aug 2010, whilst Labour wanted out as they had previously agreed as a coalition. their operation began in August 2006 and involves 1,906 troops.  21 Dutch killed. This is a setback for the international coalition"  No country has pulled out in the 8 years of the war. NATO fears a domino effect. The war is unpopular in Holland.</p>

<p><strong>A Taliban Arrest: </strong>A murky situation : Baradar's capture has been portrayed as a breakthrough in U.S. efforts to get Pakistan to pursue Taliban leaders in the country.  But emerging details about the arrest challenge that conclusion and questions are being asked about his role &amp; relationship with President Karzai..</p>

<p><strong>Bank Profits</strong>
<br />A 92% increase in profit reported.  Barclays Bank PLC had no bailout. Do or don't bailouts work?  However a lot of their competitors went under and so have seen a bigger share of market.  Banks are all part of the same system.  UK Government Bank RBS is to announce its results on Thursday with  annual losses of around £6 billion expected.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/feb/03/iran-launches-rocket-carrying-animals" target="_blank"><strong>Iran Rocket</strong></a></p>

<p>It is embarrassing that a country like Iran that has been embroiled in War - and supposedly on the brink of war with the west - and conflicts with Iraq since 1980 and is considered as a semi-developed country is able to put together a space programme. The UK space programme was basically mothballed in the 1970's  and the UK does not contribute financially to the International Space Station.  Jodrell Bank is under threat constantly from bean counters for the sake of £100,000.  Will our so called enemies get the higher ground and is this in response to the  USA &amp; Obama quitting the Moon Missions?</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 12</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>After the absence of a single week, and an outcry from rabid listeners, The Mind Set Podcast returned to the virtual airwaves with a paranoid grin, and Episode 12!  The show began with the usual rambling greetings that we've all grown to love, and Gareth's apology and workaholic excuse for causing last weeks absence.</p>

<p>Then it was on to the news.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8483865.stm" target="_blank"><strong>MMR</strong></a></p>

<p>They removed the choice of parents to opt for single measles vaccine and then said they had a choice. MMR or nothing. They ensured that legal aid was withdrawn, which was the only avenue for parents to attempt to get to the truth. They prosecuted the doctors involved, in the longest trial in GMC history, brought not by parents of their patients, but by a free lance journalist, with a fixation on one of those doctors. It took several years to get their chosen verdict.</p>

<p>There were children who, by any standard, literally were normal one day and autistic the next. Whilst I would agree that there is no scientific evidence to support a link between MMR and autism, there is sufficient evidence to investigate parents' concerns. The controversy will not end until such an investigation is undertaken, independent of government. The doctor is currently living and working in the USA and is loved and admired by all parents who felt let down by lack of proper tests and feel isolated. Blair consistently refused to say if his kids got the MMR. It was thought that it didn't.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_94880.html" target="_blank"><strong>Brain Scans</strong></a></p>

<p>Consciousness is never destroyed. Imagine everyone talking around you thinks your totally unaware and then they want to put you to sleep. It must be terrifying. The number of people over the decades who have died when still aware.  At least now they - or some - will potentially have a choice if they want switching off or not. The law will possibly have to change to allow for Assisted Suicide to take place.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jmVICVPpmVGLrJ2f3c53jVXJy9vQD9DQV6FG0" target="_blank"><strong>US Casualties In Pakistan</strong></a></p>

<p>Are USA troops now on the front line in Pakistan, as the war on Afghanistan Taliban gains momentum?  Pakistanis think so. Drones, uniforms, and now casualties all point to an increased level of military action from the USA from Pakistan - and the Pakistan Govt are scared of the reaction of their citizens to this fact. This comes at a time when anti-US sentiments are running high in Pakistan. Indiscriminate US drone attacks have killed hundreds of civilians in Pakistan's northwestern tribal areas, resulting in a surge in anti-American sentiments.</p>

<p>Anti-US groups have targeted growing numbers of American troops. Reports - unconfirmed by the USA authorities- that there are 9,000 agents working for the US-based security firm Xe Services LLC (formerly known as Blackwater) are operating in Pakistan. This is a Covert War we aren't really being told about.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fox.com/fringe/" target="_blank"><strong>Fringe Global Warming</strong></a></p>

<p>A great show, but even in these sci fi shows they put in a little 'accepted truths' taken as real truth, that seems to make global warming a fact.  The power of the subliminal message...</p>

<p><a href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Farmer-Who-Secretly-Built-A-Castle-And-Concealed-It-In-Straw-Loses-Battle-To-Stop-It-Being-Removed/Article/201002115541527?lpos=UK_News_Second_Strange_News__Article_Teaser_Region__2&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15541527_Farmer_Who_Secretly_Built_A_Castle_And_Concealed_It_In_Straw%2C_Loses_Battle_To_Stop_It_Being_Removed" target="_blank"><strong>Castle Destroyed</strong></a></p>

<p>You may think that you own your own property, you may have bought or built yourself? No! Local Authorities own it, and they will make you pay to live in it, decide what shape it can be, and what is in it?</p>

<p>If you decide to build an extension, you can be forced through law to pull the new work down. If you have the <strong>CHEEK</strong> to do it without asking for planning <strong>PERMISSION</strong> they will make you pay by flexing their muscles and pulling it down. The decision lies with a Council Minion who has yea or nay final decision. He can send it to elected reps to decide - or can make the decision for himself. An Englishman's Home Is Not His Castle</p>

<p><a href="http://www.teapartynation.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Tea Party Nation</strong></a></p>

<p>Hijacked by Opposition Party (the Republicans) Sarah Palin, reading from her hand whilst criticising Obama for using a Teleprompter. Boston Tea Party started USA independence from the UK and the current Tea Party started as like-minded individuals protesting about Big Brother. TP is called racist because a news guy said ' I don't see many black people out here'. Implied racist org or crackpots.</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 11</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The show opened with Gareth and Peter commenting on how well the Mindset Podcast is progressing. And as a free to air show, it can improve further for the price of a cup of Starbucks! A donations tab has been added for those kind enough to add a dollar or two.  A discussion ensued about the sale of pink Ouija boards to girls, Peter pointing out a few dangers associated with this 'toy'.</p>

<p><strong>Clip One : Earthquake in the Philippines</strong></p>

<p>This was discussed, with Peter's take being every new earthquake, every monsoon, snowfall, blizzard, typhoon, hurricanes, rain, drought is being reported in the news as if it is all new - but we as children were taught of these events as natural - it is possibly all hijacked in an attempt to push climate change and exact tax. Gareth's take was that it is possible that weather is now being used as a weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Clip Two : Photographers Protest in London</strong></p>

<p>A long clip, shortened in order that we could discuss this in depth.  Despite EU banning wanton stop and search, the UK Govt have appealed this and continue the practice.  Obviously non violent, doing - their-job, fragrant women are being hounded because the authorities CHOOSE to.  Controlling a Common Law makes individuals property of the State instead of Free entities.</p>

<p><strong>Clip Three : Obama's First Year and State of the Union Address</strong></p>

<p>Gareth gave the USA viewpoint of the Healthcare Package that Obama was attempting to introduce.  Also why he is becoming more unpopular with the American people.  Peter commented on sound-bytes and Gareth pointed to some utter irrelevant points he made, with cheerleaders clapping and cheering as if off the cuff.</p>

<p><strong>Clip Four : Face Recognition Cameras</strong></p>

<p>More Orwellian gadgets to further entrap ourselves with, yet all packaged up as "fun" to make easy sales.  They don't need to collect all data on us because a lot of people out there are only too willing to give it up freely on themselves.  The Kodak Slice uses facial recognition software and a search function that allows people to arrange pictures according to where and when they were taken and who they were with at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Clip Five : Haiti Trafficking</strong></p>

<p>Gareth related some disturbing information about a cult who may or may not still be active.  Peter described the scenario facing Haiti in the coming decade.  Child and Organ Trafficking was discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Clip Six : UFO Conference</strong></p>

<p>The trouble with us Earthers is that we are so arrogant - we think we are the only ones around.  The Apollo Missions were discussed . as was Obama stopping future Moon landing missions as promised by G.W.Bush.</p>

<p><strong>Clip Seven : Italy Media Control</strong></p>

<p>If you control the media , you control peoples minds.  Its why when there's a coup, the insurgents always take the Radio Stations first.  If they fail to do that, the game is always up. Berlusconi is seeking to own all the Media - either privately or in Government - and licensing Youtube is also on the agenda.  Italy an EU (NWO) Ally and supposedly one of the great Western democracies.</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 10</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Gareth and Peter opened the show by discussing the crazy weather LA had been undergoing. Mention was made of how well the Message Board was doing, with its new members and awesome posts.</p>

<p>The quiz question from last week was correctly answered, and the winner also had some interesting things to say about various Illuminati symbols in Haiti.</p>

<p>Peter then touched upon the recent raising of the Terrorist Threat level in the UK from Substantial to Severe.</p>

<p>Gareth then talked about the brains frontal lobe activity and the latest 3D technology that is being pushed on us.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mindsetcentral.com/archives/574" target="_blank">The Zen TV Experiment</a></p>

<p><strong>1. </strong><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2212774220100123" target="_blank"><strong>California Rain</strong></a></p>

<p>First up we discussed the fact that California has been suffering from contstant ran for five days, and has received up to 20 inches of rain.  Gareth mentioned fires and mudslides, and that homes were being evacuated. He intimated a connection to the L.A. Quake and Global Warming. Peter asked Gareth to clarify HAARP and Chem-trails.</p>

<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.mindsetcentral.com/archives/1503" target="_blank">The Chocolate Factory</a></strong></p>

<p>British-owned companies are systematically being taken over and whole country asset-stripped, withCadbury's being the latest.  Peter talked about Royal Bank of Scotland, a UK Government owned bank, giving a bridging loan to an overseas company to aggressively purchase a quintessentially British institution.  He also alluded to a One World Order of Chocolate, stating that soon we will see only one company owning any one product.</p>

<p><strong>3.  <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/01/22/earlyshow/leisure/celebspot/main6128631.shtml" target="_blank">Prince William Down Under</a></strong></p>

<p>A Prince William report, which Gareth found strange as this gets airtime on USA news programmes.  No other bloodline gets a mention. Why? He then discussed the Special Relationship between the USA and UK.  Also the 'Chain of Command.' Peter went back to basics and said as far as we knew, Wills might not be able to hit a barn door with his rifle,  and that its only the TV that's telling us that he is a good shot.</p>

<p><strong>4. <a href="http://www.mindsetcentral.com/archives/1451" target="_blank">The Twitter Arrest</a></strong></p>

<p>A man, Paul J Chambers was arrested by Police in the UK after Tweeting a so-called bomb threat in his 'locked' twitter account.  We discuss how it was picked up by police, and all aspects relating to social control.</p>

<p><strong>5. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8467309.stm" target="_blank">The Bill Bragg Protest</a></strong></p>

<p>Billy Bragg, a UK folk singer and staunch left winger, has refused to pay his taxes in protest of the banker bonuses.  Gareth stated that he has always been very political, but is still very much in the Matrix.  He is now into protesting the bonuses of banks and the bail out.  He is highlighting the issue, but that nothing will become of it, as It's only him.  If everyone did it things would change in a heartbeat. Peter suggested that he is 'half right' but that something lies much deeper - the system itself, rather than individuals who are replaced every now and again with more of the same.</p>

<p><strong>6. <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1953379_1953494_1954326,00.html" target="_blank">The Haiti Invasion</a></strong></p>

<p>Haiti was again up for discussion, the country being only part of one island - Hispaniola. But ONLY Haiti has suffered the quake.  The clip featured France's accusation of USA invasion and the UN asking the US to allow aid into the striken areas.  Mention was made of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his reference to HAARP. Also that rescues had now ceased, despite two more people being found. Finally Child Agencies are concerned about the rush to send children into adoption.</p>

<p>Until Next week, Peace Out Humans…</p>]]></description>

            <title>The Mind Set Podcast Episode 9</title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This weeks show kicked off with Peter offering an apology.  Tim Osman , aka Osama Bin Laden , is ( or was) not an Aston Villa Fan , he was ( or is) an Arsenal Fan.</p>

<p>Latest News!! <a href="http://www.mindsetcentral.com/archives/1397" target="_blank">FBI photo fit of Bin Laden now as an older person , minus beard and turban.</a></p>

<p>Benazzir Bhutto told us he was dead , so why aren't the Feds listening?</p>

<p>Mindset Forum member Alex Fate , who Gareth seeks to categorize , is mentioned for his great posting in the forum , but failed to send in an audio clip of his answer. We have another quiz question later on in the show. Meanwhile , we fail to provide the answer to the poser - What Was Gerald Ford's real name?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mindsetcentral.com/archives/1001" target="_blank">How much of Television  new / drama is real?</a></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Airport Shells</strong></p>

<p>Gareth's first clip - Man Takes Gun Shells On Board A Plane - much discussion about the how's and why's of the story and confirmation that these were not sea shells , but ammo shells.</p>

<p>See : <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,582803,00.html" target="_blank">TSA: Passenger Carries Ammo on Plane in Milwaukee</a></p>

<p><strong>2. Pyramids:</strong></p>

<p>Peter's first clip , a seemingly innocent account of free men now being suggested as builders of the Great Pyramids. The illuminati and Symbolism was delved into . This opened a huge vein of comment, with Gareth on fire , telling a scary tale and explaining in depth how symbolism is central to the NWO and its minions workings.</p>

<p>See : <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8451538.stm" target="_blank">Egypt tombs suggest free men built pyramids, not slaves</a></p>

<p><strong>3. Hollywood Haiti</strong></p>

<p>Gareth's second clip. Last week we talked jokingly about your LA Earthquake. 3 days later and BANG! Haiti. Danny Glover gets a mention as he said it was the Earth's revenge and was caused by Global Warming and Climate Change :  Huge discussion on HAARP technology followed. Gareth's take is of a more ' what's in it for us'.</p>

<p>See : <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/16/2793859.htm?section=entertainment" target="_blank">Hollywood rallies for Haiti donations</a></p>

<p><strong>4. Salt shortage</strong></p>

<p>Peter's second clip , with some general points such as road ownership , how communities are destroyed by Super Highways , how local authorities might be suckered into failing to stock up on salt and grit due to Global Warming and mention that the UK is surrounded by a salty sea .</p>

<p>See :<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/the-big-freeze-triggers-salt-shortage-1545967.html" target="_blank">The Big Freeze triggers salt shortage</a></p>

<p><strong>5. Pat Robertson</strong></p>

<p>Gareth's 3rd clip. We come to this week's quiz question. It was generally agreed upon that Pat is demented and his words were greeted as a joke the world over. The Iris Robinson Affair in Northern Ireland was also touched upon.</p>

<p>See : <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/01/13/haiti.pat.robertson/index.html" target="_blank">Pat Robertson says Haiti paying for 'pact to the devil'</a></p>

<p><strong>6. Snow Police</strong></p>

<p>Peter's final clip. A warm human story to finish the 'Cast , with UK police happy to be filmed having fun in the snow.</p>

<p>See : <a href="http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Thames-Valley-Police-Officers-Caught-Sledging-Down-Hill-On-Riot-Shields-In-Boars-Hill-Oxford/Article/201001215522820?lpos=UK_News_First_UK_News_Article_Teaser_Region_3&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15522820_Thames_Valley_Police_Officers_Caught_Sledging_Down_Hill_On_Riot_Shields_In_Boars_Hill%2C_Oxford" target="_blank">Police Told Off For Riot-Shield Sledging</a></p>

<p>Until  Next week, Peace Out Humans...</p>]]></description>
