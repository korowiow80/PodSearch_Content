Jackson also re-introduces readers to now twenty-seven-year-old Kristi Bentz, a woman who has nearly died twice at the hands of a serial killer, and lived to tell about it.  Her dad—and Montoya’s partner—New Orleans detective, Rick Bentz wants Kristi to stay out of danger, but if anything, Kristi’s experiences have made her even more fascinated by the mind of a killer, and she’s determined to become a true crime writer.  Kristi seems to find her perfect subject after discovering that four girls have disappeared at All Saints College in less than two years.  All four were “lost souls,” troubled, vulnerable girls with no one to care about them, or come looking if they disappeared.  The police think they’re runaways, but Kristi senses there’s something that links them, so Kristi decides to enroll, following their same steps.  There are whispers of a dark cult on campus whose members wear vials of blood around their necks and meet in secret chambers, rituals to which only the elite have access.  To find the truth, Kristi will need to become part of the cult’s inner circle, learn their secrets, and play the part of lost soul without losing herself in the process.

Weber introduces readers to the bodacious women of the Big Girls Book Club (BGBC) Tammy, Egypt, Isis, Nikki, Coco, and Tiny.  There’s only one rule to be a member of this club, you must be at least a size 14 to join.  At the center of the club is president, Tammy.  She loves everything about her life— her family, her friends, but most of all she’d do anything for her husband Tim.  So much so, that for his birthday, she’s convinced that involving her best friend Egypt in a threesome with them would be the perfect gift, now if she could just convince Egypt.   Isis and her boyfriend, Tony, seem to have the perfect relationship — that is until a man from her past steps back into her life with only one goal in mind, to win back the woman he’s has never been able to forget.  Single mom Nikki isn’t so lucky with men.  After loving the father of her soon for so long, all she wants to do now is kill  him, especially since he can’t seem to stop disappointing their son every chance he gets—and then making her look like the bad guy.

TIMING IS EVERYTHING--&lt;br /&gt;Essie Mae Richardson is an elderly, wise, and church-going soul. She lives alone, but spends most of her time worrying about those around her. Using God's guidance and wisdom, Essie keeps an eye on things happening around her and when the time is right, reaches out to those who don't even know they need her. Mason and Elaine Demps are going through the motions of marriage. Elaine's need for more than financial support from her husband overwhelms her after she meets a handsome mechanic who shows an interest in her. Colin and Angel Stephens are happily married and expecting their first child, yet one careless mistake changes the tone of their marriage and possibly the outcome of Angel's pregnancy. Jennifer Mays is a single mother to Jerrod, her teenage son who she simply doesn't understand. Jerrod is holding on to past hurts that will send him to his destruction if they aren't resolved. Quite innocently, Ms. Essie touches each family in her own special way.

Weber returns with a tale of a woman who knows she's her husband's First Lady—-but doesn't want to be his last… The Bishop may be a man of God, but he’s still a man who needs a woman. Trouble is, T.K. is just as naïve as any other man when it comes to women—especially slick, bible-toting, man-hungry church women. That’s why Charlene has planned a way to hang around in spirit—to make sure her replacement is a good one. First in line is Marlene, the mother of T.K.’s illegitimate daughter, Tanisha. Then there’s Monique Johnson, First Lady of Plastic Surgery and Implants. The only thing real about Monique is how much she wants T.K. Next is Savannah Dickens, the church’s attractive new choir soloist, who’s also the daughter of a prominent church elder. And last but not least is Charlene’s good friend, Sister Lisa Mae Johnson, widow of Pastor Lee Jones. With the help of her friend Alison, Charlene anticipates any scenario that might occur in a series of letters addressed to the lucky ladies. Alison has vowed to keep an eye on T.K.’s social life and deliver them as needed. No one else knows about the letters, but rest assured, they will shake up a whole lot of people.

Black's FREEZE ME TENDER and Judy Merrill Larsen's ALLTHE NUMBERS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Bush is the author of more than three dozen novels in various genres. She has also worked as a breakdown writer on the daytime favorite, All My Children. Nancy’s newest novel, ELECTRIC BLUE, is the second in the Jane Kelly series of romantic mysteries, following Candy Apple Red.  In this second smash outing, Nancy’s wickedly funny heroine, Jane Kelly, proves herself a worthy successor to Stephanie Plum, but with a wit, style, and dog that are definitely all her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael A. Black is a former Army Military Policeman, who entered civilian law enforcement after his discharge, and for the past twenty-seven years has been a police officer in the south suburbs of Chicago. The author of over forty articles on subjects ranging from police work to popular fiction, he has also had over thirty short stories published in various anthologies and magazines, including Ellery Queen and Alfred Hitchcock’s Mystery Magazine. His novels include FREEZE ME TENDER, A Killing Frost, Windy City Knights, and The Heist, a thriller set in Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In ALL THE NUMBERS, author Judy Merrill Larsen skillfully takes us through every parent’s worst nightmare as she brilliantly explores, through fiction, how love makes us vulnerable and how very isolating yet very human is the desire for revenge. A trial takes us to a highly charged ending in which, in an unexpected turn, Ellen reconciles the pain of an irreversible past with the duty ahead.  Judy Merrill Larsen teaches high school English in St. Louis, Missouri, where she lives with her husband and five children.

Episode one of this series will feature Midwest Literary Festival author liaison Henry Perez, Nancy Bush's ELECTRIC BLUE, Michael A. Black's FREEZE ME TENDER and Judy Merrill Larsen's ALLTHE NUMBERS. Nancy Bush is the author of more than three dozen novels in various genres. She has also worked as a breakdown writer on the daytime favorite, All My Children. Nancy’s newest novel, ELECTRIC BLUE, is the second in the Jane Kelly series of romantic mysteries, following Candy Apple Red. In this second smash outing, Nancy’s wickedly funny heroine, Jane Kelly, proves herself a worthy successor to Stephanie Plum, but with a wit, style, and dog that are definitely all her own. Michael A. Black is a former Army Military Policeman, who entered civilian law enforcement after his discharge, and for the past twenty-seven years has been a police officer in the south suburbs of Chicago. The author of over forty articles on subjects ranging from police work to popular fiction, he has also had over thirty short stories published in various anthologies and magazines, including Ellery Queen and Alfred Hitchcock’s Mystery Magazine. His novels include FREEZE ME TENDER, A Killing Frost, Windy City Knights, and The Heist, a thriller set in Chicago. In ALL THE NUMBERS, author Judy Merrill Larsen skillfully takes us through every parent’s worst nightmare as she brilliantly explores, through fiction, how love makes us vulnerable and how very isolating yet very human is the desire for revenge. A trial takes us to a highly charged ending in which, in an unexpected turn, Ellen reconciles the pain of an irreversible past with the duty ahead. Judy Merrill Larsen teaches high school English in St. Louis, Missouri, where she lives with her husband and five children. She holds a master’s degree from Washington University.
