Hi! My name is Frederick. I'm an aspiring home music producer/arranger/singer. I run a site featuring the music i write, produce and sing at &lt;a href="http://www.Winterealm.com"&gt;http://www.Winterealm.com&lt;/a&gt; . This blog is a journal of my life, and the other love of my life, cooking. My occasional music podcast, &lt;b&gt;The Winterealm Show&lt;/b&gt; is also featured here. It's essentially a pre-recorded music show where i sing and play on the keyboard live on the set.</description><language>en</language><managingEditor>noreply@blogger.com (Frederico)</managingEditor><lastBuildDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2012 00:13:16 PDT</lastBuildDate><generator>Blogger http://www.blogger.com</generator><openSearch:totalResults xmlns:openSearch="http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearchrss/1.0/">84</openSearch:totalResults><openSearch:startIndex xmlns:openSearch="http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearchrss/1.0/">1</openSearch:startIndex><openSearch:itemsPerPage xmlns:openSearch="http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearchrss/1.0/">25</openSearch:itemsPerPage><feedburner:info uri="winterealm" /><atom10:link xmlns:atom10="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" rel="hub" href="http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/" /><media:copyright>The Winterealm is a copyright of Frederick Lin, 2001-2005.

He only had a humble outdated plastic Yamaha keyboard at home, left behind by his brother, but he learnt and made quite a few songs with it.&lt;br /&gt;However, he was severely restricted by the instrument's limitations. Because of that, he always kept a lookout for articles about keyboards and synthesizers, and often made secret wishlists of keyboards/synths he'd dream to own some day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a trip to Hong Kong in 2003, he came upon the Yamaha S08 keyboard/synthesizer at a well-known music store known as Tom Lee Music. The keyb&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/1600/s08_4.0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/200/s08_4.0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;oard caught his attention because it felt good to play on, and although it was pricey, it didn't seem impossible to buy. It costed approx $1700 and later the price was confirmed by Yamaha Singapore.&lt;br /&gt;So, our little young musician saved what spare money he could, and made a little goal that he will earn money with his own hands and music to buy his desired instrument. The day finally came, after a Chinese New Year in 2004, with personal savings and CNY money, he finally had the $1700 needed to buy the keyboard! (even though he didn't actually earn any money from music as originally intended). So, the happy little bugger hopped down to Yamaha Music Plaza, only to his horror, to find the price risen to $2400!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His dreams were instantly shattered, hopes dashed. It was already costing him a limb and leg to fork out $1700, lest to say $2400. So reluctantly, he gave up his dream for the Yamaha S08.&lt;br /&gt;After some research, he managed to find another keyboard, although not half as good, but it was reasonable for it's price, and a good value for money. So our budding musician bought that instrument, and made alot of progress in his music and growth for over a year using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2006. Frederick Lin was a name that rang throughout the halls of Musical Theatre Society as a talented composer and singer. He achieved much success and acclaim for a musical he wrote and staged in March 2006, and subsequently received a generous offer to compose a birthday song for the renowned Goei family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young man did some research again on the Yamaha S08, still the instrument of his dreams after 3 years... although the price at Yahama remained at $2400 (and unaffordable), he found another shop who has it for $1990 ! With enough money this time, having received some recognition for his music, he finally bought the Yamaha S08, with his own money from music.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, 1 of his dreams had come true. The 2 month wait for the shipment from Japan to arrive was over, and it was an emotional moment when he opened the huge box finally, unveiling the beauty laid within. The wait was over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/1600/s08_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/200/s08_2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/1600/s08_3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/200/s08_3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/1600/s08_6.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/200/s08_6.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/1600/s08_5.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/200/s08_5.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17166372-115018389995884150?l=thewinterealm.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">9</thr:total></item><item><title>为什么我没早点认识你</title><link>http://thewinterealm.blogspot.com/2006/05/blog-post.html</link><author>lin.frederick@gmail.com (Frederick Lin)</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 May 2006 11:28:31 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-17166372.post-114858171132082719</guid><description>&lt;span style="font-family: SimSun;" lang="ZH-CN"&gt;看见你&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;那苗条的背影&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: SimSun;" lang="ZH-CN"&gt;千言万语&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="ZH-CN"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: SimSun;" lang="ZH-CN"&gt;数不清&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: SimSun;" lang="ZH-CN"&gt;我没能力&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;表达我的心意&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: SimSun;" lang="ZH-CN"&gt;因为你已经属于别人的唯一&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;你只在我面前，却那么遥远&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: SimSun;" lang="ZH-CN"&gt;如果有一天再有个机会，&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="ZH-CN"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: SimSun;" lang="ZH-CN"&gt;我一定会从新追求你&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17166372-114858171132082719?l=thewinterealm.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>Another new song up</title><link>http://thewinterealm.blogspot.com/2006/04/another-new-song-up.html</link><author>lin.frederick@gmail.com (Frederick Lin)</author><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2006 22:44:13 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-17166372.post-114568465377767625</guid><description>Another post to redirect you to my &lt;a href="http://www.Winterealm.com"&gt;Winterealm site&lt;/a&gt;, to check out my latest Original Chinese Vocal Song.... titled 17 Sui Na Nian, i sing about a girl i met when i was 17, and a girl i met when i was 24 ...

Completed and delivered 1 project. It was a success.&lt;br /&gt;Today was a pretty significant day in my life.  I sang  a song, and moved an 82 year old man to tears. Anyway, i'll be working on some of my own stuff for awhile from now on, expect alot of songs to come.. i have like 4 songs that i'm about to release out...&lt;br /&gt;Here's 1.. but it's not an original song... a very -very- nice christian song by Hillsongs .. So You Would Come.. enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.winterealm.com/songs/vocal/arranged/Frederick%20Lin%20-%20So%20You%20Would%20Come%20%28Hillsongs%20Cover%29.mpx"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file is named mpx, but save it as an mp3. Reason for naming it mpx is so that if you click on it, it won't autoplay in quicktime, rather open up the save as dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: anyone knows anyone working at Yamaha ?

Although having a natural ability to excel in a certain area, does accelerate the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, i've learnt alot over the past month. Learnt how to manage my  time, juggling work, play and .. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;more work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, success management, which my brother brought up to me. To manage my success, involves managing what people expect out of me, and what i produce.&lt;br /&gt;Because when someone has seen/heard you do something impressive, that will set a standard in their minds. So naturally, the next thing you do, if it is lesser than what was previously done, you will disappoint, and eventually go back to square one. Key thing is, don't "Over Promote" yourself too much. So people expect less, and when you give more, they're impressed once again.&lt;br /&gt;I gotta go for now... I had lessons with Celebrity vocal instructor, Dave Stroud the past 2 days.  It was an extremely enlightening experience, and honour at the same time. Looking forward to his masterclass over the weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17166372-114433493585384897?l=thewinterealm.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>Do YOU want to SING in a Musical???</title><link>http://thewinterealm.blogspot.com/2006/03/do-you-want-to-sing-in-musical.html</link><author>lin.frederick@gmail.com (Frederick Lin)</author><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2006 07:36:29 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-17166372.post-114364651257872086</guid><description>&lt;pre wrap=""&gt;THE NEXT WAVE III of Original Singapore Musicals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CASTING CALL&lt;br /&gt;TAKE PART IN NEW MUSICALS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you sing and act?

We were sold out, much to my alarm because i had told my friends that tickets would be available in abundance on the actual day. Fortunately i did manage to get tickets for them at the last minute.&lt;br /&gt;We arrived  at 3 in the afternoon, everyone's nerves were just building and building..from our rehearsal till 10mins before our actual performance...&lt;br /&gt;But at the end of the day... it was probably the last time we'll perform this act... so everyone agreed to give it their all... and that we did... and blew the audience away. (even our director).&lt;br /&gt;People were weeping, and we received applaud for nearly every song sung.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to take this time to thank my beloved cast, for doing such a great job with my music, for enduring the rehearsals and recording sessions... for having to adhere to me and Hawk's vocal expectations.... because of everyone 's hard work, the musical was a success.&lt;br /&gt;Don't know what'll be in stored for the future now, but i hope that we'll have a chance to work together once more, someday. :)&lt;br /&gt;I will break some rules, and put up some songs from the musical on my music site sometime later... Till then, i'll be busy recording/producing new pop songs, as well as making the new Winterealm site. Keep ya'll posted. Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps: On a side note, i don't know if she's crazy, really thoughtful, or just have alot of free time, but my friend &lt;a href="http://ngader.livejournal.com"&gt;Miss A&lt;/a&gt;, has compiled a must-have warddrobe list for guys. &lt;a href="http://ngader.livejournal.com/422999.html"&gt;Check it out here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17166372-114343007453885608?l=thewinterealm.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">1</thr:total></item><item><title>Final Promo for my musical</title><link>http://thewinterealm.blogspot.com/2006/03/final-promo-for-my-musical.html</link><author>lin.frederick@gmail.com (Frederick Lin)</author><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2006 17:57:39 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-17166372.post-114316429104658710</guid><description>Ok guys... The musical that i have been working on will be showing tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;It's titled &lt;em&gt;Closer to Your Heart&lt;/em&gt;. The story and script was written by &lt;a href="http://massb.blogspot.com/"&gt;Mohd Shaifulburi&lt;/a&gt;, a very promising writer/director.&lt;br /&gt;The music, is composed and arranged by yours truly. I will also be acting/singing in it for a couple of scenes.&lt;br /&gt;The story is about a broken family and how the members deal with their problems, only to find their relationships drifting further instead.&lt;br /&gt;Mae had lost her husband after moving to Singapore, and 1 of her 2 sons shortly died after... Leaving her with her rebellious son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The musical will be held at &lt;a href="http://www.streetdirectory.com/asia_travel/travel/travel.php?masterid=12927&amp;amp;buildingid=413"&gt;The Artshouse&lt;/a&gt;, which is located behind Victoria Theatre.&lt;br /&gt;Tickets will be available at the door, and will buy you 2 musicals. Moon People, and Closer to Your Heart. First show starts at 8pm, Mine starts at 9pm .&lt;br /&gt;If you don't have anything on tomorrow evening, you might want to consider attending.. since $20 for 2 musicals is pretty cheap! Support local productions! And this is probably the last you will hear from me regarding saturday's performance. :)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17166372-114316429104658710?l=thewinterealm.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>Closer to Closer to Your Heart</title><link>http://thewinterealm.blogspot.com/2006/03/closer-to-closer-to-your-heart.html</link><author>lin.frederick@gmail.com (Frederick Lin)</author><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2006 18:09:33 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-17166372.post-114290697393782823</guid><description>Pardon the pun.. haha... Did the recording for the comemmorative at Stereo Image Productions yesterday after work. Ended at about 11:30pm, had dinner and then took a cab back.&lt;br /&gt;The recording went pretty well, especially for first timer Shahddon, it was quite daunting for him. But he pulled it off. I'm just glad my coaching during his takes helped him and solved his problems..&lt;br /&gt;So i'm really honoured and happy, that ours is the only musical to have 3 tracks in the CD, aside from ending the CD. I also have my name plastered ALL over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Composer: Frederick Lin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Arranger : Frederick Lin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Lyricist: Frederick Lin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Assistant Producer: Frederick Lin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Performed by: Frederick Lin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a preview of the programme guide for the night, and i'm just glad that i used a good picture of myself, coz, there are 2 profiles of me in the book. Once in the composer section, and the other in the Cast section.&lt;br /&gt;In anycase, i think i'm drawing alot of attention. Just hope the attention will be good, and come from good sources.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17166372-114290697393782823?l=thewinterealm.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>Closer to Your Heart: A Musical by Mohd Shaiful &amp; Frederick Lin</title><link>http://thewinterealm.blogspot.com/2006/03/closer-to-your-heart-musical-by-mohd.html</link><author>lin.frederick@gmail.com (Frederick Lin)</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Mar 2006 03:21:56 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-17166372.post-114259386662034941</guid><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/1600/thenextwave.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/400/thenextwave.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The musical i've been working on is finally complete, and the response so far to the preview has been excellent.

I'm honoured, and very happy that i'm finally getting some acknowledgement for my music.&lt;br /&gt;Closer to Your Heart is on Day 2 of the musical spree, which is on the 25th of March, Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;For $20, you get to watch 2 musicals, Moon People and Closer to Your Heart.

I went to get my hair cut at Far East Plaza today, after which, i decided to drop by the supermarket at Isetan. Why there? Because being a japanese supermarket, it packs ALOT of goodies than you can't find elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since reading about &lt;a href="http://www.chubbyhubby.net/2005/06/mentaiko-tobiko-pasta-imbb-16.html"&gt;Mentaiko Pasta on ChubbyHubby's&lt;/a&gt;, i had been dying to try it out, given it's simplicity to create. But the main reason is, i wish to know if it tastes as good as it looks. I have no idea how mentaiko tastes like, so it was quite exciting.&lt;br /&gt;The packet of mentaiko. Looked a little appalling. Especially the thought of it being eaten raw.&lt;br /&gt;Mentaiko in it's sags look like a raw piece of organ, specifically, a kidney.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, i bought my goods, got home and cooked it as soon as i could. Whipped out the camera and took a few shots. This is the first time i have prepared a 'high class' dish, and presented it nicely. I think i give myself 7/10. The taste, was not disappointing. :)&lt;br /&gt;For the recipe i based tonight's dinner on, check out &lt;a href="http://www.chubbyhubby.net/2005/06/mentaiko-tobiko-pasta-imbb-16.html"&gt;CH's Mentaiko Pasta post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;My version of it is slightly more sinful though. Actually features 3 whole strips of bacon, together with 1 shredded bacon sauteed with the onions. The rest of it is exactly the same as his recipe.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks CH, for introducing this to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/1600/Mentaiko_3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/400/Mentaiko_3.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17166372-114139943641997680?l=thewinterealm.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">2</thr:total></item><item><title>Ramly Burger Debut!</title><link>http://thewinterealm.blogspot.com/2006/03/ramly-burger-debut_03.html</link><author>lin.frederick@gmail.com (Frederick Lin)</author><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2006 07:11:03 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-17166372.post-114139866365102488</guid><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/1600/Ramly1.0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/400/Ramly1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/1600/Ramly2.0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/400/Ramly2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished vocal training late last night, and didn't exactly have anything planned for dinner. Walking past the night market set up near my home, i noticed a stall selling the famous Ramly Burger. I don't really know the origins of this humble burger, but it has been popularize by the Malaysians apparently.&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, it's a burger with a meat patty, a very thin omlette, diced onions, cheese, mayo and an unknown (to me) dark sauce.&lt;br /&gt;The burgers are freshly made on the spot upon request. Watching the person make the burger is kinda interesting for the first timer, because it involves some flair and stylistic moves, which seperates one ramly stall from another. You'd see the cook tossing the sauce cans in the air, and handling the ingredients with finesse.&lt;br /&gt;It tasted quite good. I don't really know how to describe it. It's nothing like a Macdonalds, Burger King, Subway. I guess it's uniquely .. Ramly. :)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17166372-114139866365102488?l=thewinterealm.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>Featured on Mr Brown Show</title><link>http://thewinterealm.blogspot.com/2006/02/featured-on-mr-brown-show.html</link><author>lin.frederick@gmail.com (Frederick Lin)</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2006 01:08:15 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-17166372.post-114111759583390380</guid><description>A pleasant surprise greeted me today when i listened to the latest &lt;a href="http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2006/02/browncast_shoot.html"&gt;Mr Brown show podcast&lt;/a&gt;. The jingle that i did for them like a month ago was finally aired, and i think they're even gonna use it from now on as their jingle. It felt a little odd hearing someone talk about you on the show, but i guess it's an honour... haha. Incase you missed the post i made about the jingle, you can get it &lt;a href="http://thewinterealm.blogspot.com/2005/12/parodyjingle-for-mr-brown-show.html"&gt;here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17166372-114111759583390380?l=thewinterealm.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>My saturday breakfast pwns.</title><link>http://thewinterealm.blogspot.com/2006/02/my-saturday-breakfast-pwns.html</link><author>lin.frederick@gmail.com (Frederick Lin)</author><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2006 05:20:34 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-17166372.post-114086132813736095</guid><description>I look forward to weekends for many reasons. One of which is the weekend breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to make my weekend breakfast as enjoyable as i can, coz it's the only 2 days where i actually have time to enjoy a nice  breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;This weekend, inspired by &lt;a href="http://www.chubbyhubby.net"&gt;ChubbyHubby's&lt;/a&gt; recent cheeseburger post, i decided to make Cheese Muffin! It's a very sinful muffin sandwich, but extremely... extremely... tasty...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/1600/bacon_muffin1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/320/bacon_muffin1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/1600/bacon_muffin2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3990/1648/320/bacon_muffin2.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;Start by frying your bacon as normal, with abit of oil. I used 2 strips of streaky bacon, cut into half. So that's 4 pieces in total.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;After bacon is done, put the bacon aside, and crack an egg directly into the grease left over by the bacon, and stir the eggs in the  pan until they're cooked. Once they're done, put aside. It takes about 1-2 minutes for the eggs to be done. You shouldn't have much grease left in the pan, it should've been absorbed by the egg.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;Turn down the heat, add a slab of butter, and brown the cut sides of your muffins. Let it grill for about 3-5 mins, the upside should be soft, while the cut side should be crispy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;Put the 2 pieces of muffin on a plate, 2 pieces of bacon on the bottom side, eggs on top, and another 2 pieces of bacon on top.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;Cut about 2 slices of cheddar, put em' on top of the top side of the muffin, and put them in a conventional oven for about 5 mins to melt the cheese. Watch out for the muffin getting burnt though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:85%;"&gt;When the cheese has melted, just put the 2 sides of the muffins together, and it's done!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavenly.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17166372-114086132813736095?l=thewinterealm.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>YAM - Yet Another Monday</title><link>http://thewinterealm.blogspot.com/2006/02/yam-yet-another-monday.html</link><author>lin.frederick@gmail.com (Frederick Lin)</author><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2006 18:27:35 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-17166372.post-114040245576355058</guid><description>The weekend was a decent. Well my family problem is coming to a close for now, Thank God. Went down to The Next Stage Academy at Newton (Which is basically the Theatrical section of United Artistes Network). Halfway walking there, it started raining...... very... heavily... so i took off and ran out to the main road, thinkign that i'd find a bus stop or something.&lt;br /&gt;There wasn't a single shelter in sight. -_- . So i continued running under the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;heavy&lt;/span&gt; rain, and luckily found a huge tree with a big extended branch, which i stood under for 5 mins, until the sudden downpour slowed down. By then, i already was 90% drenched.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, the rain did subsided in 5 mins, afterwhich, i walked briskly to the venue. (no point running since i'm already all wet). The last time i got drenched so bad in the rain i think was back in Secondary School, when we actually thought it felt cool to 'take a shower in the public'. Haha. Good times.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17166372-114040245576355058?l=thewinterealm.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>Free Your Voice!

Don't get me wrong, the banquet was perfectly executed. It was the first time i attended a Halal/Muslim banquet, and it was interesting. However, my headache was so bad that all i could do all night was wear a smile and drink my glass of water. Any attempts at putting the food in my mouth simply felt revolting, and made me want to puke. Not that the food was bad, the food seemed to be pretty good, but i was simply not well. Fortunately, i did'nt puke and make a fool of myself. It was pretty much a night of enduring and keeping my cool. First time i attended a banquet with a small portion of food on my plate from the 3rd course, that remained untouched all the way till the 8th course. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned home at 2330, feeling slightly better. Played a little FF, mainly doing &lt;br /&gt;something that was scheduled with my FF gang days ago, at the same time, preparing some amterial for today's musical meeting. Finally hit the sacks at 01:30 am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woke up today with my head feelin' really heavy, and like 20% control of my eyelids. Dragged myself to work anyway, after poppin' 2 asprins. &lt;br /&gt;Gonna sleep the lunch away... i seriously lack sleep... i think.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/17166372-113997326559874567?l=thewinterealm.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>It's Scam-The-Couples day!</title><link>http://thewinterealm.blogspot.com/2006/02/its-scam-couples-day.html</link><author>lin.frederick@gmail.com (Frederick Lin)</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2006 20:32:02 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-17166372.post-113989152203055590</guid><description>Hello, It's Valentine's day, and as most of us know, it is the day couples all over the world get scammed of their money on expensive but 2nd grade quality dining.&lt;br /&gt;The best meal would be one cooked at home by/for your companion! :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm so busy this week.. &lt;br /&gt;Tuesday   - Vocal Lesssons with Dan 1830-1910&lt;br /&gt;            Wedding Dinner 1930 - 2300 (?)&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday - 1st full cast meeting for Closer to Your Heart: The Musical. - 1845 - 2230&lt;br /&gt;Thursday  - Possible Meeting with Local Film maker Lionel Chok - 1930ish - ????&lt;br /&gt;Friday    - Some R&amp;R time finally.
