<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B> </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> There&#8217;s this video game art project called <a href="http://hcsoftware.sourceforge.net/passage/"><i>Passage</i> by Jason Rohrer</a>.  Have you heard of this?</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Okay. Because your book reminded me very much of this.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;ll have to forward you the link. Basically, it&#8217;s this sidescroller.  It&#8217;s in a 100 pixel by, I think, 13 pixel window.  And you control this person who goes from left to right.  From beginning to end of life.  And you pick up a partner.  In fact, you grow a beard.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And you die at the end.  And it takes the 8-bit sidescroller and it turns it into this unexpectedly poignant moment.  If you play it enough times, you can move the cursor down and actually have the figure go into this mire and collect stars, but maybe not have a partner or maybe meet an early demise there.  And it absolutely reflects what life is.  And I read your book, and I was extremely aware of the physicality.  Not just because it was an 800 page book, but because the first 400 pages is basically these escapades of lots of sex, youthful brio, and so forth.  And then, suddenly, decades flash by often when we read this.  And I&#8217;m curious, just to start off here, where did the design of this structure come from?  I know you&#8217;re very keen on structures.  You&#8217;ve written about this many times.  But how did this come about in <i>Spiders</i>?</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Well, it came from being a person who&#8217;s gotten older.  I just had my 70th birthday. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes. Happy birthday.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Thank you very much.  And one of the things that does happen, and it&#8217;s a really interesting phenomena, is that time seems to go a lot faster as you get older. When you were young, time takes forever.  You go to the doctor.  You wait around for two hours in the doctor&#8217;s office. It seems like three months. Whereas I went to the doctor&#8217;s office this morning.  I went in.  And the next thing I knew, I was on my way here.  And I&#8217;d been there about two and a half hours. And it didn&#8217;t seem that any time had passed at all.  And I was at the University of Massachusetts between 1988 and 1999, for eleven years. And that seemed much longer than the last twelve years, thirteen years, that I&#8217;d been at Temple University, where I&#8217;ve been there from 1999 to this year, 2012.  And that seems much shorter than the eleven years that I was at UMass.  And there&#8217;s no way to avoid this. As you get older and older, time just begins to rush by.  And I wanted to get this. So actually, the time goes faster and faster through the book.  But at a certain point, you realize, &#8220;Oh wait a minute! It&#8217;s rushing along.&#8221;  As one of the reviewers said, decades drop out between paragraphs.  Well, that&#8217;s what happens.  That&#8217;s how your life kind of goes.  So in that sense, the structure of the book is based on the structure of my own experience. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> What&#8217;s very strange though &#8212; I read the book and, actually, I started missing the sex after that 400 page mark.  I mean, all of a sudden, wait a minute, they&#8217;re not having so much sex anymore. There isn&#8217;t all the snot stuff and the pissing and the corprophiia and, of course, the father-son stuff.  All of a sudden, we don&#8217;t have a lot of that at all.  And then you drop some, quite literally, serious bombs later on in the book.  And this leads me to ask&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Well, the sex doesn&#8217;t vanish. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, of course. It&#8217;s there. It keeps going on.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> I mean, the sex is there.  But it&#8217;s the sex that someone older has. And one of the things that they have to deal with is the fact that your body changes as you get older.  And somewhere between 50 and 60, you go through the equivalent of the male climacteric. Which is a very strange thing to go through.  Quite as odd&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh god. Thanks for warning me.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Quite as odd as, what is the term for women?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Menopause.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Menopause, yes. It&#8217;s very much like the menopause. And somehow you&#8217;re not warned. You aren&#8217;t warned how it&#8217;s going to change. Everybody notices the body changing. From ten to twenty, there are going to be a lot of changes. But there are going to be just as many changes from twenty to thirty, from thirty to forty, forty to fifty, fifty to sixty.  You konw, I&#8217;ve been with my partner now, Dennis, for almost twenty-four years.  And we still have a sex life.  And we&#8217;re very fond of one another and very close.  But it&#8217;s different.  Things do change. And that&#8217;s one of the things that it&#8217;s about.  I wanted to explore what the relationship of two men who were notably older was.  And so I tried to do that.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You have said also in <i>About Writing</i>, which I&#8217;m probably going to be cribbing a lot from for this conversation, that a short story&#8217;s not exactly the best thing to include in a novel.  And yet this book arose out of a short story that was published in <i>Black Clock</i>.  Which leads me back to the original query.  How did this thing become structured?  How did this take on a life of its own?</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Well, I had to throw away the whole second half of the original short story and rewrite something that flowed into the novel.  If you actually compared it, the opening couple of scenes are very similar, although not identical by any means.  There were lots of changes all through it.  From the very first paragraph.  But I wanted to use that as a kind of jumping off point.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, that&#8217;s one hell of a jumping off point.  800 pages.  I mean, why do you think that you were interested in exploring such an expansive format?  Why did Eric and Shit demand this sort of attention?</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Well, because I wanted to talk about a lasting relationship between two men.  And a very committed relationship.  They&#8217;re very close to each other.  They&#8217;re absolutely fixated on one another.  I mean, neither one of them could really make it without the other.  Which is the tragedy that Eric is faced with at the end.  So I just wanted to explore that and see what happened, and deal with all these things.  The time speeds up in the first half of the book too.  The first 400 pages basically take, what, about seven years.  So that&#8217;s even years.  That&#8217;s a good Dickens novel.  (<i>laughs</i>)  But this is a book that goes on for basically sixty or seventy years.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah. I wanted to also talk about the location.  Since my name is Ed, I have to bring up another Ed.  E.M. Forster. You have often quoted the advice given in <i>Aspects of the Novel</i>.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> &#8220;Write what you know.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> &#8220;Write what you know.&#8221;  But your idea here is to build upon that and say, in addition to writing what you know, it&#8217;s very good to keep the writing alive and energetic if you write about something that you&#8217;ve only experienced a few times.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Right. Exactly. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And in this, it&#8217;s interesting because it should be evident by your Lear-like use &#8212; another Ed &#8212; of &#8220;runcible&#8221; that this Georgia is a fantasy of sorts.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Yes. It&#8217;s a fairytale.  The whole book is an 800 page fairytale.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> By which I mean things like <i>Don Quixote</i>. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Of course. But my question is: You&#8217;re almost writing what you know and you&#8217;re writing what you don&#8217;t know, or only know a little bit of.  Because we have to go to <i>Times Square Red Times Square Blue</i>, which I also read.  You write about a man in that named Tommy.  He wears a sleeveless denim jacket.  Well, there&#8217;s a guy with a sleeveless shirt here.  And he collected scrap metal.  Not unlike this.  You look at The Dump. It could also be The Deuce.  The Opera House.  It could also be the Metropolitan Opera House.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Easily.  Well, it wouldn&#8217;t be the Metropolitan.  But it could be one of the old porn theaters before &#8217;95.  Before New York closed them down.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I guess my question though is: by putting much of these viewpoints that you have raised both in your fiction and your nonfiction to Georgia, to the edge of the earth quite literally, I mean, what does this allow you to do as a fiction writer?  How does this allow you to explore a subculture that, say, keeping everything in New York would not?</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Well, one of the things that I wanted to show is that the kind of life that Eric and Morgan &#8212; his nickname is Shit.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You can say &#8220;Shit&#8221; here.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> That Eric and Shit lead &#8212; as I said, besides being a fairytale, is also &#8212; well, I&#8217;m trying to figure out a good way to put this.  In some ways, it&#8217;s kind of didactic.  It&#8217;s almost like a <i>Bildungsroman</i>.  They have to learn how to live their life.  And it can&#8217;t be done &#8212; and this is, I really feel &#8212; and this is one of the reasons why it had to be a fairytale &#8212; it needs institutional support. Which is why there has to be the Kyle Foundation and why there has to be a certain support, a certain community support for what they&#8217;re doing.  And at the same time, they&#8217;re very much on the margin of this community.  They&#8217;re not in the center of this community.  So that people like Mr. Potts, for instance.  A very conservative man who just doesn&#8217;t want his nephew, who has come down to spend the winter with him, associating with these riffraff who use the gay-friendly restroom.  Because he doesn&#8217;t like the idea of gay men using the restrooms at all.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Where did the Kyle Foundation come from? </p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> It was purely out of my head.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Really. Because there&#8217;s a specific phrasing in their mantra: &#8220;an institution dedicated to the betterment of the lives of black gay men and of those of all races and creeds connected to them by elective and non-elective affinities.&#8221;  And that phrasing recalls any number of Islamic foundations and the like.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> And also the Goethe novel.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes!</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> <i>Elective Affinities</i>.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So that was really more where it came from? </p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> It came more from Goethe than it did from Islam.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Sure.  Steven Shaviro.  <a href="http://www.shaviro.com/Blog/?p=528">He has pointed out</a> that the intensities of your pornography are never presented as transgressive.  Now in a disclaimer&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Although this is pretty transgressive.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, of course. I want to talk about this.  Because in a disclaimer to <i>The Mad Man</i>, of which we see statues of something that crops up in there appearing in this, you called <i>The Mad Man</i> &#8220;a pornotopic fantasy: a set of people, incidents, places, and relations among them that never happened and could not happen for any number of surely self-evident reasons.&#8221;  Well, there is no such disclaimer for <i>Spiders</i> and we see much of the same stuff, as I said.  Piss-drinking, shit-eating, you name it.  I&#8217;m wondering.  How does a pornotopic fantasy &#8212; how does one of these, whether it be <i>The Mad Man</i> or <i>Spiders</i> or even the infamous <i>Hogg</i>, how does this help us to understand or come to terms with the realities of sex and what the present limits are?  What some people might call deviancy today or perhaps yesterday.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Well, literature is divided into genres like that.  You have the world of comedy, the world of tragedy. And you have the world of pornography.  And each of them is a kind of subgenre.  And sometimes they can be mixed.  You can go from one to the other. And I think pornotopia is the place, as I&#8217;ve written about, where the major qualities &#8212; the major aspect of pornotopia, it&#8217;s a place where any relation, if you put enough pressure on it, can suddenly become sexual. You walk into the reception area of the office and you look at the secretary and the secretary looks at you and the next minute you&#8217;re screwing on the desk.  That&#8217;s pornotopia.  Which, every once in a while, actually happens.  But it doesn&#8217;t happen at the density.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Frequency.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> At the frequency that it happens in pornotopia.  In pornotopia, it happens nonstop. And yet some people are able to write about that sort of thing relatively realistically.  And some people aren&#8217;t.  Something like <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> is not a very realistic account. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve read that by now.</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> I&#8217;ve read about five pages. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And it was enough for you to throw against the wall?</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> No. I didn&#8217;t throw it.  I just thought it was hysterically funny.  But because the writer doesn&#8217;t use it to make any real observations on the world that is the case, you know, it&#8217;s ho-hum.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> How do we hook those moms who were so driven to <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> on, say, something like this?  </p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re going to.  I think the realistic &#8212; and there&#8217;s a lot that&#8217;s relatively realistic about it and there&#8217;s also a lot that isn&#8217;t.  Probably less so in this book than in, let&#8217;s say, <i>The Mad Man</i>, which probably has a higher proportion of realism to fantasy.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I also wanted to ask you &#8212; what&#8217;s interesting is that there is almost a limit to the level of pornography in this. There&#8217;s one funeral scene where something is going to happen and they say, &#8220;Nuh-uh. You&#8217;re not allowed to do that. Show some respect.&#8221;  And roughly around the 300 page mark, I was very conscious of the fact that you didn&#8217;t actually use the word &#8220;ass.&#8221;  And you were always using &#8220;butt.&#8221;  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> I didn&#8217;t even notice.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And so when &#8220;ass&#8221; showed up, I was actually shocked by that.  So I&#8217;m wondering.  Does any exploration of sexual behavior, outlandish sexual behavior or sexual behavior that&#8217;s outside the norms of what could possibly happen, whether it be frequency or density or what not &#8212; does it require limits with which to look at it?  With which to see it in purely fantastical terms?</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Well, I think one of the things that you need to write a book, especially a book this long, is you need a certain amount of variety.  And I think that this is perhaps a failing.  There are only so many things that you can do.  I think I give a good sampling of them.  But every once in a while, I&#8217;m sure it probably gets somewhat repetitious.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, it&#8217;s a good variety pack.  But it&#8217;s also: &#8220;Okay, reader, you have to get beyond these first 350 pages and then, by then, you are actually able to get into totally unanticipated territory and I&#8217;ve already locked you in.&#8221;  How did you work that out?  </p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> One of the things is that you try and keep telling interesting things about the sex.  I mean, things that can be observed about the world that is the case.  I mean, I tried to talk about the sex in terms of &#8212; I don&#8217;t think most people know how a dog has an orgasm.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> How do we find this out? (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Delany:</b> Uh, there&#8217;s a wonderful website. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B> </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> What about overseas jobs?  I mean, two-thirds of all the people who made or sold iPods in 2006, as you point out in the book, were located overseas &#8212; most in production jobs.  One of your solutions in the &#8220;What to Do&#8221; section at the end is to import more skilled labor.  What of these Apple production jobs?  I think I&#8217;m returning to what we were talking about earlier, about the difference between skilled labor and unskilled labor and moderately skilled labor.  Surely, there needs to be some sort of infrastructure in place.  Some patch till we actually get to this great skills gap solution which we seem to be talking about.  I mean, it just seems to me that we&#8217;re trying to fight a very difficult problem with a form of idealism that is just incompatible with that reality.</p>
<p><b>Noah:</b> Well, it&#8217;s very hard to compete globally for low skilled jobs.  Because it&#8217;s a race to the bottom.  You end up engaging in wage competition with some of the poorest countries in the world and that&#8217;s not going to make anybody prosper.  If you look at a country like Germany, they&#8217;ve managed to hang onto their manufacturing sector.  But the way they&#8217;ve done it is they have gone after the highly skilled manufacturing jobs.  Of course, they also have a much more healthy labor movement.  Here in the United States, we&#8217;ve had the labor movement been decimated or down and out.  7% of all employed workers.  So another part of the solution is to rebuild the labor movement.  I&#8217;m not saying that it&#8217;s going to be easy to address these problems.  But in talking about ways to address them, I decided there was really very little point in pretending that tiny little solutions were going to do much.  I think it&#8217;s time to start a discussion about some of the more ambitious things we can do.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But as you also note, &#8220;If you have a job that you can perform from home, it&#8217;s worth asking yourself whether an English speaker could perform the job tolerably well from halfway around the world at one thirtieth the pay.&#8221;  Do you think that America has the obligation to give everybody a job?  That that might actually be the solution in some way?  Or do you think the labor force really needs to revert to its inherent skills?  Or skills that they can actually acquire to get those jobs?  I think I&#8217;m trying to get an answer from you in terms of whether it&#8217;s actually the corporations&#8217; fault or whether it&#8217;s education&#8217;s fault or whether it&#8217;s the people who are unskilled &#8212; whether it&#8217;s their fault.  </p>
<p><b>Noah:</b> Well, I don&#8217;t know whose fault it is, per se.  I mean, I think our workers need to acquire those skills one way or the other.  And anything we can do to encourage that would be good.  Because offshoring is a real problem.  Although interestingly, the projections from here forward are that offshoring will have a bad impact on our economy.  But it won&#8217;t continue probably to have a very bad impact on income inequality.  And that&#8217;s because those other countries are now coming after the skilled jobs.  And it will be very interesting politically to see how that plays out.  There are a lot of affluent people who, when you talk about other countries eating our lunch in manufacturing, they say, &#8220;Well, we need free trade.  You have to have capital flow across borders.  Otherwise, we won&#8217;t have prosperity.&#8221;  Well, I wonder if they&#8217;ll still be saying the same thing when suddenly you have, for example, American radiologists competing with radiologists overseas.  You&#8217;ve already got a bit of that.  And there are any number of very highly paid jobs that could be performed offsite.  And Alan Blinder, an economist at Princeton, he says that he actually thinks that slightly more of the offshore jobs of the future will be skilled rather than unskilled. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Wow.  Well, in 1971, <a href="http://reclaimdemocracy.org/corporate_accountability/powell_memo_lewis.html">Lewis Powell wrote a memo</a>:  &#8220;The American economic system was under attack from Communists, New Leftists, and other revolutionaries,&#8221; as well as &#8220;perfectly respectable elements of society.&#8221;  So this memo results in this tremendous flurry of pro-business lobbying from organizations and so forth.  Various consumer-oriented laws are killed through this effective lobbying.  And that was forty years ago.  Now pro-business lobbying today is arguably more pronounced than then.  You point out in the book the figure &#8212; that the Chamber of Commerce spent $132 million in 2010.  As you point out, not a single labor union could be found among the top twenty lobbyists.  So how then can any pro-labor organization make a serious dent with these particular states?  I mean, what hope is there for a modern day Walter Reuther in this post-Taft-Hartley age?</p>
<p><b>Noah:</b> Well, it is true that the corporate power in Washington has vastly increased.  And it increased not just because of the Powell memo, but really throughout the late &#8217;60s and the 1970s, you had corporations absolutely flipping out at the rise of the regulatory state and counter-culture politics and Ralph Nader.  And one person I write about in the book a great deal is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harlow">Bryce Harlow</a>, who is best known as a White House aide in the Nixon White House, where he was kind of a good guy.  He was trying to keep Nixon honest.  Failed at that, but he was considered one of the few honorable men in the Nixon White House.  That&#8217;s all true. But he had a separate role where he spent most of his career post-1960.  And that was as the Procter &#038; Gamble representative in Washington DC.  In 1961, when he came to work for Procter &#038; Gamble, there were just a handful of corporate representatives in Washington DC.  And Harlow looked around and thought, &#8220;We need troops here.&#8221; And he started going around the country and evangelizing and giving speeches saying, &#8220;We need to build up corporate power in Washington.&#8221;  And one of the things I really like about Harlow is that he didn&#8217;t mince words.  He identified the enemy as a movement towards greater equality.  Sometimes people say, &#8220;Well, what does the rise of corporate influence in Washington have to do with equality?&#8221;  Well, Harlow himself made the connection.  And he succeeded.  And Lewis Powell wrote that memo in &#8217;71.  Succeeded.  Over time, corporations were bestirred to increase their presence in Washignton.  Increase their lobbying.  And they get a lot more done actually through lobbying than they do through campaign contributions.  And as a result, you saw a change in our politics.  It hurt the consumer movement.  And it hurt the general movement towards greater equality.  So, yes, that makes the task a lot more difficult.  But I don&#8217;t think there is a bigger, more important challenge to liberalism right now than to find a way to rebuild the labor movements somehow.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Do you have any ideas on this?  Because it&#8217;s pretty decimated and gutted.  As you point out, the Walmart situation is terrible.</p>
<p><b>Noah:</b> Yes.  In part of the book, I have a narrative about the attempt to unionize a Wal-Mart in Colorado.  And the extent to which the deck is stacked against labor is not to be believed.  It is literally true that nobody has ever managed to unionize a Wal-Mart, except for once when the meat cutters in some place in Texas managed to get themselves declared a bargaining unit.  And they voted to unionize.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/09/business/09walmart.html?pagewanted=print">And what do you know?</a>  About a week later, Wal-Mart said, &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to be cutting meat anymore.  We&#8217;re just going to be selling prepackaged meat.&#8221;  So it is very, very difficult.  But there&#8217;s an interesting idea that&#8217;s been put forward by Richard Kahlenberg of the Century Foundation.  Part of the underlying problem is simply a matter of law.  I mean, laws favor management over unions.  And the ultimate source of this is the 1947 Taft-Hartley law.  Which was passed right before the peak of the union movement.  But it acted as a slow-acting poison on the labor movement.  So you need to roll back Taft-Hartley.  And you need to revitalize the National Labor Relations Board.  And Kahlenberg&#8217;s idea is: he says, &#8220;Look, nobody seems to really &#8212; it&#8217;s been multiple generations since anybody got really excited about workers&#8217; rights.  So rather than frame this as labor rights, why don&#8217;t we frame it as a civil right? Why don&#8217;t we pass a law saying that it is a civil right protected by the Civil Rights Act to organize a union?&#8221;  It is actually illegal for a boss to fire somebody for trying to form a union.  But the law is so weak that, as Kahlenberg says, it&#8217;s actually economically irrational for bosses to obey that law.  But if you were to extend protection of the Civil Rights Act, then workers would be able to take their bosses to court and sue them.  And that might change the equation.  That might help.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I agree with you.  But unfortunately, as we saw with the healthcare debate, framing anything as a civil right creates a protracted battle and constant gridlock and endless concessions.  And as you pointed out with the Wal-Mart example, businesses are pretty much free to do whatever they want.  If someone&#8217;s going ahead and being an irksome worker, well, we&#8217;ll go ahead and whack that part of our operations out.  So is there any hope for labor when you have legislation against them and you also have this anything goes, unfettered approach from Wal-Mart and the like?</p>
<p><b>Noah:</b> Sure. There&#8217;s always hope.  There&#8217;s always hope.  There was a time.  If you go back to 1932, things were looking pretty bleak then too.  And we got a government that was pro-labor  And really the growth of labor unions was largely a result of the New Deal.  So government could make it happen again.  It&#8217;s very difficult in this environment, I will grant you.  There is a huge amount of demonization of labor.  I was talking with a liberal economics writer the other day.  And he was saying, &#8220;The problem with labor unions is that labor unions in America, they have this culture that&#8217;s so adversarial.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Culture? Culture?  They&#8217;re down to 7% of the private sector workforce.  You can have any culture you want.  Because they&#8217;re going to be starting from scratch.&#8221;  So I think there needs to be &#8212; as I say, it is the most difficult challenge.  But I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re going to see any substantial improvement towards equality without empowering workers. There&#8217;s just no reason for bosses to pay workers a lot of money if they don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Do you think any movement that would actually amend some of these problems is not being adversarial enough?  I mean, even Occupy Wall Street has to be careful.  Because you have the police issuing all of these crazy regulations, as we saw with <a href="http://gothamist.com/2012/04/20/feds_tells_ows_to_vacate_federal_ha.php">Federal Hall</a>.  And now you have competing statutes of how they can protest.  The world&#8217;s most exclusive club at 25, as we saw.  So the question is, well, they have to remain calm.  Which is totally unprecedented if you look at our history.  If you look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_bombing">bombs going off</a> in Wall Street decades before.  So maybe the economics writer who you were talking to might, in fact, be right.  That the problem is also cultural as well.  Do you think that?</p>
<p><b>Noah:</b> Well, you just need to be strategic about the proper methods to use.  I think there are certain situations where an adversarial approach is called for.  There are other situations where a cooperative approach is called for.  One thing that distinguishes European &#8212; Western European &#8212; labor unions from American ones is they are more cooperative.  They have a part of a three-part partnership between industry and labor and the government.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reuther">Walter Reuther</a>, who was I think maybe the greatest labor leader who ever lived, was the president of the United Auto Workers in the 1940s, the 1950s, and the 1960s.  And he tried very hard to establish something like that European model here.  And it&#8217;s fascinating.  He was a brilliant man.  And he was constantly proposing things to management that would actually help the company.  He would say &#8212; for example, after World War II, he said, &#8220;My workers will sacrifice some pay because we need to worry about postwar inflation. They will sacrifice some pay.  But they have to see that management will show some restraint too by not raising the price of cars.&#8221; And this was a time when auto sales were oligopolistic in the United States.  It didn&#8217;t have a lot to do with supply and demand.  So you could knock the price down of the car and still have plenty of profit.  Reuther would say &#8212; there&#8217;s actually one instance &#8212; I can&#8217;t remember if it was that instance or another one &#8212; where he was actually told, &#8220;You know, Walter, that&#8217;s a really good idea.  But because it&#8217;s your idea, we&#8217;re not going to do it.&#8221;  </p>

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Contemplating a new career in unique dairy products.</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> <a href="http://www.florencewilliams.com/">Florence Williams</a></p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B> </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I wouldn&#8217;t to actually get into the history of breastfeeding.  Before the 20th century, of course, breastfeeding was the main method of feeding babies.  Then we have postwar life ushering in formula and so forth.  It has been pointed out, as you say in the book, by evolutionary biologists that 6,000 human genes relating to lactation are among our most stubbornly conserved ones and, if natural selection as even Darwin has pointed out is in favor of lactation, my question to you is: why is artificial selection through industry so very much against it?  Just to get things started here.</p>
<p><b>Williams:</b> Oh, that&#8217;s a big question.  Well, you know, there have always been women throughout history &#8212; even in our deep evolutionary past &#8212; who didn&#8217;t want to breastfeed or who couldn&#8217;t breastfeed.  Of course, many women died in child birth.  There were lots of breast infections, as well as other infections related to child birth.  And so sometimes women couldn&#8217;t produce enough milk.  And so as I point out in the book, actually wet nursing is one of the oldest professions known to humankind.  You know, humans are very flexible and picky in their feeding habits.  And some populations wouldn&#8217;t wean their infants for years.  Three, four years.  The recent cover of <i>Time</i> Magazine was so shocking because it had a three-year-old on the cover.  But, in fact, the human race would not be here if it weren&#8217;t for toddlers breastfeeding in our deep evolutionary past.  And then there have always been populations that wean their young earlier.  So when formula came along, many, many women thought this was a great liberating phenomenon and invention.  And, you know, they went for it with greater and lesser success, I would say.  You know, in the 19th century, women sometimes tried to raise their infants on oatmeal, basically, and cow&#8217;s milk.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> That was sort of the formula of its time.</p>
<p><b>Williams:</b> That was the formula of its time.  It was often a total disaster.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I would imagine oatmeal wouldn&#8217;t be exactly quite the same constituency.</p>
<p><b>Williams:</b> It&#8217;s not really everything you need.  And so infant mortality was really high among infants who were not breastfed.  Fortunately, now, formula is pretty good at approximating the nutritional needs of the infant.  But as we&#8217;re learning more and more all the time, breast milk isn&#8217;t just a food.  It&#8217;s a medicine.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> It&#8217;s a way of life. </p>
<p><b>Williams:</b> It&#8217;s a way of life. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Sorry.  But it is actually a way of life &#8212; in all seriousness.  As you point out in this book, there&#8217;s also a good deal of adulterated breast milk that is running around right now.  We&#8217;ll get into the whole phthalates and plastic chemicals in just a bit.  But I&#8217;m wondering. Why aren&#8217;t we considering this?  I mean, I guess your book is a starting point.  Or is this, in fact, one of the serious issues that scientists are presently looking into?  Or is it?</p>
<p><b>Williams:</b> Oh yes.  It is.  You know, breast milk now has been known to have contaminants in it from the industrial world.  I tested my breast milk while I was breastfeeding my second child and I found out that I had flame retardants and jet fuel ingredient.  Trace amounts of pesticide.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> That&#8217;s what you get for having a pilot career.</p>
<p><b>Williams:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh, you didn&#8217;t have a pilot career!  I see.</p>
<p><b>Williams:</b> Oops! I didn&#8217;t have a pilot career.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/timecover.jpg" alt="" title="timecover" width="350" align="right" /><b>Williams:</b> We all have these substances coursing through our bodies.  Unfortunately, some of them really collect in fatty tissue in the breast.  And then the breast is really masterful at converting these substances into food.  So it ends up in our breast milk.  But I would point out that I did continue breastfeeding.  I was convinced that the benefits still outweighed the risks. And, of course, formula is not a completely pure product either.  It&#8217;s also contaminated with heavy metals and pesticides and whatever else is in the water that you&#8217;re mixing it with.  And then, you know, of course there are sometimes these <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/world/asia/17milk.html">scares that come out of China</a> where you find melamine and other weird additives in the formula. So unfortunately, I feel that we&#8217;ve taken this miraculous evolutionary substance and we&#8217;ve degraded it to the point where you can really now almost compare to formula.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So we can, in fact, compare sullied breast milk of the present industrial age with the formula of yesteryear that infants relied upon.  Is it safe to say that we can determine which is the greater threat these days?  Or what?</p>
<p><b>Williams:</b> I still think the benefits of breast milk are incredibly profound and amazing.  You know, we&#8217;re just learning more and more all the time about how breast milk boosts the immune system.  And there&#8217;s some evidence that despite all the pollutants in breast milk, it still protects the infant possibly from the effects of other chemicals.  You know, it boosts the IQ and it helps teach the human immune system what&#8217;s a good pathogen, what&#8217;s a bad pathogen. So there are all kinds of great reasons to still use it.  Of course, unfortunately, in the United States anyway, we don&#8217;t really support breastfeeding.  As you can tell from the reaction to that <i>Time</i> cover, we&#8217;re still deeply uncomfortable with it.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> There are still public laws, however, that permit women to breastfeed their children that we&#8217;ve seen more and more of in the last decade or two.  I think there&#8217;s &#8212; well, we&#8217;re in New York City. So we can be a little hubristic about this.</p>
<p><b>Williams:</b> You can do anything.  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You&#8217;re coming from Colorado.  So I think it&#8217;s a little more challenging there.</p>
<p><b>Williams:</b> Well, there&#8217;s always these stories in the news of women who get kicked out of the shopping mall because they need to breastfeed their infant.  And sometimes that creates this big reaction.  And sometimes lactating moms will come and have protests.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Lactating moms with pitchforks.  I love it!  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Williams:</b> Stay away from them. They&#8217;re dangerous!</p>

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Wondering if he can start a Kickstarter campaign for someone to send him tequila money.</p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B></p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I wanted to ask you about the logistics of this <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mollycrabapple/molly-crabapples-week-in-hell">Week in Hell</a> experiment.  The first thing I have to say, in seeing the television covered up and in seeing the thermostat on the wall, what negotiations were there with the hotel management to actually allow this to happen?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> Oh, we didn&#8217;t ask the hotel.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) Oh, you didn&#8217;t?  They found out while it was happening?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> They didn&#8217;t find out at all.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> This was entirely surreptitiously.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Wow. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> I will probably send them a copy of the book.  The reason was that we initially wanted to do it at another hotel and we had all this money from the Kickstarter.  And we were like, &#8220;Golly, mister, here&#8217;s $4,500 to do our crazy art project.&#8221;  And they were like, &#8220;Oh no! You must speak with our creative directors to see if you&#8217;re in line with our creative vision.&#8221;  And I thought that was bullshit.  So I just dressed up like a fancy person and borrowed a Ralph Lauren suitcase to hide all those rolls of paper in.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Really?  (<i>laughs</i>) It&#8217;s like a bank heist.</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> We totally ran it like a bank heist.  Snuck everything in.  Told the maid not to come all week.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Was that the 57 minutes that you spent eluding the maid, which you refer to?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> Yes! Exactly!  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Wow. So you actually had to plan this like a bank heist.  I mean, I understand.  I&#8217;ve done some of these interviews in hotels and I&#8217;m told that I can&#8217;t actually sit down with these microphones with another person.  Just having a conversation.  So why did you have to go ahead and do this almost like you were shooting without a film permit?  What steps did you take to plan this bank heist?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> So me and Melissa, who&#8217;s my amazing assistant.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> Who is actually the brains behind all of my harebrained ideas.  We made a long list of everything that could possibly go wrong.  We did everything from testing the right type of tape to hold the paper off, that wouldn&#8217;t peel off the paint, to getting the right fancy people suitcases.  So we wouldn&#8217;t look all sketchy sneaking into the Gramercy Park Hotel with duffel bags.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Did you have any consultants say, &#8220;Hey, you actually look professional enough to pass muster with the scrupulous guards&#8221;?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) What was so funny was that I had this whole outfit, which can only be described as rich people&#8217;s whore.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> It was all Alexander McQueen and Louis Vuittons and shit.  And I went in and everybody is wearing sweatpants.  And I was so disappointed. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, these tests about not peeling the paint off the walls.  And the paper itself.  The specific markers you used.  I&#8217;m wondering.  What were the logistics here?  I&#8217;m really curious.</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> The paper and markers?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah. How many types of paper did you have to go through?  </p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> We didn&#8217;t go through types of paper. Because I got that sponsored.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> It was more &#8212; Melissa&#8217;s whole wall was covered with different strands of paper being held up with different types of tape.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Fantastic. What other logistics were needed aside from this?  Anything else that you&#8217;re missing?  </p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> We had tons and tons of friends sneaking in the entire week and we found a back staircase for them to sneak up. Because we didn&#8217;t &#8212; I mean, especially when we had the wild closing party.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> This is like Philippe Petit walking across the World Trade Center.  How he had friends gradually get all the supplies up over the course of several weeks in advance. Was it similar here?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> It was kind of like that.  I even had one of my friends go into the hotel, looking super-sketchy so that he could see how much scrutiny he would get.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) Oh really?  Did you have any input into his skeeziness?  </p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> No, we just went with his natural dress.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh, I see.  I got it.  Now for many of the visitors who came into this hotel room during this week, I&#8217;m wondering if you asked permission to draw them.  I mean, this raises an interesting question for me.  Because you have one particular drawing that&#8217;s part of this elaborate project where you have the photographers, who are drawn like lizards to your friend. Because they&#8217;re ogling her with their cameras.  And so I&#8217;m wondering.  This made me think.  How much is any artist, who illustrates or sketches or paints, different from, say, a photographer of any stripe? What are your thoughts on this?  And what are your thoughts in terms of drawing people at will who happen to come into the room?  Or was that the agreement for anyone who came through the room?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> Well, people usually want to be drawn by me.  But that&#8217;s actually an awesome question. I&#8217;ve always thought that the instinct of the photographer and the visual artist are very similar &#8212; in that we&#8217;re generally twitchy weirdos who want to hang out with the cool people and we use our camera or our sketchpad as a way to kind of bribe the cool people to hang out with us.  But the thing is that photography has become so ubiquitous that people don&#8217;t feel impressed anymore by having their picture taken.  And, in fact, it can become like really grabby and soul-stealing.  Like &#8212; I used to march a lot at the [Coney Island] Mermaid Day Parade and sometimes there would be such a crush of photographers &#8212; like yelling at you how to pose and demanding that you arch your back this way or demanding that you look at them &#8212; that it wasn&#8217;t a fun thing at all.  Whereas most people only get drawn a few times in their life. So it still has a novelty to it.  And I&#8217;ve always kind of used my sketchpad as this key to sneak into scenes where I really didn&#8217;t belong.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But stealing another person&#8217;s soul.  It seems to me that you&#8217;ve always been very conscious about this.  Even from the Dr. Sketchy stuff.  So my question is: how do we return the balance so that the person who is photographed or the person who is drawn actually feels comfortable and doesn&#8217;t feel as if she has her soul stolen through the process of art?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> Well, with me, what I always try to do is I always try and capture the person&#8217;s personality, as well as just how hot they look.  Like when I did the picture of Stoya on that door, I&#8217;m talking to her. And I do like her beautiful, beautiful, perfect, mathematically perfect face.  Then I also &#8212; since I&#8217;m friends with her, I draw her making her own costumes &#8212; she&#8217;s a brilliant costumer &#8212; and on her aerial hoop.  And then I talk with her. And she complains about obnoxious photographers.  And so I draw them swarming around her.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So much of the input came from what she was telling you.  As you were actually drawing her.</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> Exactly.  It was just as much a portrait of our conversation.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> In terms of the hoop, that was based off of memory.  Did you have any source material for that?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> That was based off of memory.  I&#8217;ve seen a lot of aerialists in my time.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You note that you were drawing the top of the wall at the very beginning of this. So that you would have some inspiration for your dreams.  And it seems to me that between that and the influx of stories that you had plenty of inspiration.  This leads me to ask, well, what do you do if you run out of ideas to sketch during this situation?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> I asked the Internet.  I had a livestream going along.  And my livestream audience would be saying, &#8220;Draw hippos on the moon! Draw undersea Algonquin round table!&#8221;  And I would put that in if I was running out of inspiration.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So did you feel that sometimes the list of suggestions was too intrusive a presence?  Or there were a lot of bad ideas sifting through this?  Were you playing Beat the Clock because you had only a week to cover this entire surface?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> There was a certain amount of Beat the Clock going on.  I drew pretty much every waking hour.  Like in the back of all my glamorous friends partying, there was usually me standing up on top of a shelf frantically sketching things.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Really?  Well, were there any trial runs of you sketching things?  Like say in your bathroom for half a day?  Or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> I was at Stumptown Comics Festival. They had me as a guest.  And I didn&#8217;t want to sit behind a table and sign things.  Because I don&#8217;t know.  I felt like I was at a craft fair or something.  So instead I was like, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just hang up a giant piece of paper where my table would be and I&#8217;ll just draw on it over the course of the convention&#8221;?  And I did a six foot by six foot drawing.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So that was the trial run.</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> That was where I got the idea.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Were there any other runs before that?  Maybe three by three?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) That&#8217;s just my career. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Exactly. So what do you need often to keep your routine changed up?  I mean, you suggested that this was the end of a particular period in your life.  It was sort of your renouncement of pen and ink.  How often do you need to change things up in order to stay fresh as an artist?  I&#8217;m curious.  Do you anticipate the next move?  Does it come organically?  Do you just do it and it becomes ambitious by default?</p>
<p><b>Crabapple:</b>  I&#8217;m not a very thoughtful person.  And I&#8217;m incapable of thinking in Five Year Plans.  And also I&#8217;m kind of young.  So I don&#8217;t really know &#8212; like I just don&#8217;t have that many periods in my work.  I don&#8217;t know.  I was in this deep fucked up almost clinical depression when I was 27.  And I don&#8217;t know why.  My brain was just wonky.  And I needed to do something to do violence to all of this stuff in my art that I was tired of.  And this was how I did it.  And I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll need to do it again.  But I don&#8217;t know when or how.  </p>

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Expressing his determination to keep the forward thrust of America began with notable historians.</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> <a href="http://www.robertcaro.com/">Robert A. Caro</a></p>
<p><b>Subjects Discussed:</b> Lyndon B. Johnson as a great reader of men, Horace Busby, Johnson talking with people until he got what he wanted, Johnson&#8217;s misread of John F. Kennedy, the 1960 Presidential Election and Johnson&#8217;s self-sabotage streak in seeking the nomination, Emmett Till and Autherine Lucy, passing the 1957 Civil Rights Act, Jack Kennedy&#8217;s use of television, Johnson having his staff calculate the odds of a U.S. President dying in office, &#8220;power is where power goes,&#8221; Sam Rayburn, Johnson&#8217;s mode of desperation vs. Steve Jobs&#8217;s &#8220;reality distortion field,&#8221; Southerners as Presidents, Johnson&#8217;s decisiveness in the Senate, John Connally, Johnson&#8217;s fear of failure, Sam Houston, Johnson not wanting to be like his father, Johnson&#8217;s inability to stare physical reality in the face, smoking and fluctuating weight, challenging Arthur Schlesinger, Johnson being shut out from many of the key Kennedy meetings as Vice President, Johnson&#8217;s humiliations, LBJ being reduced to a &#8220;salesman for the administration,&#8221; the spiteful rivalry between Robert Kennedy and LBJ, character being a defining quality of politics, the importance of vote counting in Washington, Johnson as Senate Majority Leader, Johnson&#8217;s preying upon the loneliness of old men, Richard Russell, the Armed Service Committee, Johnson&#8217;s manipulation of Russell on civil rights and the Warren Commission, how Southern Senators were duped into believing that Johnson was against civil rights, the phone call in which <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyEnaxEerR0">Johnson forced Russell into the Warren Commission</a>, how Johnson preyed on older men to get what he wanted, Kennedy&#8217;s tax bill, how Johnson worked on Harry Byrd, how Johnson dealt with human beings, the impact of personality on policy, Johnson&#8217;s terrible treatment of Pierre Salinger, Johnson bullying his subordinates, what Caro found the hardest to write about, triumphs of willpower, Johnson&#8217;s involvement with Bobby Baker, <a href="http://allthewaywithlbj.com/lbj-and-the-bobby-baker-scandal/">the Bobby Baker scandal</a>, the surprising sensitivity with which the media handled Johnson&#8217;s corruption after the Kennedy assassination, the <i>Life</i> investigative team on Johnson (as well as Senate investigation), the lowering of the Presidency because of Johnson, some hints about Volume V, and Johnson&#8217;s legacy.</p>
<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B></p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You challenge in this book Arthur Schlesigner&#8217;s long-standing notion about the relation between Kennedy and Johnson.  Now Johnson is in the vice presidential seat.  Schelsinger&#8217;s idea was that, well, Kennedy was absolutely fond, genial, and generous.  The vice president was included in most of the major meetings.  And then, of course, we read this chapter &#8220;Genuine Warmth&#8221; and we find out, well, wait a minute! That&#8217;s not always the case. According to Ted Sorenson, Johnson was shut out from a pivotal ExCom decision, a decision meeting relating to the Cuban Missile Crisis.  And that also is in large part because Johnson is a bit hawkish to say the least.  So my question is: why has the lens of history been so keen to favor the Schlesigner viewpoint?  And what was the first key fact that you uncovered that made you say to yourself, &#8220;Well, this isn&#8217;t exactly true&#8221;?  What caused you to start prying further and further?  That caused you to think, well, things are not all wine and roses.  </p>
<p><b>Caro:</b> Well, you know, part of it was that as soon as you start to look at Johnson and the Kennedys, you hear about the nickname that the Kennedy people called him.  &#8220;Rufus Cornpone.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p><b>Caro:</b> &#8220;Uncle Cornpone.&#8221; &#8220;Uncle Rufus.&#8221;  You know, they coined phrases for Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird. They used to call them &#8220;Uncle Cornpone and His Little Pork Chop.&#8221; Then you ask someone like Ted Sorensen, who helped me immensely.  He was the person probably closest to Kennedy in the administration.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You spent a lot of time with him.</p>
<p><b>Caro:</b> I spent a lot of time with Ted.  And he said, yes, as has previously been said, Johnson was included in all the big meetings, the Cabinet meetings, the National Security meetings.  But in the Kennedy government, those weren&#8217;t the meetings that mattered.  The meetings that mattered were the small little groups that Kennedy would convene.  And Johnson wasn&#8217;t invited to those.  You know, when the 1963 Civil Rights Act is introduced by the Kennedys and Johnson has to say to Ted Sorensen &#8212; we happen to have a recording &#8212; &#8220;You know, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s in this act.  I have to read about it in <i>The New York Times</i>.&#8221;  The greatest legislator possibly of the century, the greatest legislator of the 20th century is not consulted on Kennedy&#8217;s legislation.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Why then has the Schlesinger lens been allowed to proliferate for so long?  That&#8217;s the real question.</p>
<p><b>Caro:</b> Well, I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s just the Schlesinger lens.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Or this idea.</p>
<p><b>Caro:</b> I really can&#8217;t answer that question.  But when you talk to the surviving Kennedy people &#8212; like Sorensen &#8212; when you read their oral histories, you see it&#8217;s simply not true.  I mean, Horace Busby talks basically about going to see Sorensen one day and asking, &#8220;Well, what role do you want Lyndon Johnson to play in this administration?&#8221; And Sorensen says, &#8220;Salesman for the administration.&#8221;  I mean, this is Lyndon Johnson, who is to be the salesman for the administration.  Johnson says to an aide, Harry McPherson &#8212; you know, they&#8217;ve turned the legislative duties over to Larry O&#8217;Brien. Johnson says, &#8220;You know, O&#8217;Brien hasn&#8217;t been to see me to ask advice once in two years.&#8221;  So it&#8217;s undeniable that Johnson was shut out from Kennedy&#8217;s legislative processes and from the Cuban Missile Crisis &#8212; the key meeting of the Cuban Missile Crisis.  He&#8217;s not invited to it.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I know.  It&#8217;s really amazing.  One of the other great showdowns in this book &#8212; the great clash is between Bobby Kennedy and Johnson.  I mean, you want to talk about cats and dogs, these two guys were it.  You have their first meeting in the Senate cafeteria in 1953 where Kennedy was glowering at Johnson and forced to shake his hand.  Then years later, Johnson is Vice President.  And he&#8217;s largely powerless as we&#8217;ve been establishing here.  He serves on the Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity.  And Bobby Kennedy shows up late, humiliates him over two meetings.</p>
<p><b>Caro:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And then on the Saturday after the Kennedy assassination, there&#8217;s this misunderstanding over how the West Wing is going to be cleared out and ready for Johnson.  There&#8217;s this very tense meeting not long after.  But Johnson is in this interesting predicament of having to maintain the Kennedy faction all through Election Day in 1964.  Yet he also tests the waters a bit with the Thomas Mann nomination.  So my question is: was there any hope of Bobby Kennedy and Johnson putting aside their differences?  What factors do you think caused Bobby to acquiesce to Johnson for the good of the nation while Johnson was President?</p>
<p><b>Caro:</b> Well, he doesn&#8217;t always acquiesce.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Caro:</b> We see him breaking with him strongly over Vietnam in 1967 and 1968 and running for the nomination.  I mean, when Bobby Kennedy enters the race, Lyndon Johnson bows out basically.  You know, people don&#8217;t understand, in my opinion, enough.  And I try to explain in my books how personality, how character, has so much to do with politics and government.  And with Robert Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, whatever the reasons are, at bottom you have this personal hostility.  You talked about the first meeting.  You know, this first meeting is when Lyndon Johnson is the Leader.  He is the mighty Leader.  Bobby Kennedy &#8212; I think he&#8217;s 27.  And he&#8217;s just gone to work for Senator Joe McCarthy as a staffer.  So Joe McCarthy &#8212; the Senate cafeteria is on the second floor of the Senate Office Building.  And every morning, Johnson goes in there to have breakfast with his aides.  And Joe McCarthy is sitting every morning at this big round table near the cashier with four or five or six of his aides, you know.  And every time Johnson comes in, McCarthy jumps up as everyone does to Johnson and says, &#8220;Hello, Mister Leader.  Can I have a few moments of your time, Mr. Leader?  Good work yesterday, Mr. Leader.&#8221;  One morning, there&#8217;s a new staffer there.  It&#8217;s Robert Kennedy.  Johnson walked over.  Senator McCarthy jumps up.  And so, as always, do all his staffers.  Except one.  Robert Kennedy, his 27-year-old staffer, sits there glaring at Johnson.  Johnson knows how to handle situations like this.  He holds out his hand to everybody sort of halfway out and forces Bobby Kennedy to stand up and take his hand.  And George Reedy said to me &#8212; I said, &#8220;What was behind that?&#8221; George Reedy said, &#8220;You know, you ever see two dogs come into a room that never met each other and the hair rises on the back of their neck immediately and there&#8217;s a low growl?&#8221;  That was the relationship between Bobby Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.  Of course, there were other reasons.  Robert Kennedy was very attached and devoted to his father, Joseph Kennedy.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Caro:</b> And Johnson, who was close to Roosevelt, was always repeating these stories about Roosevelt firing Joe Kennedy, tricking him into coming back to Washington from England, and then firing him.  Making him look bad.  So I think that Robert Kennedy hated him for that.  But it&#8217;s not too strong a word to use hatred for what was going on between Bobby Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.  And, you know, at the convention, one of Johnson&#8217;s assistants, Bobby Baker, he thinks everything&#8217;s just politics.  So he&#8217;s having breakfast in a coffee shop in Los Angeles at the convention.  He sees Bobby Kennedy come in and says, &#8220;How about sitting down?&#8221;  He&#8217;s Bobby Baker, sitting with his wife, having breakfast.  Bobby Kennedy sits down. But within two minutes, he&#8217;s up.  And he throws money on the table.  And he says to Baker, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry.  You&#8217;ll get yours when the time comes.&#8221;  Well, the time came.  Johnson was Jack Kennedy&#8217;s Vice President.  Bobby Kennedy has, in effect, power over him.  And he makes life miserable for Lyndon Johnson.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> What you said at the beginning of this, about character being a defining quality of politics.  I mean, Johnson, as you establish in this book and in <i>Master of the Senate</i>, is a master vote counter.  He has his tally sheets when he&#8217;s in the Senate.  He&#8217;s going ahead and making sure he knows exactly how things line up.  In this book, you point out during the wheat bill that not only does he want enough votes to make the wheat bill [an amendment from Sen. Karl Mundt banning sale of surplus wheat from Russia] die.  He wants it murdered, as he says.  So the question I have.  He may have been a master vote counter.  But how much character did he need to go along with that?  Was vote counting enough for him?  Was that relentless drive just as much of a quality as the sheer statistician approach that he had?</p>
<p><b>Caro:</b> It was never a sheer statistician, of course.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Of course.</p>
<p><b>Caro:</b> He was a great legislator.  Listen.  A key thing in politics is the ability to count.  And Johnson was the great counter.  He&#8217;d send aides to find out how senators were going to vote.  So sometimes someone would come back.  Usually they didn&#8217;t do this more.  They said, &#8220;I think Senator X is going to vote this way.&#8221;  Johnson would say, &#8220;What good is thinking to me?  I need to know.&#8221; He never wanted to lose a vote.  So vote counting.  He was the great vote counter.  He&#8217;s a young Congressman.  He comes to Washington.  He&#8217;s 29 years old.  He falls in with this group of New Dealers, who later become famous.  Abe Fortas.  Jim Rowe.  &#8220;Tommy the Cork&#8221; Corcoran.  These are guys who live and breathe politics.  And do you know what they do when they have a dinner party on Saturday night?  They get together for dinner.  They count votes.  They say, &#8220;How is Roosevelt&#8217;s bill on this going to be?&#8221;  And Johnson, they said, was always right.  We might think this Senator was going to vote this way.  Johnson always knew.  He was the greatest vote counter.  And when he was in the Senate, he was the greatest vote counter of them all.  But that&#8217;s not all of why Johnson was great.  Johnson was this master on the Senate floor.  He got through amendments.  And there&#8217;s the base.  And there&#8217;s shouting back and forth.  He can seize the moment.  He sees the moment where he can win.  And he acts decisively.  He says, &#8220;Call the vote.&#8221;  And he&#8217;s Majority Leader.  And he would stand there at the Majority Leader&#8217;s desk.  So he&#8217;s towering over everybody else&#8217;s front row center desk.  He&#8217;s got this big arm in the air.  And if he&#8217;s got the votes, he wants the vote fast before anyone can change.  Or maybe some other people on the other side are absent and not there.  He makes little circles on his hands, like someone revving up an airplane, to get the clerk to call the rolls faster.  And if one of his votes wasn&#8217;t there, and he was being rushed from somewhere in a car across Washington, he would make a stretching motion with his hands.  He ran this.  There were a lot of things that went into Johnson&#8217;s dominance of the Senate. </p>

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Inexplicably hungering for Wendy&#8217;s hamburgers.</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> <a href="http://stewart-onan.com/">Stewart O&#8217;Nan</a></p>
<p><b>Subjects Discussed:</b> [forthcoming later this afternoon]</p>
<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B></p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Niagara Falls. Here is a location that&#8217;s loaded with all sorts of associations. Joyce Carol Oates wrote a book there.</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> <i>The Falls</i>.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes, exactly.</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> Yes, I was introduced the other night as &#8220;the author of <i>The Falls</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> And I was like, &#8220;Not that prolific.&#8221;  Not nearly.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) Well, you are churning them out one a year.</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> Oh thank you. Churning them out. You said cranking before.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Crafting!  Cranking, churning. All right.  But they&#8217;re short! They&#8217;re short.</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> They&#8217;re tiny.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> There&#8217;s craftsmanship in there. Don&#8217;t worry.  </p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> I understand.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But I&#8217;m wondering.  You&#8217;re taking a location that&#8217;s loaded with all sorts of cultural baggage.  There&#8217;s that Marilyn Monroe/Joseph Cotten film. </p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> Gotta love it. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But I&#8217;m wondering.  Here you are taking two characters and putting them in a touristy location.  I&#8217;m wondering if you did that to work up against limitations and see what kind of behavior you could mine based off of that.  I&#8217;m wondering why you chose this.  What was the process of selecting the Ice Bridge or the details of the customs location?  What went into nailing Niagara?</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> Well, it&#8217;s a ready made stage.  Usually when I take on an area or a setting, it&#8217;s virgin territory in a way. Conneaut, Ohio. Kingsville in <i>Songs for the Missing</i>. No one&#8217;s ever written about that in any kind of novel.  Western Pennsylvania.  Butler, PA in 1974.  So I always say I&#8217;ve written the best Butler, Pennsylvania novel ever written. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> Or Avon, Connecticut.  Usually these are overlooked places.  Like New Britain, Connecticut, that <i>Last Night at the Lobster</i> takes place in.  I write in that interzone, that nowhere America of strip malls.  It has been kicked around forever.  But in the new book, I thought, let&#8217;s focus solely on the characters and put them on a stage that everybody knows.  So I don&#8217;t have to do that disorienting, here is the place that you don&#8217;t know and now I&#8217;m going to tell you about it.  So I had a little less responsibility to the setting and I could spend a little bit more time on the characters.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I have to ask you about the odds as chapter headers for all of these.  Some are, in fact, true.  &#8220;Odds of a black number coming up in roulette: 1 in 2.06.&#8221; I Wikipediaed that. Some are unscientifically true.  &#8220;Odds of a marriage proposal being accepted: 1 in 1.001.&#8221;  So I&#8217;m wondering. How many odds did you collect?  I mean, I&#8217;m wondering if you were sitting on a bunch of odds sets.</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You were?</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> Yes, I was. And I was trying to figure out: How do I weave these into the book and what effect are they going to have when I get them in there?  And they seemed to me to work.  When I thought of using them rather than chapter headings, in the way I did with, say, <i>Emily</i> or in <i>Songs of the Missing</i>, I saw them as how the chapter headings are in something like <i>Blood Meridian</i> or in, say, 19th century fiction work, which is &#8220;In this chapter I am eaten by sharks.&#8221;  And before you even get into the chapter, you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh sharks!  This could be cool!&#8221;  So it kind of brings the reader and it gives them an expectation of what may happen in this chapter.  Not necessarily has to happen.  But it may happen.  The odds of dying in a bus crash.  Whoa! There might be a bus crash.  I&#8217;ll stick around and find out.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> It&#8217;s interesting. Because here you are in one sense messing with the reader for the first ten pages, repelling them, and then on this, you&#8217;re subverting their expectations.  It&#8217;s actually, &#8220;Ooh! I want to continue to read this chapter.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> Well, you hope.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> What of this bipolar approach to fiction writing?</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> Flannery O&#8217;Cononr.  Flannery O&#8217;Connor said, &#8220;Distract them and hit them over the head.&#8221;  Absolutely right. Absolutely right.  Give them a reason to come into the place.  <i>A Prayer for the Dying</i>.  The opening sections are very &#8212; it&#8217;s a terrible thing to say, very beautifully written. I use the language.  I make the beauty of the language a key thing to hang into.  And so the reader gets rewarded somehow.  And by the time they have to go through the book, they&#8217;re kind of stuck.  They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t really want to hang around and watch this guy go crazy while I&#8217;m inside of his mind.&#8221;  Well, it&#8217;s too late.  So like Poe, say, in &#8220;The Black Cat.&#8221;  Once you get them in the door, then after a certain point, they&#8217;re kind of yours. They have to follow along.  Or you hope so.  You always hope so.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;m curious if the odds sets actually were methods for you to riff off of Art and Marion.  If you were stuck at a certain place.  Is this a point?  I mean, you&#8217;re a former engineer.  I presume that this was either heavily designed.  Or were there false starts?  And did the odds help you in anything?</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> No. There weren&#8217;t a whole lot of false starts. I knew the characters very well before I opened up.  It&#8217;s also a small novel.  It&#8217;s very much sort of a drawing room novel in a way.  It&#8217;s the one weekend.  You&#8217;ve got the unity of place.  The unity of time.  You&#8217;ve got a lot of pressure on them from the memories.  This is their second honeymoon.  They&#8217;re in Niagara Falls.  And you have the time pressure of, well, at some point, they&#8217;re going to have to put their money down on the wheel.  And they&#8217;re always kind of at odds with one another. They&#8217;re always picking at one another.  So I had a lot to work with.  The plates were already spinning when I started getting into it. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I wanted to also ask you.  One interesting thing that you also do with Marion is body image.  She doesn&#8217;t like Art to see her undress.  And in one of the passages you&#8217;re going to read tonight, the only thing you mention is her stomach.  We actually don&#8217;t really know what she looks like physically.  So I&#8217;m wondering if this is a method for you to not reveal certain details to the reader or this reflects your relationship to the reader.  Is this your way to protect your own characters?  To not divulge all?  Or is this your way to encourage judgment?  Perception on the reader&#8217;s behalf?  </p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> This is more to encourage the reader to join in the process of creating the work.  And I don&#8217;t say what the character looks like unless it&#8217;s really necessary to the arc of the story there.  So what the characters look like is completely up to the reader there.  And I leave judgment to the reader.  I don&#8217;t try to steer the reader too much in terms of who&#8217;s good, who&#8217;s bad, who&#8217;s right, who&#8217;s wrong.  And it&#8217;s always sort of that inkblot that shows how generous the reader can be or how, on the flip side, how stingy they can be.  &#8220;I hate Marion.  I hate her so much.&#8221; It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Easy there, lady.  Easy there.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Have you had this happen before?</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> Oh yeah.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Wow. Really?</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> In Wichita of all places. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Wichita!</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> &#8220;I didn&#8217;t like her.&#8221;  Well, that&#8217;s good.  That&#8217;s your prerogative.  That&#8217;s fine.  That&#8217;s you. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You know, one of the interesting things &#8212; I&#8217;ve read a number of reviews of this book.  And they actually don&#8217;t mention, for example, Karen or these two characters who are having affairs with the couple.  And I&#8217;m curious about this.  Maybe this relates to this issue of giving the reader something.  Maybe they don&#8217;t want to talk about this aspect of Art and Marion. What do you think of this?</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> Yeah. I think they want to key more on Art and Marion and just say, &#8220;Look, there are problems in the marriage.&#8221;  And this is how they work them out over this weekend.  Or don&#8217;t work them out.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Inevitably, because you do deal with Heart, I have to bring up celebrity gossip.</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> Heart.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So in late 2010, Nancy Wilson and Cameron Crowe initiated divorce proceedings.  It was a great shocker to certain waves.</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> So sad.  They had everything going for them, didn&#8217;t they?  They did.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah. I&#8217;m wondering if you including the Heart concert before or after you heard this news.  Or if you possibly predicted this dissolution in anyway.  I mean, what of this?</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Some sort of angle here.  </p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> No. I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s accidental subtext, I guess. I guess it happens from time to time.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Another silly question. Wendy is a character. And I have to ask you, and I know this is really pedantic, but I have noticed in all of your books &#8212; nearly all of your books &#8212; there&#8217;s a moment where someone eats Wendy&#8217;s.  A Wendy&#8217;s hamburger.</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But not, not  in <i>The Odds</i>. The last time I saw this was <i>Last Night at the Lobster</i>. There was a Wendy&#8217;s moment.  It was the Stewart O&#8217;Nan Wendy&#8217;s moment!</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> He doesn&#8217;t go to Wendy&#8217;s. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh, he doesn&#8217;t go to Wendy&#8217;s?</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> He decides not to go to Wendy&#8217;s. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But he does actually consider it!</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> This is a climax.  This is a climax in an actual work of fiction. &#8220;Want to go to Wendy&#8217;s?  Nah.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Do you eat at Wendy&#8217;s quite a bit?</p>
<p><b>O&#8217;Nan:</b> No. Maybe that&#8217;s it. Maybe I want to eat at Wendy&#8217;s more.  I can see my biographer doing a lot on Wendy&#8217;s now. A map of all the Wendy&#8217;s around my house.  </p>

<p>[<b>PROGRAM NOTE:</B> In the first few minutes of the conversation, one of the microphones decided to blow out.  And while Our Correspondent was equipped with two microphones, the microphone that blew out wasn't the one on Our Correspondent's voice, but the one that was on the author's voice.  Ms. McAffee's words can be detected during this program, but if her voice sounds like it's coming out of a small radiator, well, you now know why.

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Selling his scandalous tales to the highest bidder.</p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</b></p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> In terms of tearing people down, I did not work in that world really.  I worked on <i>The Financial Times</i>.  It&#8217;s a fantastic paper and the probity is unimpeachable.  I worked on <i>The Guardian</i> on the culture. I founded and edited <i>The Guardian Review</i>.  Again, that&#8217;s a paper that&#8217;s on the side of angels.  I was very, very lucky.  I had a spell on the <i>Evening Standard</i>.  But I was arts editor and theater critic. And I suppose in my capacity as theater critic, sometimes I might have been less than kind.  But it certainly wasn&#8217;t the kind of sustained bullying.  Or I didn&#8217;t have that opportunity. And I hope that if I did, I would be able to resist it.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So you were really perhaps comparable to the <i>Monitor</i>&#8216;s books editor the morning after the party.</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Yes. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Where everybody else was completely trashed and their heads were throbbing and they were incapable of any conversation.  And meanwhile, those who chose not to imbibe in this debauchery, they were able to seize the reins here, so to speak.  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Well, books editor do debauchery too.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Of course. Most people do.  We all know this.</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> There&#8217;s no character assassinations or kiss-and-tells on my particular beat, thankfully.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Sure. I wanted to go back to the question of character balance. Because you have this confident young woman named Tania.  She&#8217;s dutifully reading books.  She&#8217;s researching her subjects.  </p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> She&#8217;s called Tamara. But the old woman gets her name wrong and calls her Tania sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m talking about &#8212; anyway, she even is very nice to respond to the quip.</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Oh, Tania.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Tania. That&#8217;s who I&#8217;m saying. Tania.  </p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> You know my book better than I do.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I know that Honor, in a joke, actually calls her Tania. And that&#8217;s the clue that there is actually something askew because she completely insists on Tania.  You have that email joke.  Okay. Now that we&#8217;re on the same page, so you&#8217;ve got Tania.</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> She&#8217;s this erudite person who&#8217;s incredibly capable and she&#8217;s even kind enough to offer this tinselly chime that you describe when Tamara says, &#8220;Oh, well, the future is unisex jumpsuits and time travel.&#8221; But this does not exactly help us in warming to Tamara.  I was reading this book and I&#8217;m saying to myself, &#8220;You know, Tania, this woman&#8217;s got her stuff together.&#8221;  But I&#8217;m wondering how you worked out your method of parceling out Tania&#8217;s appearances throughout the book.  Because they tend to be somewhat sparse near the beginning.  And I almost got the sense that, as you were working on this, you wanted to have not so much of Tania.  Because then all of a sudden, we&#8217;ll really not like Tamara.  I&#8217;m wondering how you balanced the Ts here.</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Well, I did kind of concede Tania as the future. The only capable young woman journalist.  Brilliant and completely ahead of the game as far as technology.  And, of course, as I say, that was a time &#8212; 1997 &#8212; it was still possible to believe that the Internet was a passing fad.  And indeed some of our great commentators said so.  &#8220;It will be over soon.  It&#8217;s like Citizens Band radio.  It&#8217;s like Esperanto.  It&#8217;s a craze.  It will pass.&#8221;  I use a quote from one of our great commentators saying exactly that in January 1997.  So that&#8217;s what Tamara and all her colleagues are thinking. But gradually I hope that as a young woman who runs a website, as the future makes itself plain, as we see what direction it&#8217;s going in, that was the aim.  That ultimately the future belongs to Tania and she claims it.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But did you worry that she might, in fact, be too virtuous?  I mean, you&#8217;ve got two characters who have issues with Tamara and Honor.  You&#8217;ve got Tania, who has not a single bad bone as far as I know.  So how do you deal with this balance?  Because if you have too much of Tania, then it gets away from the two central characters here.  And so I&#8217;m wondering if there was more of Tania in an earlier draft perhaps or you had to say to yourself, &#8220;Well, I have to wait twenty or thirty pages before she appears again.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Well, no, there wasn&#8217;t more of Tania.  And actually, again, I&#8217;m trying for complexity.  And to be perfectly honest, I find Tania&#8217;s virtuousness and her capabilities slightly irritating.  She&#8217;s the person who does one&#8217;s own job better than one can ever do and is always the last to leave the office.  And she doesn&#8217;t laugh much.  Her tinselly chimes are part of a game rather than a sense of humor.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> No, it&#8217;s more of a polite gesture, I thought.  I mean, here, she has been just totally insulted and instead of actually allowing herself to be steamrolled, she decides to respond with some grace.  The tinselly chimes.</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Grace? Well, the tear of the victor. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Here&#8217;s the other thing about Tania. I mean, I know people like this. They go ahead and they work very hard, but they have a dark side.  So I was reading this book thinking, &#8220;You know, Tania&#8217;s probably doing something we don&#8217;t know.&#8221; But we never actually get there.  So I&#8217;m wondering: why? (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Well, that&#8217;s true. That is probably true.  And, in fact, she does move in on people.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> She&#8217;s incredibly attractive.  That&#8217;s another of her irritating virtues.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> But she uses it and is jockeying for position and is not afraid to use her sexuality.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Nevertheless, you find her irritating.</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Well&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> The successful woman is irritating.  Wait a minute here. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> She doesn&#8217;t have warmth, I suppose.  And that&#8217;s really it.  She&#8217;s hard to read and she doesn&#8217;t seem generous to her colleagues.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I see.</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> She lacks generosity.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> She moves in on the territory and she does so without really seeing what the pecking order is.</p>
<p><b>McAFee:</b> As I say, she&#8217;s got the ambition of a young person.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> That&#8217;s an annoying quality. I&#8217;ll give you that.  So it&#8217;s interesting that you have the Monday Club in this book.  Because it&#8217;s far more liberal than the conservative Monday Club.  Because you have the Twisk Foundation fighting child exploitation wherever it is to be found.  You have the war correspondent.  And I&#8217;m saying to myself, &#8220;You know, this is almost a Bizarro World Monday Club.&#8221;  And so I&#8217;m wondering why you decided to go for a more progressive form of something that is a conservative institution in the UK.</p>
<p><b>McAFee:</b> Well, they meet on a Monday. But I chose&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> It could have been the Tuesday Club. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> But I quite liked it.  And I think I do say an ironic reference to the conservative, right-wing thinktank of the same name.  Or whatever.  So I quite liked playing with that.  I mean, these are <i>bien-pensant</i> liberals and they&#8217;ve taken the name of the arch factory of Thatcherism.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Do you have any personal experience with the real Monday Club at all?  </p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Any efforts to peek in there?</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> No. Not at all.  I can&#8217;t think of any.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So Sherman Duffy &#8212; he was a reporter friend of Ben Hecht&#8217;s &#8212; and he has this very famous maxim.  He said, &#8220;Socially a journalist fits somewhere between a whore and a bartender.&#8221;  Wonderful, wonderful line.  Now in the Monday Club chapter, you not only have Tamara serving canapes to these affluent types.  But you also have Ruth, Honor&#8217;s publisher &#8212; she&#8217;s actually engaged in this service sector activity as well. She&#8217;s unpacking the pastries on the plate and so forth.  So I&#8217;m wondering if you were thinking of the Duffy maxim when you were considering this.  This is a natural extension.  Is there any way that fiction can help us and assist us in rehabilitating a journalist&#8217;s social status from somewhere between the whore and the bartender?</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Well, I mean, journalists are happy to see themselves as mavericks. Aren&#8217;t they? Certainly British journalists.  I know that American journalism is a more honorable tradition.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Really?  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> I was talking to a friend about this the other night. And she said that there&#8217;s more of a public service attitude.  And it can make for more solemn journalism.  But in the UK, it&#8217;s well, you know, anything can go.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So you would say that journalism in the UK has declined considerably in the last ten years.</p>
<p><b>McAFee:</b> Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Or twenty years.</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> I wouldn&#8217;t. I wouldn&#8217;t.  I mean, I think there&#8217;s marvelous stuff going on.  Absolutely marvelous.  In fact, all that&#8217;s changed is the medium really.  My war correspondent is not &#8212; she&#8217;s a bit of a dragon.  And she resents the fact that the world has turned and she is not the top of the pile anymore.  In fact, if she&#8217;d looked around, she would have much to celebrate.  Particularly women in journalism.  Women like Marie Colvin, the late Marie Colvin.  In Russia, Anna Politkovskaya, as she died in the cause of her work.  There&#8217;s marvelous reporting going on.  But there&#8217;s also a lot of dross. That&#8217;s all mainstream. I don&#8217;t get celebrity journalism.  I just can&#8217;t understand the appeal.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But some would argue that cultural journalism is, I suppose, a classier version of celebrity journalism.  What do you think?</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I ask myself this question too. I mean, look, I&#8217;ve read the book and I&#8217;m trying to tie it into a culture here. And I don&#8217;t want it to be about gossip.  But at the same time, is this conversation also part of the problem?  Even though it&#8217;s slightly higher on the brow?  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Somebody said that novels were higher gossip.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) Yes.</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> That&#8217;s the level of celebrity journalism that appeals to me.  But yeah, TV stars.  Reality TV shows. I mean, I don&#8217;t want to go on to that.  But that seems to be cheap television and cheap journalism.  And I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything edifying that one gets from it.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/nussbaumtweets.jpg" alt="" title="nussbaumtweets" align="right" /><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, the problem we have here too &#8212; and this is really frustrating.  David Simon, for example, recently <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/05/the-game-never-ends-david-simon-on-wearying-wire-love-and-the-surprising-usefulness-of-twitter/?src=tp">said some things in an interview</a>.  He didn&#8217;t quite express himself very well.  But he basically implied that people who didn&#8217;t watch <i>The Wire</i> from beginning to middle to end were not watching it according to his vision.  And I can totally understand his sentiment.  But from my standpoint, I was saying, &#8220;Well, this is really nothing to get all that worked up about.&#8221;  But, of course, television journalists completely flipped out over this and said, &#8220;David Simon is being an ass.&#8221;  And Simon then has to spend <a href="http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/whats-alan-watching/posts/interview-david-simon-doesnt-want-to-tell-you-how-to-watch-the-wire">an hour of his life</a> talking to this TV critic named Sepinwall, basically clarifying what he was saying, where he was coming from.  And this, to my mind, is the epitome.  This says nothing about <i>The Wire</i>. It says absolutely nothing about the actual relationship to art.  And there were several people &#8212; including a <i>New Yorker</i> TV critic on Twitter &#8212; who were going off about this.  And I was saying to myself, &#8220;You know, why are you devoting so much of your energy to try and systematically dismantle and deconstruct a quote that really has no bearing on what David Simon is doing as an artist?&#8221;  The suggestion I&#8217;m making here &#8212; and I&#8217;m going off on a total tangent and we will get back to your book &#8212; is that, well, do you think that cultural journalism might be suffering from the same problems that reality TV, this sensationalistic journalism, is?</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Oh yes. I do.  I find that a lot of interviews &#8212; and I know we&#8217;re having an interview.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah, I know. It&#8217;s very meta here. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> They concentrate on rehashing old stuff.  Rehashing cuttings basically. Inquiring, as Tamara does, about affairs, about the personal life and not about the work.  And when I was on the <i>Guardian</i>, we started a profile which was an essential interview about a writer or an artist.  And the one rule was it was about the work.  We don&#8217;t care about the personal life.  If anyone cares about the personal life, they can read it. They can look it up.  They can read it elsewhere.  But what&#8217;s really interesting is the work.  And I find that so much more enriching.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> There is one question I have about your husband [Ian McEwan] and you, and it has nothing to do really with the personal. Although it may have something to do with the personal.  But we&#8217;re talking about purely artistic terms.  Okay.  One, you&#8217;ve got an in-house editor.  I&#8217;m really curious about how you two work as in-house editors. And, two, I noticed that this book had quite a bit in common with <i>Amsterdam</i>.  You have a photo that is released.  You have editors who are sacked.  And so I wondered first of all if <i>Amsterdam</i> was hovering over you as you were writing this and, second, how do you guys edit each other&#8217;s work?  That&#8217;s all I care about. </p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Well&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Or do you?  Or do you leave each other alone?</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Yes. We do read. I read his work.  I&#8217;m his first reader with a pencil.  And he returned the compliment.  In terms of <i>Amsterdam</i>, which I love &#8212; it&#8217;s a great newspaper novel actually, though it&#8217;s guys again.  I hadn&#8217;t reread it for a while.  But I guess any newspaper novel about modern journalism is going to have this scandal element to it.  And, in fact, what you ask me is a fairer question, less compromising.  When I was on the <i>FT</i>, I was editing the arts and books page.  I was invited to the BBC. And it was around the time of the Booker Prize, when the Booker Prize was just going to be announced. The shortlist was going to be announced.  And I was asked to come on as a literary editor of the <i>Financial Times</i>. So I turned up. And I&#8217;m very nervous on television.  And I&#8217;m in absolute agony.  And I turn up in this bright lit studio.  And the guy turns to me and says, &#8220;So did you help hubby write the book?&#8221;  Oh, what do you say?  I said, &#8220;He&#8217;s perfectly capable of writing it himself.  Thanks very much.  But, nope, he wrote <i>Amsterdam</i> by himself.  Unassisted.&#8221;  As I wrote <i>The Spoiler</i>.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I would have said, &#8220;Did your wife help you with that question?&#8221;</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> You know, that&#8217;s good.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So you guys edit each other&#8217;s work.  Is there a point where you say, &#8220;Hey, hands off, Ian, I&#8217;ve got this&#8221;? I mean, does he become too vigorous with the pen?  Or do you become in turn too vigorous with the pen?  How do you keep each other&#8217;s hands off?  What&#8217;s the deal with you guys?</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> Well, it&#8217;s very companionable and decent.  We both make suggestions and we both know that we&#8217;re at liberty to ignore them.  Which is what happens.  But when I read his first &#8212; the first book when we were together was <i>Enduring Love</i>.  And I read that.  And he asked me.  &#8220;Be as free as you like and put pencil marks wherever there&#8217;s any kind of doubt.&#8221;  And I was very tentative about it.  I mean, I was used to editing for a living.  But I was very tentative about hurting things.  And I&#8217;ve written children&#8217;s books.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes, I know.</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> I had a children&#8217;s book that was just coming out.  And so he said, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d like to see that.&#8221;  And he went through it.  And there were pencil marks and suggestions.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> I thought, &#8220;Right.  That&#8217;s how it&#8217;s done. No holds barred.&#8221;  I went back to <i>Enduring Love</i> and pulled no punches. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) Wow. Did you pull no punches on the opening scene?  I&#8217;m curious.  No one can&#8230;</p>
<p><b>McAfee:</b> There was no work required.  Absolutely. It&#8217;s superb. </p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B></p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You point out quite early on in this book that there was something about the liberal intellectual spirit in Vienna 1900 that permitted all these fascinating interdisciplinary possibilities.  You have the Vienna School of Medicine, which becomes this vital part of culture for Viennese artists and intellectuals. You have Klimt, who&#8217;s studying biology informally with Berta Zuckerkandl and he also has these amazing three panels that he does for the University of Vienna.  As you point, they are rejected for being too radical, too pornographic, and too ugly.  So just to start things off here, and we&#8217;ll get into the science in a bit, what specific factors do you feel allowed this golden age of collisional ideas to happen?  I mean, from the vantage point of the 21st century, what lessons can neuroscience and biology take away from this really flourishing period?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/erickandel.jpg" alt="" title="erickandel" width="209" height="309" align="right" /><b>Kandel:</b> I think what is really so important is, as you pointed out, that there was an interaction between science, literature, and arts that was really unusual.  And this began with the School of Medicine, which had great leadership at that time.  Under the leadership of a guy called Rokitansky who introduced modern scientific medical practice by developing clinical/pathological correlations to a more systematic way than it had ever been.  He felt that when you listened to a patient&#8217;s heart and you hear an abnormal sound, you don&#8217;t know which valve it&#8217;s coming from or exactly what is the disorder of the valve.  And so he collaborated with a clinician.  And the clinician described the patient&#8217;s sounds from the heart and the lungs in great detail.  But if the patient died, they collaborated together to do an autopsy on him to figure out exactly what valve was involved and how.  And that gave rise to the scientific medicine we now practice.  And Rokitansky realized that the truth is often hidden from the surface.  And you have to go deep below the surface to get there.  </p>
<p>And that is a metaphor that influenced Freud, that influenced Klimt, that influenced all of these people.  That surface appearances are misleading.  They were also influenced by Darwin and they realized that humans are wonderful creatures, but they involved from simple animal ancestors and we have instinctual drives that we share with other animals.  And Freud picked this up &#8212; he was sort of the Darwin of the mind &#8212; and realized that when human beings interact, they interact through surface appearances.  There are a lot of processes that are hidden from them.  The unconscious mind, which he really developed in great detail.  And these ideas were also picked up by the artists.  They were in part influenced by Freud, but in part on their own.  So Freud had a very good understanding of many aspects of the human mind, but didn&#8217;t understand female sexuality at all.  Klimt had a very profound understanding of female sexuality and in his drawings of women, which are absolutely just marvelous, he depicts women having their own independent sexual life, masturbating, pleasuring themselves without the presence of a man, without feeling obligated to look out at the viewer, as if that was the necessary thing for satisfying them.  They could have their own fantasy life.  And also that eroticism could be fused with aggression, as in a very famous painting of Judith and Holofernes.  So he had tremendous insight into the human psychology.  This was carried further by Kokoschka and Schiele, two of his disciples if you will.  Kokoschka focused this self-analysis on himself.  This analysis on himself showed how his own unconscious processes were recruited, realized that he could depict adolescent sexuality.  He was the first artist to depict adolescent female nudes, pointed out sexual struggles between really young children.  He has a very famous painting of the Stein children.  A brother and sister.  Both aggressive and erotic components involved in their interaction.  And then finally Schiele, who studied himself almost exclusively, using himself as an object for exploring unconscious mental processes.  Just an extraordinary period.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/schieleselfportrait.jpg" alt="" title="schieleselfportrait" width="206" height="300" align="left" /><b>Correspondent:</b> Sure. Well, let&#8217;s talk about Egon Schiele. His self-portraits in the book, many of which expressed, as you were saying here, this eroticism, this anxiety.  In the case of <i>Self-Portrait with Striped Armlets</i>, it depicts him as a fool.  He depicts himself as a fool.  So his anxiety may very well evoke this fear in the beholder, or the viewer.  But there&#8217;s a difference between what Schiele experienced and what he chose to express.  So it&#8217;s possible that he may have exaggerated or distorted.</p>
<p><b>Kandel:</b> Oh, there&#8217;s no question.  I mean, I think what he tried to depict is the essential anxiety of modern man.  And he depicted this in a lot of artificial ways in order to bring them out.  He was very much influenced by Charcot and the postures that people could assume while under hypnosis.  And he actually postured in order to convey these emotions.  And also he was shocking. He painted himself masturbating in the mirror in order to make clear that no emotion is alien to him.  And he&#8217;s willing to share that with the beholder.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, if a painting is a buffer between the artist and the beholder, how do scientific developments account for what the artist withholds or decides to distort?  Or what the beholder might in fact misinterpreted or be tricked into interpreting?  There are many illusions in this book too.</p>
<p><b>Kandeel:</b> This is, of course, true.  The sign of a great painting is its ambiguity.  It allows you and me to bring different things to bear on it.  And depending upon our relative sophistication on a particular subject, or a particular sub-subject, we would interpret it in different ways.  So I think this is part of the greatness of art, that it allows different people to bring their own experiences to bear on it in an individualistic way.  </p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ktri.jpg" alt="" title="ktri" width="284" height="298" align="right" /><b>Correspondent:</b>  The key element in assessing the relationship between art and neuroscience is the beholder. Now Semir Zeki has argued that the Kanizsa triangle, where we see these three&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Kandel:</b> These illusory contours. They&#8217;re not there.  We make them up.  Zeki, of course, one of the pioneers in visual perception, is in an ideal position to point out that the brain is a creativity machine, which art historians in Vienna 1900 began to appreciate.  That we don&#8217;t reproduce in our head what we see in the outside world.  That&#8217;s not a detail of reproduction.  We construct it. We take it apart.  And we build it together again.  So the beholder undergoes a creative process that parallels what the artist undergoes.  It&#8217;s an amazing set of insights.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And that Zeki experiment is one example of the beholder responding to cues.  Zeki also discovered in another experiment that no matter what type of art was presented to the subject, the same areas of the prefrontal cortex are going to light up. So if the biology of beauty, as you write, has varied very little over the centuries and also across cultures, my question to you is why are these cues and our biases so universal?  I mean, how does the brain distinguish between, say, Klimt and Hopper?</p>
<p><b>Kandel:</b> Well, it clearly sees different forms.  But that does not mean that those two painters can evoke certain common responses.  And what you&#8217;re seeing is the common responses.  There are also distinctive elements between the two.  So there&#8217;s a loneliness that Hopper depicts that you never see in Klimt.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You are very precise when speculating upon Klimt&#8217;s <i>Judith</i> and its effect on the brain.  You write that the gold hues, the soft body, and the colors trigger the release of dopamine and that Judith&#8217;s sadistic gaze might release norepinephrine.  And this demonstrates that art has an effect on neuroscience.  But it also seems to imply that this connection is almost a one directional flow.  In light of E.O. Wilson&#8217;s hope for unity between biology and the humanities, and in consideration of the impact of Freud&#8217;s ideas have had on the Viennese Secession, I&#8217;m wondering how 21st century neuroscience has an effect on art in the other direction.</p>
<p><b>Kandel:</b> You mean, how neuroscientists are likely to influence the arts?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Exactly. Anything on the level of how they influenced in Vienna.</p>
<p><b>Kandel:</b> As you pointed out, it&#8217;s very easy to see how art influences science.  Neuroscientists consider it as one of the great aspirations of the field to understand how we respond to works of art, how artists and how creativity takes place. What can art historians and artists take away from neuroscience?  Well, Leonardo da Vinci spent a lot of time dissecting bodies when he was interested in getting a realistic depiction of human form, of people walking, of just how the various bones go together in order to form the body, and he learned an enormous amount by studying anatomy.  So the hope is that as we know more about the biology of creativity, we know more about perception, we will excite artists to think about new art forms that may bring those things out even more effectively.  Also, if they learn one of the kinds of stimuli that really turn on different regions of the brain, they might be able to play upon their skills to bring out those things even more.  So one would hope this would be a dialogue that would go in both directions and have some impact on art as well.  </p>

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Reconsidering the ever-shifting happy/normal life spectrum.</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> <a href="http://www.jeanettewinterson.com/">Jeanette Winterson</a></p>
<p><b>Subjects Discussed:</b> How the brain spins around, getting two marriage proposals, sleeping in a brothel in Los Angeles, people who copulate in corridors, &#8220;part fact part fiction&#8221; as a cover story, Winterson&#8217;s obligations to the facts, how a new life can be found in the form of a book, a life ending that nobody wants, how literature allows an intervention into that fateful feeling of life, imaginative freedom, adopted children and being a control freak, the cyclical nature of Winterson&#8217;s work, performance spring from fiction and performance turning into nonfiction, Witnerson World, trusting the creative process, the problems with creative writing schools, Ulysses and the return, T.S.

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</b></p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Speaking of Mrs. Winterson [JW's adopted mother], there is a dash-driven paragraph about halfway through the book where you have her applying various charges to locations.  Bestiality for the pet parlor, unmarried mothers to the day nursery. So to what degree does containing Mrs. Winterson in words help you to insulate her both from yourself and also, while we&#8217;re talking about this idea of what the reader takes away, the readership?</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> Well, I think this time I let her loose.  She is also the Dog Woman in <i>Sexing the Cherry</i>. The gigantic lonely philosophical creature who adopts Jordan from the banks of the River Thames.  I&#8217;ve worked with her often.  As a dream figure.  As a psychopath, which I suppose she was in a way.  But also as a psychopomp, which in myth stories is the strange part-angel, part-devil creature who often tells the stories.  You find them in the <i>Arabian Nights</i> very often. There&#8217;s kind of a liminal creature inhabiting two worlds.  Which in a way she did. Because she lived in end times.  She was waiting for Armageddon. And that&#8217;s what she wanted.  So she was only ever partly in our world.  She called life a pre-death experience, which tells you a lot about her psyche.  So I wasn&#8217;t insulating myself any longer.  I had to do that in <i>Oranges</i> because that was a cover version I could live with.  I couldn&#8217;t have told the story twenty-five years ago.  I really couldn&#8217;t.  That would have been the end of me. And it would have been a very different trajectory for me.  But I can tell it now.  And I wanted to release her &#8212; like the genie, like the 300-foot genie from the bottle &#8212; and give her back to the reader.  Because I think the reader comes out feeling compassion for this woman. Sympathy even.  And also understanding more both about me &#8212; Jeanette Winterson the writer &#8212; and also about the place that I come from.  It&#8217;s not covered up at all.  I think this is the most revealed book that I have ever written. Which is not to say that the language isn&#8217;t as conscious or as taut as I liked it to be.  It&#8217;s important to me to work with language.  But it is a completely honest book.  It&#8217;s a truthful book, yeah.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Can you reveal too much of yourself through these particular projects?  </p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> Yes, you can.  You can get very overshary if you&#8217;re not careful.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> How have you stopped yourself from doing this?  Do you have a good team that&#8217;s going to say, &#8220;Hey, Jeanette, maybe you don&#8217;t actually want to tell the world that&#8221;?</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> No. I made a choice.  And it&#8217;s the center of the book. There&#8217;s one page called &#8220;Intermission.&#8221;  And I say, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to miss out twenty-five years.&#8221;  Which I thought would be good for the memoir anyway. Because I thought, this time, the form got a kick up the ass.  It became just a bit more fluent and less linear.  So I thought, well, that would give people a later clue. They won&#8217;t feel so bound to go through this from A to Z.  And I did that in order not to bring in lots of people from the middle of my life, which would have turned it more into a kiss-and-tell book.  And it would have been about sex and gossip and money. And I thought, I&#8217;m not letting this be hijacked by the lurid press.  I&#8217;m going to tell the stories I need to tell and miss out the things which will spoil the story in a real way. By that, I mean, whether it&#8217;s a spoiler and a spoiling.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But where does order come in for you?  I mean, you&#8217;re reading the books in the library A to Z.  </p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> I was.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And this leads me to ask you &#8212; because I also know that at the very beginning of each day, instead of bicycling to work &#8212; most of us who work in the freelance world have the ideal commute.  Bed to desk.  Thirty seconds.  Best commute in the world, right?  You, on the other hand, get into a stationary bike and you start just jamming in that for a while.</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> Oh no! It&#8217;s not stationary.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> It&#8217;s not stationary?</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh! You actually do ride the bicycle!</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> I do!  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> Yes, but I come right back to where I started from.  So we may be at the start of our conversation.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Aha!</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> I have a studio in the garden of my house.  But I will not leave my house and walk over to the studio.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I see.</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> I have to get on my bicycle and I cycle for fifteen minutes.  Because there&#8217;s a circular lane where I live.  I live in a village in The Coxwells.  And I just cycle round it and come back.  And then I can start work.</p>
<p><b>Correspodnent:</b> Got it.  Why do you need to&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> I don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> But I do.</p>
<p><b>Correspodnent:</b> What does that do for you?  Reading in sequence or going from A to Z in this case to work.  It&#8217;s very fascinating to me.  And this kind of relates back to my question about units of measurement.  Do you need order in order to find something distinct?  Something idiosyncratic?  Something quirky?  Something brand new that nobody else has?  Do you need to have a destination to find a completely idiosyncratic journey?  What&#8217;s the deal here?</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> Try Flaubert, when he said that the artist needs to be ordered in his habits so that he can be wild in his imagination.  That&#8217;s a good quote.  That works entirely for me.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Calm and orderly life so you can be violent and original in your work.</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> Right.  If you came into my house, you know, it&#8217;s lovely. I mean, it&#8217;s ordered.  It&#8217;s warm.  It&#8217;s beautiful.  There&#8217;s always food.  You know, everything&#8217;s clean.  And I like it that way.  The garden&#8217;s attractive and I grow vegetables.  That allows me to be completely free in my mental space.  Now this isn&#8217;t a prescription. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> No, no, no.</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> By any means.  But everybody who does creative work must quite soon work out the best way for that to happen and stick to it.  And a lot of people imagine that there is this Bohemian disorder and somehow that&#8217;s better for them.  They think it&#8217;s a kind of rock star thing.  And they should just be writing the songs at four in the morning.  It seems to work very well for rock stars.  I&#8217;m not sure it necessarily works well for other forms of creativity.</p>
<p><B>Correspondent:</b> But 15,000 words in two weeks.  </p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> It&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> It seems to me that you&#8217;re also struck by flashes of inspiration and so you could possibly be the rock star who has an idea at four in the morning.</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> Oh yeah. I have plenty of inspiration. That&#8217;s never been an issue.  I&#8217;ve never had writer&#8217;s block and I&#8217;ve never had the slightest worry, even for a moment, that the thing would stop.  I feel very confident there.  But I do like that space.  And even though I live alone &#8212; I mean I wouldn&#8217;t live with my girlfriend, because it would be terrible &#8212; but even though I live alone, I still have to have a studio space separate to my domestic space.  And I have to bicycle to it.  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> How many different spaces do you need in life?  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> Several.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Do you have about ten?</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> Well, I have my place in London.  I have my shop.  And then I have a place in the country.  And I have my studio.  And I also have a secret room in Paris.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Aha!  Wow, that&#8217;s very intriguing.</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I wanted to get back to the book.  You are adopted, as we&#8217;ve been saying.  But I&#8217;m wondering if it is an inevitable part of life that we transform in some sense to our parents.  How do you deal with this?  I mean, you write late in the book, &#8220;I wanted to be claimed.&#8221;  Now isn&#8217;t it essential to claim yourself at some point?  I mean, if you&#8217;ve always been interested in stories of disguise, in mistaken identity, how do you recognize yourself?  I mean, does the disguise of truth within stories create additional problems with self-recognition here?  </p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> No. I think it allows you to play with all your possible selves.  The options.  Because none of us is one thing.  But sometimes it feels like that or we get forced into that because of the way society&#8217;s structured.  And it&#8217;s great privilege and freedom to think, &#8220;Well, I can play with all these other selves.&#8221;  It&#8217;s partly why I have a shop.  That&#8217;s another life completely.  That&#8217;s why I grow vegetables.  You know, there are many JWs, but they all come together in the one that writes the books, which I think is the important thing.  And, yes, I do feel settled now and claimed and reclaimed in myself.  But, you know, I&#8221;m not free from the normal anxieties of the rest of the population.  We all want to belong.  We are gregarious creatures.  We&#8217;re pack animals. We don&#8217;t always want to be the one who&#8217;s the outlier on the outside.  We like to be inside sometimes.  And it&#8217;s a very lonely place if you&#8217;re always on the outside.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah. Do you have a finite sense of selves?  Because it also seems to me that that has got to be &#8212; if you&#8217;re constantly dredging up different selves and you&#8217;re also worried about this issue of being an outsider in some sense, or being criticized by a media climate&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> Oh no! I&#8217;m not worried about that.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> I don&#8217;t care about being criticized.  If you&#8217;re going to be an artist, you really can&#8217;t care about that.  Because nobody is going to give you any easy ride for all of your life.  Someone&#8217;s always going to come out with both guns. So that&#8217;s how it is.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Winterson:</b> It&#8217;s not that.  It&#8217;s actually much more of an existential loneliness.  It&#8217;s where you position yourself on the radar of humanity.  Are you in its sights?  Or are you just always just being missed out in some ways?  That sense of belonging is not to do with how many friends you&#8217;ve got.  It&#8217;s not to do with how many girlfriends you&#8217;ve got.  I&#8217;ve always had good friends.  And I&#8217;ve usually been with somebody.  It isn&#8217;t that at all.  That&#8217;s why I call it an existential loneliness.  It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s at the center of self.  And possibly it always will be.  I think so.  Although I&#8217;m comfortable with that now.  And I think that sultriness might be a necessary condition with being able to create something and comment on the world.  You need that slight distance, I think.  </p>

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Making the unanticipated five year wait count for something.</p>

<p><B>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</b></p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> In <i>The Father of All Things</i>, you remarked on how your father was depicted in Philip Caputo&#8217;s <i>A Rumor of War</i>, where Caputo, he remarks that your father is very funny in telling all these jokes to the other soldiers in the face of tragedy.  You wrote back then, &#8220;I saw the still normal man my father could have become, a man with the average sadnesses.&#8221;  I&#8217;m wondering if assembling the essays for this collection was in some weird way an effort to look at yourself in the same way.  Do you feel that you saw a younger Tom with these average sadnesses or anything like this?  Some image of what your life could have become?  I mean, I also note this because there&#8217;s an interesting sentence you write in &#8220;Unflowered Aloes&#8221; &#8212; the first essay, the youngest one &#8212; where you say, &#8220;For intellectuals, destiny as it applies to life is a ludicrous thought. But destiny as it applies to works of fiction and poetry goes largely unquestioned.&#8221; So do you subscribe to any peculiar destiny these days?  What of this?</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> The earlier essays are the ones that I was most hesitant to include in the book at all. They&#8217;re basically &#8212; I&#8217;m sure you think this way when you look at your own stuff that&#8217;s older than, say, five years. Basically, it&#8217;s a stranger&#8217;s work, right? And I once imagined that if I ever did a nonfiction thing, I&#8217;d have all the pieces that I&#8217;d ever wrote and it would be a big chunky thing.  No one wanted to do that obviously.  There&#8217;s a lot of essays that I could have included, but I didn&#8217;t.  Just because they were so sloppy in their thinking and they were so &#8212; what I&#8217;m saying now gets into self-congratulatory territory.  Because the presupposition is that your recent work is not perfect.  And that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m trying to say.  But I think you can see in the essays, and I noticed this when I was going over them, is a journey from someone who has become gradually more comfortable not presenting himself as a [DAvid Foster] Wallace-like buffoon, and actually becoming someone who is able to be present in a piece, and I hope be honest and not have these kind of ridiculous squirting boutonniere moments where you&#8217;re somewhat desperately trying to get the reader&#8217;s affection and attention.  So I think I&#8217;ve become a less needy presence.  And I think my interests &#8212; I feel like when I&#8217;m talking about intellectuals in that first piece, I mean, all the stuff I said, I more or less believe. I was a somewhat self-serious person then.  And I was working for this literary house.  And you can see the tone varies in a lot of the pieces. The tone is often directly reflective of where I was living even physically, and the experiences I&#8217;d gone through.  And maybe the more average experiences I&#8217;d had until that point, I think there&#8217;s a temptation to actually make more of your experience than can really be made of it.  And the Escanaba essay, which is the second essay in the book about watching Jeff Daniels make this movie about my hometown, I read it aloud at Bookcourt the other night.  And I kind of kept stopping and apologizing to the audience almost for the histrionic tone. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I think most writers of personal journalism or confessional essays tend to do that &#8212; especially if it&#8217;s been a long while.  I know Jonathan Ames does that. I&#8217;ve seen other writers do that.</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> Well, I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not alone then.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> They&#8217;re embarrassed. &#8220;Oh my god. I can&#8217;t believe I wrote this about myself.&#8221; I think that&#8217;s a very human reaction.  But on the other hand, I mean I have to say, if the yardstick here in comparison to your father is yourself, do you see the typical sadnesses at all that you saw as Caputo depicted your father?  Or anything like that?</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> I don&#8217;t know. I do know that in some of the experiences I had immediately after September 11th, then covering the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, I became a lot more concerned with making my work as funny as possible. (<i>laughs</i>) And maybe that was just an attempt to not succumb to a kind of glumness about &#8212; oh, this is just veering off into territory that I&#8217;m not even sure I understand.  But I became way less interested in the kind of essay I would have written &#8212; like &#8220;Unflowered Aloes.&#8221;  A puckish but tart stately essay, right?  And I just became more interested in stuff that puts it out there on the line emotionally, but is primarily concerned with exploring the absurd and the humorous parts of these people.  And I try to do that even in the Werner Herzog essay, which &#8212; he&#8217;s not the easiest subject in the world to wring a lot of humor out of.  But I don&#8217;t know.  I&#8217;m not sure.  I feel like I have not answered your question at all.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, this is actually all good.  Maybe another way to phrase it is this.  I mean, there seems to me to have always been some interesting confessional streak in your writing.  I think of when you finally spill about your fiancée in <i>Chasing the Sea</i>.  I think, of course, of the ultimate example. It&#8217;s probably the last chapter in <i>Extra Lives</i>.  I think of your decision in <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/celebrities/The-Last-Lion.html">the Jim Harrison essay</a> to basically announce at the end, &#8220;I&#8217;m giving up teaching.&#8221;  These are really bold &#8212; I mean, very bold, quite frankly &#8212; ways to find a personal connection into someone who you clearly revere or some thing &#8212; like <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> &#8212; that you clearly revere.  And I&#8217;m wondering. Why do you feel this need to do this? And why has it been blowing up with, I suppose, even more extraordinary pronouncement?  &#8220;Hey, I went ahead and had this coke breakdown.&#8221; Or &#8220;I am packing up my life entirely and maybe if you follow me in the next essay, I&#8217;ll tell you how things are going.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> It also causes, at least this reader, to say, &#8220;Fuck! I hope Tom is okay!&#8221; (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So my question is: is this an effort to draw either longtime or short-term readers into what you&#8217;re doing?  Does it provide a greater authenticity? Is it a way of shaking off the sort of smarmy, sort of semi-self-confident guy in &#8220;Unflowered Aloes&#8221;? What of this?  Why?</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> I think some of this must come from having started as a fiction writer and being profoundly uninterested in nonfiction for a long time.  And so when you&#8217;re writing fiction, there are these lightning bolts of revelation from your own life, your own experience, that are being superinjecting that into the story or paragraph you&#8217;re working on.  It&#8217;s easy to do in fiction. Because no one asks any questions, right?  But that electricity is actually what gives fiction its texture.  And without that sensed personal connection between writer and material, even if it&#8217;s not autobiographical material, there&#8217;s that electric sense that this voice knows of what it speaks.  And for me, informational nonfiction, nonfiction that doesn&#8217;t have an identifiable human being in it, I mean, I could not care less about reading that stuff.  And so I realize I confess things in my pieces not out of any real objective or desire.  It just seems to be the move that I&#8217;m driven to make.  Like I didn&#8217;t have any idea when I was writing the <i>Grand Theft Auto</i> essay that I was even going to get into my collapse. Into cocaine. No idea. I just started writing the essay and it just started coming out.  I didn&#8217;t even know that I was going to get into the quitting my teaching thing literally until the moment I got there.  So, believe it or not, those moves are like &#8212; I&#8217;m almost powerless to not do them in some strange way.  They&#8217;re never &#8212; and here&#8217;s my defense.  Teaching doesn&#8217;t come up in that whole essay until the very end. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> So I hope structurally I&#8217;m proving my point.  And I could have gone back.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But in an age of Google, I mean, we can find out.  The reader can find out.  &#8220;Oh, Tom was teaching somewhere.  Wait. What the hell?  He&#8217;s no longer teaching and he&#8217;s telling us this in his essay?&#8221;  I mean, part of me almost wants to say, in an age where that covenant of author-reader privacy is diminishing, where the author is now expected to tell everything about himself &#8212; because everybody is spilling everything about themselves on Facebook, on Twitter, on Tumblr, on whatever &#8212; I&#8217;m uncomfortable with that idea too.  Because I feel, well, why must the author confess everything? Unless it&#8217;s pertinent to the piece. This is why I say to myself, well, the bigger leap. If you don&#8217;t know where it comes from, and it sometimes gets out there, well, it seems like you&#8217;re working in terrain that&#8217;s very uncontrolled. What do you do to make sure you don&#8217;t say too much?</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> Decorum.  My girlfriend. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)  What army?  What vanguard is there to prevent you?  &#8220;Hey, Tom, you can&#8217;t say this!&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> Well, I think that less than 1% of my readers are keeping track of me, right?  And so in one sense, I&#8217;m assuming that everyone who reads something of mine is coming to me for the first time.  And so I don&#8217;t presume that they have any concern for what&#8217;s going on before with me.  And especially with my video game book, I think a lot of people read it not even knowing that I had this career as a literary writer before that.  So I&#8217;m just assuming that the slate is blank.  And I guess maybe these bombs get dropped in there to assert some kind of &#8212; well, I guess it&#8217;s reasserting the pact of intimacy between the reader and the writer.  And that intimacy is not always there in nonfiction.  It&#8217;s not even really expected.  And what&#8217;s weird is that, as a nonfiction writer, you start off with this utterly unearned intimacy.  Which is the intimacy that, well, I&#8217;m telling you the truth.  And that&#8217;s the moral bond between the nonfiction reader and the nonfiction writer.  &#8220;What I&#8217;m telling you is true.&#8221;  And so you start on this very intimate terrain.  And then I think a lot of nonfiction writers never really wander off that terrain.  That that&#8217;s enough.  And for me, it&#8217;s not enough.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> On the other hand, the extreme version of that would be someone like John D&#8217;Agata or Mike Daisey, who basically throw that trust into the water and piss a lot of people off and perhaps, depending upon where your point of view is, destroy their credibility as someone who can share a story or who can even share some acceptable version of the truth, if that makes any sense.  It seems to me that your confessional streak is both bomb-dropping but also just enough for us to maintain that covenant.  Yet I know you&#8217;ve also taught <i>About a Mountain</i> at Portland.  And so forth.  So do you see yourself possibly entering into &#8220;Hey! I really wasn&#8217;t telling the truth about this. Fuck you.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) Well, here&#8217;s an interesting point that I will make that I will stand by.  I never anymore write magazine pieces in the kind of magazine journalism present tense.  Ever.  I kind of loathe the nonfiction present tense.  And I loathe it because &#8212; especially if you&#8217;re writing about yourself &#8212; when you write in the present tense, you are almost foreclosing any possibility of reflection.  And you almost don&#8217;t have to account for your decisions or your behavior.  And that&#8217;s why all bad behavior memoirs are always written in the present tense.  &#8220;I slapped the hooker.  And then I did another line. And then I staggered out and slept with the cab driver.&#8221;  Now: &#8220;I slap the hooker, step outside. I snort another line of coke.  I sit down with the cab driver.&#8221; No. I&#8217;m doing this in present tense. But you turn that into past tense and suddenly it doesn&#8217;t work anymore.  Now it just seems ghoulish and there&#8217;s no sensationalistic fizziness to it.  And you just have a reader that&#8217;s just saying, &#8220;Well, wait a minute? <i>Why</i> did you do these things?&#8221;  Right?  So you&#8217;ll notice that I never ever, ever write in the present tense when it comes to nonfiction.  And I really, really strive when I do go into confessional mode to keep part of the partition up.  I have no interest in revealing the details of my life if they&#8217;re not relevant to what I&#8217;m actually writing about.  And I hope that would distinguish me from some people who seem compulsively confessional.  That I would like to think that the stuff that I&#8217;m letting loose has a direct emotional bearing on the material that&#8217;s under investigation.  </p>

<p><B>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</b></p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Let&#8217;s start with the first sentence of this book.  I think it&#8217;s a pretty telling notion that the author&#8217;s note is: &#8220;The first essay in this collection was written by a 25-year-old assistant editor living in New York City and the last was written by a 37-year-old assistant professor of English living in Portland, Oregon.&#8221;  Now this is interesting because you are now no longer living in Portland, Oregon.  You are now no longer an assistant professor.  I read <a href="http://therumpus.net/2012/04/the-rumpus-interview-with-tom-bissell/">an interview you did with Owen King</a> and I learned that, in fact, your video game script writing is also in this tetchy peripatetic vocational mode.  So my question to you is, well, what do you think accounts for this existence?  Were the early roots basically set down with this whole aborted Peace Corps stint?  I mean, what of this?  What do you think accounts for this constant travel on your end?</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> I guess &#8212; I lived in New York City for nine years with a couple stints away.  One in which I spent seven months living in Vietnam.  I spent a summer in the Canadian Arctic. So I&#8217;d live in New York City and then go to places and spend time there.  And then I won the American Academy of Arts and Letters Rome Prize, which is a great thing.  But it also kind of wrecked my life in some very curious way.  I mean, I don&#8217;t want to say that to give the impression that I&#8217;m not hugely grateful and it&#8217;s not an amazing prize.  But from there, I wound up moving out of New York without ever really meaning to.  And then I lived in Rome for a while.  And then I got this fellowship.  Then I moved to Vegas.  And then I decided that I wanted to move to Estonia.  And then that didn&#8217;t go well.  And then I decided, &#8220;Oh, I need to get a job.&#8221;  So I got a job as a professor at a time where it was really hard to get them.  So then when I was offered this thing, I was like, &#8220;Oh god. Gotta take it. Gotta take it.&#8221; You know, economic downturn. Apocalypse coming.  Cats and dogs living together.  You know. That&#8217;s a <i>Ghostbusters</i> reference.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Of course.  I got it.</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) For the audience.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, unlike William Atherton, you do have a penis. (<i>laughs</i>) I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> You&#8217;ve just doubled down on my <i>Ghostbusters</i> reference.  So I moved to Portland thinking that this was where I was going to be for a while.  And for various reasons, it just didn&#8217;t take.  So I recognized that this was a chaotic last few years that I had as a person and as a writer.  It hadn&#8217;t felt that chaotic.  Every step that I&#8217;ve taken has kind of been, well, this is obviously what I have to do.  But looked at objectively, I mean, I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve written anything.  Considering the amount of places.  Moving.  As I get older, I just get more and more books.  So my girlfriend and I just moved to Los Angeles. And the movers, when they greeted us, they were like very hostile right away.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Hostile. </p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> Why were these guys so mad at me?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Books? (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) Yeah.  Because of the books.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah, I know.  Having moved many times myself, that&#8217;s always the pain in the ass right there.</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> Yeah, man. For the first time in my life, for the first time in my life, I was like, &#8220;Yeah, I think Kindles might make sense.&#8221;  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Because you might move next year.</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> Because I might move.  So now, if I had my druthers, I would live in New York City again.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But you live in L.A. right now.</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> We live in L.A. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> How long do you think that will last?</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> I&#8217;m determined to live there for at least several years.  And we&#8217;ll see.  We&#8217;ll see.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But the peripatetic picaresque instinct might actually seize you again?  Is this something you can entirely tame? Do you think? </p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> I can&#8217;t.  Because, like I said, New York is the only place that&#8217;s ever never stopped boring me.  And I get bored in places.  And then I want to be somewhere else. And New York is really the one city that I never got sick of.  Just even going back here, walking around, it&#8217;s just the most amazing place. And every neighborhood &#8212; and I&#8217;m sounding like just a hackneyed New York-loving cliche monger right now. But every neighborhood you walk through is interesting and there&#8217;s just &#8212; you never get tired here. You never get tired of it.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, let&#8217;s look at this from another point of view through the writing.  In this book, you have <a href="http://harpers.org/archive/2000/09/0067557">&#8220;Escanaba&#8217;s Magic Hour,&#8221;</a> which demonstrates how the re-creation of this real world on film leads to some problems. Because there are these stiff regulatory pronouncements upon the Escanabans.  Is that how I would say it?  Escanabans?</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> Escanabans.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Okay. Fantastic. Don&#8217;t want to be rebuked by a local.  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> Escanabianite.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes!  Exactly.  It&#8217;s interesting that you ended up talking with Herzog when you did.  Because <i>Rescue Dawn</i> &#8212; is that not a re-creation of a quasi-re-creation?  Then you also, of course, pieced together details from your family of this photo in <i>The Father of All Things</i>. And then, if we go ahead and factor in your stints in Uzbekistan, the trip to Vietnam, being embedded with the Marines in 2005, much of this also involves some effort on your part to try and find a relationship with the real world.  Now, with video games, much of your time, I would say, is spent working on fictitious worlds.  You know, you describe the world of <i>Grand Theft Auto IV</i> at the end of <i>Extra Lives</i>: &#8220;as real as Liberty City seems, you have no hope of even figuratively living within it.&#8221; So I have to ask you about this.  If Edmund Wilson said that the human imagination has already come to conceive the possibility of recreating human society, how does your imagination work?  Why these efforts to take stabs at re-creation over the years?  That&#8217;s a rather enormous question.  But I wanted to see if we could roll the ball.</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> No, no.  And this is where I think you&#8217;re really onto something. I think some people &#8212; the conventionally-minded readers &#8212; would look at my interest in something like <i>Grand Theft Auto</i>, having started off as a travel writer to &#8220;real&#8221; places, would look at this as a kind of alarming drop in quality control on my part.  But I&#8217;m really interested in travel, both literal and figurative.  Right?  And I&#8217;d like to think my books &#8212; and this is something I&#8217;ve consciously tried to create in my books &#8212; is a sense of realities within realities. And that photo thing that you mentioned, which is at the beginning of <i>The Father of All Things</i>, which is this book I wrote about my dad and my relationship, and his relationship to Vietnam, and a generational relationship to war that we both had a different version of that &#8212; and I took this photo and basically jammed a 100 page section out of just looking at this photo.  And I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s terribly different from my interest in video games in a weird way.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s that different from planting yourself in a place like Uzbekistan, which I didn&#8217;t really have any right to write about, you know.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Do you still feel that now?</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, as a nonfiction writer who&#8217;s &#8212; I&#8217;m not an expert on anything. I&#8217;m just interested in a bunch of stuff.  And sometimes those interests fade.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But aren&#8217;t those interests enough?  Isn&#8217;t that curiosity the ultimate drive that causes you to recreate in some sense?</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> I hope so.  Yeah.  So this idea of loving worlds both real and virtual.  And my favorite is I think the driving thing behind my entire goal as a writer.  And I think my interest in games is finding yourself in this densely created place that human beings have populated with detail and incident, and then just running out there and finding out what&#8217;s ther4e for you.  Now it may be pathetic from a certain perspective, that I&#8217;ve gone from traveling to places like Vietnam and Uzbekistan to serving these digital worlds. But I try not to think of it that way.  Because I think &#8212; like what John [Jeremiah] Sullivan&#8217;s <a href="http://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/200908/michael-jackson-john-jeremiah-sullivan-tribute">piece about Michael Jackson said</a> &#8212; anything that is is real. And I really believe that.  Because he was talking about people who had criticized Michael Jackson&#8217;s new face. No. &#8220;Anything that is is natural.&#8221; And that, I think, is a really wonderful insight.  And I think it&#8217;s true.  Anything that is is natural.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah. But I&#8217;m wondering if, when you&#8217;re writing about something like a sitcom television producer, as you do in this book, and you have to hit the tropes of &#8220;Okay, here we are at the rehearsal stage,&#8221; &#8220;here we are with the joke writers trying to revise the joke so that it gets the biggest laugh for the audience&#8221; &#8212; what is interesting is the whole incident with the luncheonette at the beginning.  The hard work. The failure at the beginning.  Getting fired from <i>My Little Pony</i>.  Those are very human moments. And it almost seems to me that you &#8212; particularly a guy like you, who is very much interested in the complex details of any world &#8212; it must be difficult to find a way to sandwich those moments into a profile along these lines when, in fact, you also have to meet the need of an audience who wants to know additional sordid details.  Behind-the-scenes stuff. </p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> About Charlie Sheen.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Exactly. </p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I mean, how do you negotiate the human in an essay like that when it would seem to me, if that is a goal of yours, to be more difficult than, say, going into ravaged terrain and seeing a disappearing sea or seeing that there are no remnants of a military campaign from decades before.  You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> Well, this is the one thing that I think [David Foster] Wallace did so well in his essays.  Which is he turned the act of noticing things into a kind of a narrative in and of itself.  That the mere cataloging of things becomes the story in a weird sort of way.  And I&#8217;ve never done this to the degree that he did it.  But when you read these Wallace pieces, like about David Lynch or about talk radio, he&#8217;s always more interested in the cameraman or the baton twirlers.  You know, he&#8217;s always interested in the freakshow qualities of the places he goes.  And if you&#8217;re profiling a hit sitcom producer, you can&#8217;t do that.  You can&#8217;t talk to the joke writer as much as you perhaps want to.  Chuck Lorre, the subject of the piece, has to be the focus.  So it took a long time to get those <i>My Little Pony</i> details out of him.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) How long did you have to work him?  Did you have to grill him to get the <i>My Little Pony</i> details?</p>
<p><b>Bissell:</b> Kind of. Yeah.  Because it took him a long time to open up.  And if there&#8217;s anything I can say about writing profiles, which writing celebrity profiles, I mean, why even bother?  They&#8217;re too canny to really open up to you.  And their publicists are all on everyone&#8217;s backs.  And there&#8217;s all this <i>quid pro quo</i> that goes on with that kind of a piece.  It&#8217;s not even writing.  It&#8217;s like alien anthropology, right?  But someone like Chuck Lorre, who has a publicist, but I think the idea of self-protection is much less pronounced as a technician type creator, right?  Celebrity type creators are &#8212; I just can&#8217;t imagine ever being interested in writing about a person like that.  So Chuck Lorre, you have all this access to the ins and outs of a fringe television job that he just happened to basically become the most successful sitcom producer of the modern age.  It&#8217;s really interesting.  But within that journey, there are all the arcana of how one goes about becoming a successful sitcom writer.  And the fact that he got fired from <i>My Little Pony</i> was to me &#8212; I&#8217;m glad you latched onto that.  Because that was the most interesting detail in that piece to me.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> That from such a humiliation comes the great success.</p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B></p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You put on the glasses.  Have you always worn glasses?  Because I noticed that was the new cover photo for this. Whereas before you didn&#8217;t have glasses.</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Oh, I&#8217;ve been blind for a long, long time.  Maybe &#8212; I forget.  Maybe the photographer had me take them off.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> They asked you to take them off.  I was always curious.</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> No, no, no.</p>
<p><B>Correspondent:</b>  I didn&#8217;t know if it was a new mild-mannered Clark Kent look or&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> No, no, no.  I can assure you that these glasses actually work. They help me see.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Good. I&#8217;m more visible for you.  That&#8217;s reassuring.  Let&#8217;s go ahead and get right into it.  Your book opens with this story of Continuum observing an elderly woman who is wetting a paper towel and wiping the remaining coffee grounds off of the linoleum as she was cleaning.  This, of course, leads to the development of the Swiffer.  Near the end of the book, you point out Shakespeare.  He had a tendency to comb through the many books he read to find stories that he could use for plays and so forth. So it would seem to me &#8212; just to establish some terms from the beginning &#8212; that much of your notion of creativity involves the theft of ideas.  That if you have financial or intellectual resources and you&#8217;re able to go ahead and pluck them from somebody else, then hey! You can be creative! So how is profiting off of another person&#8217;s idea a form of creation?  Or art?  Or what not?</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d call it straight theft.  I think Dylan actually has &#8212; I talk a lot about Bob Dylan in the book.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes, you do.  </p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> And he&#8217;s got this wonderful phrase where he describes his process as one of love and theft.  That first you fall in love.  Whether it&#8217;s a Woody Guthrie-style.  Whether it&#8217;s a Robert Johnson riff. Whether it&#8217;s, say, old Irish lullaby from Ireland which you turn into &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind.&#8221; So you love it and you love it.  And you try and understand it and map out the intricate details and connections and then you steal it.  And you make it your own.  So this isn&#8217;t straight theft.  This is, in theory, Shakespeare, who, as you point out, was doing pretty well for himself.  He came from very humble beginnings.  His father was a glover.  He signed his name with a mark.  But he did his dad proud and made lots of money.  So he didn&#8217;t just steal <i>Hamlet</i>.  He didn&#8217;t just steal the plot for <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.  And he didn&#8217;t just steal almost all his plots.  Shakespeare did not like inventing his own stories, of course. He made them his own.  He reinvented them.  I think it&#8217;s the same thing Bob Dylan did with that Robert Johnson riff.  It&#8217;s the same thing Continuum did with watching that elderly lady wipe up the coffee grinds that they actually spilled on her floor.  That she didn&#8217;t invent the Swiffer.  They invented the Swiffer.  That triggered an insight which then led them to combine the mop, which they spent nine months studying and realizing that mopping&#8217;s a terrible idea.  Because you spend more time cleaning the mop than you do the actual floor.  And in that, her simple act, I mean, they had all done themselves countless times, simply triggered their breakthrough. So in a sense, I mean, I think you&#8217;re right to point out that all creativity involves a theft from somewhere.  I think creativity is ultimately just a new connection between old ideas.  So you are in the most literal sense thieving ideas which already exist.  But the connection itself is new.  At least it should be new.  If it&#8217;s not new, then it actually is straight up theft.  And that&#8217;s not the kind of creativity I&#8217;m interested in.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> What is the creativity you&#8217;re interested in?  Because I want to actually distinguish from an elaborate or high-class pickpocket.  You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Yeah. You know, I think it&#8217;s very easy to get lost in lots of circular discussions about how to define creativity.  I think creativity, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, is a bit like porn.  You kind of know it when you see it.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh yeah?</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Yeah.  Or at least that&#8217;s what the Supreme Court says.  You know, I think creativity is just the invention of something new.  I&#8217;m not saying new in some kind of pretend sense.  I&#8217;m saying something genuinely new which doesn&#8217;t exist in the patent office, doesn&#8217;t exist in the world, that other people find useful.  So that&#8217;s as fancy as I get in defining creativity.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, let&#8217;s get into conceptual blending, which you get into.  People exchanging ideas across different disciplines.  When you take two concepts and mash them together, which seems applicable to this notion of what is creativity, I mean, it has given us some regrettable and fairly negative ideas.  I think that we can both agree that aerosol cheese spray, the car alarm, telemarketing, the Pet Rock.</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Yes. Oh come on.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> These are things that also come from conceptual blending.  So&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Aerosol cheese spray?  I&#8217;ll go with you on the Pet Rock, but Cheese Whiz? That stuff in the can?  That fueled me for much of my childhood.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes.  &#8220;Childhood&#8221; being the key.</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> We&#8217;re talking about adulthood.</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I mean, we&#8217;re talking about ideas that really changed the world.  That really have a revolutionary impact.  Such as the iPhone or something like that.  I mean, you commend <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Gurley_Drew">Dick Drew</a> as this innovator. And I&#8217;m fairly certain that a lot of terrible ideas have also come from 3M.  And with the bartender <a href="http://newyork.seriouseats.com/2008/12/don-lee-bartender-pdt-mixology-drinks.html">Don Lee</a>, you point out that most of his experiments were utter failures.  His attempt to carbonate a cherry didn&#8217;t exactly work.</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Yeah.  And even his Bacon Old Fashioned is very divisive.  Like I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about it.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Have you tried it?</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> I have.  The first sip is delicious and then it&#8217;s kind of unsettling. I think it&#8217;s more about my limitations as a consumer than as an eater.  And a lot of people don&#8217;t like it.  So that&#8217;s a&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, who ultimately determines whether it&#8217;s creative or not?  I mean, I can just go ahead and spend an evening being completely stoned out of my mind and come up with stupid ideas and that can also be conceptual blending.</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I mean, what is the distinguishing quality here?</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Well, that&#8217;s why I think when defining creativity, one has to invoke the second life of the idea.  One has to invoke this notion that it has to be useful to yourself and other people.  So you know, one of my favorite stories and moments of insight &#8212; I talk about moments of insight in <i>Imagine</i> and the neuroscience of it.  And why they happen when we least expect it.  But there&#8217;s this great story of an insight by Oliver Wendell Holmes when he first took laughing gas for the first time.  And he&#8217;s stoned out of his mind.  High as a kite.  While high as a kite, has this big epiphany.  He solved the world.  This grand solution.  Writes it down on a cocktail napkin.  And they can&#8217;t find the cocktail napkin.  And he wakes up the next day.  He&#8217;s hungover. Searches everywhere.  Finally finds a cocktail napkin.  So excited to read it. And what it says is: &#8220;The world smells like turpentine.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah. But there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve">failed economic theories</a> that are also written on cocktail napkins.  You know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no.  So that&#8217;s why I think one has to separate the phenomenology of the idea.  To use a ten dollar word.  Like the feeling of the insight.  Like &#8220;Oh my god, I made this great connection.&#8221;  And I think we&#8217;ve all had the experience &#8212; many of us have had the experience of being stoned or high and being &#8220;That was such a brilliant epiphany.&#8221;  Then you wake up in the morning and you realize it&#8217;s useless.  So I think when talking about creativity, one should talk about the second life and hopefully not just in the brute financial terms.  I don&#8217;t think we should get in the business of just measuring creativity by how many books you sell or whether or not it can be monetized.  Etcetera etcetera.  But we should talk about the second life.  Cause that I think is the ultimate way our ideas are measured. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, to go ahead and get into some of what you write in the book, late, you write that Alex Osborn&#8217;s idea of brainstorming was in fact wrong.  That&#8217;s been pointed out by numerous people.  Why then does your book skim over the really terrible ideas?  I mean, how do we reconcile Osborn with the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14498785">Carson/Peterson/Higgins study</a> involving 86 Harvard undergraduates in which those who considered the irrelevant details were seven times more likely to be rated as &#8220;eminent creative achievers&#8221;? Now being ranked as an &#8220;eminent creative achiever&#8221; is a lot different from, oh say, inventing the iPhone or coming up with something that is actually helpful.  </p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Of course.  So their ranking of creativity &#8212; and what I liked about this study is that it was real world creativity.  A lot of limitations of the way scientists study creativity are creativity tests.  So it&#8217;s tests on divergent thinking, coming up with uses for a brick, finding ways to study traffic in the Bay Area.  Stuff like that.  But it&#8217;s not about the real world.  So what I liked about that study was that it was real world achievement.  So to get back to your question about why I don&#8217;t spend a lot of time on the failed ideas&#8230;.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Because that would seem to be important, you know.</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Well, one of the subplots in the book &#8212; at least that I tried to engineer into the book &#8212; is this notion that there&#8217;s no success without failure, that one of the defining features of successful creators is the way they&#8217;ve learned how to fail successfully.  One of my favorite lines in the book is Lee Unkrich&#8217;s quote &#8212; the director of <i>Toy Story 3</i> &#8212; about the secret sauce of Pixar is failing as fast as possible.  You know, you go through iteration after iteration.  So I&#8217;ve got that whole chapter on the importance of revisions and drafting and the conceiving process and going through drafts, looking for your failures, and trying to fix them.  So, you know, hopefully I&#8217;ve made it clear that all good ideas emerge from the litter of lots of bad ones and that even the best epiphanies, you still have to edit them.  You still have to fine tune them and perfect them.  So hopefully it&#8217;s implicit in the book that part of coming up with a good idea is this entangled relationship with bad ideas.  As for why I don&#8217;t talk a lot about failed ideas in the book, why I don&#8217;t harp on those inventions that never work, I don&#8217;t know. I mean, to be honest, I&#8217;m sure as a storyteller, it&#8217;s easier to tell stories of success.  That&#8217;s what interests me more.  No one wants to buy a book that&#8217;s all about&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You&#8217;re more of a Mike Daisey type than a <i>New York Times</i> guy?</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> How&#8217;d I go from wanting to tell success stories to being a Mike Daisey type?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, because we&#8217;re talking about facts vs. storytelling.  Which is an ongoing debate especially in 2012.  With John D&#8217;Agata and Jim Fingal&#8217;s <i>The Lifespan of a Fact</i>.  With Mike Daisey.</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Well, what are facts vs. storytelling?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> The point I&#8217;m trying to make here is if you are telling a story where everything could be a conceivable success, I mean, there are some things that are inevitably failures.  <i>John Carter</i> is probably by every standard a failure.  It&#8217;s lost more money than any movie.</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Yeah, but how does that?  To get back to your question about facts and stories, how does that &#8212; I&#8217;m trying to talk about creativity and where it comes from.  I think that one of the defining features of creativity &#8212; like I said before &#8212; it&#8217;s a new idea that people find useful.  So there are obviously lots of ideas which people don&#8217;t find useful.  Lots of failed ideas.  In my book, I try to make clear that failure is a part of the creative process.  One should learn how to deal with it.  But one doesn&#8217;t have to write a book about creativity to talk about all the bad ideas that don&#8217;t work out. That would be a very, very, very, very long book, and I think fairly incoherent.  So that&#8217;s why most of the stories I tell in the book are stories where, because that&#8217;s part of what creativity is, that&#8217;s how I define it.  It&#8217;s a new idea that works.  So I tell the story of new ideas that work.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Okay.  </p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> But I don&#8217;t quite understand how that means I&#8217;m Mike Daisey.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, because Mike Daisey took facts to fit his larger narrative.  And while from a liberal standpoint, I suppose you could argue that looking at Shenzhen, even if the facts aren&#8217;t entirely airtight, might be a good idea, there&#8217;s still&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Well, which facts am I eliding to make my larger narrative?  I guess that&#8217;s my&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, when you say you can learn from every failure and there&#8217;s a success from there, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s entirely the truth.</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> I&#8217;m not saying you can &#8212; I don&#8217;t say that anywhere in the book that all ideas are created equal.  In fact, the whole point of why brainstorming doesn&#8217;t work &#8212; you brought up Alex Osborn&#8217;s failed idea &#8212; is that it treats all ideas as equal.  I mean, the whole point of brainstorming is all ideas are useful.  All ideas are good.  And as I point out, the reason brainstorming doesn&#8217;t work is because groups that engage in criticism and debate and dissent, groups that point out, &#8220;That idea is actually a piece of shit,&#8221; they do much better. They come up with more ideas and those ideas are better.  So hopefully a theme of the book, as I&#8217;ve been trying to make clear, is this notion of being honest about which ideas are good and which ideas are bad, identifying failures and fixing them, and out of that process, which is often dismal and unpleasant and insufferable, out of that long process, you will hopefully get a good idea.  But there is no shortcut around it.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You talked with Milton Glaser, the graphic designer who came up with the I ? NY logo.  You mention WH Auden and how he was hopped up on Benzedrine to produce his poems.  You say that it was persistence, this determination to solve the problem of how to rehabilitate the image of New York City, which led to Glaser&#8217;s solution. But aside from Earl Miller&#8217;s recursive loop, his dopamine findings, I&#8217;m curious what science you have to back up this idea of the value of persistence to the creative mind.  I mean, is it not possible that maybe Glaser&#8217;s idea caught on because, well, New York was kind of stuck with it?  Because I ? NY was everywhere?  Know what I mean?</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And also there&#8217;s this troubling idea of, well, do we have to be hopped up on Benzedrine to be a poet?</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> No, no, definitely not.  As Auden himself would discover, there&#8217;s a reason why Benzedrine is now illegal.  We no longer prescribe it for asthma.  It&#8217;s incredibly addictive and, as I point out in the book, comes with all sorts of terrible side effects like horrible constipation, insomnia, and heart arrhythmia, and you definitely don&#8217;t want to advocate Benzedrine, no matter how much you need to edit your poetry.  In terms of the science on persistence, yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of interesting research.  A lot of which has nothing to do with the brain, at least not yet.  Which I think demonstrates that persistence &#8212; the technical term for persistence that psychologists study is grit.  This is primarily the work of Angela Duckworth.  She&#8217;s at Penn.  I&#8217;m actually writing about her now.  Writing an article about her.  She&#8217;s shown in many domains that grit is the single biggest predictor of success.  More than IQ scores.  So if you&#8217;re trying to figure out which 12-year-old will win the National Spelling Bee, it&#8217;s about grit. Who&#8217;s going to last at West Point? It&#8217;s about grit.  Who&#8217;s going to last at Teach for America?  Which amateur golfers are going to make the PGA tour?  She argues that grit also plays a very important role in the creative process. She always quotes the Woody Allen line that 80% of success is showing up.  Well, grit is what allows you to show up again and again.  The two components of grit &#8212; and it&#8217;s important to point out, it&#8217;s not just about persistence.  And I think this is an important caveat.  It&#8217;s not just about persistence.  You also have to have the right goal in the first place.  So I may want to play in the NBA. But you&#8217;re looking at me.  It&#8217;s not going to happen.  So I have to have someone tell me early on hopefully that all the grit in the world, all the persistence in the world, won&#8217;t turn me into Spud Webb.  Find a different goal. So I think sometimes one of the problems we have is we&#8217;re not willing to help people &#8212; you know, dreams will come true if you simply try for it.  That kind of talk. It sounds really good, but it&#8217;s not entirely honest.  And I think we need to be honest about it not being honest.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Now that&#8217;s a completely reasonable assessment.  Why then would you put WH Auden on Benzedrine then in the book?  And is this sort of the worst case scenario?  Even though he ended up coming up with a number of great poems.  If we&#8217;re talking about reasonable applications of what we&#8217;re talking about here for people to find their creative roots, why would you go for these more extraordinary examples?  </p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Why I chose that in particular?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah. I&#8217;m just curious. Why did you include a Benzedrine addict? Genius as he may very well have been.</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Sure. To be honest, the reason I chose Auden is because I&#8217;ve long been an Auden fan.  I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by why you look at his most anthologized poems &#8212; and my favorite Auden poetry is actually his late poetry.  So absolutely after he weaned himself off Benzedrine, and that was a brutal process, but I actually like &#8220;In Praise of Limestone&#8221; &#8212; his later poetry &#8212; which is a little messier, a little more chaotic, a little more personal.  But if you look at his most anthologized poems, they really come from this three year window when he was really on Benzedrine, &#8220;September 1,&#8221; &#8220;In Memory of Yeats,&#8221; etcetera etcetera.  And I was interested in why that is. What allowed him to, in this narrow window, produce poems that were spare and precise and transparent and really, really popular and have resonated with people for decades. And so that&#8217;s why I chose Auden.  Both because I liked the man and I have this lingering interest in this particular phase of his career. So that&#8217;s why I chose him.  I wasn&#8217;t trying to pick an extreme example. You know, for me, it was the storytelling challenge in this chapter was &#8212; in the end, the point I&#8217;m trying to give readers is incredibly banal. And I&#8217;m sure that &#8212; I think most readers will realize that, in the end, the point of that chapter is &#8220;Sometimes you have to work really hard.&#8221;  Not the most exciting idea.  And so for me, the reason I chose Auden is cause drugs, Benzedrine, and that struck me as a slightly more interesting way to, in the end, make this point that creativity is also about hard work.  And Milton Glaser&#8217;s motto says it best.  &#8220;Art is work.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But wait a minute.  If the underlying point of the chapter is banal, then why stretch out a chapter? I&#8217;m not saying that&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Well, because that&#8217;s an important part of the creative process.  I wish I could write a book in which the whole point was &#8220;Take showers when you&#8217;re stuck.&#8221;  Get relaxed.  Which is part of the process too.  I think there&#8217;s good evidence for that.  But when you talk with creative people, and I&#8217;m trying to tell the story of creativity as I see it from talking to people in the business and from the perspectives of scientists who study it.  A big part of creative success is showing up, is putting in the work, is going after the drafts. That&#8217;s not the sexy stuff.  But that needs to be in there too.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But isn&#8217;t it your job to sex it up, Jonah? I mean, you&#8217;re a guy &#8212; we were cracking up about aerosol cheese spray, right? </p>
<p><b>Lehrer:</b> Oh, I do my best to sex it up. Which is why I begin the chapter by talking about Benzedrine.  That was my attempt to sex up a very banal chapter.  Hopefully the chapter itself isn&#8217;t banal.  The idea in it is &#8212; you know, if you&#8217;ve ever done anything worthwhile in your life, you know it takes work, right? So my challenge as a storyteller in that chapter was, gosh, I&#8217;ve got to put this in here. Because that&#8217;s a huge part of the creative process.  There&#8217;s no getting around it.  But how can I make it interesting?  I can&#8217;t just talk about hard work.  That&#8217;s a chapter I wouldn&#8217;t want to write and people wouldn&#8217;t want to read. So the way I begin it is by talking about this poet who is an incredibly talented poet.  I&#8217;m not saying that if we all take Benzedrine, we&#8217;ll pump out &#8220;September 1st, 1939.&#8221;  Having dabbled in amphetamines myself, all I got out of it was several nights of insomnia.  But I think it does, within the context of Auden, help show how this drug modulated his poetry a little bit.  </p>
<p>* &#8212; In <a href="http://www.themillions.com/2012/03/are-you-your-brain-on-jonah-lehrers-how-creativity-works.html">The Millions</a>&#8216;s comments, Lehrer responded to a lengthy criticism of <i>Imagine</i> offered by Requarth and Crist (namely, Lehrer criticizing the limitations of fMRI in a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> column, while simultaneously relying on similar data elsewhere):</p>
<blockquote><p>I honestly can’t cite a popular brain book that either 1) doesn’t cite fMRI localization studies at face value at some point or 2) engage in speculative links between neural mechanisms and complex mental phenomena. For instance, I’m currently in the midst of Eric Kandel’s wonderful new book, which has many chapters on fMRI data combined with musings on aesthetics and beauty. Is this inappropriate?</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, Our Correspondent also happened to read Kandel&#8217;s book.  In chapter 30, Kandel does cite fMRIs too.  But he doesn&#8217;t just cite fMRIs.  He is careful to write this in Chapter 30:</p>
<blockquote><p>The two techniques for measuring brain activity complement each other perfectly: EEGs, which are superior for pinpointing when an event occurred but poor at identifying where it occurred, have good temporal resolution but poor spatial resolution, whereas functional MRIs have the inverse and weaknesses.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In fairness, Lehrer, at the beginning of <I>Imagine</i>, writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>By combining both techniques &#8212; fMRI and EEG &#8212; in the same study, Beeman and Kounios were able to deconstruct the epiphany.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But inexplicably (and this is also the point of contention with Requarth and Crist), he merely applies the fMRI results in relation to jazz improvisation. Kandel did not make this slip at all in <i>The Age of Insight</i>.  The issue here is whether Lehrer, who was good enough to talk out this problem at length during this program, is omitting essential data in an effort to appeal to a popular audience. This conversation begins at the 43:44 mark in the program.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Steve Erickson is most recently the author of <i>These Dreams of You</i>. He previously appeared on <a href="http://www.edrants.com/segundo/steve-erickson-bss-180/">The Bat Segundo Show #180</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/steveerickson.jpg"><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/steveerickson.jpg" alt="" title="steveerickson" width="491" height="327" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21280" /></a></p>

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Contriving plans to join a community of one half.</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Erickson">Steve Erickson</a>)</p>
<p><b>Subjects Discussed:</b> Writing a novel around short bursts, plagiarizing the future, <i>The Sea Came In at Midnight</i>, the novel as kaleidoscope, rationale that emerges midway through writing a novel, losing 50 pages in <i>These Dreams of You</i>, not writing from notes, Zan&#8217;s tendency to hear profane words from telephone conversations, the considerable downside and formality of being dunned, fake politeness and underlying tones of contempt, not naming Obama, Kennedy, or David Bowie, Molly Bloom in <i>Ulysses</i> and Molly in <i>These Dreams of You</i>, Erickson&#8217;s commitment to the ineffable, letting a reader find her own meaning, defining a character in terms of story instead of public and historical terms, listening to David Bowie to get a sense of Berlin, Erickson&#8217;s cherrypicked version of Bowie&#8217;s Berlin Trilogy, not capitalizing American and European throughout <i>Dreams</i>, using autobiographical details for fiction, Jeanette Winterson&#8217;s <i>Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?</i>, &#8220;part fact part fiction is what life is,&#8221; dating a Stalinist, why fiction is more informed by real life, how invented details encourage a conspiracy, the dissipating honor of being true to what is true, the last refuge of a bad writer, what a four-year-old can and cannot say, bending the truth when it sounds too fictional, Kony and Mike Daisey, combating the needs for believability and readers who feel defrauded, authenticity within lies, kids and photos who disappear in <i>Dreams</i>, striking a balance between the believable and the phantasmagorical, fiction which confounds public marketeers from the outset, postmodernism&#8217;s shift to something not cool, limitations and literary possibilities, the burdens of taxonomy, living in a culture that wishes to pigeonhole, why <i>Zeroville</i> and <i>These Dreams of You</i> gravitate more toward traditional narrative, reviewers who are hostile to anything remotely unconventional, writing a novel from the collective national moment, the relationship between history and fiction, being a man &#8220;out of time,&#8221; thoughts on how a private and antisocial reading culture is increasingly socialized, having an antisocial temperament, writers who cannot remember the passages that they write, the pros and cons of book conventions, and being &#8220;a community of one.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B></p>
<p><b>Erickson:</b> We do live in a culture that wants to pigeonhole things. I don&#8217;t know whether that&#8217;s a function of late 20th century/early 21st century culture or is a function of American culture, or some combination of the two.  In Japan, for instance, they don&#8217;t seem to worry about that when it comes to my novels.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But with <i>Zeroville</i> and with <i>Dreams</i>, we have moved a little bit more toward traditional narrative.  I mean, maybe the impulse was always there.  But do you think this has just been symptomatic of what you&#8217;ve been more occupied with of late?  Fusing that traditional narrative with, say, some of these additional ideas of disappearance, of inserting words into sentences, and so forth?</p>
<p><b>Erickson:</b> Right.  Well, it&#8217;s hard for me to know.  There are still a lot of people out there who would read this novel, <i>These Dreams of You</i>, and think it&#8217;s a pretty damn unconventional novel.  They may not have read <i>Our Ecstatic Days</i> and thereby see this novel as whatever you want to call it: more accessible.  But I can tell from the reviews I&#8217;ve gotten on this novel, which have largely been somewhere between good and better than good, nonetheless there are reviewers out there who really don&#8217;t quite know what to make of even this particular novel, which I think you&#8217;ve rightly said steers a little bit toward the conventional than earlier novels.  And in the case of <i>Zeroville</i>, again, I had a strategy from the beginning, having thought about this novel for a while.  I had started the novel at one point and I was writing it differently.  And I was writing it &#8212; I don&#8217;t mean differently in terms of my earlier books.  It was written more like my earlier books.  And I stopped.  I threw it out.  Because I felt that this novel is about loving the movies, being obsessed with movies.  It should have some of the energy of a movie.  It should follow some of the narrative laws of a movie.  So you had a lot of dialogue and a lot of the story being told in external terms.  Being told in dialogue.  Being told in action.  Not a lot of motivational stuff.  The main character in that novel, we never quite know where he&#8217;s coming from.  We never know if he&#8217;s some kind of savant, or socially and mentally challenged.  We never know.  </p>
<p>In the case of this novel, I was aware at some point that, first of all, I was writing a story about a family, which I had never done.  And, secondly, I was writing a story that it became clear to me, really from the first scene, that addressed the national moment and a moment that any reader could recognize in a way that none of my other novels quite had.  Los Angeles was not submerged in a lake or covered by a sandstorm.  It was out of that opening scene of the novel, which was the real-life scene that led to writing the novel.  I merged a story that I thought would be recognizable to most readers.  And I didn&#8217;t want to completely lose that.  There are a lot of times in the novel that I think that is challenged.  That recognizability.  Or that recognition rather of the contemporary moment.  Halfway through the book, the story suddenly changes track.  But even as I was taking the reader, even as three quarters of the way through the book I knew the reader was going to be saying &#8220;Where is this thing going?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t want to lose that connection between the book and a moment of national history.  It&#8217;s a history that&#8217;s still going on.  It&#8217;s not a history of the past, but of the present.  I didn&#8217;t want to lose that connection.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But why did you feel at this point, with this novel, that you needed to respond to the national moment?  I mean, history is something, especially as it is unfolding, that one doesn&#8217;t necessarily feel obliged to respond to.  So now you&#8217;re getting into questions of, well, is it possible that you are giving into the reader somewhat?  In light of the conditions that we were describing earlier.  Where did this need to respond to the 2008 climate come from?</p>
<p><b>Erickson:</b> Well, I think it was completely personal. I was sitting on the sofa watching the election in November 2008 &#8212; Election Night &#8212; with my black daughter.  And I knew this was a singular moment for me.  And I knew this was a singular moment for her.  And it was a singular moment for the country.  And it was one of those cases where the story made itself manifest to the point of screaming at me.  Here&#8217;s a story that not many other people are in a position to tell, given the circumstances of their lives as those circumstances were coinciding with the circumstances of the country.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Sure. I wanted to actually go back into the intertextuality within the novel.  You have this character &#8212; J. Willkie Brown, the Brit who invites Zan over to give the lecture on &#8220;The Novel as a Literary Form Facing Obsolescence in the Twenty-First Century, Or the Evolution of Pure History to Fiction.&#8221;  Now if we call journalism the first draft of history, it&#8217;s interesting that you also describe that &#8220;Zan&#8217;s single triumph over Brown is that, in time-honored journalistic tradition, the world-famous journalist always longed to write a novel.&#8221;  It&#8217;s also interesting that Zan must return to his American roots: the original British origin point, right?  To collect his thoughts on how he has dealt with words.  And I&#8217;m wondering how much this relationship between history and pure fiction is predicated on Anglo-American relations.  Can any novel or any life entirely deflect &#8220;the crusade against gray&#8221; that you mention?</p>
<p><b>Erickson:</b> The crusade against what?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> The crusade against gray.  It&#8217;s when you&#8217;re describing Ronnie Jack Flowers and the specific content of his views.  I wanted to talk about him, if it&#8217;s possible too.  </p>
<p><b>Erickson:</b> Yeah.  That&#8217;s a big question.  Early on, Zan wonders &#8212; or actually an omniscient narrator wonders by way of Zan &#8212; if this is the sort of history that puts novelists out of business.  And I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve got a sweeping cultural answer for all this.  At some point early on in my life, well before the 21st century, I knew that I was a man out of time.  I knew that the great art form of the 20th century was film.  And I still believe that.  And at the same time, popular music was rendering other media obsolete or, in terms of relevance, was usurping all of these other forms.  But my talent and my temperament is to write novels.  You know, and I should probably have been born fifty years earlier.  And so as much as I would love to convince myself that I am operating in the central cultural arena of the time, I know I&#8217;m not.  I know that fiction becomes not a fringe form, because too many people still read.  And not even a secondary form.  But a form that becomes more private.  That is not shared with the culture at large.  I mean, people read novels in private.  Whereas they still tend to watch movies in public.  Even as we watch more and more movies by ourselves at home.  Even as they tend to respond still to music in public, whether they&#8217;re in the car with their sound system.  So it&#8217;s just&#8230;it&#8217;s what I do.  And it&#8217;s what I&#8217;m stuck doing.  And the relevance or significance of fiction in relationship to history or journalism is almost beside the point for someone like me.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So working in a cultural medium that is below the mass culture omnipresence is the best way for you to negotiate these issues of history and fact?</p>
<p><b>Erickson:</b> Well, I think&#8230;</p>
<p><B>Correspondent:</b> A more dignified way?</p>
<p><b>Erickson:</b> No, I think, Ed, it&#8217;s the only way I know.  That&#8217;s all. I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s the best way or the more dignified way.  I mean, I can&#8217;t rationalize it in those terms.  In a way, I would like to be able to.  You know, at some point early on, I thought a lot about filmmaking.  When I was in college, I was actually a film student.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Erickson:</b> But I recognized at some point that, for better or worse, whatever talent I had &#8212; I felt I had some talent writing fiction.  I had no idea whether I&#8217;d have any talent making movies.  But perhaps even more importantly, temperamentally fiction is the province of a loner.  Fiction is about locking yourself up in a room and having as little social interaction with other people as possible, and living in this world that you&#8217;ve created.  There is nothing collaborative about it in the way that film is, or even making music is.  So the answer to your question is entirely personal.  It&#8217;s entirely personal.  It&#8217;s what I was just meant to do.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You just have an anti-collaborative temperament.</p>
<p><b>Erickson:</b> Absolutely I do.  I mean, it&#8217;s more than that.  I have an antisocial temperament.  I teach in a writing program back in California and I have a lot of problems, actually, with writing programs and writing workshops.  And I tell my students this.  I say, the thing is, the paradox is that a writing program socializes what is really an antisocial endeavor.  There&#8217;s something very strange about shutting yourself off from the rest of society to create this world or reality that&#8217;s completely yours and that you don&#8217;t share with anybody until it&#8217;s done, and even then you share it on a very private basis.  If someone&#8217;s sitting across the room, and they&#8217;re reading one of my novels, I&#8217;m going to leave.  You know, I don&#8217;t want to be there.  Because even though I know that the public has complete access, what I did still remains so private to me, I don&#8217;t want to be around when somebody&#8217;s reading my work.  Except for cases like this, I don&#8217;t especially want to have casual conversations about it.  Perhaps strangest of all, and I&#8217;ve heard a number of other writers say this &#8212; I heard Jonathan Lethem say it a few weeks ago &#8212; people will come up to me, for instance, and ask me about a section of a book and I have no recollection of what they&#8217;re talking about.  I have no recollection of writing it.  I have no recollection of what I was thinking when I wrote it.  I often have to ask them to show me what it is.  Because I was utterly immersed in that, and then it&#8217;s done, and I need to leave it behind.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Running away from people who are reading your books.  I mean, does this create any problems for you to go about your life?  If you&#8217;re interested in the types of things that Steve Erickson readers are likely to be interested in, this could create some intriguing social problems.  </p>
<p><b>Erickson:</b> Well, as uncomfortable as it may make me to be in the same room, I would love to tell you that my life is littered with scenes of people reading my books everywhere I go.  But that&#8217;s not the case.  So it doesn&#8217;t happen that often.  But I don&#8217;t have a lot of conversations with people who are casual friends about my work.  And I don&#8217;t want to.  So in that sense, the antisociability &#8212; is that the right word for it?  The antisociability of the writing and the work, it does go on.  It bleeds outside the lines of the life of that work, and it bleeds into areas of my other life, where I don&#8217;t, even though I&#8217;m always a writer, I don&#8217;t want to be interacting with people as a writer.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So is there any place for community?  An increasing term used, I find, in writing.  We have a &#8220;literary community&#8221; and so forth.  Is this a logical extension of what some people find in, say, AWP or MFA workshops?  Is there any possible place for community for you?  Or that you find of value?</p>
<p><b>Erickson:</b> For me, not especially.  For other writers, perhaps.  And I&#8217;ve been to AWP.  And I&#8217;ve been to book conventions.  The <i>LA Times</i> Festival of Books.  And I can even drive a certain amount of pleasure for 24 hours to meet other writers. But the only community that gets any writing done is a community of one.  And at the point that it becomes too much a salon, then I check out of it.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So for you, being antisocial is the truest temperament for an artistic writer.</p>
<p><b>Erickson:</b> Well, I don&#8217;t know how you can be anything else.  Certainly at the moment that when you&#8217;re doing the work.  For me, that&#8217;s true, yeah.  I can&#8217;t speak for other writers.</p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B></p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Your timing is quite impeccable.  Because I&#8217;m talking with you the day after Representative Issa to basically not allow a woman to testify at the all-male hearing on contraception.  I&#8217;m talking with you a week after <a href="http://www.edrants.com/komen-for-the-cowards-betraying-breast-cancer/">Komen for the Cure initially pulled its funds</a> from Planned Parenthood, saying, &#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t support any organization that is under congressional review,&#8221; and then changing this to be &#8220;Well, we can&#8217;t support any organization that is referring out its mammograms.&#8221;  So I gotta say, maybe this might be the opportune time to discuss how we got to this point in American political history.  How does this constantly wavering excuse fit into the political strategy of the religious right and the forces of what you identify as the sexual counterrevolution? How did this come into play?</p>
<p><b>Cohen:</b> Well, I&#8217;m an evil genius.  And when I came up with this idea a couple years ago, I planned for these hearings to take place.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Aha.</p>
<p><b>Cohen:</b> No, seriously, the first line of my first chapter is &#8220;Perhaps if the pill hadn&#8217;t been invented, American politics would have turned out very differently.&#8221;  And at the time, it was kind of a literary allusion.  A way to get some history down.  So what we&#8217;re seeing is really the logical end point of what I call the sexual counterrevolution.  <i>Delirium</i> tells the story about how a small group of reactionaries who want to control sex have hijacked American politics.  And what we&#8217;re seeing this week, and last week, is really the essence of the Republican Party.  The id of the Republican Party coming out to play because they are so intoxicated with the power that they got in the last elections.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes.  Well, the id wasn&#8217;t always there.  As you point out in the book, I mean, it&#8217;s become increasingly id-like over the years.  What of the sensible conservative idea? What of the rational reactionary?</p>
<p><b>Cohen:</b> The sensible conservative ideas  Back in the &#8217;60s and the &#8217;70&#8242;s, the Republican Party was the small government/personal freedom party.  They actually meant it.  They were better on women&#8217;s rights.  They were better on sexual freedom really.  Even before the sexual revolution, the Republican Party was better.  But what happened was, with the sexual revolution and feminism and gay rights, a group of people &#8212; surprisingly mostly women &#8212; were appalled, freaked out about all these changes and sexual life and women&#8217;s roles and gays coming out of the closet.  And they organized on a grassroots level against these changes.  And so they went up against the Equal Rights Amendment.  And they won.  And then they went after publicly financed child care.  And they won.  And then they took civil rights away from gays.  And they won.  And then they methodically started taking over the Republican Party from local, state, and county committees on to the school board until 2008, when they had one of their own, Sarah Palin, on the presidential ticket.  </p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/nancycohen.jpg" alt="" title="nancycohen" width="252" height="309" align="right" /><b>Correspondent:</b> Let&#8217;s get into this.  You point out that George McGovern is one of the key figures responsible for Democratic timidity in relation to the sexual counterrevolution.  You suggest that McGovern losing his temper, telling a voter to kiss his ass &#8212; that was one factor.  The really terrible decision he made involving ordering milk with a liver sandwich in a Jewish deli.  Not exactly the smartest choice.  There was also this idea that McGovern, because he encompassed this cultural radicalism and failed, that this was what encouraged the Democrats to backpedal.  So I&#8217;m wondering to what degree is this political temperament and to what degree is this, I suppose, a cultural radicalism that Democrats are afraid of?  I mean, 2004, you have Howard Dean&#8217;s famous scream.  And even before that, everybody was like, &#8220;Wow, this guy&#8217;s finally standing up for progressivism.&#8221;  I mean, it seems to me that if you have a situation where the Democratic presidential candidates are limited in what they can say and how they can act, that this kind of progressive idea of, say, supporting something like the Equal Rights Amendment, you&#8217;re almost not allowed to do that.  So how did this state come to be and what solutions do we have for the future?  </p>
<p><b>Cohen:</b> Good question.  So the sexual counterrevolution has affected both parties.  And in the Democratic Party, it&#8217;s really about their overreaction to every time they lose.  And the way it goes back to McGovern&#8217;s election is that they convinced themselves that the reason McGovern lost by a landslide is because of all the gays and feminists and multiculturalists that he associated himself with.  And so there&#8217;s this idea that Democratic progressives alienate mainstream America.  Mainstream America is conservative.  That idea is a fixation of the Democrats.  But if you look at the studies of elections and you look at the studies of public opinion, it&#8217;s not true at all.  Democrats have actually won elections for being the more culturally progressive party on women&#8217;s issues and gay issues and race issues.  And so Democrats, I believe, would actually do better if they did embrace their voters&#8217; live and let live attitude about people&#8217;s personal lives and stood on principle for civil rights for every American.  But Democrats are timid and they have convinced themselves that they lose on this issue.  So it would be good for them to start to recognize that it&#8217;s a winning issue.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But what data are they using?  I mean, it can&#8217;t just be McGovern that&#8217;s the linchpin for this.</p>
<p><b>Cohen:</b> No. So what they generally look at is exit polls and focus groups.  And to get a little wonky here&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Sure.  Feel free.</p>
<p><b>Cohen:</b> What I looked at in the books so that no one else really has to &#8212; except maybe Democratic strategists can start looking at this stuff &#8212; is a lot of research by political scientists and sociologists that do regressions of public opinion polling and elections, and conclusively show that all the things we think are true &#8212; you know, that the white working-class man is an economic populist, but a social conservative?  Wrong.  It&#8217;s the reverse.  He&#8217;s pro-choice and doesn&#8217;t like the Democrats&#8217;s economic policies.  That Bush won the election on gay marriage?  Wrong.  No evidence.  That Democrats lose elections for being pro choice?  Wrong.  Clinton won the election in 1992 on a huge upsurge of pro-choice women and pro-choice men.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You challenge Thomas Frank&#8217;s ideas in <i>What&#8217;s the Matter with Kansas?</i> by saying that he was condescending in believing that Kansans were duped into voting for more right-wing candidates and so forth.  How do we go ahead and factor in, oh say, scenarios like Scott Brown in Massachusetts?  Which is very much a scenario in which arrogance and technocratic approaches tend to destroy a Democratic seat.  I mean, how does this play into the sexual counterrevolution?  And how do you reconcile this, what seems to me, legitimate Thomas Frank idea with this?</p>
<p><b>Cohen:</b> So I do criticize Tom Frank for being condescending.  But I also criticize him for having no empirical evidence for his argument.  And that&#8217;s the main case.  His idea is premised that, one, the working class doesn&#8217;t vote for Democrats.  They actually do.  It&#8217;s premised on the idea that Kansas has been some bulwark of Democratic politics.  It&#8217;s actually been a bulwark of right-wing evangelical fundamentalism.  So there&#8217;s a number of other factual errors.  I actually went into the book assuming that I was going to extend Tom Frank&#8217;s thesis.  And I found that it actually went back to this anti-McGovern idea and discovered that there was no evidence for it.  And that&#8217;s when I started moving in this other direction on the sexual counter-revolution.  So an election like Scott Brown&#8217;s, a lot of health care money went in there.  A lot of the people that they say are white working-class populist men are actually middle income or better off people.  So what you have in a lot of these elections, like 2010 and the Scott Brown election, is you have very low turnout from poor Democratic groups.  Young people.  Single women.  Low income people.  And so when the exit polls do show a surge of white men, they often don&#8217;t figure out, well, where are these men economically?  And I do agree that the smugness of the Democratic candidate in that election.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Who we don&#8217;t want to name. (<i>laughs</i>)  And you didn&#8217;t name in the book and I won&#8217;t name on this show. </p>
<p><b>Cohen:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Traitor!</p>
<p><b>Cohen:</b> I think she&#8217;s probably reformed.  So I do think that was a case of a sense of the Democrats being entitled to a seat and didn&#8217;t really see this both right-wing and corporate money coming into that election that year.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> If Tom Frank is so wrong with his evidence, then why is that book constantly cited?  Why over many decades does the idea of the McGovernik still hold within the Democrats?  I think that&#8217;s the thing I really don&#8217;t get.  If all of the scientific evidence says otherwise, then why are serious Democratic leaders going by this?</p>
<p><b>Cohen:</b> Well, actually, serious Democratic leaders aren&#8217;t going by it anymore.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> It only took them several decades. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Cohen:</b> Yes, well, they read the polls and they read exit polls and they do their own political polling.  They don&#8217;t necessarily read the academic literature.  But the key person who articulated this idea of the McGovernik, about the Reagan Democrat: Stanley Greenberg, who I hear is a wonderful man and has done a lot of good work for progressive causes, was one of the people who kept this idea alive.  And he runs a polling company.  And he uses his own polls.  So just after, since 2008, he&#8217;s basically said, &#8220;You know what? The Reagan Democrats aren&#8217;t the key voting bloc anymore.  Democrats need to go for this multiethnic, cosmopolitan, progressive base and they&#8217;ll pick up enough of these white working-class men to win elections.  So it is Tom Frank &#8212; and I haven&#8217;t read his new book, so I don&#8217;t know how he&#8217;s amended his thesis.  But there has been a shift among the leadership of the Democratic Party.  And I think you see with Obama not defending DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act], right?  Saying, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s unconstitutional.&#8221;  This is a sign that they&#8217;re starting to see that good principles are good politics.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maggie Anderson is most recently the author of <i>Our Black Year: Our Family&#8217;s Quest to Buy Black in America&#8217;s Racially Divided Economy</i>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/maggieanderson.jpg"><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/maggieanderson.jpg" alt="" title="maggieanderson" width="530" height="396" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21179" /></a></p>

<p>[<b>PROGRAM NOTE:</B> The universe did nearly everything in its power to prevent Ms. Anderson from appearing on The Bat Segundo Show.  On the day that I was scheduled to meet Ms. Anderson in New York, I suffered from an acute and especially debilitating case of gastrointestinal poisoning. I was forced, much to my great dismay, to cancel our meeting at the last minute. Nevertheless, I felt that the book's subject matter was important.  So I made a rare exception to my "in person only" rule and talked with Ms. Anderson over Skype.   But then <i>this</i> appointment was delayed -- in large part because the universe conspired with similar health interventions against Ms. Anderson's family.  I am pleased to report that we did end up talking and that all parties are hale and hearty.  And while the subsequent conversation was a fun and fruitful one, I should also note that Skype sent out an inconsistent signal for much of the conversation.  My apologies to Ms. Anderson and the listeners for any lapse in quality.]</p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B> </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You are responsible for a rather amazing idea called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment_Experiment">the Empowerment Experiment</a>, which you document in this book, in which you spent the entire year buying from nothing but black-owned businesses, frequenting them and so forth. Just to get the ball rolling here, I want to discuss why this is necessary.  You point out in the book that there were 6,339 African-American owned and/or operated grocery stores in the United States in the early decades of the 20th century.  And then, by the time we get to the new millennium, only 19 African American owned grocery stores existed in the U.S. So a number of questions come to mind.  First off, what specific figures are you relying on?  Is this from the 2002 Economic Census?  What ultimately accounts for this dramatic decline?</p>
<p><b>Anderson:</b> Well, the numbers are so important to us.  And we&#8217;ve got to let your listeners know that we fashioned this as an experiment.  It was, of course, a stand.  But we really wanted these important numbers to be injected into the national dialogue.  Those numbers.  How we used to have so many businesses in the country in our community.  We had hotel chains, department stores, hardware stores, drugstores.  We don&#8217;t have any of that now.  Grocery stores.  And that when we have those businesses, our community didn&#8217;t suffer.  We didn&#8217;t have the high unemployment.  Our kids weren&#8217;t choosing gangs over college.  We didn&#8217;t have all this drug abuse and violence and recidivism.  So we really wanted to bear out that correlation.  That when we had strong black-owned businesses, our community didn&#8217;t suffer.  So if we can find a way to do little things to bring some of those businesses back, maybe we can counter the social crises that disproportionately impact our community.  We wanted to show the numbers.  The big number that we wanted to talk about was our $1 trillion in buying power and that less than 6% of that makes it way back to the black community.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blackunemployment.jpg" alt="" title="blackunemployment" width="400" height="300" align="right" /><b>Anderson:</b> If we can just get a little bit more of our own buying power to be recycled in our own communities, maybe we can bring those jobs numbers up.  The other number is that black businesses are, by far, the greatest private employer of black people.  Black unemployment, we know, is three times the national average of our white counterparts.  Highest among any ethnic group.  And in some places like Birmingham and Cleveland, we&#8217;re at black unemployment like 15, 16%. So maybe if we start supporting more black businesses that employ black people, we can stop black unemployment.  So it was really just about making sure the conversation about the black situation in America is thorough and comprehensive.  We can&#8217;t just keep talking about black unemployment and then not talk about black buying power and the fact that black businesses employ people and that none of our buying power is going to black businesses.  So the numbers that we depended on &#8212; to get back to your question &#8212; you know, it&#8217;s just kind of known in our community how we don&#8217;t support each other.  How if you walk up and down the street in a black neighborhood, none of the businesses there are black-owned except for funeral parlors, barber shops, and the braid salons.  It&#8217;s just kind of known that most of the products on the shelves, none of the retailers in our community, none of the franchises are black.  So we just kind of know that and joke about it.  It hurts, but we just accept it.  But it&#8217;s so hard to find data to bear that out.  My roommate jokes about it.  But we did find an interesting study &#8212; I think it was an economist, John Wray.  Who did a study based out of DC that proved this horrible statistic about how long the dollar lives in different ethnic communities.*  This statistic is used a lot in this conversation when people <a href="http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_4184.shtml">talk about &#8220;leakage,&#8221;</a> economic leakage, recycling wealth in minority communities, that kind of stuff. This is a well-known statistic.  That in the Asian community, the dollar lives close to 28 days.  In the Jewish community, I think it was 19 to 21 days.  Hispanic communities: 7 days.  But for black people?  The dollar in the black community lasts six hours.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Anderson:</b> And it&#8217;s like, no wonder we live at the bottom!  So we&#8217;re just so frustrated.  And no one talks about that six hours.  Because if you want to talk about the six hours, then you&#8217;re basically saying that all of these horrible things happen in the black community as a reflection of our propensity and our potential.  Not a byproduct of how there&#8217;s a lack of support from black consumers &#8212; it&#8217;s our fault! &#8212; or black businesses.  Sorry about the long-winded answer.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh no.</p>
<p><b>Anderson:</b> I can&#8217;t leave that out. It&#8217;s such an open-ended&#8230;</p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/twowomen.jpg" alt="" title="twowomen" width="450" height="302" align="right" /><b>Correspondent:</b> I know. No, this is all very good.  And there&#8217;s a load of threads to start from here. Actually, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar &#8212; <a href="http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/10068/1041225-84.stm">there was a study in 2010</a>.  A rather alarming study from the Oakland-based Insight Center for Community Economic Development, which revealed that the median wealth of a single white woman in the prime of her working years &#8212; roughly 35 to 49 &#8212; was $42,600.  And the median wealth for a single black woman was only $5!</p>
<p><b>Anderson:</b> Yes!  Yes!  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar.  </p>
<p><b>Anderson:</b> I&#8217;m onto that one.  I&#8217;ve heard about that. That&#8217;s just &#8212; man! The one that really blows me away.  There&#8217;s the other one where I think we&#8217;re at 3% transferable wealth or whatever the definition of wealth.  3% compared to the white purse.  [<b>NOTE:</B> I believe Ms. Anderson is referring to <a href="www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/.../concentration200110.pdf">Arthur Kennickell's "A Rolling Tide."</a> (PDF)  The economist revealed that African-Americans had less mean wealth than white non-Hispanics.]  But that thing about the single black woman, that&#8217;s ridiculous. I mean, we&#8217;ve been here 400 years.  We have a black president now.  We have folks like me.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Anderson:</b> We have living manifestations of the American dream at work.  You know that my family&#8217;s an immigrant family.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Anderson:</b> You know, we have all of this and we still have that.  And it&#8217;s going to be hard to make that kind of number a fair number.  It&#8217;s going to be really hard.  But at least, if everyday consumers like me were to try and find the businesses that were going to employ that woman or give her a fair wage or give her community a chance and invest in her community instead of just making money from that community and taking it away, maybe we can do something about that number.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And the statistics actually get slightly better when you account for marriage or cohabitation.  The white woman has a median wealth of $167,500 and the black woman has $31,500.  So better than $5.  But still really troubling.  I guess the question I have, since we&#8217;re talking about the idea of a black dollar not going so far, what do you think ultimately accounts for this failure to have the wealth reinvested in the community?  In black neighborhoods?  How can they be expected to invest their wealth in any concentrated matter?  I mean, what are the underlying issues here?  I&#8217;m curious.</p>
<p><b>Anderson:</b> Right.  And it&#8217;s so funny.  Because when people just hear about the essence of our experiment &#8212; black families say they&#8217;re only going to support black businesses &#8212; there&#8217;s accusations of racism.  And people will assume that the book is this thing of taking it to the Man.  And getting back at Charlie. And all that stuff.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Getting back at Charlie. (<I>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/bugerking1970s.jpg" alt="" title="bugerking1970s" width="400" height="519" align="right" /><b>Anderson:</b> The white man Charlie.  But anyway, the book is really &#8212; if I&#8217;m yelling at anyone, it&#8217;s at black consumers.  Because there&#8217;s a lot of history here that contributes to the bad situation we&#8217;re in.  I&#8217;ll be really quick.  A lot of it has to do with integration.  Of course, we love what integration did in this country.  Of course, we fought for it.  But it had some really negative impact.  Some deleterious impact into the black economy, if you will.  Because we&#8217;re forced to, because we&#8217;re segregated, we built up our own businesses. We had a strong sense of entrepreneurship in our community.  And we recycled our wealth.  So that was just the fact.  That was the way it was.  And the University of Wisconsin <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/business/employment-of-black-men-drops-drastically-tf3tg7m-137932723.html">just did a study</a>** that showed in 2009, when there was over 50% black unemployment in Milwaukee, in the same area, where there used to be black businesses flourishing in the 1950s before integration, there was less than 7% unemployment.  So it really bears out that when we have the businesses where black people work, black people are employed.  So after integration, we were so anxious to be enfranchised.  We were so happy to have that opportunity to shop at Woolworth, to go to Walgreen&#8217;s, that we did it in droves.  And it was just kind of our way of saying, &#8220;Yeah!  We&#8217;re going to show you that our money is just as good as white people&#8217;s money and we&#8217;re going to show you how important we are and how equal we are by spending as much money with you as we can!&#8221;  And in so doing, we kind of abandoned our would-be Woolworth&#8217;s, which were already providing quality goods and services in the community.  All of our consumers just left those local black businesses that helped our community shine to go out to these big corporations where we were denied the right to shop before.  So that was the first punch.  And then the second punch came in.  Because these corporations started seeing the value of the black consumer dollar.  So they started to market to us very positively.  Another term that I&#8217;ll bring up, which is kind of funny.  We used to say &#8220;colored on&#8221; at one point.  Colored on.  We were so excited if GM were to show a black family coming out of a house, driving their Cadillac to the family vacation.  Or McDonald&#8217;s, where you&#8217;d have a black family enjoying a black family meal.  We were so happy when we saw that and that was the best way for them to market to us.  And we returned that honor with our dollar, with our loyalty.  So that was the second punch.  They started marketing to us more aggressively.  And we started spending more money with them, with their businesses.  And then the third punch was they started to recruit us.  So when I was coming up &#8212; I&#8217;m 40 &#8212; so in the &#8217;70s, when I was coming up, the big deal for black mothers, for black parents, for black grandparents, was for me that kind of shining star, that smart kid that hoped to get out of the ghetto, was for me to find a great job at a big white company.  That was the goal.  It wasn&#8217;t like with our Asian counterparts, even our Hispanic counterparts, to continuing the family business, to start a business, to stay in the community.  No.  It wasn&#8217;t that.  It was get out and do so by getting that great job.  So the would-be entrepreneurs or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Talented_Tenth">Talented Tenth</a>, if you remember that. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Anderson:</b> We didn&#8217;t do our Talented Tenth duty.  We left the community and we gave all our talent to big corporations.  All of these things contributed to the lack of support for black business and our lack of entrepreneurship in the community.  The big deal is to get a good job, not be an entrepreneur.  So the entrepreneurs we do have don&#8217;t have the capital or the training to compete.  So we can only survive in the industries where no one else can do it better. And that&#8217;s by braiding hair, cutting black hair, and providing funeral services in our community.  So that&#8217;s where we can still have a stronghod.  Even in black hair, in beauty supplies.  Even in all that kind of stuff, we&#8217;ve lost those industries.  That was kind of the fourth punch when immigrant groups basically started to leverage this wonderful phenomenon of a whole class of people that loves to spend money outside our community.  They set up shop in our communities.  Not racist.  Not trying to steal our wealth.  But they set up shop there and did well there.  And now we&#8217;re upset because we can&#8217;t find quality black businesses in our own neighborhoods when basically we invited the intrusion by not supporting the black businesses we did have.  So all of this has led to the demise that we have now.  So some of it, yes.  Some of it, our racist history.  A lot of it has to do with our consumers, our people, kind of seeing our own businesses in a negative way.  It&#8217;s a real difficult thing to talk about outside the black community.  It&#8217;s just kind of cultural.  But the definition is another term.  White man&#8217;s ice is colder.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Anderson:</b> Why go to a black business when you can go to a white business?  The way we show that we&#8217;re equal is by buying Polo and Hennessy.  By living in the white suburbs.  That&#8217;s how we demonstrate our equality.  Not by buying black products and supporting local black businesses.  I know it&#8217;s kind of a disgusting thing to say, but that&#8217;s the truth.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, as an effort to unpack much of what you just said &#8212; for example, in this book, among the businesses that you include in the Empowerment Experiment are, for example, a black-owned Quiznos.  But my understanding is that a white guy named Rich Schaden is the principal shareholder and that he and his company have this history of <a href="http://www.westword.com/2009-03-05/news/rick-schaden-accused-of-ripping-off-franchisees-is-back-at-the-helm-of-quiznos/">ripping off numerous franchise owners</a>. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with the Quiznos franchise holder, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/24/business/24quiznos.html?pagewanted=all">Bhupinder Baber</a>.  He killed himself over this.  So, yes, I agree that a black-owned Quiznos, it may indeed hire more black employees. But if the parent company is exploiting its franchise owners, I&#8217;m wondering if this cycle of exploitation has a negative impact on a black neighborhood or a black community.  Shouldn&#8217;t one also consider the independent nature of a business as well?  How does a black-owned Quiznos help a community more than, say, an independent family restaurant?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/poload.png" alt="" title="poload" width="368" height="150" align="left" /><b>Anderson:</b> Right.  And this is a huge point that I have to contend with when I push this supply diversity franchise rediversity message into the community.  And here&#8217;s how it goes when I&#8217;m talking to black folk who I&#8217;m trying to get to support black businesses.  It should not be that tough of a fight, but it is.  When I say this to them, they come at me, generally with stuff like &#8220;Well, we tried to Karriem [Beyah]&#8216;s grocery store.  He didn&#8217;t have the thing that we wanted.&#8221;  Or it wasn&#8217;t like going to our Jewel, the big grocery store chain around here.  Or you can go to this black franchise.  But I didn&#8217;t see a bunch of black employees there. Or how do I know Quiznos is a good franchise to be supporting?  So I get a bit of a challenge.  Then I say, &#8220;Well, you know what?  How is that?  I mean, what are you doing now?&#8221;  Basically, we&#8217;re just out there supporting anybody.  Not thinking about what the businesses are doing for us.  Polo.  I mean, Polo blew the lid off of black consumers.  We have black Polo parties that we have for our kids.  I mean, it&#8217;s just ridiculous how addicted we are to the Polo brand.  I have nothing against Polo Ralph Lauren.  But I did have a friend who works writing for the CFO of Polo, and I asked her to do some research for me.  She&#8217;s a conscious consumer like me.  HBS grad.  Very well connected in the company.  And she thinks they talked with the marketing folks, the procuring folks, everybody about buyer diversity.  Do you do business?  How do you invest in the black community?  We have so much money coming in from the black community.  And their answer to me was, &#8220;Well, our label comes out of Indonesia.&#8221;  And it&#8217;s unbelievable.  That&#8217;s the best we can do to reciprocate the loyalty that the black community&#8217;s giving you? So it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah. Maybe.&#8221; And you&#8217;re totally right about the Quiznos thing.  But the first answer to them is, &#8220;But you&#8217;re supporting Polo.  And it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re stopping in support of Polo.&#8221;  And I&#8217;m not saying don&#8217;t support Polo.  But if you&#8217;re so discriminating with how you spend your money, there&#8217;s a lot of things that we shouldn&#8217;t be doing that we ought to be doing. </p>
<p>* &#8212; This study can also be found in Brooke Stephens&#8217;s <i>Taking Dollars and Making Sense: A Wealth Building Guide for African-Americans.</i> There seems to be no online version of this.</p>
<p>** &#8212; After <a href="http://www4.uwm.edu/ced/publications/black-employment_2012.pdf">reviewing the study</a> (PDF), I believe Maggie&#8217;s slightly off &#8212; that is, if she&#8217;s referring to the Marc Levine findings from January. But black unemployment is absolutely a problem a Milwaukee.  There was a huge hit in the last several decades.  1970: 84.8% employment rate for metro Milwaukee black men in their prime working years.  By 2010, that figure had fallen to 52.7%. Here&#8217;s the important paragraph from Levine&#8217;s report:</p>
<blockquote><p>The city of Milwaukee, where almost 90% of the region’s black males live, has lost over three-quarters of its industrial jobs since the 1960s. As Table 5 suggests, this manufacturing decline has disproportionately affected the employment prospects of African American males. In 1970 54.3 percent of Milwaukee black males were employed in 1970 as factory operatives, more than double the white percentage. By 2009, only 14.7 percent of black males were working in Milwaukee factories, about the same percentage as white males. By 2009, in fact, even though working-age black males outnumbered Hispanic males by 55 percent in Milwaukee, there were more Hispanic male production workers (7,200) than black male production workers (4,842) in the region, a sign of the degree to which manufacturing is no longer the bulwark it has been historically for the Milwaukee black male working class.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Seeking pragmatic forms of belief.</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> <a href="http://www.alaindebotton.com/">Alain de Botton</a></p>
<p><b>Subjects Discussed:</b> The difficulties of turning other people onto enthusiastic concepts, why religion draws extremists on all sides of the debate, attempting to fight capitalism through a new belief system, the Agape Restaurant, <a href="http://www.edrants.com/segundo/susan-cain-bss-430/">Susan Cain&#8217;s <i>Quiet</i></a>, including introverts within community-based ideas, the Day of Atonement, mandatory voting in Australia, attempts to reach people who are not inclined to forgive, voluntary mediators, a temple for atheism, the need to feel small, feeling small through extra human forces, the power of awe, aesthetic uses of science, being awed by the city and knowledge, the mass appeal of Proust and Tarkovsky, <i>South Park</i>, competing notions of awe and boredom applied to the same idea, religion as a populist medium, the upside of vulgarity, high and low culture, Tarkovsky as a joke high culture figure, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins#Pride">superbia</a>, egotistical notions in getting to know someone through prosaic conversational questions, social status as a way of fending off other people, dependence, religious distinction through coherent brand identities, role models, reductionism and marketing, responding to architecture, touching people through their senses, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/jun2007/id20070618_505580.htm">São Paulo&#8217;s prohibition of advertising</a>, religion&#8217;s reliance upon advertising, making a public claim for certain states of the soul, the Kony 2012 campaign, the pros and cons of shame, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/alaindebotton/statuses/178612516170121218">how humans can be more interesting than a smartphone</a>, how technology forces humans to relearn essential concepts, and how human life is in permanent competition with superficial biases. </p>
<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B></p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Your books very often have this moment where you describe a very funny yet sometimes socially awkward encounter where you attempt to impart some concept or some amazing idea in your head that you are excited about and that the person who is receiving this intelligence often expresses some dismay.  I think of, for example, your long speech at the Mojave Airport Graveyard in <i>The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work</i> or your attempt to pitch yourself as a writer-in-flight to the British Airways head honcho Willie Walsh.  Obviously, I think, based off of this, you are aware that some of your excitement is being misperceived.  So in light of trying to consider a scenario along the lines of what you&#8217;re preaching in <i>Religion for Atheists</i> &#8212; where you&#8217;re trying to have certain concepts stick in other people&#8217;s heads and religion is more fraught, more sensitive than the norm &#8212; how do you get through to these people?  I mean, if you&#8217;re aware of these things, you&#8217;re probably going to have moments even more extreme than the two I&#8217;ve cited.  So what of this predicament?  How do you go ahead and convert these people over to your side?</p>
<p><b>De Botton:</b> Well, I suppose, when it comes to religion, you&#8217;ve got extremists on both sides of the debate.  You&#8217;ve got religious believers who are very fervent in their belief and think that anything else, anything besides full conversion to their creed is not acceptable.  And at the same time, you have very fierce atheists who think that any involvement with religion is evil and to be resisted.  And I&#8217;ve tried to write a book that&#8217;s somewhere in the middle of those two.  It&#8217;s a book that tries to say that, as an atheist, you can nevertheless engage with aspects of religion.  And indeed those aspects may be very enriching for your understanding of secular society.  So it&#8217;s a weird book.  Because it really is fairly in the middle of something that most people would consider to be incompatible, which is atheism and religion.  It&#8217;s arguing that atheism should engage in, and can engage, with aspects of religion.  And it can be shot at from both sides.  But I also think there is a silent majority that is actually in sympathy with the approach I&#8217;m taking.  But that is a silent majority that don&#8217;t have the pulpits.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But if the movers and shakers, such as the man at the graveyard, require twenty dollar bills to advance things, I&#8217;m wondering how you can instill these ideas into a new belief system if everything is centered around commerce, centered around capitalism, centered around the need to get ahead, centered around some unusual man asking to see the airplanes and so forth.  I mean, this, I think, is one of the interesting takeaways I get from your book.  So how do you solve this?</p>
<p><b>De Botton:</b> Well, I think that the proposals that I make are aiming to get secular capitalist people in secular capitalist societies to rethink their positions on things.  I&#8217;m arguing that there are certain things missing from modern society.  Though we&#8217;ve been fantastically good at delivering material improvements and supplying material needs in the developed world, there are some other needs, which you might call spiritual &#8212; and I use that word without any supernatural implications.  But spiritual, psychological needs have been left slightly unattended.  I&#8217;m thinking here of things like our need for community, our need for moral structure, our need for certain guidance through the challenges of life.  These things have not been so well done by the secular world and I&#8217;m arguing that one of the ways which we can plug some of the gaps in the secular world is to look back at the lessons of religion.  And my book is full of examples, of concepts, of practices, of rituals that one might rescue or at least learn from as atheists in a secular world.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, there&#8217;s one idea &#8212; the Agape Restaurant &#8212; where you have different types of people sitting at the same table, sharing their stories and so forth.  But I&#8217;m wondering what safeguards you have in place for people who are shy or who are introverted.  There&#8217;s a new book by Susan Cain called <i>Quiet</i> that gets into the amount of social energy one has to exert if one is introverted or even ambiverted.  And so this also leads me to ask &#8212; well, if I go into a situation and I&#8217;m asked to share my most intimate secrets with a stranger, I&#8217;m not certain if I would want to do that.  Because maybe someone there might want to steal my identity or so forth.  We would enter such a social arrangement with understandable suspicion.  And if you&#8217;re an introvert, you may be very scared or it may actually be a little intimidating to be asked to engage in this extroverted activity.  So what of these kinds of problems here?  What are your solutions?  What are your workarounds?</p>
<p><b>De Botton:</b> I guess my starting point is that the modern world is not so good at community building.  There&#8217;s a lot of loneliness.  Because much of who we are doesn&#8217;t get an expression in social life.  And this is surprising.  Because with Facebook and other social media, we were supposed to have cracked this.  But I think people will still complain that in many areas, we don&#8217;t have good communities.  And religion&#8217;s unparalleled at building communities.  Now how do religions build communities?  One of the things they do is they gather people around a table every now and then and get them to break bread together and get them to talk.  That&#8217;s how early Christianity started.  It started as a series of meals between the followers of Jesus who remembered his lessons and got together to eat.  And, as I say, you find this in all faiths.  That somehow the stranger is invited to the table and is welcome to the table and a stranger is turned into a friend.  It&#8217;s a beautiful idea.  A simple idea.  And I couldn&#8217;t help but contrast this with the modern world, where we&#8217;re obsessed with eating.  And newspapers and media are full of places to eat.  The restaurant world is high on the agenda.  But what&#8217;s never really spoken of is the meal as a source of a social engagement.  As a source of discovery of another person.  And that is really what interested me.  And so with the example of religion in mind, one of the things I do in my book is to suggest how we might learn from the tradition of communal dining of religions, and precisely set up meals between strangers.  Now, of course, some of them may feel uncomfortable.  And some people like to eat on their own.  So it wouldn&#8217;t be for everybody.  But I think in many of us, there is a desire to shed the armor which we normally have to wear in daily life and to eat with others and to discuss our shared and common humanity.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But what I&#8217;m saying is that the introvert who is very fond of, say, one-on-one exchanges, as opposed to mass group exchanges &#8212; I mean, how does such a communal dining experience account for that?  They may feel very uncomfortable.  There may be a lot of social energy.  You&#8217;re saying that they should go ahead and answer very deep questions about what they fear.  And so how do you account for them?</p>
<p><b>De Botton:</b> Well, look, it&#8217;s not for everyone.  As I say, if someone wants a one-on-one meal, if someone&#8217;s not interested in community, then it might not be for them.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, how do you get them involved in the community?  If the ideal here is to get everybody on the same page, how&#8230;</p>
<p><b>De Botton:</b> Well, it doesn&#8217;t have to be everybody.  But it has to be those among us who hunger for community, as many of us do.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But introverts do hunger for community.  They just go about it in a different way.  </p>
<p><b>De Botton:</b> Yeah.  Well, I couldn&#8217;t speak for them.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Okay.  Early in the book, you bring up the Day of Atonement &#8212; the moment on the Hebrew calendar where Jews must identify all those who they have hurt or behaved unjustly towards.  Now those who are part of the Day of Atonement are inclined to forgive any offenders for annoying them or causing them grief.  But it is an undeniable truth that very often when you apologize to someone in the secular world, well, they&#8217;re not exactly going to have the same degree of understanding sometimes.  In fact, your apology may aggravate the other person further.  So I&#8217;m wondering.  To get something along the lines of a Day of Atonement for a secular or non-religious group, I&#8217;m wondering: Does it take a specific secular rite?  For example, in Australia, if you go and vote, 95% of the people turn out.  Because if you don&#8217;t vote, then you&#8217;ll actually get fined.  So I&#8217;m wondering if a Day of Atonement along the lines of what you&#8217;re talking about would require something like a government mandate for everybody to apologize to everybody.  What of this dilemma?  </p>
<p><b>De Botton:</b> Well, I don&#8217;t know. I mean, what strikes me as a secular person is how intelligent religious communities are at realizing that community is a very nice thing in many ways.  But it&#8217;s also very challenging.  And you find, throughout the history of religion, mechanisms to ease social tensions.  And it struck me that the Jewish Day of Atonement was particularly clever and insightful in recognizing that what holds communities back is grudges.  Things that are undigested in the past. And what it encourages people to do is to both accept that another person may have a grudge to bring up, but also that it behooves you not to drag out that grudge.  So there&#8217;s a kind of mutual responsibility on both sides not to drag out an argument and to move towards forgiveness.  And the underlying assumption is that God is the only perfect being.  And anyone else is going to be flawed.  And so we have to forgive on the basis of our fragility and flawed natures.  And I think that&#8217;s a very beautiful idea.  Look, the specifics of how an atheist might do this can yet be worked out.  But it&#8217;s food for thought.  I think, for me, what&#8217;s interesting here is that the psychological mechanism of forgiveness based on a recognition of imperfection.  And this is something that the modern world struggles with.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> How do you reach, though, someone who is not inclined to forgive?  Or who may not in fact be on the same page?  I mean, I&#8217;m all for you.  I would love to see everybody forgive everybody for their sins or their errors or their sleights or what not.  But the fact is that a lot of people are just not going to.  So what does it take to really bring people around?  Does it take constant promotion of idealism along the lines of what you&#8217;re saying or what?</p>
<p><b>De Botton:</b> Well, in the Jewish Day of Atonement, what gets people motivated is a sense that it is normal both to forgive and to have a grudge that you need to bring up.  And I think that too often when people annoy the mood for discussing issues, of discussing grudges, it&#8217;s because they feel that they&#8217;re not going to get a proper hearing, that it might be embarrassing to do this, and that dialogue with another is impossible.  So it&#8217;s a kind of pessimistic position.  And sometimes we may need a bit of help.  We may need a third person.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Mediators.</p>
<p><b>De Botton:</b> Mediators.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Voluntary mediators.</p>
<p><b>De Botton:</b> And that, in a sense, was the role that God was playing in the Jewish community at that point.  He is a mediator.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah.  So in addition to having a temple for atheism, we also need to get a mediator army of volunteers.  Would this also help to spread further good will and bonhomie?</p>
<p><b>De Botton:</b> I think you&#8217;re focusing a little bit unfairly on the practical aspects of this.  I&#8217;m really writing as a psychologist.  I&#8217;m interested in psychology of religion and the psychology of the dynamics that are being explored.  So how exactly this might apply, how a secular person might absorb this into their life is capable of many different interpretations?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But aren&#8217;t pragmatics important when considering the psychological possibilities of what human beings are capable of?</p>
<p><b>De Botton:</b> Sure. Absolutely.  Absolutely  But we don&#8217;t have to decide today.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;m just picking your brain here.</p>
<p><b>De Botton:</b> Sure. Of course.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/freddiemacgnomes.jpg" alt="" title="freddiemacgnomes" width="350" height="494" align="right" /><b>Correspondent:</b> You start this book with a late 19th century image of the fat and prosperous man who sold in cash and the skinny man who sold on credit.  I think that more than a century later, it&#8217;s safe to say that those roles have now been flip-flopped.  You also write, &#8220;In the era of the CMO, the smart bank could be like the Skinny Man, its vaults nearly empty, with a pile of IOUs in a nearby basket.&#8221;  I have to ask you, Louis.  You are the debt man.  Why were so many people willing to place their faith in the supernatural qualities of the collateralized mortgage obligation?  Your book describes a Freddie Mac ad that appeared in a 1984 issue of the <i>American Bankers Association Journal</i> which contained magical gnomes.  And they frightened me when I saw that picture.</p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> As well they should.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So why were people willing to believe in gnomes?  Is it possible for you to explain in plain English what in the hell a CMO is?  And why did Freddie Mac even need a new financial instrument?  Just to get this party started.</p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> Well, that&#8217;s about fifteen different questions.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes!</p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> I will start with the most important question.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Okay.</p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> Which is why did people want to put money into these mysterious supernatural instruments.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Gnomes! </p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> Yeah. Only the gnomes know.  It&#8217;s hard to describe it over the radio.  But it&#8217;s an image of gnomes advising the head chief financial officer of Freddie Mac and saying even he does not understand how these things work.  Only gnomes know.  It&#8217;s terrifying to comprehend that no one understood what they were doing.  But the truth of the matter was that they knew what they were doing in that what they thought that they were doing.  What they thought they were doing was taking together a bunch of risky things, combining it in different ways using magical alchemical transformations, and in the process they thought they were reducing the overall level of risk.  And then they were making those sellable in the form of bonds to people who ordinarily would not buy them.  To understand this, you need to understand the back history of mortgages and how they were financed and sold in America, which I&#8217;m very happy to talk about.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Feel free!</p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> And it&#8217;s what I talk about in the book before the time of the gnome hegemony.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Pre-gnome.  More level-headed times.</p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> Yeah. Before the dwarven under kingdom began to rule us in the night. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Before investment bankers cleaved to the <i>Return of the King</i> appendix and started speaking in Elvic langauge.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/isoldoncredit.jpg" alt="" title="isoldoncredit" width="350" height="247" align="left" /><b>Hyman:</b> Exactly.  So you need to understand that it used to be that it was very difficult to get loans in America of any kind.  And that&#8217;s why I start the book off with that picture.  Because the picture of the Skinny Man, who is nervous and afraid because he had lent on credit to his customers in his store.  It was a picture that would be hung in a 19th century store. And the reason I start with that is  because I think more than a graph, we are all besieged by numbers these days.  More than a graph, it gets at the different mentality, the different practice of lending in the 19th century.  That lending was something that was not profitable.  It was something that in terms of cash loans wasn&#8217;t even legal.  And yet today it&#8217;s the center of our capitalism.  So how did that transformation happen?  </p>
<p>So with mortgages, the story is a long one.  And I&#8217;ll spare you the details.  Though in the book, the details are quite intriguing, I hope.  The basic idea is that, before the 1930s, you could get a mortgage from a local bank.  They were very expensive and they tended to be funded by &#8212; they were balloon mortgages like we have today.  We imagine that they were recent inventions.  But they actually were commonplace in the 1920s.  And they fueled the housing boom.  Because they allowed people to pay only the interest every month on their mortgage.  Which meant that they could buy more of a house.  And the banks, in turn, would resell little bonds, mortgage bonds, to pay for all those mortgages going out.  And so we have something like the mortgage-backed security is today.  And with all that money from the investors, they could then lend to all these people to buy.  Now the problem was, of course, that as soon as the stock market crash happened, all those panicked bonds people stopped buying bonds.  All those panicked investors stopped buying bonds.  And then suddenly the banks ran out of money to lend for mortgages and those balloon mortgages all came due.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> We&#8217;re talking about the mortgage-backed securities period with the participation certificates.</p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> They were called participation certificates.  That&#8217;s the technical term from the 1920s.  And what happens is that suddenly they had to foreclose on all these houses and you have the housing crash of the Great Depression.  It wasn&#8217;t because people lost their jobs as much as they lost their investors.  Which I think is a really counterintuitive finding from what we think about when we think about the Great Depression. And so after this, the government creates the FHA.  And the FHA and Fannie Mae together, what they do is they say, &#8220;Look, little bank.  You can lend money to this home buyer.  And then we will sell it to distant investors.  Like in New York City.&#8221;  So insurance companies, for the most part, bought these mortgages whole.  The entirety of them.  And then that money can be used to pay for a house in Texas.  But these kinds of bonds, which fueled this wild, crazy, free-for-all kind of atmosphere in the 1920s &#8212; those went out of style.  Investors didn&#8217;t want to buy them.  Because they had all gone toxic.  And the Fed actually prevented banks from using them at all.  And so this period from the &#8217;30s to the &#8217;70s, they&#8217;re outside.  They&#8217;re no longer in our economy.  But the problem is that if you want to get more money into the housing market, you want people to have more money to invest in houses like they did in the late &#8217;60s and early &#8217;70s &#8212; predominantly to fund housing of the poor.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> <a href="http://findamortgage.com/online.resource/hud.section.235.assistance.program.asp">Section 235</a>.</p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> Section 235. Correct. It&#8217;s as if you read a book recently on the topic.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Your book perhaps!</p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> Perhaps a book I am acquainted with.  This money was to be used for that.  And it was because they confused the cause for the effect in the postwar period.  They looked around them.  They saw on the one hand impoverished cities and, on the other hand, prosperous suburbs.  And they thought, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s make the cities like the suburbs.&#8221;  And instead of realizing that the reason why the suburbs were prosperous was because of all the jobs that the well-to-do white people had, that made them prosperous, they thought, &#8220;Oh, it was just because of their houses.&#8221;  They confused cause for effect.  And they created this program to bring back the mortgage-backed security, which then these bonds could be sold to new kinds of investors.  Not just insurance companies, but pension funds.  To all kinds of people. And actually to these small banks, it turns out.  They turned out to be the biggest buyers initially of these mortgage-backed securities.  And so what you have is this system which actually collapses in a year or two under George Romney&#8217;s administration of the Housing and Urban Development.  But the mortgage-backed security survives and becomes the new basis for our economy.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And they also use the term &#8220;participation certificate,&#8221; leaving one to wonder &#8212; at least this reader to wonder &#8212; why they would use the same name of a clearly failed idea.  </p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> It had been several generations.  And so they were vaguely&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> People forget.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/louishyman.jpg" alt="" title="louishyman" width="400" align="right" /><b>Hyman:</b> People forget.  They forgive.  And they think that it would be different this time.  Because they were tradeable in the secondary market, which the ones in the 1920s were not.  They were born toxic almost in the 1920s.  But they thought, &#8220;Well, these will be fine.  They&#8217;ll be like FHA loans.&#8221;  Which had worked for several generations.  And actually they worked fine.  The securitization worked fine for a long time.  From the mid-1970s on for about thirty years. They worked fine.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Just as the participation certificates worked fine until things started to happen.</p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> Until things fall apart.  Things work fine until they fall apart.  That&#8217;s how it is.  You survive every accident you have until the one that kills you.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So why do these financial people, who should know this &#8212; because the historical examples repeat and repeat and repeat &#8212; why are they so short-term in their thinking when they consider credit ideas or debt ideas?  Or even the extension of credit?  I mean, this is what gets me.  That nobody seems to have a memory longer than a few years.  It&#8217;s like, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got some money! We&#8217;ll go ahead and blow it!&#8221;  I&#8217;ll get into the hilarious Chicago credit card thing in a bit, which I thought was funny.  But also remarkably short-sighted.  </p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> No. It is really surprising.  I think people are just intoxicated by reason.  They think that if a model works, then it will work in the real world too.  But the way things work on the ground and the way things ought to work can be quite different.  And I think that&#8217;s one of the lessons of all of this.  That we should trust our experience more than our thinking on some level.  Our thinking can be wildly off.  Everything made sense.  But when you look at the models that people actually use for all this kind of lending, they only use three or five years of data.  They don&#8217;t even use a full business cycle.  And they did that because that was the data that they had.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, I guess the question here is: we are looking at this from the vantage point of financial people.  The question I have is whether American citizens can be held accountable for some of the problems that occurred.  To what degree should they be held responsible for borrowing, believing, going ahead and taking the extension of credit options that were given to them so that they could live their middle-class lifestyles?  Does historical precedent reveal that our parents and our grandparents are victims of various strains of predatory lending?  Or is it really these middle-class aspirations?  How do we look at this?</p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> Our grandparents lucked out.  So if you look at the actual Federal Reserve data, you see that people began to borrow like crazy after World War II.  But what was different was that they actually had good jobs. And they were able to pay back all those debts.  So the amount of borrowing goes up.  But so does the amount of repayment.  So it looks like no one&#8217;s borrowing.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> But they&#8217;re actually using car payments for their big-finned cars.  They&#8217;re using mortgages for the suburban housing.  They&#8217;re using charge-a-plates at the mall. They&#8217;re doing all kinds of things that require debt.  Now are they better people than us?  No, they just live in a different time.  So that today, it&#8217;s very difficult to have the same job over your entire life.  That kind of job security is no more.  Wages have stagnated for forty years for average people.  And people get sick.  They lose their job.  And they&#8217;re stuck with these bills.  So they have credit cards to fall back on.  Though I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the people who have gotten dumb or become immoral.  I think it&#8217;s that the world around them has changed.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But when one considers such transitions as Jack Welch&#8217;s decision to move GE&#8217;s resources from manufacturing capital to financial capital, and essentially eliminate jobs that give people money that allow them to purchase goods that allow them to perpetuate an economy, the question is&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> Are we responsible for that?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Are we responsible for that? </p>
<p><b>Hyman:</b> Yeah. I think on some level we were fools to let this happen.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Catherine Chung is most recently the author of <i>Forgotten Country</i>.</p>

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Wondering if he left his car keys in Korea.</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> <a href="http://www.catherinechung.com/">Catherine Chung</a></p>
<p><b>Subjects Discussed:</b> How <i>Forgotten Country</i> emerged from multiple stories, finding inspiration from disappearance, mysterious ghost monks that couldn&#8217;t float their way into the narrative, getting to know a character&#8217;s family by telling other stories, bad fictional boyfriends, Korean American identity as seen through reflection, character depth that springs from an aesthetic, how Chung keeps her characters separate from her identity, drawing from emotional experience, the difficulties of finding details in grief, losing your parents, giving additional details to personal experience, loneliness expressed as a dialogue between author and characters, growing up in the Midwest, &#8220;Chinaman Costumes,&#8221; racist products sold at chain stores, being surprised by people speaking against injustice, first-generation Korean Americans and second-generation Korean Americans, being bullied while growing up, being pushed into a brick wall, how schools used to react to bullying, dwelling on childhood incidents, moving around a lot as a kid, not being accepted, changing perceptions of bullying over the past few decades, grief as a way of understanding cultural identity, <a href="http://therumpus.net/2012/02/from-the-ruins/">&#8220;From the Ruins,&#8221;</a> whether any city or location can offer true respite, escaping to Leipzig, poorly buried corpses during the Korean War, animal-based mythology, how the subconscious fits personal anecdotes into fiction, unanticipated symbols which emerge in life, paying attention to things that seems like signs, the burdens of an analytical subconscious, finding the mathematical precision within sentences, Chung&#8217;s math background, the messier process of half-formed thoughts, the difficulties of not knowing, whether or not block is productive, obsessively circling a problem, Csikszentmihalyi and flow, using the least amount of words possible in a sentence, being concerned with a readership, how style is shaped through unexpected means, abuse and ambiguity, the creative showdown between God Cathy and Janie&#8217;s Voice, the troublesome results of divine creative intervention, and control in fiction and in life.</p>
<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B> </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I know that <i>Forgotten Country</i> emerged from a number of different stories that you were working on at the same time.  You have, of course, this idea of the boy falling out the window, which is at the very beginning.  The mysterious hermit girl who crops up later in this book.  And then you also have this story that was inspired by your father&#8217;s sister, who disappeared when you were a child.  It&#8217;s really interesting to me that, first of all, these stories fused their way together into a novel and that, secondly, this came before this massive family unity of complicated relationships.  So I&#8217;m curious, first and foremost, if you could describe how these stories came together in novel form and how you were able to fuse them together, and whether you needed some of these orbiting asteroids to circle around and become the planetary family unit.</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Yeah. Well, you make it sounds as if I did it so intentionally.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) No, it never is intentional, of course.  But I&#8217;m wondering how the connections came about.</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Yeah.  I think that they came about after a lot of time.  There&#8217;s one character telling all these separate stories.  And that&#8217;s what linked them.  I didn&#8217;t really know what they were doing with each other or how they were related.  There are other stories that were also in this book that eventually dropped out.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh really?  Like what?</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> So there was a flying ghost monk.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Yeah. He was eradicated fairly early on.  But he was totally in there and for a long time, he was carrying a great deal of weight in terms of just the number of pages.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> That&#8217;s quite a feat, given that he was a ghost.</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Yeah. He was a ghost.  He was on a trek to find his lost daughter.  And that was one of those stories I realized in my mind was related to the other three stories, right?  Because all those stories are about loss and about trying to find what&#8217;s been lost once you&#8217;ve moved on.  It&#8217;s almost impossible to do that. But in terms of the narrative arc, he didn&#8217;t work.  And part of the reason he didn&#8217;t work was because the main narrator really was Janie, who was the protagonist and the narrator of the novel.  Because he was carrying on his own story and I thought, &#8220;Well.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You can&#8217;t very well have him being narrated by Janie.</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Yeah. And in my mind, he was related.  But in terms of the book, he didn&#8217;t fit.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So how then did the family come about if Janie was the narrator for these three stories?  </p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Ah! Because she&#8217;s totally preoccupied by her family.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh, I see.  In the act of telling these other stories, you got to know her family.</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Yeah! That&#8217;s exactly right.  These are the stories that I was really interested in.  But the other stories that she was also interested in, I had to create a character who could tell these stories.  But I think that she was interested in these stories because of the light they shed on her own experience.  And as she told these stories, she&#8217;s sort of a secretive, hard-to-get-to-know person.  So these were the stories that she wanted to tell.  But then there were these underlying stories of her own life that came to play as she was telling them.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And allowed you to work out the connections with the sister, with the aunt, and so forth. Well, this leads me to wonder, did you have the competitive relationship between the sisters in place before the father-daughter relationship?  Which of those came first?</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Which of those came first?  I think that the father-daughter relationship came first. Hannah&#8217;s disappearance came first.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Of course.</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> It was the absolute first thing to happen.  But their competitive nature came as I was discovering why Hannah would leave and why it would be difficult to find her.  I discovered what their issues were.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> It&#8217;s interesting that competitiveness would come from disappearance.  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Yeah!  And I think that the competitiveness also arose not early on in the novel &#8212; but I think Janie gets jealous with all the attention that&#8217;s focused on Hannah while she&#8217;s missing.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You were mentioning ghosts earlier.  We&#8217;re talking about disappearance.</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;m wondering if subtraction might in fact be the way for you to pinpoint what a story or what, in this case a novel is all about.</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> That&#8217;s a really interesting point.  I think that a lot of what I&#8217;m interested in and a lot of what I focus on is what&#8217;s missing or what&#8217;s longed for.  Or what&#8217;s gone.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Were there any instances when you were writing this where you simply had too much and you had to remove an element?  I mean, we were talking earlier&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Like a flying ghost monk.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Like a flying ghost.  Or a character perhaps.  Or some angle that just didn&#8217;t allow you to get that emotional precision that I think is there throughout the book.  </p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Yeah.  I was thinking the other day just about how many pages I removed.  And I would say the book is about 300 pages, but I think I must have deleted at least six or seven hundred.  Probably more like a thousand as I was going through the drafts.  So entire storylines fell out.  Like the flying ghost monk. There was a character.  Janie&#8217;s love interest also ended up getting cut out.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh, I see. </p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> And so as I went&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Is this the guy in college?  Or just another love interest? </p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> No, it was another love interest.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh! Another love interest!  </p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> There was another.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> What was he like?</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> What was he like?  Well, you know, I think he wasn&#8217;t all that interesting.  Which is why I took him out.  He wasn&#8217;t really holding his weight.  I realized it wasn&#8217;t about him.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, I also wanted to ask about Hannah.  The thing that&#8217;s fascinating to me about her is that she almost seems like a reflection of Janie.  I mean, I think specifically about the scene in the hotel elevator, where Hannah follows her in and is essentially tailing her and mimicking her.  And then you also have Hannah, which is a palindrome.</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But also you observe of her at another point in the book, &#8220;how strangers, even adult men, would pause in the street to look at her, and how easily she held their attention.&#8221; So she&#8217;s also, on the other hand, resistant to Korean food.  Which leads me to also wonder if her reflective nature came to mimic the idea of America or an American identity mimicking the original Korean identity that Janie has.  And I&#8217;m wondering if you could talk about if Hannah came from almost a reflective pool from dwelling on Janie like this.</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> That&#8217;s such an interesting question, and one I haven&#8217;t heard yet.  But I think that&#8217;s exactly it.  Or at least that&#8217;s the source or the core of Janie&#8217;s resentment to Hannah.  I think that because Hannah not only reflects Janie, but also gets to do some of the things that Janie doesn&#8217;t get to, but would like to, Janie feels that that&#8217;s been taken from her.  That she only gets to be a certain kind of person because Hannah has already taken this other part of her.  This reflection, exactly as you&#8217;re saying, is reflecting some part of her that is also slightly different.  And so Janie is very competitive and jealous about that.  But I also think that that link that you made to how her Americanness is a reflection of how her Koreanness could be a reflection is also very interesting.  Because of the ways in which people change or mimic each other or come to copy an idea of what they should be.  So, yeah, those were things that were with me the whole time that I was writing this book.  And I just think that it&#8217;s really cool that you picked up on that.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But when you considered Hannah, did she first come to you as this aesthetic person?  And did you need to flesh her out by this reflective thing we&#8217;re talking about? By imbuing in her some sense of her being looked at by other people?  By people who were not, in fact, Janie?</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Maybe.  And I think that the thing that I kept getting caught on with this question is that I have often thought of both Janie and Hannah as reflections of parts of myself as well.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes. Of course. They&#8217;re your secret sisters. (<I>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Chung:</b> Yeah! Who live inside my head.  But I was interested in Hannah as the object of attention, right?  As a kind of reflection.  And I think part of Hannah&#8217;s problem is that it&#8217;s hard for her to &#8212; and Janie&#8217;s problem as well &#8212; it&#8217;s for them to think of themselves, or they get tripped up on the way that they&#8217;re being looked at by other people.  And it&#8217;s hard when you see yourself as a reflection.  Because then what are you? </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hari Kunzru is most recently the author of <i>Gods Without Men</i>. This is the second of a two part conversation. The first part <a href="http://www.edrants.com/segundo/hari-kunzru-part-one-bss-440/">can be listened to here</a>.  But I&#8217;m afraid that <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/460/retraction"><i>This American Life</i></a> isn&#8217;t the only program</a> forced to issue a retraction.  We&#8217;ve discovered that one of our longest conversations contained numerous extensions. This week, we detail this deeply troubling problem in the first few minutes of our program before carrying on with the second part of the Kunzru conversation.</p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B></p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So what then, Hari, do you make up when you write a novel?  I mean, I also detected, for example &#8212; I saw at least two David Mitchell nods.  Not just &#8220;Segunda,&#8221; which of course I have also plucked.  But also there is an early incident with Nicky in which he complains about the waiter not understanding that he&#8217;s saying &#8220;water,&#8221; which I&#8217;ve heard David say a couple of times.</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> Oh really?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah. And I was thinking, &#8220;Oh! Now I know they&#8217;re friends.&#8221; (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But I am curious about this idea of plucking almost everything from other incidents. Is this something you can help?  Do you make shit up to combat that in any way?  To keep it real or to keep it authentic?  Or do you not even care?</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> I simply think that you&#8217;d be lying if you said everything &#8212; let&#8217;s see. There&#8217;s various positions. On one end of the spectrum, it&#8217;s that people like Kenneth Goldsmith and Tom McCarthy would say, &#8220;We&#8217;re at the end of this tradition.  We&#8217;re playing in the ruins.  The only valid artistic act is a kind of reconfiguration of existing material.&#8221;  You know, I frankly that&#8217;s much easier to say as a straight white guy.  Because you&#8217;ve had two thousand years of airtime.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> Maybe you feel that&#8217;s all there is.  But actually I think we&#8217;re in a moment where there is a lot that&#8217;s genuinely new and there&#8217;s a lot that&#8217;s genuinely unsayable. So, however, my experience of the world isn&#8217;t of this kind of wonderful, sort of romantic notion of the primary creation out of nothing and that the extraordinary poetic mind of the creator shaping raw material into art &#8212; that simply is not an accurate description of the pragmatics of making literary art.  Is it important to distinguish one kind of thing from another?  Only when the lawyers turn up.  I think any literate person these days is literate in a way which encompasses the notion of source and secondariness. And in words: bad writers borrow, good writers steal.  You can make something your own.  David Mitchell&#8217;s project is interesting.  We are friends.  I&#8217;m friends with Tom as well.  And I have productive conversations with these guys about it. I mean, Dave is a much more orderly character than me, I think.  A lot of people &#8212; mostly because Dave&#8217;s blurbed my book; so that&#8217;s very nice of him.  But <i>Cloud Atlas</i>, to which various people have connected <i>Gods Without Men</i>, is a very different project.  That&#8217;s a response to Calvino&#8217;s <i>If on a Winter&#8217;s Night a Traveler</i>, where Dave just could not stand the fact that all these stories opened and then didn&#8217;t close.  And he made this very beautiful, nested structure, where the stories open, open, open, open, open, center, close, close, close, close, close, end.  And that&#8217;s one way of seeing the world.  And it&#8217;s a very formally perfect thing.  And it allowed him to show that he&#8217;s head and shoulders above most other people working today.  As I said before, I&#8217;m more interested in breaking that formal perfection and allowing silence.  A model I had for this book was Bolaño&#8217;s <i>2666</i>, where there are these very big &#8212; three, four very big slabs of narrative.  They seem as you read to have no damn connection to each other at all, but gradually, in this almost ineffable way, they start to vibrate in harmony with each other.  And it becomes clear that this is a work.  I admired that so much.  </p>
<p>And also, I think, given that plot at this point is taught everywhere.  I mean, I&#8217;ve been in some screenwriting lately.  You know, this world of the three act structure and this has to happen at this point.  It&#8217;s those wonderful little clockwork things that you can make out of plot.  And the only way of breaking out of that slightly clockwork feeling is literally by breaking out, by making openings, by making strands where things are not functioning as they are expected to function.  And it&#8217;s been quite a pleasure to see that, in both the US and the UK, the reviewers who have not fundamentally liked this book have all, despite themselves, basically &#8212; I mean, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/books/gods-without-men-a-novel-by-hari-kunzru.html">Michiko Kakutani did this in the <i>New York Times</i> today</a>; I was just reading her review.  They all say, &#8220;Why was this not tied up properly?  Why did he not concentrate on the straight story of this couple and their child?  Why is this imperfectly integrated material been introduced in the book?&#8221;  And that&#8217;s the project.  And that&#8217;s where I find interest.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> <i>The Millions</i> <a href="http://www.themillions.com/2012/03/fractured-world-hari-kunzrus-gods-without-men.html">also accused you</a> of doing too much style.  </p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> I mean, fair enough. I will never be a kind of cool writer in a certain sort of way.  I don&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> In a literary sort of way?</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> In an affectless sort of way.   </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> A plain, hardboiled realism degree of fiction?</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> You know, I feel I have a reasonably nailed down and possibly even cynical view of human relations.  But just in terms of writing prose, I like the idea of pretending to be an 18th century Spanish dude. And I like to do the different voices.  And that&#8217;s the opposite of a certain sort of literary call.  I read a lot of post-writing school American fiction in particular, which I find painfully self-conscious because it&#8217;s very scared of being uncool.  It&#8217;s very scared of what might look like style, what might look like showing off, or what might actually look like fun.  And it adopts a kind of Carver, who&#8217;s obviously the big &#8212; you know, all the sentences are stripped down.  The most emotional moment is the downfall at the end.  I mean, this stuff is now being put out by the yard.  Because it&#8217;s become a kind of MFA staple.  I think it&#8217;s what happens when a bunch of hyper-conscious 25-year-old MFA students critique each other in a room for too long.  It&#8217;s that acute self-consciousness, which I think you&#8217;ve got to lose.  You need to basically be able to make yourself look slightly ridiculous to be a writer.  You need to ideally make yourself look a bit ugly.  I mean, there are writers I admire because they can be unlikable on the page and because that&#8217;s interesting to me.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I agree with you.  But I think we&#8217;ve seen a shift &#8212; especially from the agents and the editors.  I mean, I have heard this.  Editors are saying, &#8220;You know, all the novels that I get tend to hit these same notes.&#8221;  This problem we&#8217;re talking about.  This fear of offending.  This diffidence when it comes to chronicling unlikable characters or unlikable perspectives.  On the other hand, when you have agents as gatekeepers, who are preventing those types of desired perspectives from actually hitting into publishers and you&#8217;re also dealing with the need to get a return on revenue, I mean&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> It&#8217;s structural, isn&#8217;t it?  You can&#8217;t just blame the writers.  You have to blame the way the industry is structured.  And there are many, many ways which make books &#8212; I haven&#8217;t read Chad Harbach&#8217;s book yet.  But it&#8217;s very interesting to me that <i>that</i> book was given the keys to the kingdom very immediately.  My partner, the novelist Katie Kitamura, is reading it and, at the moment, has found it very unsatisfactory.  I mean, there&#8217;s a kind of prose that is deemed by the gatekeepers to play in the Midwest.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> And hence kind of gets through.  And this structural stuff &#8212; I can&#8217;t have a book that looks like I want it to look.  I mean, the physicality of my book is not under my control because the publishers have certain job descriptions.  There&#8217;s an art director.  There&#8217;s a designer.  I mean, my books would not look like the published objects that they are.  Those objects should be considered as compromises.  You know, you fight for the kind of cover that you feel you want.  I mean, my visual taste is not always the visual taste of my publishers and my editors.  In terms of font.  In terms of spacing.  Let alone if you were to point to really fooling around with formal stuff or you wanted to try and open your book in some way that wasn&#8217;t the traditional novel.  All these things exclude certain types of things you can do with writing and make the novel look like the novel looks now.  And I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s fixable.  Because in a way, I&#8217;m kind of into the idea that, as a writer, you&#8217;re in this very impure situation.  My gallery artist friends are shocked by the lack of control I have over the presentation of my work.  Because they&#8217;re able to control minutiae.  Because they&#8217;re just trying to sell six things to six very wealthy dudes.  You know, I&#8217;m trying to sell six thousand &#8212; hopefully more than six thousand &#8212; to many, many people.  So there is this point.  You&#8217;re in the market.  You&#8217;re in this very, very different kind of aesthetic world.  And yet you&#8217;re trying to make art in this situation.  And it&#8217;s an interesting one.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But what do you do?  Do you pull a Mark Danielewski?  Do you go to Random House and sit in a carrel for three to four weeks and say, &#8220;I know exactly how this novel should look&#8221;?  I mean, if you have to compromise on these levels, I&#8217;m curious also &#8212; narrative-wise, textually-wise &#8212; what compromises do you make to keep this real?</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> I know.  I think that&#8217;s really a very personal question for each writer.  You have different things that are redlines and things that aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But what are we talking about?</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> Well, I mean, I give completed drafts to an agent, an editor, a couple of other people, and I listen when they say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand why this is happening.&#8221;  So even if I think something is clear, and I think it&#8217;s not communicating to that extent, that&#8217;s when I&#8217;ll change.  I don&#8217;t know if that counts as compromise.  I dug my heels in structurally on this book &#8212; in that there was a point of view that I should cut certain sections and that I should give more help, tie up more neatly.  And that was precisely what I didn&#8217;t want to do.  Same with previous books.  I mean, I was asked to put a glossary into <i>The Impressionist</i>.  But I figured that would be a way of saying that this book is for non-Indian readers rather than for Indian readers who will already know these words and I had written in a way where I thought that all the Hindi and slang words and stuff would be understandable from context. So I said no to that.  Where do I compromise?  I have ended up compromising on all the visual stuff.  I&#8217;ve never really beyond a certain point tried to impose.  I mean, publishers have house styles in terms of fonts.  I&#8217;ve never really tried to fight my corner very hard in that.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Can you ever be happy with the final way that the book looks and feels and is? </p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> I like some of the books that are out under my name.  The objects that are under my name.  I mean, I&#8217;d say that there are editions that I&#8217;m embarrassed to carry around.</p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B></p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I wanted to first of all start off on a question of faith &#8212; predictably enough. A writer has a lot of faith when he is putting together a novel.  A reader places her hard-earned shekels over the counter and has faith in the writer to tell a story.  The characters in this novel, <i>Gods Without Men</i> &#8212; they are both faithful and faithless to ideologies, to their families, to their relationships.  So faith is a very loaded concept.  And I&#8217;m curious why any novelist would tackle something that is so tricky, so duplicitous, so hypocritical, so difficult to pin down.  I mean, how do you deal with this?  Because even though this novel does not always answer all questions, you are dealing with something that you have to fit into narrative.  So maybe we can start here.</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> Yeah. I suppose my own relationship to faith is a complex one.  I&#8217;ve got an Indian father from a Hindu background.  Many people on both sides of my family are actively practicing religious.  My mother&#8217;s background is Protestant English. My parents decided quite sensibly to bring me up without any religious &#8212; not to bring me up with either of those two traditions.  So I was left to find my own way.  And I&#8217;ve always had for many reasons a kind of inclination to see things one way and then see things another way.  But over the years, I&#8217;ve developed a sense that I don&#8217;t believe in god.  I&#8217;m an atheist.  However, I don&#8217;t think that position &#8212; the idea that you don&#8217;t believe in some kind of personalized creator to whom you owe an ethical duty not to sleep with the wrong people.  That doesn&#8217;t take any of the big questions off the table about human agency, about ethics, about meaning and value.  And I&#8217;ve always been very fascinated by people of faith.  Because in some ways, I find them very scary.  People with a very strong faith have stopped asking questions at a certain point. There&#8217;s a certain point where they have made this leap.  This extraordinary leap into the world of faith.  And it&#8217;s something I felt that I understood poorly as well.  The only book that&#8217;s ever really made me really kind of feel what it must be like to have a powerful religious faith is <i>Fear and Trembling</i>, the Kierkegaard book where he talks about the extraordinary moment where Abraham has sacrificed Isaac and he&#8217;s prepared to do this because his faith in God&#8217;s word is true.  And that kind of encapsulates it.  It&#8217;s a terrifying act.  It&#8217;s a horrific act.  And it, in a way, echoes with all these incredibly violent things that have happened in the name of religion.  But at the same time, there&#8217;s a kind of horror to it.  There&#8217;s a sublimity to it. There&#8217;s an absolute abandonment of the human.  </p>
<p>And this novel is a way, is my attempt to talk about our relationship with the unknowable and with the unknown.  And it&#8217;s about all sorts of people who have many different ways of conceptualizing this and many different sorts of solutions that they&#8217;ve come up with.  But the essential question is the question of absence and unknowability.  At a certain point, human comprehension ends. And whether you believe that everything is essentially knowable &#8212; like Jaz, the husband in this.  The husband and the wife who are at the center of the book.  Jaz is a rational man.  He is trained as a scientist.  His sense of the world is if you think hard enough and you have the right concept and you test and you hypothesize, then the world will open up its secrets. And his wife goes absolutely in the other way.  She withdraws into a kind of mysticism.  And other characters in the novel range from various people who have profound faith &#8212; like a Franciscan friar and a lapsed Mormon coalminer to people who have a much more complicated relationship with it and a skeptical relationship with it.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But I would argue that this concern for faith &#8212; both sides of the fence &#8212; almost mimicks Fitzgerald&#8217;s idea of the first-class intellectual being able to hold two opposing ideas in his mind. I mean, with Jaz and Lisa, it&#8217;s very interesting, those sections in particular.  Because the prose itself is both general but specific enough for us to get an idea. It&#8217;s almost as if the prose needs to mimic their especial judgment towards the world, towards each other, and the like.  And I&#8217;m curious how you developed this at the prose level. Because that was one of the things that really impressed me about your book.  What struggles were there to get that balance? I&#8217;m just curious.</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> You mean, in terms of the voice for the different characters?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes. Exactly. Especially for Jaz and Lisa.</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> You know, it&#8217;s one of these things that emerges through the doing. I don&#8217;t think it was a very programmatic thing.  I mean, those characters emerged as quite defined opposites to each other in their reaction to what happens to their missing child.  I mean, I&#8217;m interested in the business of faith in the financial markets, faith in credit and the extraordinary kind of high wire act that is the global financial system, which depends on everybody believing that this money exists.  And yet placing a kind of Mr. Science in this world of high finance was an interesting one.  Out of those decisions, his way of talking and his way of understanding the world emerged quite naturally.  Once you know that somebody has a higher degree in physics, you know that they&#8217;re unlikely to be basic in their worldview on <I>The Celestine Prophecy</i>. And Lisa&#8217;s character comes out of something I&#8217;ve observed from a lot of liberals with humanities backgrounds.  Here, in London, everywhere.  That actually, people aren&#8217;t very scientifically educated very often and actually have a kind of gut hostility to the procedures of science.  Because they feel that it&#8217;s kind of closing down the space of wonder in the world.  And that leads quite a lot of people &#8212; I&#8217;m always quite surprised by people who are very skeptical and argumentative will often have this blind spot where it comes to &#8212; especially things to do with health, in particular.  Like people get into homeopathy and various other things that I would personally consider quackery.  Because partly they wish to believe certain things about the world that have to do with wonder and ineffability and unknowability and often beauty and a kind of non-utiliatarian way of seeing the world. It&#8217;s all kind of very valid reasons to want to protect a sacred space from an intrusion by the methodology of science.  But it can lead people into some very strange, anti-rational positions. And often those two ways of being can be very buried in people.  Because we don&#8217;t tend to have these conversations.  It&#8217;s off the list of what&#8217;s polite in a party chat.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, be as impolite as you like here. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) Well, we can talk about it. But having a couple who basically have a great deal in common, who love each other &#8212; they genuinely love each other, these two.  The kind of gradual exposure of the real contours of their ways of dealing with the unknown is what causes this terrible tension in their relationship.  And that seemed to me to speak to quite an interesting fault line that runs across a lot of contemporary culture.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;m wondering if Lisa, at least in relation to the question of faith, was almost sort of a spillover character for what you could not do with Dawn, who I&#8217;m also really curious about.  I mean, it&#8217;s interesting that the women tend to gravitate towards issues of blind faith, often destructive faith.  I mean, with Lisa, it&#8217;s interesting too because you have all these media incursions into her life.  So it&#8217;s almost like some part of the world wishes to punish her for her beliefs.</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> I&#8217;m very interested in the way that media presents women.  Especially mothers. The censoriousness that attaches itself to women&#8217;s choices around motherhood and around the work.  I mean, in this novel, their child disappears.  They become the object of this media witch hunt. And everybody zeroes in on &#8220;Is this a bad mother?&#8221; &#8212; especially &#8220;Is this a cold mother?&#8221; She fails to emote in a way that the media folk think is appropriate. And hence she&#8217;s immediately suspect. Because it&#8217;s a novel and you can get inside somebody&#8217;s inner life, we know very well that she&#8217;s absolutely destroyed by this and she&#8217;s an emotional person.  She&#8217;s not some kind of psychopath who fails to have correct emotion or a response.  However, the appearance sort of drifts further and further from reality.  Of course, they&#8217;re also New Yorkers lost out West.  Everyone hates New Yorkers in the rest of the country, as far as I can see.  I now get outed as a New Yorker by other Americans in other parts.  The English accent gets bracketed into some sort of New Yorker thing.  So I get the prejudice as well.  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Those wild and crazy liberals with their British accents. </p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> Yeah. Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You&#8217;re drinking a cappuccino right now!  So there you go.</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> Drinking a cappuccino with a British accents.  That&#8217;s exactly what everyone thinks happens in Chelsea.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You are America&#8217;s nightmare!  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Kunzru:</b> I am. Rick Santorum, right now, is burning an effigy of me in a basement somewhere in Idaho. </p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B> </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;m glad I could get in touch with you before you were actually getting on a plane.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Yeah. No, it&#8217;s good. I hate flying.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh, you do?  Well, what&#8217;s wrong with flying? </p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Um&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Aside from the security theater and all that?</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> No, it&#8217;s&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Aside from the defenseless position you&#8217;re put in?</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Yeah. That&#8217;s a big part of it.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Aside from the lame snacks that you get?  Sorry. I don&#8217;t want to be negative here.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Yeah. You sort of hit the nail on the head. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Although I do love Ativan.  So it&#8217;s sort of a&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) Let&#8217;s get into the book.  I actually wanted to broach the TV question from a weird angle.  One of the items contained within Will Self&#8217;s half-serious, not really serious <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/feb/22/will-self-rules-for-writers">rules for writing</a>.  He has this on his list: &#8220;Remember how much time people spend watching TV. If you&#8217;re writing a novel with a contemporary setting there need to be long passages where nothing happens save for TV watching.&#8221;  Now I know that you once worked as <a href="http://vpsnet1.flavorwire.com/author/adam-w">a TV blogger for Flavorwire</a>. </p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> That&#8217;s true.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> There is a notable televisual influence down to the technical details in <i>Flatscreen</i> that is often so striking that one, in fact, even encounters Eli&#8217;s mom sleeping on a sofa in a Slanket. So I&#8217;m wondering. Do you have any pragmatic ideas&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> The Slanket was actually a period detail.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Ah, yes! Okay.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Not to go off topic too much.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;m sorry to be so out of touch. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> But I will say the Slanket was the one thing that I guess I had to change in the book.  Because I originally had it as a Snuggie. The book&#8217;s set in 2006.  And the Snuggie was not yet on the market.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh, that&#8217;s right.  Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> But the Slanket was. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> It was sort of the precursor.  But the Snuggie has since taken a monopoly on the armed blanket.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> The armed blanket thing. </p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> No, Slankets do seem very endurable &#8212; the Slanket, I have to say. So maybe they just seem to last like plastic that&#8217;s not going to biodegrade or something.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Oh yeah. Anyway&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> No, no, no!  Thank you for the clarification.  It&#8217;s very important to get the Slanket detail right.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> It might be that I think I learned about both items in infomercials. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, I mean, the question I have is how novelists can win over readers from television.  And do they need to follow this advice that Will Self offers.  Writing long scenes describing watching television?  To what degree was the process of writing <i>Flatscreen</i> your way of contending with your own television feelings? Clearly, we touched a nerve here on the Slanket thing.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Yeah.  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Let&#8217;s just get the ball rolling here.  Do you need to specialize also in short alternating chapters? That&#8217;s a lot to throw. So go for it.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> No. I don&#8217;t think necessarily. I don&#8217;t know. It does seem like a ridiculous rule. Will Self&#8217;s rule seemed almost the opposite of what you&#8217;re probably told in most writing programs.  Which is: set up conflict so that your characters can move around rooms and pick up objects.  And stuff like that.  I don&#8217;t know.  I think more so, I was just interested in a character whose worldview has been so shaped by television.  Perhaps in the way that mine has, or that people of my generation or even your generation, a slightly younger, probably a slightly older generation too have.  I like the idea of having this guy whose kind of poorly educated and didn&#8217;t pay attention in school.  Didn&#8217;t go to college.  But at the same time, he actually has quite a lot of information available to him.  Based on the fact that he&#8217;s watched an incredible amount of television.  And I like this idea that if you actually spend days just watching The Discovery Channel and The History Channel and The Nature Channel, but also the news and CNN and old movies on AMC, that you could sort of become this Renaissance man of knowledge, in that you know about all sorts of different things without having any kind of deeper understanding of any of them.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So the couch potato is a superficial Renaissance man?</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> That&#8217;s all America has to offer these days? (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) Well, I don&#8217;t know. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Come on! We&#8217;re trying to win these people so that they dive into libraries!  I was hoping that you, the guy who managed to synthesize TV in novel form, might have a few ideas here.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Um, no. I have almost no ideas on that front.  I think we&#8217;re losing the battle.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> We are losing the battle.  But at least it&#8217;s marvelous nonetheless to watch this cultural phenomenon mushroom as it is.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.twitter.com/bubblesdepot"><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/adamwilsongoodreads.jpg" alt="" title="adamwilsongoodreads" width="400" align="right" /></a><b>Wilson:</b> Sure. Then again, I have received &#8212; I sort of did have this idea that, oh, you know, maybe people can relate to this.  Because we all spend our time on the Internet and watch a lot of movies on TV and stuff.  But then I&#8217;ve gotten all sorts of criticisms on Goodreads and from bloggers complaining about how this guy just sits around and watches TV and doesn&#8217;t do anything.  So maybe these people, who are complaining about the book, are like living these rich lives that the rest of us aren&#8217;t experiencing.  And they&#8217;re sick of reading about characters.  I don&#8217;t know.  They probably wouldn&#8217;t like Will Self&#8217;s books either.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes, that&#8217;s true.  Well, I&#8217;ll get into the Goodreads review thing.  Because I actually checked them out too. But I wanted to get into your book before we actually did that.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I mean, you have this strategy of alternating chapters throughout the book.  It kind of relates to what we&#8217;re talking about here. Where you&#8217;ll have something short, followed by another Eli episode.  The first two parts of the novel have these bulleted lists.  You have things such as &#8220;Facts About My Mom.&#8221; &#8220;Ways In Which I am Like a Rapper.&#8221; </p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> That&#8217;s one of my favorites.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Good!  I caught the right one.  And then the third part shifts to all these possible endings.  And then Eli starts to reference these narrative terms near the end.  Sitcom C-plot.  Things like that.  So I&#8217;m wondering to what extent these alternative chapters were almost a series of bona-fide notes to help you better know your character in your book.  How did this tension between the self-reflective and almost the self-aware narrative occur during the course of writing this book?  I&#8217;m curious.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> I think it happened in a few different stages.  Originally, the book was quite a bit longer. And I felt it was bogged down. I felt it was a bit slow and that there were two things slowing it down.  One is that there was a lot of time spent relating backstory.  Things about this character&#8217;s childhood memories.  And all this type of stuff that I felt was really slowing down the pace of the book.  Because I knew I wanted to have this really quick pace.  And maybe part of that is trying to appeal to readers who have low attention spans.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, this leads me to wonder.  Did the bulleted lists come from the larger draft?  Where one would normally expect that type of thing to come from a notebook, the awkward details you plucked from&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Exactly.  Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Wow.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> So I wanted to figure out a way to speed it up without losing a lot of this information.  And so I thought of these kinds of lists.  And I ended up cutting about 100 pages from the book and replacing it with all of these interesting little chapters that I hoped were doing some of the work in a kind of fun and more entertaining and quicker way, and that felt right for the character who is reading blogs.  And it felt like it worked. So that was one thing.  And then as for the other endings, I think those in part came out of &#8212; one thing I think the character Eli is struggling in the book is this idea that everything, all his points of reference, comes from television and movies.  And he has this idea that he wants to be in the classic coming-of-age movie.  He wants to grow and become a real person maybe.  Whatever that means.  And live some kind of grown-up life. But his imagination, I think, has been compromised in some way.  Because I think everything he can imagine is something he&#8217;s seen in a movie or on TV.  And he has bad points of reference in terms of his family. He can&#8217;t look at his father and say, &#8220;I want to be like that.&#8221; So he looks at movies and he says, &#8220;Well, I could be like that.  But is that realistic?  Or is that even a possibility?&#8221;  Or has it gotten to the point where American life is really just a kind of imitation of these tropes and this received culture or narratives?  And I think Eli&#8217;s struggle with that reflected my own struggle as a writer to try and imitate and write a book in a genre that&#8217;s been done a million times and come up with a kind of narrative that is, at the same time, aware of all that&#8217;s come before it and doesn&#8217;t cop out and have and ending where someone drives off into a sunset with a perfect song playing.  And so the way I battled that was to have Eli himself imagine all these endings that he&#8217;s seen before.  But then they don&#8217;t all come at the end.  They come over the last 100 pages.  So I think that each time one is presented, my hope is that, with the book continuing along, that ending is passed over. And that it&#8217;s pointed out as being ridiculous or unrealistic or cliche or impossible or all of those things.  And then life continues to go on in the book.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But it&#8217;s also trying to find an ending while all these other things are happening.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Which also made me &#8212; I had a total wonkish question for you.  But the whole incident on the football field with the Viagra.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> That&#8217;s not really happened to me. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (i>laughs</i>) Well, I was going to ask first and foremost, what is your Viagra experience?  And second, I mean, that almost seemed to remind me, almost, of Frederick Exley&#8217;s <i>A Fan&#8217;s Notes</i>. I&#8217;m wondering if that might have been a possible nod.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> <i>A Fan&#8217;s Notes</i> is one of the books I&#8217;ve read more times than any other book.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And, of course, Exley talks about reading other books multiple times. </p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Was that a touchstone for you?  In terms of reading?</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> In my life. It&#8217;s funny.  I didn&#8217;t think of it that much.  In terms of when I was working on the book.  But it&#8217;s a book that&#8217;s been really important to me in my life. And interestingly, I think, in that book, one of his touchstones is Saul Bellow&#8217;s <i>The Adventures of Augie March</i>.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Which I also know is a big influence on you.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Which was in some ways a big influence on this book too. So maybe it all kind of comes together. But <i>A Fan&#8217;s Notes</i> is great. I just did a piece for Flavorwire on <a href="http://flavorwire.com/261770/the-10-best-slacker-novels-according-to-adam-wilson#1">my ten favorite slacker novels</a>, </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh yeah?</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> I think my favorite thing about that book is that it introduces a great piece of slacker furniture I&#8217;d never known about.  Which is the davenport. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes. (<i>laughs</i>) So there are all these little clues for furniture that almost doesn&#8217;t exist anymore in there.</p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Yeah. It&#8217;s the perfect slacker item, I think. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, it makes me wonder if <i>Flatscreen</i> is, in some sense &#8212; I mean, we were talking about it being set in 2006 &#8212; whether it&#8217;s more of a historical novel as well.  Maybe your davenport is the Slanket. (<i>laughs</i>) </p>
<p><b>Wilson:</b> Yeah. I think so.  I&#8217;d like to think that.  If I leave one thing in the world, it&#8217;s to put the Slanket into the history of American literature.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) We need more writers to do that.</p>

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Revising his own narrative.</p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B> </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Stylistically, the first part of this book requires a great leap of faith for the reader.  I mean, we&#8217;re asked to believe that Jun Do, despite the fact that his story does not check out, gets released by the interrogator.  That he would also go to Texas with Dr. Sung. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m giving anything away.</p>
<p><b>Johnson:</b> Sure.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But then you have this twist at the end of the first part.  Then we are given this surprise and we say, &#8220;Oh ho!  Maybe the narrative itself doesn&#8217;t exactly match up.&#8221; Then you have the second part. And the last part almost mimics <i>Casablanca</i>, which of course is a DVD of the world&#8217;s best movie that is circulated as well through the text. You have all these references to storytelling. You have Sarge saying, &#8220;You think the guys at top don&#8217;t know the real story?&#8221;  You have Commander Ga wondering &#8220;if he couldn&#8217;t tell a story that seemed natural enough to them now, but upon later consideration might contain the message he was looking for.&#8221; So we&#8217;re led to believe that storytelling, or perhaps this dim awareness of narrative, is very much the North Korean identity.  And I&#8217;m curious how you arrived at this involuted solution to North Korea. In terms of why this, of all things, would be their identity.</p>
<p><b>Johnson:</b> Well, storytelling is my obsession. I love stories. I love to write them and to read them. And I&#8217;m really fascinated with how they come out.  Especially troubling stories. You know, happy, funny stories are very easy to tell.  Stories of success and achievement.  And they&#8217;re a little boring.  But, you know, I&#8217;ve studied for some time now how people tell traumatic or painful stories.  And the different shapes that they take. And when I started studying North Korea, it made me reconsider how I tell my own stories, the stories I tell myself to feel good. In America, I think, in our literature and in our real lives, everyone is the center of her own story.  And our job as humans and as characters is to follow our motivations toward what we want and need to overcome obstacles by looking inward and growing and changing and making discovery towards becoming our best possible selves. But, you know, as I studied the stories about North Korea, because the story there is state-sponsored, I realized that it was a national narrative written by a regime, enforced by a regime, controlled by censors, without another version.  And in that, the very few people at top were the central characters. Really, the main character was Kim Il-Sung, Kim-Jong Il, and Kim Jong-un now.  </p>
<p>And everyone else in that country was like a secondary character. And this is really borne out by my research and by the testimonials of defectors that, when you&#8217;re a child in the DPRK, early on you&#8217;re assessed for your aptitudes or certain qualities for the needs of the state. And you&#8217;re sent down paths that lead toward becoming a fisherman or a sailor or an accordionist.  And in that world, having your own desires and yearnings could run counter to the role that you might fulfill to survive.  So I think I started with a character who&#8217;s more trapped in a world of North Koreaness, where he must do what he&#8217;s told, go where he&#8217;s told.  He does grim things. And it doesn&#8217;t really matter who he is or what he does. It&#8217;s just that the role will be fulfilled.  Whereas in America, you know, we change our stories all the time.  They grow and evolve.  And when you go off to a new school or a new job, you just take on a new persona.  You change.  And I think over the course of the book, because the character meets Americans &#8212; he listens to foreign transmissions because he has some encounters; even though he doesn&#8217;t defect; even though he keeps maintaining his role &#8212; a growing sense of possibility rises in him that he could finally write his own story rather than being conscripted into the state. And in the second part of the book, he does this daring act to try and become his own person.  Though there he has to impersonate somebody else even.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, secondary characters.  I mean, this book is filled with them.  And I&#8217;m wondering if, from the limited resources you had at your disposal &#8212; I mean, you did in fact go to North Korea; we can talk about that in a little bit; I suppose it&#8217;s an ineluctable subject &#8212; but I&#8217;m curious if you could truly, from your vantage point, get a suitable Tolstoyian cross-section when the information you had at your disposal is so thin. I mean, do you feel that there were certain secondary characters you didn&#8217;t quite include in the book?  That may have actually been included in the previous draft and you would have liked to flesh out further? How do you go about creating a fictive population when the information at your disposal is so thin?</p>
<p><b>Johnson:</b> Well, I did kind of revel in the secondary characters in my book.  I&#8217;m glad you point that out. Because I had a lot of fun with them. You know, just in terms of North Korea, what we know and what we don&#8217;t know.  We know very little about what happens in the secret power in Pyongyang.  That the people who are ruling and who are inflicting the power upon others &#8212; we don&#8217;t know that much.  For the lives of normal citizens and the rest of the country &#8212; in Wonsan, Nampho, Chongjin, etcetera, we know a great deal actually.  Over 6,000 people defected last year.  When they make it to South Korea, and that&#8217;s a whole journey in itself, they go to a facility called Hanawon, where they&#8217;re debriefed.  And a real narrative is written about each one of them. And then they go through a kind of school that helps them reintegrate into a vastly different society. But from the information that&#8217;s gathered about normal citizens, we know how much they eat.  How many hours they work.  How their families live.  About their housing blocks.  About their group criticism sessions.  We know how much volunteer labor they have to give to the squads.  Etcetera. The mysterious people are in Pyongyang.  They don&#8217;t tend to defect.  They&#8217;re all underground. When you go to there, there&#8217;s no White House or Blue House. There&#8217;s no residence with Kim Jong-Il. He lives in an unseen place in the city.  A lot of the big structures are underground. Probably because we bombed them so mercilessly during the Korean War. And there&#8217;s an underground society that exists.  And we don&#8217;t know much about them at all.  I saw cell phone towers when I was there, but not a single person on a phone. We have to assume they have the Internet, that they understand about the world, that they watch movies.  They probably make international calls, even travel internationally.  But because they don&#8217;t leave, because they don&#8217;t leave any trail, we just don&#8217;t know who they are. And what I tried to do in my book was maybe fulfill the human dimension of the normal people outside the city.  And, by that I mean, in a place with such self-censorship, in a place where even being perceived to do something against your role in the state could cost you dearly, I wondered how normal people chose to share their inner thoughts.  This was the imaginative part. A lot of the factual basis of the book is really accurate. But would a parent tell a child that he thought it was all a lie?  Would he transmit that essential knowledge that he accumulated over a life?  </p>

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Seeking elusive parrot memoirs.</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> <a href="http://www.sara-levine.com">Sara Levine</a></p>
<p><b>Subjects Discussed:</b> Ways to state exclamation marks in conversation, unreliable narrators, verbal flair, taking qualities away from a character to create a voice, Robert Louis Stevenson, Jane Austen&#8217;s <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>, <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ourtown/2011/06/chicago_writer_sara_levine_on.html">on Levine not believing that an author has a &#8220;real&#8221; voice</a>, the academy perspective, unnamed protagonists (referred to as &#8220;UP&#8221; during the conversation), surrounding an unpleasant character with very nice people, how to separate an author&#8217;s viewpoint from a character&#8217;s unpleasant perspective, displaying items on tables, writing a book of short length, early drafts of <i>Treasure Island!!!</i>, being edited by Alice Sebold, parrots in heat, getting rid of fat jokes, stereotypical dialogue, American fiction that plays it safe, scabrous characters in contemporary fiction, political correctness and market conditions, creating family details, the inverse of a Facebook profile, placing the emphasis on ego, thinking of a book as a mindspace, not giving readers handles, Lydia Davis, the book&#8217;s <i>Cymbeline</i>-like ending, the endings of Victorian novels, four core values, author vs. character temperament, not being a good reader, Alain de Botton, &#8220;The Essayist is Sorry for Your Loss,&#8221; vocational experience, how to determine how to treat a parrot terribly, reading books about parrots, thinking about gender, living a life a certain way, and reading Stevenson biographies.</p>
<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B> </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;m not sure how we can say this while also respecting Stevenson. Shall we say <i>Treasure Island Chk Chk Chk</i>?  Should we say <i>Treasure Island</i> &#8212; maybe <i>Island</i> with extra exuberance?</p>
<p><b>Levine:</b> Yeah. I think it&#8217;s the exuberance I want.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> <i>Treasure</i> [<i>in high-pitched voice</i>] <i>Island!!!</i>  Something like that?</p>
<p><b>Levine:</b> Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Okay. The author of <i>Treasure</i> [<i>in high-pitched voice</i>] <I>Island!!!</i> Sara Levine. How are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Levine:</b> I&#8217;m fine.  Thank you.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;ll try to do less of that as the conversation progresses.  But anyway, I wanted to first of all ask you about just what it takes to create such a winsome unlikable character and to perpetuate that for so long.  How much do you feel is going over the line or enough?  What do you need to do to invite the reader in to someone who is quite literally ineffable?  There is no name for this character.  So what of this?  How does this start?</p>
<p><b>Levine:</b> Well, how does it start?  Or how do I do it?  I guess those are the same.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> How do you do it?  </p>
<p><b>Levine:</b> Well, I&#8217;ve always been interested in unreliable narrators.  And part of what interests me is that there&#8217;s this gap between the narrator and the author, the implied author.  And so I think what you have to do is vary that gap.  If the character&#8217;s completely unlikable, despicable all the way through, the reader will toss the book aside.  But I guess with this narrator, I thought, well, I&#8217;ll let her have a few things.  I&#8217;ll take away compassion.  I&#8217;ll take away generosity.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You took away quite a bit. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Levine:</b> Yeah, I took away a lot.  But I will give her language.  I will give her verbal flair.  And I think that maybe that&#8217;s what keeps people interested.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Verbal flair? As opposed to the flair in <i>Office Space</i>.  I mean, what do you mean by this?</p>
<p><b>Levine:</b> Well, I just think she has a &#8212; I would say, a syntactically ambitious voice.  It&#8217;s a very written book.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Taking qualities away.  I mean, how did so many qualities get taken away over the course of this?  I mean, is this just your inevitable reaction to generating conflict?  To create someone who might even be described as sociopathic on some levels.</p>
<p><b>Levine:</b> And has been.  Well, you know, Stevenson himself had this idea about character formation.  He said that it&#8217;s a kind of psychic surgery.  And he described how he did Long John Silver, in fact.  And he said, knife in hand, he thought about a friend of his.  Henley.  And then he cut away all his finer qualities. And left him with courage, but not much else.  And I think that&#8217;s what I was interested in doing.  Was taking somebody that I knew, but taking away those qualities that would help her on her passage.  You know, for comic purposes. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So the verbal flair and the syntax &#8212; this is something of a buffer.  This invites the reader into broaching someone who is just really unlikable normally, do you think? </p>
<p><b>Levine:</b> I think. I mean, I think there has to be verbal energy there. She&#8217;s funny.  If she weren&#8217;t funny, I don&#8217;t think it would be so fun to be in the company of someone like that.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So humor is the secret way with which to peer into these sordid human qualities.</p>
<p><b>Levine:</b> Perhaps. Perhaps. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So really much of this was just really a way of keeping yourself entertained.  That was really the m.o. for this book?</p>
<p><b>Levine:</b> Well, yeah, and I&#8217;m also always interested in perception.  What of my favorite parts of Jane Austen&#8217;s <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> is this tiny little part where the sister-in-law is talking about the money that her husband was supposed to leave to the girls.  And within the course of one paragraph, although it&#8217;s third person, you watch her rationalize how they shouldn&#8217;t give the money to the girls.  Maybe they&#8217;ll just give her some dishes.  They&#8217;ll give them even the second best dishes.  And so with this book, I think I was interested in rationalization and ego and certain psychological patterns.  And so I wanted to let her be devious in ways.  Ways that I think all people are devious. For the purposes of the story, she&#8217;s more devious than most.</p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</b> </p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> I&#8217;m doing well.  I mean, I got out of bed and out of my house.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You got out of bed?</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> I&#8217;m very excited.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> How do you get out of bed?</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Magically.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I mean, I think I got out of bed this morning.  Obviously I met you here. </p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But I obviously don&#8217;t know how I do it sometimes.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Well, you know what? I was awoken by a fire alarm going off in my building.  Which as it turned out was just a test.  But it was very exciting. And it motivated me to get up.  Because like most people who deal with depression and anxiety and certainly agoraphobia, getting out of bed is sometimes a challenge.  Getting out of the house is a challenge.  But in this case, I was so rudely awakened that it was just great, actually.  And I got to work on time.  It was amazing!</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So you need a contextual noise these days in order to get out of bed?</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> I need you to yell at me.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I mean, how difficult is it now for you?  Just out of curiosity.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> It depends.  Most of the time, it&#8217;s all right.  A lot of times, I wake up and my first thought is, &#8220;Oh no!&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh no?</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Oh no! A day!</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I don&#8217;t think you have to be agoraphobic to have that thought. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> That&#8217;s true. Absolutely.  I think that&#8217;s more of a function of probably an existential crisis.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> It&#8217;s the default setting for 21st century life.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Pretty much. But I think generally it&#8217;s a lot better these days.  I feel more motivated.  Especially with the book coming out.  I found that it helps to keep extremely busy.  Like to overstuff my schedule.  Because that is a very strong motivating factor.  The fear of disappointing someone.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Overstuff your schedule?  Like how overstuffed would you say?  Down to every hour booked?</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Oh gosh.  Not every hour.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Two hour blocks?</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> You know, I do a lot of writing.  I write for vice.com and for newnownext.com, which is LogoTV&#8217;s gay site, and I write for xojane.com.  And I write for a startup called bookish.com, a publishing startup.  And then I make videos.  And I travel.  And I talk to colleges.  And I do comedy.  And so I really take on too much on purpose.  Because it keeps the brain demons away.</p>
<p><b>Corespondent:</b> Oh yeah. The brain demons.  You allude to the voice saying &#8220;I want to die!&#8221; many times in the book.  When was the last time you heard that voice?</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Well, it&#8217;s interesting.  Because in the book, I chose to personify these urges I was having.  It wasn&#8217;t like having a voice outside my head.  It wasn&#8217;t like having a schizophrenic break, where I was experiencing auditory hallucinations.  But it was like &#8212; when you listen to yourself and you think, &#8220;I need to listen to my inner voice. What is my gut telling me to do?&#8221;  But your gut is all screwed up.  Because all the signals are messed up. Because your brain is crazy.  So it was more like that.  It was more like, &#8220;Okay. I want to die. Yeah.  Definitely want to die.&#8221;  It wasn&#8217;t that long ago.  It was really like four or five months ago.  It was when I was finishing the final edits on the book. And I was in a relationship that ended in a sense.  Because the guy moved a couple of continents away.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> This is a recurring experience in your life, based on the book. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Like I said, I think I need a lot of activity to distract me from the demon voices or my inner struggles.  So that relationship was certainly a distraction.  And the book was certainly a distraction.  And with both of those things coming to an end in one sense, I didn&#8217;t have these distractions.  So I had to face what was actually going on.  And I didn&#8217;t really like that.  So hence that.  So actually my editor at William Morrow was really great and very empathetic.  And so I went home for a couple months to Jersey to just kind of get better and get my shit together.  And my boss at Bookish was great too and let me work remotely.  So that&#8217;s the benefit of being a freelance writer.  You generally aren&#8217;t making enough money.  But you can do it from anywhere.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And it&#8217;s good when you have situations like this.  I mean, these migratory impulses of yours.  I&#8217;m really curious.  You were saying &#8212; I learned before we talked that you had made yet another move.  And this is very much a picaresque tale.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Yes!</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> It takes us to Boston.  It takes us to Asheville.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> It&#8217;s like <i>Moll Flanders</i>.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes, I know.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Which I think is a picaresque.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes, yes.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Right. I think so.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I think Thackeray or someone along those lines was an impulse.  Or Defoe. But I&#8217;m curious.  Do you have difficulties often staying in one spot?  Do you feel the impulse to flee sometimes?</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Yes!  I have trouble with commitment on many levels.  Commitment sometimes to a person.  Commitment to a place of residence.  Commitment to a career.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;m surprised that I got you to commit to this interview.  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Yes! I did!  Very exciting.  I decided to marry this interview.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Although it was last minute.  </p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> So it worked.  A lot of times, the last-minute stuff works best for me.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So short-term commitment, okay.  Long-term commitment?</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> I get surprised into committing.  </p>
<p><b>Correspodnent:</b> Surprised? (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> I have to be surprised.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Being shocked and galvanized into committing.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Oh yeah.  I&#8217;m really shocked.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> To wake up.  &#8220;Wow! I&#8217;ve been married to this guy for three years.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Surprise!  Oh great.  I have a kid?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> I have been surprised by my commitment to New York City.  Because I&#8217;ve moved around quite a bit within New York City.  But I&#8217;ve been here for six years.  Six and a half years.  And that to me is shocking.  That I&#8217;ve spent that much time in one place.  And so of course, I&#8217;m itching now and thinking about moving to Los Angeles or Asheville again or somewhere.  But I don&#8217;t know what that is.  I have a restless nature, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Is this why you have applied to jobs out-of-state over the years?</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Oh yeah.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Hey, if the vocation takes me here, I can blame the job.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Exactly.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> As opposed to my own decision.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Yeah.  So that I can keep moving.  Kind of like a shark that never stops moving.  I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a myth or true.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Or just a Woody Allen saying.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Or just a thing.  Yeah.  I find it necessary to just keep moving.  Always keep busy.  Always keep busy.  And the upside of that is that I&#8217;ve got to have a lot of adventures and do fun things and meet a lot of cool people.  And the downside is that eventually something does happen where you have to stop.  And for me, when I&#8217;ve gone through a really deep-seated depression in my life, which has happened about three or four times, that has been just a screeching halt and has made me reflect on who I am and what I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I was going to ask you about &#8212; I had one question just dissolve.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> That&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> As they sometimes do.  But I wanted to ask you.  I mean, here you are.  You&#8217;re a comedienne, a freelance writer.  These are occupations that depend very much sometimes &#8212; especially with comedians &#8212; on approval.  </p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And I&#8217;m wondering how you deal with this.  Because if you have all sorts of inner demons committing you to self-loathing, so to speak &#8212; at least temporarily, short-term commitment &#8212; and you can&#8217;t get a laugh from an audience or you can&#8217;t get a gig, how do you deal with that?  I mean, do you have a good support base?</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> I have a really good support system in the form of a pathologically approving family and supportive family.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Pathologically?  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> A really disturbing, supportive&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> They&#8217;ve never said a bad word about you. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> You know, sometimes, they should have.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Really?</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> There are times where they should have been more critical, but just sort of very, very loving.  Very supportive.  So there&#8217;s that.  And then I also have some great friends.  But yeah, I think we all come to &#8212; those of us who are comedians often come to comedy for reasons that are not entirely healthy.  And sometimes it is out of a twisted desire to be held up for ridicule.  Sometimes it is out of a desperate need for love and affection.  That&#8217;s me.  And other times, it&#8217;s for the high of performing.  And for me, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m chasing that high.  I think it&#8217;s more about affirmation.  Which is kind of ridiculous.  Because it&#8217;s a losing battle.  Because no one is going to be liked all the time.  No one is going to be approved of all the time.  So I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s necessarily the most psychologically healthy choice for a career. But it is the choice that I&#8217;ve made at this point.  And writing, I think, is so similar.  Comedians are writers.  We just tend to do our writing in notepads and then perform very short-form stories on stage.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes.  My query that had dissipated into the ruminative mist has come back.  </p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Ah, excellent!</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And it was about this notion of adventures taking you away from home.  I mean, you clearly have had adventures inside an apartment and so forth. </p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Oh yes.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So I&#8217;m wondering why you feel that the adventurous spirit is not necessarily there within an urban domicile.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Well, it&#8217;s a little boring when you&#8217;re just adventuring with your television set and your books and your comfort objects.  I love the song &#8220;I Am a Rock&#8221; because, you know, &#8220;I have my books / And my poetry to protect me / I&#8217;m shielded in my armor.&#8221; And he refers to the room as a womb.  And that really is how it feels.  So I can go adventuring in my mind when I am in my apartment.  But especially because I&#8217;ve had times in my life when I was afraid to leave, I find that I need to make myself leave.  It&#8217;s this impulse.  Perhaps that&#8217;s part of my wandering nature. If I can wander and not be afraid, it proves to me that I&#8217;m not a slave to my particular form of madness.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah.  You still feel very much enslaved by it?  I mean, it seems that you&#8217;ve had some success.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> Sure. Definitely.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You&#8217;ve managed to, at least, emerge unfettered to the microphones right here.</p>
<p><b>Benincasa:</b> I don&#8217;t feel enslaved it.  But it&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s kind of like the way people who are in recovery talk about their addictions.  It&#8217;s something that they manage.  But it&#8217;s not something that is cured.  That&#8217;s how I feel about mental illness for me.  Because if I don&#8217;t take good care about myself, doing basic things like sleeping enough and eating properly and making myself leave the house and acting against type &#8212; so acting against what my instincts are sometimes &#8212; it can come back.  Or it&#8217;s like, I need to constantly &#8212; it&#8217;s like keeping your house clean so that mold doesn&#8217;t grow on the corners.  Because it will do that if you don&#8217;t keep it clean. That&#8217;s sort of another metaphor that works.</p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B> </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Arthur, you&#8217;re a very huggable guy.  But how are you doing?</p>
<p><b>Goldwag:</b> I have no hate in my heart.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> No hate in your heart?  Well, let&#8217;s get down to this business of hate.  I mean, I couldn&#8217;t help but think of Mickey Rourke&#8217;s line in <i>Barfly</i> when I was reading this.  &#8220;Hatred! The only thing that lasts!&#8221;  One of the starting points of this book is Richard Hofstadter&#8217;s <a href="http://karws.gso.uri.edu/jfk/conspiracy_theory/the_paranoid_mentality/the_paranoid_style.html">&#8220;The Paranoid Style in American Politics.&#8221;</a> He pointed out that status politics was more likely to be expressed in this vindictive sense rather than through a proposal for positive action. So I&#8217;m wondering.  To what degree is vindictiveness the natural mode of status politics?  I mean, why don&#8217;t we have a lot more hugging and kissing and love-ins?  Why isn&#8217;t that more of a draw?  Maybe we can start from there.</p>
<p><b>Goldwag:</b> Well, I think it depends on which side of the status divide you are.  And I think on the relatively educated, prosperous side of the status divide, there&#8217;s a positive sense of smugness that infuriates the people on the other side of the divide. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Can violence be smug?</p>
<p><b>Goldwag:</b> Well, that&#8217;s kind of the feedback loop of our politics.  Weak people get smugger and smugger, and they get more and more infuriated.  And it works to the advantage of people that aren&#8217;t actually involved in status politics at all.  They&#8217;re involved in money politics.  But it works very much to their advantage.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;m wondering. Do movements and demagogues tend to time their vindictiveness in any way?  I mean, just looking at the various historical examples, have you noticed any specific vindictive trends?</p>
<p><b>Goldwag:</b> Well, we&#8217;re living through such a bad moment.  We&#8217;re probably living &#8212; if America is going the way other big empires have gone, we&#8217;re beginning our decline.  We&#8217;re well into our decline.  And there were a lot of people who were doing very well in America who weren&#8217;t doing so well anymore.  When you look at the history of the United States, when you look at it closely and not in terms of the stories that politicians tell on the stump, you realize there&#8217;s been very few good times in this country.  I grew up in an age of unprecedented prosperity.  But, you know, it was an age of tremendous ideological conflict.  It was the civil rights movement.  The Vietnam War.  But there was a lot of money.  Thanks to unions and the New Deal, people that were relatively uneducated were doing pretty well.  And that&#8217;s not happening anymore.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But why don&#8217;t they look at those achievements and say to themselves, &#8220;Well, hey, maybe I can be part of that?&#8221;  Why do they feel the need to be hateful?  I mean, is there something inevitably wrong with the political mechanism that forces them to hate.  Do people not really have a voice?  And is this one of the reasons why they resort to this vindictiveness?</p>
<p><b>Goldwag:</b> These people actually &#8212; they couldn&#8217;t answer that question.  Because they never describe themselves as haters.  I went to a white nationalist convention in Washington a couple of months ago.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Oh yeah?</p>
<p><b>Goldwag:</b> And over and over again, they told themselves &#8212; because there weren&#8217;t outsiders there, except me and one or two other reporters.  They&#8217;re telling themselves, &#8220;Look, we don&#8217;t hate anybody.  Our thing is: we love white people.&#8221; </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Goldwag:</b> They love whiteness.  And I talk about that in the book too.  And Hofstadter talks about it when he gets into the status politics.  You know, if whiteness is the only thing you have, you&#8217;re going to hold onto it very tightly. And then there&#8217;s a whole complex of things that go with it that, you know, they&#8217;re not bad things.  They don&#8217;t actually have anything to do with whiteness. I mean, one of the things that I actually learned at this convention is that white people really love their families.  But that&#8217;s not a white attribute.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> No.</p>
<p><b>Goldwag:</b> But the other side of that, of course, is if you love yourself to the exclusion of somebody else is the somebody else.  And there&#8217;s the specter in America &#8212; you know, it&#8217;s a darkening country.  One of the speakers who made a very moving speech in a way &#8212; he said, &#8220;Imagine a country with no blonde women.&#8221;  That&#8217;s like, okay.  Imagine that.  There&#8217;s countries in the world where there are no blonde women.  But America, we&#8217;re an unusual country.  Blood and soil, it&#8217;s a much more natural idea in Europe than it is over here.  Maybe as things are coming apart over here, it&#8217;s starting to become a part of American identity now.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I notice that you offer a smile every time you mention that things will fall apart over here.  This leads me to wonder whether, I suppose, the erosion of the American government might in fact encourage people to love each other more.  Do you think that hate will actually dissolve once we really don&#8217;t have a political mechanism with which to contain it?</p>
<p><b>Goldwag:</b> I don&#8217;t.  Because I think that I&#8217;m not a religious person.  But I believe in the fall of man.  On the other hand, I&#8217;m not an optimistic person at all.  But I believe we&#8217;ve made tremendous cultural and spiritual progress in this country.  You know, there&#8217;s this incredible resentment of our African-American President.  But he got elected by a landslide.  There&#8217;s this incredible homophobia.  But in an astonishingly short amount of time, there has been such a raising of consciousness.  I would have never imagined ten years ago that gay marriage would be as accepted as it is today.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But we still have white nationalist conventions that you&#8217;re attending.</p>
<p><b>Goldwag:</b> Yeah, but they&#8217;re small.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> They&#8217;re small?</p>
<p><b>Goldwag:</b> What disturbs me, and what made me write this book &#8212; you know, I had written this other book called <i>Cults, Conspiracies, and Secret Societies</i>, and it was encyclopedic.  And it was also, it was like a browsing book. And it was like a gee whiz book.  Like these are the crazy things that people believed.  And after the book came out, some of these people that I had blithely thought were crazy people kind of introduced themselves to me.  And I discovered that they&#8217;re out there.  And then, almost simultaneously with the publication of my book and the inauguration of Barack Obama, it&#8217;s the debut of Glenn Beck on FOX News.  And Glenn Beck, he&#8217;s not on mainstream TV anymore.  I don&#8217;t want to give him any more credit.  He&#8217;s an entertainer.  But he was channeling all this stuff.  I mean, if you had been as immersed in this stuff as I was, none of it was unfamiliar.  It&#8217;s called the John Birch Society, basically.  That&#8217;s the template.  And the John Birch Society template goes back to the origins of modern Western conspiracy theory, which is that fear of the Illuminatus. People that listen to rap music think the Illuminatus is something new.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But on that subject, in the book, you cite tenuous connections between Michael Jackson and Jay-Z.  I mean, how much does the Illuminatus or the Masonic society even matter in 2012 America?  I got a lot of historical examples from you.</p>
<p><b>Goldwag:</b> It matters in the imagination.  It matters as an idea.  Real Masons are regular people.  And some of them are very sophisticated people.  But they&#8217;re not the figures in the Dan Brown book or the figures on the cover of Jay-Z records. It&#8217;s something else.  But ideas are important.  Human beings live by ideas.  </p>

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Swelling with untapped emotional weight.</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> <a href="http://www.lizmoore.net/">Liz Moore</a></p>
<p><b>Subjects Discussed:</b> Emotional sincerity through a twin narrative, Mary Gordon, McNally Jackson, &#8220;grotesque&#8221; characters, Flannery O&#8217;Connor, complicated relationships with food in the developed world, body image issues, the perception of physicality, researching addictions and obsessions, Harper Lee, Beverly Cleary, Holden Caulfield, masculinity as a virtue and as a pathetic quality, feminine qualities, being the strong person in a relationship, emotional sensitivity, Paul Murray&#8217;s <i>Skippy Dies</i>, looking at the failings of our contemporary world through children, broken families and togetherness, the necessity of breaking a character in some way, the difficulties of generating plot, mystery narratives, maintaining a stacked series of coincidences, writing insecurities, ensuring the believability of events, imposing incidents, shifting back-and-forth on the book&#8217;s ending (not revealed in this conversation: don&#8217;t worry!), parallel character qualities, red herrings, readers who impose their own notions of authenticity, Elizabeth Bowen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.edrants.com/the-death-of-the-heart-modern-library-84/"><i>The Death of the Heart</i></a>, confusing sentiment with sentimentality, writing nasty and unlikable characters, the necessity of liking your characters, sincerity as a revolutionary act in 2012, Gordon Lish and style-oriented fiction, modernist writers, reading James Joyce as a teenager, &#8220;The Dead,&#8221; &#8220;Counterparts,&#8221; how different readers choose different favorite stories from <i>Dubliners</i>, giving Arthur a monied background, various characters who give Kel money, how money changes everything, withholding godlike interventions when writing fiction, an early version of <i>Heft</i> written in the third person, first person vs. third person, <i>The Words of Every Song</i>, playing around with third-person, the influence of music upon writing, listening to lots of jazz, dashed dialogue, artificially congealed viewpoints, working at a guitar shop, the best places to observe people, being easily distractable, peripheral hearing, writing exercises from Colum McCann, teaching, the meanness of people who stare through other people and pretend that they don&#8217;t exist, people who cry by themselves, the giddy embrace of an old friend, the relationship between observation and imagination, when your friends begin to die, when your friends get married and having kids, increasingly delayed marriage among twentysomethings, and assorted existential possibilities.</p>
<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B> </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I was curious, first of all, about a certain quality in this novel that is channeled through these two very different perspectives.  You have, of course, Arthur, who is this man who is an ex-professor.  He is just under 600 pounds. You have this kid, Kel, who has an alcoholic mother and the like.  What&#8217;s interesting to me is that these types of perspectives in another author&#8217;s hands might almost be grotesque or caricaturish.  Yet there&#8217;s a good deal of emotional sincerity to this work.  And I&#8217;m wondering what you did to get that.  I mean, is it a matter of knowing the characters extremely well before you set out on this journey to describe their intertwined fates?  What of this?  Let&#8217;s start from there.</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> Sure. Well, it&#8217;s interesting that you use the word &#8220;grotesque.&#8221; Because last night, actually, I had an event at McNally Jackson with Mary Gordon.  It was a conversation with Mary Gordon.  And I used the word &#8220;grotesque&#8221; to describe the characters.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Aha!</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> And she looked at me.  She correct me and said, &#8220;They&#8217;re not grotesque.  Not in the literary sense.&#8221; They&#8217;re not grotesque the way Flannery O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s characters are grotesque because neither one of them is mean or intentionally malevolent in a way.  So I think they both have good intentions. And despite the fact that Arthur is certainly grotesque-looking, I think his internal life or his interior life is &#8212; I don&#8217;t know.  There&#8217;s something pathetic about him in a way.  But I like to think that his thoughts kind of save him from whatever lack of appeal he has physically.  I hope his interior life is appealing in some way.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> The thing is: I read this and I was both conscious and not conscious of Arthur&#8217;s physicality. I mean, he describes it also on a compartmentalized level.  Like he&#8217;ll sometimes describe his belly or he&#8217;ll describe what he eats more so than who he is.  I mean, he is what he eats.  And I guess this goes back to the question of emotional sincerity and how you managed that.  Whether this is the way to turn any physicality into something more.  To nail that.  I mean, four years is a long time to work on a book.  So I&#8217;m curious.</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> Yeah. You&#8217;re talking about how&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> How you put yourself on the line emotionally.  Yeah.</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> Well, it was difficult.  So, okay, I am not obese.  I know this is a radio interview.  But I&#8217;m not.  And so I think some people have asked me, I guess, a two-part question.  One is how I know what it&#8217;s like to be obese or to compulsively overeat.  And the other is what right do I have to write from that perspective &#8212; in the same way that you might ask somebody why am I writing from the point of view of men.  What authority do I have to do that?</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;m more in the former camp. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> You&#8217;re more in the former camp. Okay.  Well, I&#8217;ll say this.  I think it is impossible in the developed world not to have a somewhat messed up relationship with food. So I&#8217;ll say this.  Because I&#8217;m a woman, from my point of view, every woman that I know has some sort of messed up relationship with food or I can imagine very clearly what it would be like to let go and to go to the very extreme place I can imagine food-wise and to just say, &#8220;That&#8217;s it.  I&#8217;ve given up.  I&#8217;m done restricting what I eat.  And therefore I&#8217;m just going to eat whatever it is that I want.&#8221;  And ao, in a sense, that was easy to imagine.  Because I have imagined it.  I mean, I don&#8217;t want to speak for every woman or every person.  But I think it&#8217;s a place that I could easily imagine myself going.  And so investing those thoughts into Arthur was easy.  I&#8217;ve had them.  In terms of his physicality, I guess that was more imaginary.  But even again, we all loathe.  I think he&#8217;s a self-loathing character. And we all loathe certain parts of ourselves. Even our own bodies.  I mean, I have spent energy in my life loathing certain parts of myself.  So that too comes, even though it&#8217;s not extreme, I&#8217;m &#8211;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Such as what?</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> I&#8217;m some place on the spectrum of both those things.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> What is it that you loathe about yourself that you can draw from?</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> My physicality &#8212; if you want me to get specific?  No, I&#8217;m not going to get specific.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Okay.  No problem.</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> But there&#8217;s&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;m just trying to get a general idea here.</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> Yeah. I mean, just growing up as a young woman, you fixate.  You almost disconnect certain parts of your body from yourself.  You disconnect.  You fixate on whatever part of your body you imagine to be grotesque &#8212; to use that word again.  And you just&#8230;you spend a lot of time and energy detaching yourself from it or imagining it as some thing outside of yourself.  And I guess that I think Arthur does that a lot by describing his failure, his gut. The way he describes it.  Or describing his chins.  Or describing the way that his gut hangs down between his legs when he sits down.  That&#8217;s almost something outside of himself.  I mean, it is outside of him.  But the way I have, or people in general sometimes think of their bodies as not being part of themselves, as being something else, interests me.  And that&#8217;s what I was imagining when I was writing Arthur. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But for his specific feelings and thoughts on food &#8212; especially the early incident with the chocolate eggs that is late in the book &#8212; I mean, did you talk to people who are overweight?  Did you observe?  Or did you draw from this sense of the imagination or this transposition of your own experiential point of view?</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> I did not go out and intentionally binge ever in researching this character.  Although that would have been a good excuse to.  If I really wanted to.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes.  &#8220;I&#8217;m having that second bowl of ice cream, dammit!&#8221;  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> Research!  I didn&#8217;t do that.  I know what it&#8217;s like to.  From history.  And I know people who are overweight.  And more than that though.  I know people who have had addictions.  And when I think of Arthur &#8212; I mean, he doesn&#8217;t just eat too much.  He has an addiction to food.  And to other things too.  To isolation and solitude and to being inside of his home.  He&#8217;s certainly, I would say, agoraphobic on some level.  And other characters in the book have addictions too.  And so I was drawing from, when I say my own experience of addiction, I don&#8217;t mean my own addictions, but my personal experience with people who have had addictions.  I wouldn&#8217;t call it research.  Because it&#8217;s just been part of my life.  And the research that I did tended to be more technical.  Like I spoke to a couple of different doctors about the medical consequences of obesity and also the medical consequences of long-term alcoholism.  There&#8217;s another character in the book who&#8217;s an alcoholic.  And also, without giving too much of the plot away, I had to research some medical interventions.  Emergency treatments and stuff like that. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You don&#8217;t necessarily have to have your left tail in your car go out in order to actually write about it.  Or did you?</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> Never had my left taillight in my car out.  Good memory. That&#8217;s outstanding. And I&#8217;ve never punched anyone. And I&#8217;ve never&#8230; (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Punched by accident too.</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> I&#8217;ve never&#8230;I&#8217;ve never&#8230;well, now we&#8217;re getting into too many plot points.  But I think every author that I&#8217;ve ever spoken to will say that personal experience is what invests the book with its energy.  But certainly very little of this book is autobiographical.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Would you say, especially with Kel, that it has been drawn from reading, for example, of Harper Lee?  There&#8217;s a Cleary in there.  Beverly Cleary?</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> Oh, I love that.  Beverly Cleary. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;m wondering, I suppose, if the muse in a sense wasn&#8217;t just the transposition theory I have offered, but also a lot of reading and wanting to capture that feeling of what it is to be young so that you can have this emotional sincerity alive on the page with Kel.</p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> Yeah.  I mean, I&#8217;ve heard Kel compared to Holden Caulfield and angry young man type characters, and I&#8217;m sure that I&#8217;ve been influenced over the years by a lot of the young &#8212; I guess the most famous adolescent characters in history.  I think it&#8217;s impossible to avoid.  But for me, he comes out of a lot of kids I grew up with, many of whom had very serious burdens that they were carrying around.  But especially the young men, who had to perform this kind of extreme bravado.  Especially the athletes too.  There&#8217;s something so sad and kind of pathetic, again, I guess you could use that word again, about watching kids, young kids, being externally macho or externally tough and internally just torn apart and really sad and lonely and needing help and having to still be tough.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Masculinity&#8217;s a pathetic quality?  Not just that quality in youth &#8212; speaking as a man, we all have our little moments, I suppose. But why do you find it to be pathetic? I mean, maybe I&#8217;m not viewing it that way &#8212; in large part because I found the book to also really grapple with issues of sensitivity in these characters.  So maybe this is a way to anchor what you might view as pathetic.  </p>
<p><b>Moore:</b> Yeah. I think masculinity can be a virtue in a lot of cases. But I think it&#8217;s the idea of having to perform it when you don&#8217;t feel it.  Or perform an extreme version of it or something that is pathetic and that makes me sad to see.  Mostly it makes me sad to see in children. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Agnieszka Holland is most recently the director of <i>In Darkness</i>, which has been nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award and opens in limited release on Febraury 10, 2012.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/aholland.jpg" alt="" title="aholland" width="400" align="center" /></p>

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Fumbling in the dark for the Zippo.</p>
<p><b>Guest:</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnieszka_Holland">Agnieszka Holland</a></p>
<p><b>Subjects Discussed:</b> Creating cinematic environments, how to design a sewer system for a Holocaust movie, the sewer as metaphor, the difficulty of locating the right sewer, Polish sewers, technical limitations on location, managing 60 to 70 people in a tight location, the differences between canalization sewers and sanitation sewers, finding sewer experts, Montreal, <i>Phantasm</i>, Andrzej Wajda&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana%C5%82_%28film%29"><i>Kanal</i></a>, <i>The Third Man</i>, cinematographic efforts to avoid the beauty of the sewers, darkness as a false beauty, avoiding candles, directing actors in real darkness, making a movie which containing numerous languages, linguistic training and actors, ovepreparing actors, the Balak Polish dialect, working with Ed Harris, importing Method acting ideas into the Polish acting community, Jennifer Jason Leigh, finding the right actors, Polish theatrical training, Holocaust fatigue, developing behavioral quirks to overcome tropes, the <i>Downfall</i> meme, <i>Olivier Olivier</i>, Holland&#8217;s experience with identity emerging as a theme in her films,  <i>Zelig</i>, being identified as the &#8220;literary culture&#8221; director during the 1990s, <i>Total Eclipse</i>, <i>The Secret Garden</i> as Holland&#8217;s favorite book as a kid, being faithful to Henry James, <i>Washington Square</i> vs. <i>The Heiress</i>, and efforts to determine why David Simon paired Holland up with Richard Price-penned scripts on <i>The Wire</i>.</p>
<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</b> </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> This actually came up in <a href="http://www.edrants.com/segundo/elliot-perlman-bss-429/">a conversation I had a few weeks ago with the Australian novelist Elliot Perlman</a>.  We were talking about the notion of Holocaust fatigue and how some books or films that deal with the Holocaust have to now face this dilemma.  I was looking at some of the reviews and some of the write-ups of this film and I noticed, for example, that <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/movies/in-darkness-from-agnieszka-holland-review.html">A.O. Scott suggested</a> that &#8220;the Holocaust movie has become a genre in its own right.&#8221; And in <i>Tablet</i>, you have <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/84701/tunnel-vision/">Daphne Merkin suggesting</a> that &#8220;the audience for Holocaust films is even smaller than the audience for Ukranian imports.&#8221; But on the other hand, I think one of the things I appreciated about this film, and also <i>Europa Europa</i>, is that you have characters who are committing adultery, who are shooting up, who are masturbating, and as a result you have behavioral quirks that almost defy these labels.  So what do you do, when you&#8217;re making a Holocaust narrative of any kind, to get away from these tropes?  Does it really come down to these behavioral quirks or what?</p>
<p><b>Holland:</b> Well, you know, I think that the Holocaust is such an important event in the human history, the border point of the humanity, that I don&#8217;t think it will disappear as a subject.  Even for the next generation. I think what happens really &#8212; it was too many of pretty superficial and not very good treatments of this period and of this subject, which change it to some kind of the moralistic sentimental kitsch and I think really &#8212; yeah, this kind of treatment, people have enough. It means, in the first, it was educationally important and work up some kind of knowledge and curiosity.  But after, it became some kind of cliche.  For me, it&#8217;s important that it&#8217;s not like, that you cannot label this as the Holocaust.  It is not really Holocaust film or it&#8217;s not the film of the Polish/Jewish relationship.  It&#8217;s a film about the human condition and the particular circumstances.  And what you know of the human nature is able to give, to deliver the best and the worst.  And that is the universal question which you can also translate to another sensitivity and another times.  I think personally that the only thing which is important: if it&#8217;s artistically successful and if it&#8217;s honest. Humanly speaking and psychologically speaking and historically speaking.  If it&#8217;s dishonest or bad, it&#8217;s bad. If it&#8217;s really powerful and goes straight to the heart of the people, you know, yes. I think that we, of course, had the ambition to shot into the heart of the people and the brain comes later, you know? And if after it wakes up the reflection, what it was, how it was possible, when was my nation in that, how I will act in those circumstances, that is a bonus.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah. Well, I agree with you. But on the other hand, you as a filmmaker are competing with, for example, <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/downfall-hitler-reacts">the <i>Downfall</i> meme</a> on the Internet.  Where they take that scene and put different subtitles with Hitler.  &#8220;Hitler has learned this.&#8221;  As a result, any serious consideration of the Holocaust now has to compete with these caricatures.  Although, oddly enough, I guess you were sort of ahead of the trend with the Hitler who&#8217;s in <i>Europa Europa</i>.</p>
<p><b>Holland:</b> Right.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But how do you deal with this?  Does it really come down to creating subcultures?  Behavioral quirks along these lines that defy all tropes?</p>
<p><b>Holland:</b> Well, you know, it&#8217;s where we are today.  And anyway, you know, the Internet.  And you think of the artifacts and the pieces of art on the Internet and the cut-and-glue, you know, kind.  It exists.  You cannot do anything about it.  And of course, you can answer the question, &#8220;How long the regular dramatic narrative will survive?&#8221; And if it will change to something different.  Some kind of interactive games or something like that.  I don&#8217;t know.  By now, it still exists and you still can touch a pretty amazing amount of people with that.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I was always curious. I&#8217;ve been wanting to ask you this.  Why are you so interested in frauds and swindlers and those who have secret identities or who are pretending to be somebody else?  I mean, even in this film, you&#8217;ve got con men. There&#8217;s the pretense with the cash. <i>Olivier Olivier</i> &#8212; is the boy real or not?  Things like that. Is this, I suppose, the result of growing up in pre-Solidarity Poland?  This natural curiosity?  Or is it just good for narrative?</p>
<p><b>Holland:</b> Probably.  Probably.  In Polish Jewish family also, where, you know, I had to change those hearts depending upon who I am talking to.  So in some way, part is my own experience.  And being woman in a man&#8217;s world.  And in general, I think that the people are wearing the masks all the time.  So that is like the basic human problem.  Who we are really in the depth of our identity and what we pretend if that real identity really exists or is just the function of the circumstances. If it&#8217;s something like the true, true, you know, true myself &#8212; someplace &#8212; and the rest is just some kind of the appearances, the true myself doesn&#8217;t exist.  Everything is appearances.  The question is asked in <i>Europa Europa</i> in a very vivid way. Because the guy had been like the <i>Zelig</i> &#8212; changing identities, depending.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And very flute-based as well.  </p>
<p><b>Holland:</b> Right. And in <i>Europa Europa</i>, it was paradoxical.  It was that his identity was his circumcised penis. If he wasn&#8217;t circumcised, probably he will become someone else totally. And that he had to remember.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> No greater physicality than that. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B> </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Tying these multifarious observations with what is in your book, I actually wanted to ask you about this intriguing period when you were at Cambridge.  You describe how you were &#8220;cheating&#8221; on essays because you wrote all of the essays in advance in your head &#8212; to the point where you were able to cite chapter and verse.</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> Yes.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Specific lines down to the line number of Shakespeare.  Specific critical reference works down to the publisher, the edition.</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> The review course. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Whether it was in trade or whether it was in hardcover.  Rather extraordinary.  And that you would actually tilt these essays in relation to the question that was asked of you.</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> That&#8217;s the point.  Exactly.  The point is: if you have an essay on <i>Othello</i>, if you have an essay on <i>Anthony and Cleopatra</i> &#8212; we&#8217;ll stick with Shakespeare just for the sake of a closed canon, so we can think about it &#8212; if you have an essay on <i>Macbeth</i>, you have a point of view.  I know I can deliver 3,000 words very quickly on <i>Macbeth</i> if I know I can.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You have 45 minutes right now, man!</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> And the question is &#8220;The essence of <i>Macbeth</i> is the difference between the microcosm of Macbeth&#8217;s mind and the macrocosm of the real world,&#8221; say.  Now that may not suit my thesis at all for <i>Macbeth</i>, which is actually to do with the way the poetry disintegrates as the play progresses.  But I can make it exactly answer that question.  You just have to polarize.  You know, it&#8217;s like getting a magnet.  Did you ever have it in &#8212; you probably were American. So I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m asking if you had them.  Those little bald men with iron filings and a magnet and you used to make beards out of them. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> That was, I think, before my time.</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> It probably was before your time.  But that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re doing.  You&#8217;re taking a magnet and you&#8217;re polarizing what you know.  Now it&#8217;s kind of cheating.  It&#8217;s not cheating really.  Because I am passionate about Shakespeare.  I love Shakespeare.  But I&#8217;m very, very lazy when it comes to exams.  And I also am aware that an examination is nothing other than the ability to pass an exam.  And what use is that?  You might as well say, &#8220;In order to qualify from Harvard University, you have to win a squash match.  Or you have to do the best Lady Bracknell of your year.  Then you&#8217;ll get your top degree.&#8221;  But why is the ability to reproduce prepared pappy ideas about intellectual concepts on paper &#8212; why is that a good reason to give someone a job in a law firm, in Wall Street, or in a publishing company for that matter?  And part of my love of technology, personally what I would love is, of course, to go all the way back to the days of ancient Greece where you had Aristotle and you had Plato and you had the Lyceum and you had the Academy.  So you would actually have a master.  And to me, this is how an ideal examination would go.  It doesn&#8217;t matter what subject the person is reading, as we say in England, or studying, as you would say here.  You would just say, &#8220;Coffee.&#8221; Now someone who&#8217;s reading history might just instantly start talking about the coffee shops and how they were banned by Charles II, how they then came back again under Queen Anne, and how they caused a movement with the coffee shops in Paris with Diderot and the Republic of Letters and Voltaire and the Enlightenment.  Or they could talk about the Secessionist Viennese coffee shops of Mahler and Klimt and so on.  And Stefan Zweig and the whole generation of intellectuals.  Rilke and Kraus and so on.  Or you could talk about coffee as: Is it an emulsion? Is it a solution? How is coffee grown?  What is it as a cash crop? What is is politically?  Ethically?  That there are some countries who are not allowed to grow food that they can eat.  They can only grow food that they can sell. Currency rates.  It&#8217;s a geopolitical issue.  You can talk about the history &#8212; here we are in a publisher&#8217;s office &#8212; about the coffee table book.  You could talk about it as a medical student.  You could talk about it as a stimulant.  You could talk about caffeine.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Worker exploitation.  Fair trade.</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> Yeah.  Basically, what you want, if you&#8217;re examining someone, is just to give them a single word and watch them run with it.  One of my absolutely favorite quotations &#8212; and I&#8217;ll try and get it right &#8212; is from <a href="http://upword.com/wilde/de_profundis.html">&#8220;De Profundis,&#8221;</a> the letter that Oscar Wilde wrote in prison to his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. Bosie, as he nicknamed him.  The man who basically destroyed his life.  The boy who destroyed his life. And at one point, he&#8217;s talking about Oxford, and he&#8217;s saying, &#8220;The fact that you didn&#8217;t get a first-class degree is a disgrace. Many first-class minds never achieve first-class degrees. The fact that you didn&#8217;t get any degree at all is no disgrace.  Many first-class minds never finish their course and get their degrees.  But what to me, Bosie, is unforgivable is that you never achieved what I believe used to be called&#8221; &#8212; he put in inverted commas &#8212; &#8220;the Oxford manner.&#8221;  And he then says, &#8220;Which I take to mean the ability to play gracefully with ideas.&#8221; Isn&#8217;t that the most beautiful definition of education you&#8217;ve ever heard?  The ability to play gracefully with ideas! So whether the idea be coffee, whether it be paper, whether it be homosexuality, whether it be floorboards, it doesn&#8217;t matter.  Because intelligence is about connection.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes!</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> So an exam question that just says, &#8220;Discuss Shakespeare&#8217;s use of imagery in <i>Measure for Measure</i>.&#8221;  Well, gah!  Come on.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But it&#8217;s actually much worse here in America.  I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with the No Child Left Behind Act, which is imposing these draconian standards and is absolutely convinced that all schools can offer 100% competence adhering to these standards.  As a result &#8212; and there&#8217;s a great book by Diane Ravitch called <i>The Death and Life of the Great American School System</i>.</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> Oh yes. I&#8217;ve heard about it.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Which outlines exactly what&#8217;s been going on.  Which means that if the school doesn&#8217;t meet these draconian standards, it gets sanctioned.  It can fire teachers and administrators who are considered to be failures.</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> The pedant in me would say that Draco was a leader of the Greek Republic at a time when every single crime was punishable by death.  Which is what &#8220;draconian&#8221; really means.  And I&#8217;m sure it isn&#8217;t draconian in that sense.  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But when the Oxford manner is in opposition like this&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> I know what you mean.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> &#8230;it&#8217;s difficult.</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> And even more in opposition to that is the other group of people, which tend to be the right-wing industrial nexus.  Whatever you might call them.  Those who have influence over politics who say that education actually is irrelevant.  What matters is vocational training. And so they want people with MBAs.  They want people with apprenticeships.  They want people who don&#8217;t have a wide, broad education and the ability to play with ideas, but who can do very specific things. Like training.  It&#8217;s training. and think of that in terms of a tree.  You know how you used to train a fruit tree against a wall. You straightened out its branches.  [<i>begins spreading arms</i>] You stapled them to the wall.  And that&#8217;s it.  And it bears fruit very efficiently.  Now we&#8217;re human beings. We&#8217;re not fruit trees.  And we&#8217;re certainly not there to have ourselves straightened out to produce fruit for the state.  We&#8217;re here to question, to wonder, to oppose.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But you are extending your arms very impressively, resembling a branch.  </p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> Thank you very much.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So I think that if you wanted to be a fruit tree, you could. You have a good line in that.</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) I&#8217;ve certainly been a good fruit. Whether or not I&#8217;m a tree &#8212; well, of course, by their fruits, shall ye know them. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> But the education point is a really interesting one.  And I don&#8217;t know what the answer to it is.  I think, oddly enough, if I am educated, if I have an education, it&#8217;s obviously one I&#8217;ve given myself.  Because that&#8217;s what, by definition, what all educations are.  You&#8217;re drawn out.  Nothing&#8217;s put in.  You&#8217;re not a bucket that is filled by a good teacher.  And one of the saddest things is when people say, &#8220;Ah, well, Shakespeare was ruined for me at school.  Because I had a terrible Shakespeare teacher.&#8221;  I would say back to them, &#8220;Yeah. It&#8217;s the Alps for me. I had this awful geography teacher.  I just find the Alps so dull.  Because I had this awful geography teacher.&#8221;  I mean, it&#8217;s ridiculous.  I think it&#8217;s either beautiful or it isn&#8217;t. You can&#8217;t blame a teacher for not being able to communicate its beauty. I can look at the Alps and see that they&#8217;re beautiful.  And if you can&#8217;t look at Shakespeare and see that it&#8217;s beautiful, don&#8217;t blame a teacher. Blame yourself for not looking hard enough.  And I know people don&#8217;t want to hear that.  But that&#8217;s the answer.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And you get into that in the book. And I actually wanted to discuss this further. I mean, I&#8217;m in agreement that, okay, we are in a world of riches. We have more information available to us than at any point in human history. But at the same time, learning about apple trees, Shakespeare, or what not, this requires time.  And if you are someone who is working two jobs, who is raising a kid, how do you factor that into your dismissal of&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> I like that. Because I&#8217;m a gay actor who doesn&#8217;t do much&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) No, no, no. It&#8217;s not that at all.</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> No. I know you weren&#8217;t. But it is funny.  I have to say &#8212; and I don&#8217;t mean this in a boastful way, but I have yet to share diaries with someone who is busier than I am.  Including politicians.  I&#8217;ve had meetings recently.  I&#8217;m trying to get&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> (<i>laughs</i>) Including politicians? Like who?</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> Well, they always say that every single hour of every day is taken up by&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Even the bathroom breaks and all that.</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> Yeah. Etcetera. And, of course, they are to some extent. But they&#8217;re not busier than me. Because that&#8217;s actually all stuff that&#8217;s done. And then when it&#8217;s done, it&#8217;s done. If you&#8217;re a writer and you have other things, it&#8217;s never finished. And I am a very, very busy person.  But you may notice I&#8217;m quite tubby.  It&#8217;s because I&#8217;m greedy. And if people say they don&#8217;t know anything, it&#8217;s only because they&#8217;re not greedy.  They&#8217;re not greedy for knowledge. Sometimes an image I give is &#8212; imagine that the Mayor of Washington was told when he was a child, &#8220;Go to London. Because the streets are paved with gold.&#8221; If he knew that in every city, the sidewalks, as you call them here &#8212; the pavements were piled high with gold coins and it made a noise. It made a kind of clashing noise as you shuffled your way through it.  And it was terrible.  And you bumped into a beggar standing with his hat out, saying, &#8220;Please.  Please. Give me some money. I&#8217;m poor. I can&#8217;t eat.&#8221;  You&#8217;d look at him and go, &#8220;What? Look around you! Just bend down and pick it up!&#8221; And that&#8217;s what I feel when people say, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right for you. You went to Cambridge and were taught things. Oh, why can&#8217;t I? I don&#8217;t know about this stuff.&#8221;  I just want to say, &#8220;Bend down and pick it up.&#8221; It&#8217;s never been more available. All it takes is greed. Curiosity.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> You are in a country where <a href="http://travel.state.gov/passport/ppi/stats/stats_890.html">most Americans don&#8217;t have a passport</a>. You are in a country where they actually don&#8217;t know these options. I&#8217;ll give you a perfect existential example of my own. So the New York Public Library &#8212; if you go in that marvelous reading room, it&#8217;s capacious. Tables. Everything. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Of course! I&#8217;m going to study. Because this is an environment totally made to not slack off in any way.&#8221; Right? But if you try to find a seat at a coffeehouse now, every single table is completely filled up with people with their laptops. And there&#8217;s often people who sit down and they have this board meeting vernacular. And you can&#8217;t get anything done. I mean, it&#8217;s to the point where it&#8217;s almost a Trail of Tears-like situation for me and my friends.  </p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> We have to go to the next coffeehouse before they discover it!  But you can pretty much almost always get a seat at the New York Public Library.  And the question is: What do we do to restore the balance? To get people understanding that, yes, the streets are paved with informational gold if you go and reach down and pick it up.  What do you think?</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> To me, this is simply prejudice.  It&#8217;s prejudice that comes from the gifts that nature never gave me.  And they were coordination and music.  Although I love music and I&#8217;m passionate about music and I listen to music every day and I collect music.  I have musical heroes that are distinct and different.  You may know that I made a film about Richard Wagner, which is very important to me.  Partly because as a Jewish person, Wagner is always going to be traumatic if you love him.  Because he was such a bestial anti-Semite.  Of course, that was not his fault.  Because he died fifty years before &#8212; literally fifty years before Hitler became Vice-Chancellor of Germany, who of course adored Wagner too.  So I do love music.  But I can&#8217;t do it. I can&#8217;t perform it.  I can&#8217;t sing. I can play the odd note on the piano. </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But can you dance?</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> Absolutely cannot dance! I can&#8217;t even begin to put myself in a position.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Have you tried to take ballroom dance lessons?</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> I would hate it!  I would loathe it!  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Come on, Stephen!  Pick it up!  The dance is right there!  (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> If you read my book, you would know my physical self-consciousness is extreme.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yeah. </p>
<p><b>Fry:</b> But bad as this sounds, and this is no complaint, the fact that I was so incompetent, so uncoordinated physically, so ungifted musically, meant that all I had to give myself any pride was language. It&#8217;s all I had. And the odd thing is that&#8217;s all any of us have. It is the miracle of the human species. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deborah Scroggins is most recently the author of <i>Wanted Women: Faith, Lies &#038; The War on Terror: The Lives of Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Aafia Siddiqui</i>.  <a href="http://www.edrants.com/dwight-garners-revisionist-ignorance-ayaan-hirsi-ali/">My response to Dwight Garner&#8217;s <i>New York Times</i> review</a>, which contains more links and information, is also helpful background reading for this interview. </p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wantedwomen.jpg" alt="" title="wantedwomen" width="400" align="center" /></p>

<p><b>Condition of Mr. Segundo:</b> Oscillating between two polar points.</p>
<p><b>Author:</b> <a href="http://deborahscroggins.com/">Deborah Scroggins</a></p>
<p><b>Subjects Discussed:</b> Salman Rushdie and the Jaipur Literature Festival debacle, India&#8217;s political sensitivity, Islamic pluralism, Theo van Gogh&#8217;s assassination, why so many intellectual figures supported Ayaan Hirsi Ali (even after revelations of falsehood), Affia Siddiqui&#8217;s fundamentalism while a student at MIT and Brandeis, Hirsi Ali&#8217;s desire to abolish Article 23 of the Dutch Constitution, Muslim schools in the Netherlands, Hirsi Ali&#8217;s belief that all Islam is dangerous, Siddiqui&#8217;s close ties to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Siddiqui&#8217;s 86 year prison sentence and murky details in the early stages of her capture, the Justice Department not trying Siddiqui on terrorism, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, how Siddiqui&#8217;s treatment has impacted U.S.-Pakistani relations, the Hague spending $3 million a year to protect Hirsi Ali in the United States, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_for_Freedom_of_Expression">the Foundation for the Freedom of Expression</a>, the degree of danger against Hirsi Ali in the U.S., Siddiqui&#8217;s lawyers backing off from initial charges that Siddiqui was being tortured in Bagram, Abu Lababa&#8217;s claims that Pakistan was going to come under attack from the United States, why Pakistan only selectively observed certain facts relating to Aafia Siddiqui, <a href="http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/national/22-Jan-2012/aafia-siddiqui-contracts-cancer-in-us-jail">unchecked claims of Siddiqui has cancer and got pregnant in prison</a>, advantages in not talking with Siddiqui and Hirsi Ali for a dual biography, Scroggins&#8217;s efforts to stay objective, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2003/10/22/pearl_3/">Daniel Pearl&#8217;s murder</a>, Bernard Henri-Lévy&#8217;s claims that there are ties between the ISI and the Deobandi jihadists, speaking with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_Khawaja">Khalid Khawaja</a>, efforts to steer Scroggins away from Siddiqui, trying to find the truth given so many inconsistent stories and motivations, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvonne_Ridley">Yvonne Ridley</a>&#8216;s press conference offering further claims concerning Siddiqui, why Scroggins unthinkingly forwarded a Pakistani journalist&#8217;s email to Siddiqui&#8217;s lawyers, how lack of journalistic care puts people in danger, Hirsi Ali&#8217;s positive qualities, finding the balance between defending extreme free speech and knowing the implications, considerations of nonviolent Islam, connections between Siddiqui and Hirsi Ali, and how extremism feeds upon itself.</p>
<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B> </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I&#8217;d like to calibrate this conversation with recent events in India.  There was, of course, the whole Salman Rushdie affair at the Jaipur Literature Festival.  He gets a report indicating that <a href="http://www.rferl.org/content/rushdie_bows_out_india_jaipur_literary_festival_muslim_protests/24457700.html">there are going to be hit men from the Mumbai underworld who are going to assassinate him</a>.  So he decides not to go.  Then he pulls out.  And then <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jan/22/i-quoted-satanic-verses-suport-rushdie">Hari Kunzru with various other authors actually read from <i>The Satanic Verses</I></a>, which is banned in India.  Then they have to leave.  And then it&#8217;s discovered that Rushdie has, in fact, been <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-16675759">relying on fabricated police reports</a>, which makes everything extremely interesting.  And then, most recently this morning, the latest escapade reaches almost a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> level in the sense that <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/02/jay-leno-joke-upset-india.html">Jay Leno tells a joke</a> and this is considered a grave offense and <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/9032304/India-to-complain-to-US-over-Jay-Leno-joke.html">they want the government to step in</a>. So all this is happening &#8212; as I&#8217;m thinking and considering your book, which deals with two key polar figures &#8212; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aafia_Siddiqui">Aafia Siddiqui</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayaan_hirsi_ali">Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a> &#8212; and I&#8217;m curious about this. It seems to me that we have an environment in which extremes beget extremes beget extremes.  And I&#8217;m wondering how understanding figures like Hirsi Ali and Siddiqui leads us to contemplating more Islamic pluralism.  Moderation.  Or is such a thing possible?  Maybe we can start off from there.</p>
<p><b>Scroggins:</b> Well, absolutely.  That could be the whole point of my book.  That extremes beget extremes.  And there&#8217;s no doubt that both of these women &#8212; Aayan Hirsi Ali and Aafia Siddiqui &#8212; owe their fame to their enemies.  Because if Ayaan Hirsi Ali had never been threatened, she would never have been asked to stand for Parliament in the Netherlands.  And then if her film collaborator, Theo van Gogh, hadn&#8217;t been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3974179.stm">murdered on the streets of Amsterdam</a>, she wouldn&#8217;t have become internationally famous.  Aafai Siddiqui, on the other hand, became famous because she was hunted by the CIA and because the CIA and the Pakistani government were actually kidnapping people and holding them in secret prisons, it came to be believed that they were lying when they said that they didn&#8217;t know where Aafia Siddiqui was.  And no one would believe them, even though in this case they probably were telling the truth.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But how, using the lives of these two women, does a legitimate concern for radical Islam&#8217;s suppression of women transform into extremism?  I mean, is it the inevitability of the present climate?  Whether it be in India or the Netherlands or elsewhere?</p>
<p><b>Scroggins:</b> Well, I don&#8217;t think it has to.  I think there are thousands and thousands of women, Muslim women, working to improve women&#8217;s rights in the Muslim world who don&#8217;t necessarily see a conflict between Islam and democracy and human rights.  There&#8217;s fascinating things happening as we&#8217;ve seen with the Arab Spring.  So it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way.  But in Ayaan Hirsi Ali&#8217;s case, she has taken the position that Islam is to blame for the oppression of women in the Muslim world.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> All of it.</p>
<p><b>Scroggins:</b> Yeah.  So that&#8217;s her stance.  And it&#8217;s been an enormously popular one in the West.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Why do you think it&#8217;s so popular in the West?  And why do you think Ayaan Hirsi Ali has managed to attract so many notable intellectual figures?  As you point out in the book, Rushdie and Sam Harris author <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/la-oe-harris9oct09,0,3351338.story">this <i>LA Times</i> editorial</a>.  You&#8217;ve got, of course, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/05/the_caged_virgin.html">Christopher Hitchens supporting her</a> &#8212; three days later, <a href="http://docforfree.com/the-holy-ayaan.html">revelations occur</a> &#8212; in <i>Slate</i> Magazine.  You have <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2007/02/the_infidel_europeans_love_to_hate.html">Anne Applebaum</a>. And they&#8217;re still supporting her &#8212; even as it&#8217;s discovered that she has <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4986418.stm">lied about her asylum application</a>. Even as she is demanding <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,535589,00.html">a 50 million Euro security detail</a> from the EC.  Unsuccessfully.  I&#8217;m curious how a person like this also becomes <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1972656_1972691_1973029,00.html">one of the 100 Most Influential People</a> named by <i>Time</i> Magazine.  Is it pure charisma?  What is the intellectual value of a figure like Hirsi Ali?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.edrants.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/scroggins.jpg" alt="" align="left" title="scroggins" width=250 /><b>Scroggins:</b> Well, the idea that Islam is responsible for the oppression of women is a very old idea in the West.  It goes back hundreds of years.  So it&#8217;s got a lot of roots here.  So when somebody says that, it basically coincides with what people believe.  So that&#8217;s one reason.  I think with Ayaan Hirsi Ali, what really has made her so popular is her incredibly personal story.  It&#8217;s very inspiring how she tells it.  Her coming to the West.  Becoming converted to Western ideas.  Shaking off Islam.  And then being threatened with death for speaking out against it.  A lot of people feel very sympathetic to her and feel inspired by her because of that.  So I think that&#8217;s really why she&#8217;s gained such an influential backing.  And as to why she got named the 100 Most Influential People, that came right after the murder of Theo van Gogh.  And I think it was sort of a sympathy vote on <i>Time</i> Magazine&#8217;s part.  Because prior to all this, she was a very new junior legislator in the Dutch Parliament.  Not somebody who would normally be considered one of the most influential people in the world.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> It&#8217;s fascinating to me that a good story would be all it would take to ingratiate yourself into the intellectual world.  And as we&#8217;ve seen with the Rushdie thing, he also fell for a good story as well. I mean, why do you think that narrative seems to trump the investigation?  Is it difficult, as you learned over the course of writing this book, to pluck away at the pores, so to speak? </p>
<p><b>Scroggins:</b> Yes, it is.  Because a lot of her story is true.  And it is inspiring to people.  So that&#8217;s a big part of it.  Some of the things that have come out &#8212; for example, the stories that she told to the asylum authorities.  You ask why haven&#8217;t her backers backed away from her on account of that.  Well, I think it&#8217;s because a lot of them feel like they might have done the same thing under the same circumstances.  There&#8217;s still a lot of sympathy for her, despite the fact.  And she has admitted to these lies.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> So she&#8217;s offered enough remorse in the viewpoint of many of these figures who are supporting her.</p>
<p><b>Scroggins:</b> Yeah. I don&#8217;t know if she&#8217;s remorseful.  Because she admits that if she hadn&#8217;t done it, she would never have become the person that she is today.  And it&#8217;s hard to see how she would.  She would have remained in Kenya.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Well, let&#8217;s try to swap between Siddiqui and Hirsi Ali, comparable to your book.  When Aafia Siddiqui was getting her doctorate in neuroscience at Brandeis, she actually told her professors that the Koran prefigured scientific knowledge and that the scientist&#8217;s job was to discover how the laws of the Koran worked.  I&#8217;m curious. How was she able to get away with this approach at MIT and Brandeis?  I mean, she was able to go ahead and cleave to these religious views and still actually get her education.  Can we chalk this up to a profound misunderstanding of Islam at our highest institutions?  What of this?</p>
<p><b>Scroggins:</b> Well, when she started saying these things at Brandeis, her professors were completely shocked.  They told me that they had never had a fundamentalist of any description in the program, the neuroscience program at Brandeis.  And they actually went back to MIT and they tried to find out.  Had she had these views when she had been an undergraduate at MIT?  And as far as they could find out, she hadn&#8217;t said anything in the science classes at MIT that led anyone to believe that she was a fundamentalist.  So that&#8217;s one of the mysteries.  Whether she sort of changed her views and became more outspoken or whether just nobody paid any attention at MIT.  But at any event, by the time that she came to Brandeis, she was done speaking out about this.  She was such a brilliant student.  She could do all the work, the scientific work, and still make straight As.  And her professors still told her, &#8220;You&#8217;ve just got to keep religion out of it.&#8221;  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> And that was enough.</p>
<p><b>Scroggins:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>EXCERPT FROM SHOW:</B> </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I should point out that, as an ambivert, I&#8217;m one of those types who swings both ways.  I go ahead and ingratiate myself with all forms of version.  I&#8217;m wondering if it&#8217;s entirely productive to divide the world into these two austere bipolar categories.  As you point out in the book, David Sloan Wilson applied these labels to the fruit fly.  And I&#8217;m wondering if, say, a Kinsey scale of 1 to 6 &#8212; to pound the metaphor in here further &#8212; is probably more applicable for this kind of thing.  I mean, why should introverts of all stripes be lumped together?</p>
<p><b>Cain:</b> Yeah  Okay. So that&#8217;s actually a really important question that you&#8217;re raising.  And the reality is that there&#8217;s an introvert-extrovert spectrum and that we&#8217;re all situated on different points of the spectrum and that even people who are on the extreme end of the spectrum, whether introverts or extroverts, have sides to themselves that are the opposite side.  And Jung &#8212; Carl Jung, who is the psychologist who actually popularized these terms &#8212; speaks about that.  And he says that there&#8217;s no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert and that such a man would be in an insane asylum.  So it&#8217;s an important question that you&#8217;re asking.  But at the same time that this is true and that we&#8217;re all a glorious mishmosh of traits, there is also a reality to what it means to be, in general, oriented towards the outer world or, in general, more oriented to the riches that are inside your own mind.  And these things I believe, these orientations, shape who we are in ways that are as profound as our gender shapes us.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But gradients of orientation.  I mean, that&#8217;s the key thing.  Jung, of course, as you point out, he popularizes the terms in 1921.  You have Hans Eysenck doing research in the late 1960s, hypothesizing that humans sought &#8220;just right&#8221; levels of stimulation.  And he ran some tests.  So where do we, I suppose, calibrate ourselves if we&#8217;re all going to all refer to people as &#8220;You&#8217;re only an introvert&#8221; or &#8220;You&#8217;re only an extrovert.&#8221;  I mean, we could get vertist, so to speak. (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Cain:</b> Right. I guess I would take the &#8220;only&#8221; out of that formulation.  It&#8217;s not &#8220;you&#8217;re only an introvert&#8221; or &#8220;you&#8217;re only an extrovert.&#8221;  You&#8217;re a million other things as well.  But I guess a metaphor that I could give for you, that I think is helpful here, is gender.  So if I had written a book that presumed to say, &#8220;Here&#8217;s what men are like and here&#8217;s what women are like,&#8221; I probably would have been able to get it mostly right describing these categories as groups.  But in the case of any one individual, there are going to be men with all kinds of female characteristics and women with all kinds of male characteristics.  That doesn&#8217;t mean though that there&#8217;s no such thing as maleness or femaleness.  And that doesn&#8217;t mean that these things aren&#8217;t hugely important and shape our lives in ways we need to pay attention to.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes, but such a book would spawn a million Jezebel threads.</p>
<p><b>Cain:</b> (<i>laughs</i>)</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> There&#8217;s a danger, I suppose, in cleaving to these labels.  And I guess maybe another way of trying to figure out what&#8217;s going on here in terms of the schism between the introverts and the extroverts is through <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/03/caring-for-your-introvert/2696/">a wonderful 2003 Jonathan Rauch article in <i>The Atlantic</i></a>, not quoted here.</p>
<p><b>Cain:</b> Yes.  Fantastic article.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> &#8220;Caring for Your Introvert.&#8221; He was willing to go on the line and say that introverts are oppressed.  I&#8217;m wondering if you would go on the line as well.  You didn&#8217;t in this book.  But to what degree are they oppressed?  I mean, since 2003, we&#8217;ve seen Google and Apple, products of introverts, spring up.  And we&#8217;re all enslaved by them.  So I think the balance may be more or less stabilized.  What do you think about all this?</p>
<p><b>Cain:</b> Okay, so first of all, I would say I did go on the line in this book.  And the central thesis of my book really is there is a severe bias against most introverts in this society and that operates to all of our losses.  Certainly to the loss of introverts who get the message in a million different ways that there&#8217;s something wrong with who they are.  But I think it operates to the loss of everybody.  Because when we set up society in a way that depletes the energies of half to a third of the population, that&#8217;s not in anybody&#8217;s best interest.  So that&#8217;s my feeling about it.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> But no real oppression.  I mean, if the extroverts are in control, do you think that there&#8217;s been enough of a comeback of the introverts in the years since that Rauch article? </p>
<p><b>Cain:</b> Well, okay, so I think it&#8217;s an interesting thing.  When I talk about a bias, I&#8217;m not saying, &#8220;Well, therefore introverts have had no happiness and no success in society.&#8221;  And the examples that you just gave are very interesting and apt ones.  But here&#8217;s the thing.  Those examples, they&#8217;re not accidents.  We tend to have respect for the loner who&#8217;s operating in his garage and is about to launch a fabulously successful company or who holds the promise of launching such a company.  We have respect for that person.  Because that person carries with him the whiff of great wealth or power.  But what I&#8217;m talking about is something that operates at a deeper level of self.  And the fact is that if you look at our schools and our workplaces, the institutions where we all spend our lives and where our daily happiness is shaped, those institutes are set up for extroverts.  In ways that we&#8217;re not aware of.  So children from the time they go into preschool at a very early age, they are going into an environment that is a group environment where they are expected to behave in certain ways.  I&#8217;m not saying this is all a bad thing.  But I am saying that it&#8217;s set up in such a way that introverted children from the get go are kind of expected to act in ways that are being not themselves.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Yes. But it&#8217;s interesting to me that the loner has moved from the sort of James Dean <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>/Marlon Brando kind of thing to the guy going ahead, like Wozniak, and fiddling around with tools in his garage, in his bedroom, starting a company.  And I&#8217;m wondering if the loner model has always been associated with introverts or whether there has been some outsider label instead.  It seems to me that, because the idea of being a loner was predicated in some way on being a loner in relation to society, you weren&#8217;t entirely an introvert.  You were more an outsider.  You were still an extrovert in some sense.  And yet it has moved in the decades since to the Wozniakian model, where you&#8217;re tinkering with some massive project that&#8217;s going to change the world in your garage.  I&#8217;m wondering if you had some thoughts on why &#8220;loner&#8221; has almost been co-opted and has become more related to this introversion idea.</p>
<p><b>Cain:</b> Oh, that&#8217;s interesting.  I think that&#8217;s probably just a function of the role that technology has played in the last decades.  You know, what you&#8217;re talking about really is ways in which we have shifted notions of glamour as attached to individual people.  So in the &#8217;50s, the decade of conformity, there was a glamour attached to the figure who could stand outside that and still have sex appeal.  And then what happens in the decades of technology is suddenly we have introverts who, just because of their great technical competence, can create wealth and power.  And so glamour attaches to them.  </p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Introverts aren&#8217;t sexy?  I think they are.  I think they&#8217;re being celebrated in our culture.  The &#8220;Think different&#8221; billboards that we got with Apple.  It&#8217;s been all about &#8220;Yes, introverts are sexy. But we just don&#8217;t communicate with other people.&#8221;  You think that they aren&#8217;t sexy these days?</p>
<p><b>Cain:</b> No, what I was saying is that what was happening as technology grew up was that there was a glamour that was attached to that.  But what I still believe is that that&#8217;s a subset of the reality of what it means to be introverted.  And even if you go out to Silicon Valley, the heart of the subset where you would say that this glamour model for lack of a better word is operating &#8212; you know, even in Silicon Valley, I went out there while I was researching my book.  And I talked to many introverts who were working there.  And even there, they feel that their personality style is not validated, that it&#8217;s not celebrated.  And they&#8217;re constantly exhorted to act in a way that&#8217;s not natural to themselves.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> I suppose this relates to the initial line of inquiry.  When you are talking about introverts, when you are promoting introverts, they inevitably feed into this marketing, advertorial sort of approach, where it&#8217;s not so much about trying to understand the introvert&#8217;s place.  It&#8217;s more about promoting the introvert.  This leads me to also name a figure who you didn&#8217;t name in the book &#8212; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">Edward Bernays</a>. I mean, we were talking about Jung earlier.  But he relied upon Freudian ideas to promote the idea of being empowered, that manipulation could be used to factor in the herd crowd.  &#8220;Herd&#8221; is a word used frequently in your book. Do you think that one of the problems with introverts being misunderstood or not accepted has a lot to do with this maligning or skirmishing of psychology with these larger marketing forces? </p>
<p><b>Cain:</b> Well, I think that it goes back even earlier than that.  It starts out with there being this kernel in our society.  We are a culture that is grounded on Greco-Roman ideals.  And these are ideals that celebrate oratory and celebrate being able to declaim in front of people.  So that&#8217;s a piece of it.  But that&#8217;s only a small piece really.  Because what really happened was, at the turn of the 20th century, we moved from what cultural historians call a culture of character and we moved into a culture of personality.  And this happened because suddenly we had the rise of big business.  And we had urbanization.  So you had people flocking into the cities.  And instead of living in small towns and working with people they had known all their lives, they&#8217;re suddenly in big cities applying for jobs at corporations, where everything depends on their abilities to shine at a job interview and to be able to sell their company&#8217;s latest gizmo and, of course, to sell themselves. At the same time, you have the rise of movies.  And movie stars are the perfect model for this.</p>
<p><b>Correspondent:</b> Of course.</p>
<p><b>Cain:</b>  They are the ultimate role models of this kind of charisma that people are starting to feel they need in their everyday lives.  And so in a way, there used to be in the earlier years of this country&#8217;s founding, where it used to be that these oratorical skills and this ability to command a crowd was seen as being important only for political figures.  Now it was something that everybody suddenly had to have.  And at the core of all this was the corporation really.  That was why people started to feel that they needed to have these skills.</p>
