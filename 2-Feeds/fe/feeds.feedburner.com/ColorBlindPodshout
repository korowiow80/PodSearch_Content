			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/04/faisal-shahzad-arrest-lie_n_562834.html" target="_blank">HuffPo article</a>, Ryan Grim writes: &#8220;In arguing against the reading of Miranda rights to terrorism suspects&#8230; Joe Lieberman has a creative solution: Take away their citizenship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some humans act as if we can somehow live in a state where there is perpetual light without dark. Changing the rules when faced with darkness in an effort to stave off our feelings of mortality doesn&#8217;t at all change the eventual outcome: that we will, some day, meet our end.</p>
<p>Facing the darkness with bravery and maintaining one&#8217;s integrity, even when confronted with something as horrible as what Faisal Shahzad tried to do, is much more admirable than trying to switching the chess pieces around when you feel you&#8217;re losing, Lieberman. By trying to employ the old switcheroo, Lieberman shows he has no faith in our American system of justice.</p>
<p>To carry my point to an absurdist conclusion but one that may contain a whiff of truth based on Lieberman&#8217;s consistently bizarre political antics: It&#8217;s unfortunate that Lieberman doesn&#8217;t believe in America.</p>
<p>Frida Potente, I am Malan<br />
Be your true identity.<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carmen Van Kerckhove makes issues of race her business. Van Kerckhove heads up New Demographic, a diversity education firm &#8220;dedicated to promoting relaxed, authentic, and productive conversations about race.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her work in the areas of race relations, racial identity, and diversity have lead to her appearance on <a class="zem_slink" title="CNN" rel="homepage" href="http://www.cnn.com/">CNN</a> and <a class="zem_slink" title="MSNBC" rel="homepage" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/">MSNBC</a> and, ultimately, to her acceptance to the Malan race.</p>
<p>Van Kerckhove is not only familiar with diversity and trans- and interracial issues from the standpoint of an educator, but also from that of a <a class="zem_slink" title="Multiracial" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiracial">mixed-heritage</a> person—she describes herself as being of mixed Chinese and Belgian heritage. The I Am Malan Council hopes Van Kerckhove will readily add Malan to the list of elements that make-up her identity.</p>
<p>Frida Potente explains the decision to offer Van Kerckhove membership to the Malan race: &#8220;The work Carmen is doing to create a higher level of comfort in discussing issues of race is vital to getting us all to a point where we can move past the distraction of misconceptions and stereotypes, and really start getting closer to a place of empathy and humility.</p>
<p>Being candid about racial issues, creating an atmosphere where we are comfortable and unafraid to talk about what ails us—that&#8217;s the first step to revealing the underlying connections that exist between us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Malan race is defined by ideology rather than by superficialities. Malans transcend racial stereotypes and the boundaries of archaic race categories. Malans form bonds based on linkages deeper than skin and, as a result, help move the world closer to racial unity, improved race relations, and toward the end of racism.</p>
<p>Membership to the Malan race is by invitation or award only, although invitations can be requested on the group&#8217;s site, <a href="http://www.iammalan.org/">http://www.iammalan.org</a>. <a class="zem_slink" title="Stephen Colbert" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Michael Moore" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore">Michael Moore</a>, and John Oliver are recent Malan membership recipients.</p>
<p>Potente adds, &#8220;Carmen is a leader in the field and we are so pleased to extend membership to her. We are eager to learn from and grow with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>A popular blogger and podcaster, Van Kerckhove&#8217;s internet radio show, Addicted to Race, and her blog Love Isn&#8217;t Enough: On Raising a Family in a Colorstruck World, have lead to her being cited on NPR, <a class="zem_slink" title="USA Today" rel="homepage" href="http://www.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a>, and <a class="zem_slink" title="New York Times" rel="homepage" href="http://www.newyorktimes.com">The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the welcome process, Van Kerckhove will receive an official Malan race certificate, as well as a short guide detailing how to live in the world as a Malan, and how to educate others on her new racial identity. An expanded FAQ—a condensed version of which is available on <a href="http://www.iammalan.org/">http://www.iammalan.org</a> -will also be provided.</p>

<div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 110px"><br />
<a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/2539659/michael_moore_no_longer_afraid_of_himself.html?cat=48"><img class="  " title="TOKYO - NOVEMBER 30:  Director Michael Moore a..." src="http://cache.daylife.com/imageserve/08jR9zv9AE7Tb/100x150.jpg" alt="TOKYO - NOVEMBER 30:  Director Michael Moore a..." width="100" height="150" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image by Getty Images via Daylife</p></div>
</div>
<p>“White people scare the crap out of me,” <a class="zem_slink" title="Michael Moore" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore">Michael Moore</a> famously wrote in his 2001 book, <em><a class="zem_slink" title="Stupid White Men" rel="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Stupid-White-Men-Micheal-Moore/dp/B000LMT67U%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000LMT67U">Stupid White Men</a></em><em> &#8230;and Other Excuses for the State of the Nation! </em>Now a new member of the Malan race, at least Moore can no longer be afraid of himself.</p>
<p>Equally loved and not-so-loved—depending on the side of the fence one perches on—for his in-your-face, never back down, take-a-long-hard-and-extreme-close-up-look-at-this-mess approach to filmmaking, Moore and his films <em><a class="zem_slink" title="Roger &amp; Me [Region 2]" rel="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Roger-Me-Region-Michael-Moore/dp/B00013KCLS%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB00013KCLS">Roger &amp; Me</a></em>, <em><a class="zem_slink" title="Fahrenheit 9/11" rel="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Fahrenheit-9-11-Michael-Moore/dp/B000SINT52%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000SINT52">Fahrenheit 9/11</a></em>, <em><a class="zem_slink" title="Sicko (Special Edition)" rel="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Sicko-Special-Michael-Moore/dp/B000UNYJXQ%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000UNYJXQ">Sicko</a></em>, and <em>Capitalism: A Love Story</em>, among others, have garnered him a large audience of supporters and a slew of awards, including a 2002 <a class="zem_slink" title="Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Documentary_Feature">Academy Award for Documentary Feature</a> for his gun violence exposé, <em><a class="zem_slink" title="Bowling for Columbine [Region 2]" rel="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Bowling-Columbine-Region-Michael-Moore/dp/B0000916TJ%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB0000916TJ">Bowling for Columbine</a></em>.</p>
<p>Although Moore’s stance on issues such as American culture, and domestic and international policy is sometimes met with chilliness from those not leaning in his particularly liberal direction—such as at his Oscar acceptance speech where he blasted then <a class="zem_slink" title="George W. Bush" rel="homepage" href="http://www.georgewbushlibrary.gov">President George W. Bush</a> and was greeted by “loud boos from the audience of 3,500”—it is his gumption and courage to speak his discoveries and insights that earned him a place amongst the people of the Malan race. Moore joins fellow Malans Stephen Colbert and John Oliver who have both been recently adopted into the fledgling race.</p>
<p>“Part of being Malan is being able to nurture and empower the people around you,” says Frida Potente, President of the I Am Malan Council, “Michael does this with his films and books. He knows how to get things done in the world, how to convey a powerful message that incites in viewers and readers a new understanding of the issues and, in many, a desire to affect change. Michael is a mentor and we look forward to learning from and growing with him.”</p>
<p>Potente says that Malans are not bonded as a group by external appearances as are almost all other races. Instead, Malans identify as a <a class="zem_slink" title="Race (classification of human beings)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28classification_of_human_beings%29">racial group</a> by their ideology rather than by, what the group refers to as, external superficialities.</p>
<p>Moore will also be presented with a posthumously awarded Malan race membership certificate for his one-time friend, Ray Simon. Simon was a marketing consultant and author, and used his talents to help Moore with the development of his website in the early part of the decade. Simon succumbed to cancer in 2002.</p>
<p>Simon published <em>Mischief Marketing</em>, which offers at once guerilla-style yet light-hearted advice on marketing to those with miniscule promotion budgets. He advocated innovation, creativity, and even undertaking gray area, borderline-legal but always safe and at least minimally-sane marketing strategies.</p>
<p>Simon wrote, “When you are on the verge of doing something important but difficult, people around you will often fail to recognize or appreciate what you’re doing.”</p>
<p>Simon, Moore would likely agree, would have appreciated being inducted into the Malan race.</p>
<p>As part of the welcome process, Moore will receive official Malan race certificates for both himself and Simon, as well as a short guide detailing how to live in the world as a Malan, and how to educate others on his new racial identity. An expanded FAQ&#8211; a condensed version of which is available on <a href="http://www.iammalan.org/" target="_blank">http://www.iammalan.org</a>&#8211;will also be provided to Moore.</p>

</div>
<p>John Oliver&#8217;s recent journalistic walloping of Swiss UN Ambassador Peter Maurer prompted his swift nomination and selection for membership to the Malan race. Oliver joins fellow Malans <a class="zem_slink" title="Stephen Colbert (character)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Colbert_%28character%29">Stephen Colbert</a> and <a class="zem_slink" title="Michael Moore" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore">Michael Moore</a> who were recently adopted into the new race.</p>
<p>Oliver interviewed Maurer following The Daily Show&#8217;s coverage of Switzerland&#8217;s vote to ban the building of minarets. Jason Linkins discusses Oliver&#8217;s approach in the Huffington Post: &#8220;[He] used the news story to make a point about the overall character of the nation of Switzerland. Rather</p>
<p>than take the glib remarks of Switzerland&#8217;s UN Ambassador Peter Maurer at face value, presenting them as stenography and letting it stand as just another &#8216;interesting viewpoint&#8217; in the marketplace of ideas, he confronted the illogic and batted it back, unconcerned that it would make his interviewee upset or ruin someone&#8217;s opportunity to have &#8216;access.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>A <a class="zem_slink" title="Stand-up comedy" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy">stand-up comedian</a> and staple anchor on the long-running, Emmy-winning news satire show, <em><a class="zem_slink" title="The Daily Show" rel="imdb" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115147/">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</a></em>, Oliver&#8217;s political commentary and fearless journalistic style made him an ideal Malan race candidate. But it was Oliver&#8217;s tête-à-tête with the Swiss UN Ambassador that clinched the deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Malan people can talk with anyone on any topic, and can communicate persuasively and movingly. Oliver demonstrates this through his comedy and his journalism, satire or otherwise. He creates an environment where people find themselves thinking about old ideas in new ways,&#8221; said Frida Potente, president of the I Am Malan Council.</p>
<p>The Malan race is defined by ideology rather than by superficialities. Malans aim to transcend racial stereotypes and the boundaries of archaic race categories by forming bonds based on linkages deeper than skin. Their hope is that, as a result, they can help move the world closer to racial unity, improved race relations, and toward the end of <a class="zem_slink" title="Racism" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism">racism</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the welcome process, Oliver received an official Malan race certificate, as well as a short guide detailing how to live in the world as a Malan, and how to educate others on his new racial identity. An expanded FAQ&#8211; a condensed version of which is available on <a href="http://www.iammalan.org">http://www.iammalan.org</a>&#8211;was also be provided to Mr. Oliver.</p>

<p>Stephen Colbert&#8217;s “disability,” color-blindness, makes him an ideal member of the new Malan race.</p>
<p><a class="zem_slink" title="Seattle" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle">Seattle, WA</a> (PRWEB) December 16, 2009 &#8212; He&#8217;s been knighted, received an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts degree, and now it has been declared that he is no longer <a class="zem_slink" title="Caucasian race" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race">Caucasian</a> and has been adopted into a new race. Stephen Colbert, the popular, late-night, news satirist often speaks candidly on his show about his self-diagnosed “disability”: color-blindness. It is, in fact, this very disability that proved the key to his selection as a member of the Malan race.</p>
<p>Colbert has made much of his “race-blindness,” even revealing during his coverage of the <a class="zem_slink" title="Inauguration of Barack Obama" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Barack_Obama">Obama inauguration</a> that he believed himself to be a black man.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It has been declared that he is no longer Caucasian and has been adopted into a new race.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Now, I don&#8217;t see race … People tell me I&#8217;m white, and I believe them, because I own a lot of Jimmy Buffett albums,&#8221; said Colbert in an airing of his multiple <a class="zem_slink" title="Emmy Award" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award">Emmy Award</a>-winning show, “<a class="zem_slink" title="The Colbert Report" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colbert_Report">The Colbert Report</a>.”</p>
<p>It may come as no surprise to Colbert, then, when he learns later this week that he is neither white nor black. He is Malan.</p>
<p>Colbert was selected to become one of the early members of the fledgling Malan race and is scheduled to receive official Malan membership certification in the coming days.</p>
<p>Mr. Colbert&#8217;s nomination and subsequent acceptance into the Malan race was based, in large part, on his color-blindness. Malans renounce racial stereotypes and archaic racial definitions, and identify as a racial group by their ideology rather than by, what the group refers to as, external superficialities.</p>
<p>The small-but-growing members of the Malan race found that Mr. Colbert&#8217;s “race-blindness” typified one of the central tenets that bonds the racial group together, and are pleased to officially welcome him into the race.</p>
<p>As part of the welcome process, Mr. Colbert will receive an official Malan race certificate, as well as helpful tips on how to live in the world as a Malan, and how to educate others on his new racial identity. An expanded FAQ&#8211; a condensed version of which is available on <a href="http://www.iammalan.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.iammalan.org</a> &#8211;will also be provided to Mr. Colbert.</p>
<p>About<br />
The Malan race (<a href="http://www.iammalan.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iammalan.org/</a>) is defined by ideology rather than by superficialities. Malans transcend racial stereotypes and the boundaries of archaic race categories. Malans form bonds based on linkages deeper than skin and, as a result, help move the world closer to racial unity, improved race relations, and toward the end of racism.</p>

<p><script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"></script> Naturally, there was some trepidation on my part about creating a new race.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I approached a professor of sociology at a local university with the idea. Mainly, I was interested in her thoughts and feedback.  “That’s pretty far out there,” she said, and the expression on her face echoed her words.</p>
<p>I thought then as I do now: the idea was not as far out there as our long-standing attempts to classify people by somewhat arbitrary and superficial criteria. As people married those of different “races,” and/or found themselves growing up in lands far away from their place of birth, the idea that race could be quantified solely by one’s exterior appearance or place of birth–both things over which one has no control–began to take on a rather silly quality.</p>
<p>If a young woman is born of dark-skinned African parents, but grows up in Russia, and identifies with the culture of her adoptive country because it is all she knows, can she not simply be Russian?</p>
<p>Why does it upset others so if such a person chooses solely to be Russian? She might hear from her dark-skinned counterparts that she is a race traitor. She might hear from her adoptive comrades that she is not truly Russian. Why should either of those things be true?</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that, Africans whose ancestors hailed from Europe can be, quite simply, African. And certainly there is no denying the blonde-haired, blue-eyed Colombiana her Hispanic identity. There seems to be little quibble when the masses are presented with this cross-over. I accept the elegance of both the idea and practice of such cross-over, and the ease with which it is accepted. So much do I admire it, that I choose to borrow the concept for a larger purpose.</p>
<p>Let’s take a larger view: A young adult can choose from an infinite list of identity characteristics when moving into who they wish to be. Is it true that certain choices must be off-limits?</p>
<p>I can choose whether to be a criminal or not, whether to pursue art or business as a career, whether to volunteer or keep my time and money to myself, whether or not to have children. All of these things are part of one’s identity. Yet the race with which we identify, well, that’s off limits.</p>
<p>Silly, I say.</p>
<p>No more of that silliness.</p>
<p>I advocate choice in all areas of our lives. The choice to identify with a racial group not based on something as superficial as external appearance or where we happened to be at the time our mothers hit the 9-month gestation mark, but based, instead, on what and whom we most identify with. Based on values. Based on ideas and ideals we support.</p>
<p>These reasons and more are why I chose to be Malan. And why, you too, may choose to be Malan, as well.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
