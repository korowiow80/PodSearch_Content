			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/06/06/gregg-popovich-tells-a-reporter-their-boss-did-a-bad-job/gregg-popovich-press-angry/" rel="attachment wp-att-40512"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40512" title="This is his happy face." src="http://blogimages.thescore.com/tbj/files/2012/06/gregg-popovich-press-angry.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="354" /></a></p>
<p>Gregg Popovich hates answering questions and we all love him for it, which is a weird conundrum but this is not The Discussions About the Role of Media in the 21st Century Jones, so let&#8217;s just acknowledge this point and move on. Whether it be a four-word interview during a game of a &#8220;Geez oh wiz&#8221; during a postgame podium sesh, Pop is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcegYF_Ti78">never shy</a> to show his disdain for stupid questions.</p>
<p>He hates answering questions so much, in fact, that he&#8217;s going to run his insults up the chain of command until even editors know it&#8217;s not worth interviewing him. That&#8217;s what happened yesterday at Spurs practice and The Oklahoman&#8217;s Darnell Mayberry was on hand to <a href="https://twitter.com/DarnellMayberry/status/210131424949448704">document</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DarnellMayberry/status/210131603949764608">the</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DarnellMayberry/status/210131716348710912">exchange</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Question to Gregg Popovich: &#8220;Do you ever feel like too much of a big deal is made of officiating when it comes to the Playoffs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pop: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. We haven&#8217;t mentioned it at all. Is somebody mentioning it?&#8221; Reporter: &#8220;No.&#8221; Pop: &#8220;Then why do you ask that question?&#8221;</p>
<p>Reporter: &#8220;Because I have a boss.&#8221; Pop: &#8220;Tell your boss to think of a better question.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I feel like if this would have kept going, Pop would have ended up saying things like &#8220;And tell your publisher to find a more environmentally friendly printer&#8221; or  &#8220;Maybe you should talk to your business development people about reworking their subscription model.&#8221; Throwing shots at an editor is pretty deep, but it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if Gregg Popovich could go Cobb on this thing and take it even deeper. He&#8217;s a smart guy. I&#8217;m sure he knows how newspapers work and could easily come up with a few more journalism zingers.</p>

<p>On today&#8217;s playoff edition of &#8220;The Fix,&#8221; Skeets and Tas breakdown Game 5 of the Celtics-Heat Eastern Conference Finals. Topics discussed include: Whether Miami&#8217;s loss should be pinned on LeBron, Rondo&#8217;s tip-pass turning point, Bosh&#8217;s minutes, the Heat&#8217;s brutal transition defense, Pierce&#8217;s cold-blooded three, podium pussies, and 2012 Kevin Garnett. All that, plus denim vests, jogging, a Thunder-Spurs prediction, and the Internet&#8217;s hottest new meme — <a href="http://www.facebook.com/thebasketballjones/posts/147488662052584">Good Job, Good Effort Kid</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to think of an Amar&#8217;e Stoudemire in &#8220;The Warriors&#8221; joke for about half an hour, but there&#8217;s nothing to really say when a grown man wears a <a href="http://twitpic.com/9t8862">denim vest and fedora</a>. Just look at him. That should be enough.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Basketball is a great sport and these are important things that happened.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://bit.ly/NGQrim" alt="" width="590" height="325" /></p>
<p><strong>Ballin</strong>: 26 points, 11 rebounds, two assists, a steal and two blocks for Kevin Garnett, who will <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t17nv-VN9uw">happily tell you</a> that he&#8217;s not too old to be performing at such a high level. Well, maybe &#8220;happily&#8221; isn&#8217;t the right word.</p>
<p><strong>Not so much</strong>: LeBron James didn&#8217;t score from the 8:10 mark to the 0:09 mark in the fourth quarter. I&#8217;m sure no one will mention this though, since LeBron&#8217;s fourth quarter performance is one of those things that tends to fly under the radar.</p>
<p><strong>Tip drill</strong>: Finishing possessions is just as important as playing on-ball defense. Just ask the Heat, who didn&#8217;t finish this possession.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/W8xI6Z_AikY" height="332" width="590" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>I am not 100 percent convinced that Rondo&#8217;s tip was anything more than him tipping the ball out to an area where he knew there was a player, only to see the ball serendipitously go directly to Mickael Pietrus&#8217; hands, but it&#8217;s still a great play even if that&#8217;s the case. So let&#8217;s just agree that this was a complete and total pass. Way more fun that way.</p>
<p><span id="more-40477"></span><strong>All that glitters</strong>: Not everything was perfect on the Rondo-Pietrus connection, however. Early in the game, Rondo hit Pietster on a backdoor bounce pass, only to see Pietrus completely bonk the wide-open dunk. They made up for it though, I&#8217;d say.</p>
<p><strong>Rando</strong>: Not to mention, one of the <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2012/6/5/3066968/rajon-rondos-incredibly-strange-backcourt-violation/in/2830220">worst backcourt violations</a> you&#8217;ll ever see.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiration</strong>: Sorry <a href="http://gif.mocksession.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/EXCITED-GRIZZLIES-KID.gif">Fat Grizzlies Kid</a>, we have a new favorite child lunatic.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_SMUPnkuslQ" height="332" width="590" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>This kid is going to be a great middle manager some day. For now, just buy <a href="http://skreened.com/polkpanther/good-effort">this &#8220;Good Effort&#8221; shirt</a> because of laughs and because all proceeds go to the Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute. Thumbs up for rock and roll.</p>
<p><strong>Scurry</strong>: <a href="http://twitpic.com/9t9542">Watch your groin</a>, Rajon Rondo.</p>
<p><strong>Cruel and unusual</strong>: I don&#8217;t know about you guys, but I think a $1,000,000 fine for flopping is a bit excessive.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0SeB7wpmA80" height="332" width="590" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>That being said, if every player that flopped was fined a million bucks, we probably wouldn&#8217;t have flopping. Might as well threaten execution too, while we&#8217;re at it.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome back</strong>: Chris Bosh returned last night, putting up nine points and seven rebounds in 14 weirdly spaced minutes. As you might expect, <a href="http://twitpic.com/9t97if">a Bosh face</a> reared its head. Good to have that back in our lives.</p>
<p><strong>Other things</strong>: Of all the unorthodox plays Rajon Rondo made last night, his <a href="http://youtu.be/ERU5zPmIjnw">one-handed rebound layup</a> was probably my favorite &#8230; Kevin Garnett needs one of those <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2012/6/5/3066901/kevin-garnetts-saliva-or-chris-boshs-spit-there-can-only-be-one/in/2830220">dentist sucky tubes</a> &#8230; No ESPN, the Heat are not <a href="https://twitter.com/YungBolo/statuses/210205445812518914">one win from the Finals</a> &#8230; Paul Pierce played the entire first half in a pair of white Nike Air Legacy 3s that didn&#8217;t look right with the Celtics&#8217; road jerseys, only to switch to a black pair for the second half. He scored twice as many points and <a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/06/06/video-paul-pierce-hits-a-huge-three-lets-everyone-know-hes-cold-blooded/">hit a huge three</a> in the second half, so let&#8217;s think about what that means &#8230; Hey, there is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQXg3C-MOwI">dunk on your face</a>, James Jones &#8230; Even the Miami Marlins got a taste of the <a href="https://twitter.com/IzzyGould/statuses/210183241980846080">Chris Bosh face</a></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/cold%20blooded%20paul%20pierce">According to Twitter</a>, Paul Pierce yelled &#8220;I&#8217;m cold-blooded!&#8221; after hitting that dagger of a three-pointer in LeBron James&#8217; mug. I&#8217;ve never studied the art of lip-reading, but after having seen a shot like that, I&#8217;m inclined to believe it&#8217;s true. Very weird and specific brag, but also very accurate.</p>

<p>Last we heard from Andray Blatche, he was <a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/04/19/andray-blatches-conditioning-is-going-well/">losing weight by cutting his hair</a>. Before that, he was getting deactivated by the Wizards for being out of shape. Before that, he was being Andray Blatche, which is all the explanation you need for why he had his worst season since he was a rookie. Not a good year for 7-Day Dray.</p>
<p>But now that the season&#8217;s over, he has time to commit to training, just like he says he does every summer. To start, he&#8217;s began playing in a Miami men&#8217;s league called Gametime Lifestyle, that put together that video you see up top (Dray shows up a few times, most notably at the 1:15 mark). Because they have a strong internet presence, we should be able to easily keep track of his progress.</p>
<p>Having already watched the video &#8212; where it should be mentioned, Blatche actually does look skinnier, though it could just be the baggy t-shirt &#8212; let&#8217;s check in to <a href="http://www.gametimelifestyle.com/blog/2012/6/5/scores-and-highscorers-from-gametime-lifestyle-adult-basketb.html">see how he&#8217;s doing</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/06/05/andray-blatche-is-playing-in-a-miami-rec-league/andray-blatche-mens-league/" rel="attachment wp-att-40465"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40465" title="Of course." src="http://blogimages.thescore.com/tbj/files/2012/06/andray-blatche-mens-league.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="354" /></a></p>
<p>Andray Blatche being the leading scorer for a losing team in a random men&#8217;s league is just perfect. Some things never change.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/06/05/does-rick-reilly-think-a-tbj-joke-really-happened/rick-reilly/" rel="attachment wp-att-40459"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40459" title="Nailed it." src="http://blogimages.thescore.com/tbj/files/2012/06/rick-reilly.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="354" /></a></p>
<p>Remember when Amar&#8217;e Stoudemire punched the casing around a fire <del datetime="2012-06-05T22:01:28+00:00">hydrant</del> extinguisher? (Also, remember when the Knicks were in the playoffs?) It was a big story, mostly because it happened to a guy who played in New York, but also because slicing up your hand during the playoffs while punching glass leads itself to jokes upon jokes upon jokes.</p>
<p>One of those jokes came from our own J.E. Skeets, who penned a delightfully Onion-y piece titled &#8220;<a title="Permanent Link to LeBron James punches Juwan Howard’s walking cane, leaves arena with arm in sling" href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/05/06/lebron-james-punches-juwan-howards-walking-cane-leaves-arena-with-arm-in-sling/" rel="bookmark">LeBron James punches Juwan Howard’s walking cane, leaves arena with arm in sling.</a>&#8221; Laughs were had, links were tweeted and then we all moved on to the next laugh, which was probably a Chris Bosh face.</p>
<p>Until today, when that very same Skeets joke ended up in a Rick Reilly piece for ESPN where the scribe is defending LeBron James. <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/8011587/lebron-being-lebron">Check it out</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>OK, he&#8217;s not perfect. Threw a Gatorade cup. <strong>Punched a walking stick.</strong> Carries that stupid little man purse. But if you were to fill a plane with the most spoiled superstars in the country, he&#8217;d be boarding in the D group.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless Rick Reilly knows something that we don&#8217;t know, it looks like Rick Reilly is a little confused. Also confused? Me, while trying to figure out why someone would think that LeBron James would actually punch a walking stick. As far as I know, LeBron hasn&#8217;t punched anything, except for when people are using that term to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lebron+james+punch+dunk&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">describe a dunk</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an easy mistake to make, confusing a satirical news piece with something that really happened. <a href="http://literallyunbelievable.org/">People do it all the time</a>. So to make sure no one gets mixed up again, here are some other TBJ posts that were just jokes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hedo Turkoglu didn&#8217;t actually <a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2010/10/05/hedo-turkoglu-requests-a-trade/">request a trade</a> to the Pistons because the guy who owns Little Caesars was going to buy the team.</li>
<li>Kevin Durant didn&#8217;t actually <a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2011/08/03/durant-drops-284-points-in-grade-school-game/">score 284 points</a> while playing against fifth graders. That game never happened.</li>
<li>The Knicks never held <a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2010/11/02/knicks-fans-excited-for-free-asbestos-giveaway/">an asbestos giveaway</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>Obviously, that isn&#8217;t everything, but it&#8217;s a good start. Just trying to help.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/06/05/stephen-jackson-just-needs-to-make-a-few-changes-to-be-tim-duncan/jackson-duncan-face-off/" rel="attachment wp-att-40452"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40452" title="Basically the same guy." src="http://blogimages.thescore.com/tbj/files/2012/06/jackson-duncan-face-off.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="442" /></a></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever heard Stephen Jackson talk about how good of a teammate he is &#8212; and he seems to do it quite a bit, actually &#8212; then you&#8217;ve heard him mention that Tim Duncan thinks he&#8217;s &#8220;the ultimate teammate.&#8221; It comes up a lot, like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tim+duncan+stephen+jackson+ultimate+teammate&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">more than 76,000 times</a> according to Google. Jackson&#8217;s mentioned it so often that it&#8217;s even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jackson#Personal_life_and_reputation">on his Wikipedia page</a>. Needless to say, what Timmy D thinks of Captain Jack is well documented.</p>
<p>But what about from the other side? What does Stephen Jackson think of Tim Duncan? Well, thanks to Jonathan Abrams&#8217; definitive look at what makes Jackson tick, we now know that Stephen Jackson thinks he and Duncan are pretty much the same guy. <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8009630/inside-mind-san-antonio-spurs-stephen-jackson">From Grantland</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I always make him laugh,&#8221; Jackson said of Duncan. &#8220;I tell Tim, if I was a person that could keep my composure, that didn&#8217;t wear my emotions on my sleeve, that was always focused, that was the smartest guy on earth, that was 7 feet, I would be Tim.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess this is true? Hard to tell, but if you were to change everything that makes Stephen Jackson in to everything that makes Tim Duncan, then add four inches, it seems like you would maybe get Tim Duncan. The science doesn&#8217;t exist yet to test this hypothesis but the math seems like it works out.</p>
<p>Of course, for the transformation to be complete, Stephen Jackson would also need to find a way to make sure every hair on his head is the exact same length, become an amazing swimmer but never be seen swimming, and change his standard complain to a referee emotion from anger to befuddlement. Only then will he truly be Tim Duncan.</p>
<p>Oh, robots innards too, but that&#8217;s a given.</p>

<p>I am going to go out on a limb that Jordan Crawford doesn&#8217;t always <a href="http://instagr.am/p/LesN_1BGAW/">keep his shoes in the fridge</a>, but that he&#8217;s certainly down to throw some <a href="http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/?l=shop,pdp,ctr-inline/cid-1/pid-462925/pgid-437011">Kevin Durant kicks</a> on the shelves when KD&#8217;s really rolling. I haven&#8217;t decided if that&#8217;s a metaphor for a) Kevin Durant being cold as ice or b) Kevin Durant heating up and needing to cool down, but I&#8217;m confident that either of those are as good of an explanation as you can hope to receive.</p>
<p>Or maybe Jordan Crawford just has a really weird form of pica. I guess that&#8217;s feasible, but I&#8217;ve never known him to wear chewed up shoes.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t you just feel Kenny Smith seething with anger as he realizes his Russell Westbrook bit is getting buried by Shaq eating a papier-mâché Charles Barkley? He just knows that the next morning no one is going to care at all that he realized Russell Westbrook&#8217;s shirt looks like a kaleidoscope. Even after he gets the joke off, Shaq just ignores it to go back to the piñata. Bad timing, man.</p>
<p>But hey, if you want some good Kenny Smith action, check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8L0nmp8kmI">this ancient &#8220;Inside the NBA&#8221; clip</a> of Ernie and Kenny talking about the Shaq-Barkley fight, who were still in the league at that point. It&#8217;s amazing to see how much things have changed. You decide if it&#8217;s for the better or not.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/06/05/things-of-note-for-june-5-2012/tim-duncan-kid/" rel="attachment wp-att-40418"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40418" title="Hi." src="http://blogimages.thescore.com/tbj/files/2012/06/tim-duncan-kid.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="354" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Ballin</strong>: 27 points on 19 shots for Kevin Durant, which is even more impressive when you consider he had five on 1-6 shooting through the first half. Thumbs up, man.</p>
<p><strong>Not so much</strong>: Gary Neal and Danny Green must have forgot they were Spurs last night, combining to go 0-8 with two points in 19ish minutes of play. The worst was when the Spurs got a wide-open three while James Harden, who was guarding Gary Neal, was tying his shoe. Naturally, Neal missed it.</p>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Always remember, good offense beats good defense every time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MPyQayf8vpc" height="332" width="590" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>If the Thunder go on to win this year&#8217;s title, this is going to be a huge moment in the championship DVD. Like slow motion the entire time Harden has the ball huge. Not bad for a <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/19260947/video-james-harden-hits-dagger-3-to-send-thunder-past-spurs-in-game-5">broken play</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-40415"></span><strong>Also ballin</strong>: 34 points on 21 shots &#8212; including five threes &#8212; for Manu Ginobili, who got his first start since March 23. Hate to waste a game like that.</p>
<p><strong>Past prime</strong>: The <a href="blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/05/28/shirt-ideas-for-russell-westbrook/">Russell Westbrook clothing extravaganza</a> is over, you guys. Last night, he wore a shirt <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/catalog/productdetail.jsp?id=24512147">you can buy at Urban Outfitters</a>. It was fun while it lasted, but once he wore a shirt you&#8217;ll legitimately see somebody wearing on the street, it&#8217;s time to move on.</p>
<p><strong>Oh, this too</strong>: There was a time, during the middle of the fourth quarter, when this was the biggest shot James Harden had ever hit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bLtcToCV0aU" height="332" width="590" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Shoutout to you, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xlCbpPN8rs">Larry Johnson</a>.</p>
<p><strong>When we reminisce</strong>: Who among us didn&#8217;t think Tim Duncan was taking that <a href="http://youtu.be/trdsKp94Io0">very 2007-y three</a> on the Spurs&#8217; final meaningful possession? I sure did and I wish he would have taken it, just to see if he could catch lightning in a bottle twice (or alternately, if lightning could strike twice, depending on your preferred lightning metaphor).</p>
<p><strong>High jump</strong>: Russell Westbrook is so good at leaping.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/uIprR_E9eY4" height="332" width="590" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The best part of a huge Russell Westbrook dunk like this one is how it seems like he&#8217;s dunking it on the way up, like he could throw down the same play if the Thunder were playing on 12-foot rims.</p>
<p><strong>Other notable highlights</strong>: So many great plays in the signature game of this year&#8217;s playoffs so far, so let&#8217;s get through them &#8212; Nick Collison had a nice dunk over Tim Duncan early on &#8230; Tim Duncan threw a <a href="http://youtu.be/cEpeD40ncxk">crazy outlet pass</a> for an easy Spurs score &#8230; Manu Ginobili&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z06X8O-Xqe0">three festival</a> &#8230; There was also an amazing spin move and tough layup that Ginobes hit during the second half that I highly recommend if you can catch a replay &#8230; Also recommended is Kevin Durant stepping through a double team and hitting a really tough bank shot.</p>
<p><strong>Other things</strong>: Gregg Popovich had a <a href="http://www.rantsports.com/courtcrusades/2012/06/04/san-antonio-spurs-coach-gregg-popovich-says-four-words-during-interview-with-craig-sager/">four-word interview</a> with Craig Sager, so let&#8217;s not do that any more. Diminishing returns and all that &#8230; Here&#8217;s Jimmy Goldstein creeping on the &#8220;Inside the NBA&#8221; set &#8230; The Lakers <a href="http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/221387/Lakers_Exercise_12_13_Option_On_Bynum">picked up their option on Andrew Bynum</a>, no duh &#8230; The Wizards are <a href="http://www.csnwashington.com/basketball-washington-wizards/wizards-talk/Wizards-bringing-back-Wittman?blockID=717938&amp;feedID=6356">keeping Randy Wittman around</a> &#8230; Neil Olshey is <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/8009841/portland-trail-blazers-name-neil-olshey-gm">leaving the Clippers to be the Trail Blazers&#8217; GM</a>, meaning he now has a double curse on his knees &#8230; <a href="http://instagr.am/p/LdqSupPOCJ/">JaVale McGee and the Lorax</a> OR <a href="http://www.thetwomangame.com/2012/06/dinner-tournament-and-developing-big-man/">Ian Mahinmi at Medieval Times</a>?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/06/04/2012-nba-mock-draft-initial-guesses/2012-nba-draft-lottery-chairs/" rel="attachment wp-att-40408"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40408" title="2012-nba-draft-lottery-chairs" src="http://blogimages.thescore.com/tbj/files/2012/06/2012-nba-draft-lottery-chairs.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="354" /></a></p>
<p>The NBA Draft Lottery is behind us and conspiracy theories aside, we learned that karma does exist &#8212; the basketball gods hate Michael Jordan as a non-player. That said, let&#8217;s do our best in guessing which players will be drafted by which team on June 30th.</p>
<p><strong>1. New Orleans Hornets &#8211; Anthony Davis, PF, Kentucky</strong><br />
This is pretty much an &#8220;Anthony Davis and everyone else&#8221; kind of draft. He&#8217;s Marcus Camby thin, but Davis has the body structure that will allow him to get bigger. Like Camby, Davis should make a difference on the defensive end immediately.</p>
<p><strong>2. Charlotte Bobcats &#8211; Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, SF, Kentucky</strong><br />
Kidd-Gilchrist has been compared favorably to former Bobcat, Gerald Wallace, as well as Shawn Marion. Considering both are/were All-Star caliber players that still produce in their twilight years, not bad.</p>
<p><strong>3. Washington Wizards &#8211; Andre Drummond, PF/C, Connecticut</strong><br />
John Wall, meet your new running big man. Drummond is a big body that can get up and down the floor and has a lot of potential, but the question will be if can he maximize it. I personally don’t think he can and see this as a semi-Kwame Brown bust. But upside is always naturally attractive to teams, so here we are.</p>
<p><strong>4. Cleveland Cavaliers &#8211; Bradley Beal, SG, Florida</strong><br />
The Cavs won’t be doing so bad considering the whole LeBron James leaving thing. Adding Beal to the team will give the Cavs the best young backcourt in the league. Theoretically of course, since Beal will actually need to play on an NBA court first. However, we do know that Kyrie Irving is pretty good and if Beal fulfills his hype &#8230; damn.</p>
<p><strong>5. Sacramento Kings &#8211; Thomas Robinson, PF, Kansas</strong><br />
The Kings will be lucky to have Robinson drop here. He&#8217;ll form a potentially scary frontcourt duo with the oft-maligned, but very effective, DeMarcus Cousins. While Robinson could end up being better than Drummond and Beal, the fall in draft position has more to do with the Wiz and Cavs already having fours.</p>
<p><strong>6. Portland Trail Blazers &#8211; Damian Lillard, PG, Weber State</strong><br />
Lillard is an excellent scoring point guard that can get to the paint almost at will. He showed the ability to run a team and is too big of talent at the lead guard position to skip over at this spot for the Blazers. He’ll bring some excitement to PDX with his ability to hit from anywhere on the court while still being able to find a streaking Nicolas Batum or LaMarcus Aldridge in the post.</p>
<p><strong>7. Golden State Warriors &#8211; Harrison Barnes, SF, North Carolina</strong><br />
Heading into college, Barnes had a lot of expectations, even being named a preseason first team All-American as freshman. He could fit in nicely with the Warriors and hit a lot of open shots should Andrew Bogut ever become consistently healthy. Barnes could go higher, but the Warriors may be the best opportunity for him.</p>
<p><strong>8. Toronto Raptors &#8211; John Henson, PF/C, North Carolina</strong><br />
In Henson, the Raptors will get a player that goes hard inside, rebounding and blocking shots. He’s still very thin by NBA standards, but if Kevin Garnett can get by with his frame, Henson should as well. Like Garnett, Henson should be an excellent help defender with his quickness and length. I’m sure Raps fans would love it if he also had the KG nastiness.</p>
<p><strong>9. Detroit Pistons &#8211; Jeremy Lamb, SG, Connecticut</strong><br />
Lamb is a talented shooter blessed with a long wingspan that helps him get off his shot fairly easily. He has potential to be a very good defender, but lacks the necessary strength at this point of his career. Lamb should find himself on the end of many Brandon Knight passes for years to come, whether it’s for a spot up J or on the break. They wouldn’t be a bad combo to build on, along with Greg Monroe.</p>
<p><strong>10. New Orleans Hornets &#8211; Perry Jones, SF/PF, Baylor</strong><br />
Jones is the enigma of the draft. He has excellent size (6-foot-11) for the three and four position, a long wingspan, and a great skill set. However, he’s still considered raw with humongous upside and will either be boom or bust. The Hornets won’t be contending anytime soon and pairing Jones with Davis could prove to be the league&#8217;s best set of forwards in a few years.</p>
<p><span id="more-40404"></span><strong>11. Portland Trail Blazers &#8211; Tyler Zeller, PF/C, North Carolina</strong><br />
Zeller is talented offensively with his ability to post-up and his athleticism to run the floor and finish strong on the break. He’ll need to build his strength, but he’s an otherwise very capable player offensively with potential on defense. He’ll be a solid complementary player for the Blazers that will do a lot of the little things.</p>
<p><strong>12. Milwaukee Bucks &#8211; Jared Sullinger, PF, Ohio State</strong><br />
Sullinger is a physical specimen in regards to being able to eat space in the post and use his power game to bully defenders. Despite his bulk, Sullinger has excellent footwork, as well as a high basketball IQ. However, his lack of athleticism will see him drop to a borderline lottery pick.</p>
<p><strong>13. Phoenix Suns &#8211; Austin Rivers, SG, Duke</strong><br />
If Steve Nash leaves, Rivers will be the next exciting guard for Phoenix as he has a great knack for scoring from anywhere on the floor, but is particularly adept at getting to and finishing at the rim. He’s a bit undersized for the two, so may have to play the one at times, where his ability to set up teammates is questionable, so don’t expect Rivers to replace a potentially departed Nash. If the latter stays, Rivers game could really flourish.</p>
<p><strong>14. Houston Rockets &#8211; Meyers Leonard, C, Illinois</strong><br />
Kevin McHale will want to draft a big man to help mold and Leonard is likely that player. Leonard is a very athletic big man that has good offensive potential in the post, which McHale, one of the greatest post player ever, will likely enhance. Leonard is very solid defending the post and helping on defense. If he consistently hustles and puts the work in, Leonard has excellent potential.</p>
<p><strong>15. Philadelphia 76ers &#8211; Terrence Ross, SG, Washington</strong><br />
Ross will be an excellent rotation player for the Sixers at both the two and three spots and may allow Jodie Meeks to move on in the free agent market. Ross is a very good defender with motor, equally adept on the ball and playing passing lanes. Offensively, he’s able to find his teammates as well as finish on the break and hit jumpers.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/06/04/2012-nba-mock-draft-initial-guesses/terrence-jones-net/" rel="attachment wp-att-40407"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40407" title="terrence-jones-net" src="http://blogimages.thescore.com/tbj/files/2012/06/terrence-jones-net.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="354" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>16. Houston Rockets &#8211; Terrence Jones, PF, Kentucky</strong><br />
If Jones had come out after his freshman season last year, he would have probably been a lottery pick, but he now comes into the draft as an NCAA champion without losing too much value. The talent will be too good to pass up for the Rockets, who will be able to play Jones at either forward spot.</p>
<p><strong>17. Dallas Mavericks &#8211; Kendall Marshall, PG, North Carolina</strong><br />
As much as most people think it’s a done deal that Deron Williams will be heading to Dallas, Marshall falling this far may be too perfect for the team to let pass. Jason Kidd is a free agent and Rodrigue Beaubois isn’t the long-term answer at point guard, so Marshall would be an excellent and cheap backup plan should D-Will stay with the Brooklyn Nets or sign somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>18. Minnesota Timberwolves &#8211;  Quincy Miller, SF, Baylor</strong><br />
Miller probably should have gone back for his sophomore season, but his offensive ability and physical traits &#8212; size, wingspan, footwork &#8212; will have him going in the first round. He’s excellent at shooting off the dribble and getting his defender off balance. Ricky Rubio should make his job easier.</p>
<p><strong>19. Orlando Magic &#8211; Moe Harkless, SF, St. John’s</strong><br />
Harkless has the ability to move up the draft board thanks to his physical attributes and athleticism. He has a solid jumper, but still has room for improvement as the mechanics are there and it’ll just be a matter of putting the work in. He’s a very good defender because of his speed and long arms, but will need to work on his strength.</p>
<p><strong>20. Denver Nuggets &#8211; Dion Waiters, SG, Syracuse</strong><br />
Waiters will be an excellent backup for both guard positions, spelling Ty Lawson and Arron Afflalo, and should contribute relatively significant minutes, especially if Andre Miller walks. Waiters can play both the one and two with equal productivity as he’s a solid scorer with an excellent jumper and can create for others.</p>
<p><strong>21. Boston Celtics &#8211; Arnett Moultrie, PF/C, Mississippi State</strong><br />
Moultrie has one of the best motors in the game and has the ability to score inside and out, as well as rebound on both ends of the floor. He has the ability to play the three with his ability to hit the J, but can also play the five with his size and explosiveness. He can defend multiple positions and should be a solid Kevin Garnett replacement with lots of potential to learn a whole ton from KG as a reserve. Could be a really great pick considering draft position.</p>
<p><strong>22. Boston Celtics &#8211; Jeff Taylor, SF, Vanderbilt</strong><br />
Taylor could be one of those players you just plug into the rotation and let him do his thing, particularly on defense. He’s an excellent perimeter defender that can defend one through four because of his athleticism, quickness and strength. Offensively, he’s still working on getting better, but there has been improvement year-to-year while in school, so it should continue at the next level.</p>
<p><strong>23. Atlanta Hawks &#8211; Fab Melo, C, Syracuse</strong><br />
The Hawks would ideally want Al Horford to slide over to his more natural PF position, but need a center to make that happen. Melo could be that guy, as he has big potential as a defender in the NBA. He can block shots and defend post players to a very good degree, but his problems mainly come from his lack of conditioning.</p>
<p><strong>24. Cleveland Cavaliers &#8211; Evan Fournier, SG/SF, France</strong><br />
Fournier is multi-talented on offense, able to score in a number of ways or set up his teammates. He’s not very explosive, but maximizes his skill set and plays smart basketball. Playing with Irving and earlier pick, Beal, Fournier could really do damage with the Cavs as the third scoring option.</p>
<p><strong>25. Memphis Grizzlies &#8211; John Jenkins, SG, Vanderbilt</strong><br />
Jenkins can make it rain from all over the court, and with Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph in the post, there should be a great symbiotic relationship where there will be a lot of space for all to maximize their offensive ability. Jenkins can also finish on the break and has shown a good work ethic. This pick may allow the Grizz to say goodbye to O.J. Mayo.</p>
<p><strong>26. Indiana Pacers &#8211; Andrew Nicholson, PF, St. Bonaventure</strong><br />
Nicholson has very good offensive skills, both from the outside and inside and could inherit David West’s position when West’s contract is over after next season. Nicholson is a very smart and efficient player and has some nice upside despite coming out as a college senior.</p>
<p><strong>27. Miami Heat &#8211; Royce White, PF, Iowa State</strong><br />
White has a big body, but is fleet of foot, athletic and has major handle and court vision for a big man. However, he’s very raw when it comes to his ability to score, has had off-the-court issues and conditioning could be an issue. He’s a high-risk/high-reward prospect and learning the NBA game from LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh could be the best setting for him as they’ve taken a young player under their wings before; Mario Chalmers, for example.</p>
<p><strong>28. Oklahoma City Thunder &#8211; Festus Ezeli, C, Vanderbilt</strong><br />
I wouldn’t be surprised if the Thunder sold this pick as they are in win-now mode and will need to pay James Harden and Serge Ibaka after next season. However, if the team keeps it, Ezeli is basically a hybrid of Ibaka and Kendrick Perkins and could be an important rotation player down the line, particularly if Ibaka leaves for more money.</p>
<p><strong>29. Chicago Bulls &#8211; Marquis Teague, PG, Kentucky</strong><br />
Derrick Rose could miss the whole next season, and at this point, Teague is the best lead guard prospect left in the draft. To a lesser degree, has the same skill set that Rose had coming into the league: great dribble, can get anywhere on the floor, finishes at the rim in traffic and possesses a raw jumper. Of course, Teague will never be Rose, but he could end up being a great backup.</p>
<p><strong>30. Golden State Warriors &#8211; Draymond Green, PF, Michigan State</strong><br />
Green is basically a jack-of-all-trades type of player as he can do a lot of things with the ball. He possesses a high basketball IQ, which makes up for his lack of athleticism and explosiveness. Green should make for a solid contributor off the bench in Golden State.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/06/04/even-nba-players-are-jealous-of-jimmy-goldstein/jimmy-goldstein-babe/" rel="attachment wp-att-40400"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40400" title="Understandable, I guess." src="http://blogimages.thescore.com/tbj/files/2012/06/jimmy-goldstein-babe.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="354" /></a></p>
<p>For whatever reason, this playoffs seems to have been a bit of a coming out party for Jimmy Goldstein, despite the fact that he&#8217;s been sitting courtside at games across the country for years upon years. I don&#8217;t know how everyone missed a leather-clad Cryptkeeper for the past however many seasons, but more than ever, fans are noticing him. It&#8217;s been such a big year for him that he&#8217;s even got a <a href="http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-q/2012/05/jimmy-speaks-the-goldstein-chronicles-part-i.html">pseudo-blog for GQ</a>. That&#8217;s when you know you&#8217;ve made it.</p>
<p>In fact, Jimmy&#8217;s life &#8212; rich beyond belief with a secret fortune no one knows the origins of, traveling from city to city watching basketball, dating gorgeous models while looking like a human lizard &#8212; is so intriguing that even NBA players are jealous of him. <a href="http://blog.mysanantonio.com/spursnation/2012/06/04/big-fan-a-star-in-his-own-right/">From the San Antonio Express-News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I wish I could be like him,” Spurs player Stephen Jackson said. “I wish I could retire and just sit courtside and watch basketball every night.”</p></blockquote>
<p>When a guy who has made $60 million in his career wants to leave it all behind to live your life, that&#8217;s when you know you&#8217;ve had a good life. Pretty strong endorsement for the Jimmy Goldstein Experience.</p>
<p>Now all of us need to do is find a way to get rich beyond our wildest dreams without anyone knowing how we did it, then we can make this a reality. That should be the easy part. Finding hundreds of leather fedoras will be the real challenge.</p>

<p>Joke No. 1, <a href="https://twitter.com/boogiecousins/status/208741252445900800">courtesy of DeMarcus Cousins</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>congrats to my homie @jimmerfredette and his big day &#8230;also his big night!! Haha</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Paper lanterns released during [Fredette's] rehearsal dinner in Centennial on Thursday night confused nearby residents and stirred up UFO talk. [...]</p>
<p>Viewers called in to 9NEWS to report &#8220;strange fiery lights&#8221; floating in the sky near Arapahoe and University. One viewer finally solved the mystery after one of the lanterns landed in her neighbor&#8217;s yard.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a big weekend for JimmerJamz. Good thing the Kings didn&#8217;t make the playoffs because fitting in losing your virginity, starting a UFO hoax and playing basketball would be impossible.

<p>As far as I can tell, these are the only five logical conclusions for what Rajon Rondo and Doris Burke were talking about during their private embrace. Any other suggestions are welcome.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Red Auerbach and a stubborn basketball are the reasons Dwyane Wade couldn't make the series 3-1.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/06/04/supernatural-forces-caused-dwyane-wade-to-miss-last-nights-game-winning-shot/dwyane-wade-red-auerbach/" rel="attachment wp-att-40378"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40378" title="Completely and totally logical." src="http://blogimages.thescore.com/tbj/files/2012/06/dwyane-wade-red-auerbach.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="354" /></a></p>
<p>At the very end of last night&#8217;s Game 4, Dwyane Wade shot an off-balance, post-pump fake three that was just a hair short, giving the Celtics a huge victory and making the Eastern Conference finals a best of three series. Cool stuff for basketball fans around the world.</p>
<p>And while you might think Wade missed that shot because he&#8217;s shooting only 27 percent from three during the playoffs and had to reset himself for the shot, that&#8217;s not it at all. In fact, it was a couple of supernatural forces that didn&#8217;t allow Wade&#8217;s shot to go in. The first was a ghost. <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/celtics-beat-heat-93-91-085854553--nba.html">From the AP</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221;Red wasn&#8217;t going to let that go in, you know that,&#8221; coach Doc Rivers said, referring to longtime Celtics boss Red Auerbach. &#8221;Not in the Boston Garden.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The second, of course, was the spirit of a basketball. <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2012/06/04/wade_had_his_chance/?page=full">From the Boston Herald</a>:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p>“Yeah, a good look, on line, it didn’t want to go in,’’ he said. “Couldn’t ask for a better look, got the shot off I wanted from the standpoint of how we ran it. They took away our first option and then I tried to make a one-on-one play and got a good shot.’’</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote><p>“Yeah, it was on line,’’ he repeated. “That’s all you can ask for. I got my legs under me a little bit. It just decided it didn’t want to go in tonight.’’</p></blockquote>
<p>So basically, between Red Auerbach&#8217;s spectre coming down from the heavens to block the shot and a cursed basketball that had a mind of its own, there was no way that three was going in. The play was over before it started. Sorry, Heat fans. That&#8217;s just the way it is.</p>
<p>The good thing about this, however, is that now that we know the possession was doomed from the start, there&#8217;s no use in debating whether or not Wade should have hit Mario Chalmers on that last possession. Even if Chalmers is a way better shooter than Wade, if the ball has already made up its mind that it&#8217;s not going in, and Red Auerbach&#8217;s ghost has taken time out of his haunting of Kevin McHale, then no one was going to hit that shot. Argue all you want, but sometimes things are bigger than basketball.</p>

<p>On today&#8217;s playoff edition of &#8220;The Fix,&#8221; Skeets and Tas breakdown Game 4 of the Celtics-Heat Eastern Conference Finals. Topics discussed include: LeBron and Pierce fouling out, Wade&#8217;s game-winning look, Rondo carvin&#8217; up the Heat&#8217;s D, Keyon Dooling&#8217;s sponsorship deals, Ray&#8217;s rhythm, Pietrus&#8217; offensive rebounds, and the possibility of Bosh returning to Game 5. All that, plus Pharaohs, dodging post-game pressers, Durant&#8217;s Saturday night, and ESPN&#8221;s &#8220;Lost In Translation&#8221; moment.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ui3_BkK34Mg" height="332" width="590" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been tracking this mouthguard in the jersey thing here at the Jones for a while now, wondering if we&#8217;re actually seeing what we&#8217;re seeing &#8212; that some of the Celtics just spit their mouthguards in to their jerseys when they want to let their teeth breathe. Finally, last week we caught Rajon Rondo grabbing his out of his shirt, putting an end to the speculation that, yes, they are storing their mouthguards in their jerseys.</p>
<p>But then Marquis Daniels pulled the same trick last night, dropping a bright red mouthpiece in to his jersey after the game. I had to know what was going on here, so I emailed the Celtics&#8217; equipment manager to see if maybe there was a sewn-in pouch that these guys were using to hold their mouthguards. His response:</p>
<blockquote><p>No Pouch !</p></blockquote>
<p>So basically, these guys just drop their mouthguards in their jerseys, counting on the waistband of their shorts to keep it from falling out. Pretty convenient, though having three feet of space where the mouthpiece can move leads to some frantic searching at times. Now you know and now you&#8217;ll notice every time they do it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/06/04/things-of-note-for-june-4-2012/dwyane-wade-valsalva-maneuver/" rel="attachment wp-att-40357"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40357" title="Pffffffffffffffft" src="http://blogimages.thescore.com/tbj/files/2012/06/dwyane-wade-valsalva-maneuver.jpg" alt="" width="590" height="354" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Ballin</strong>: 29-6-7 for LeBron, 15 and 15 for Rajon Rondo, 17 and 14 for KG, four threes for Ray Allen &#8212; lots of standard lines in yesterday&#8217;s game. So let&#8217;s give Udonis Haslem a shoutout for adding 17 rebounds to his 12 points. Cool for him. Still a terrible beard though.</p>
<p><strong>Not so much</strong>: Not surprisingly, Paul Pierce fouled out of a big playoff game, his third disqualification in the last five games. More surprisingly, LeBron fouled out with about two minutes left, which is his first foul out since 2008. Best part is both of the sixth fouls came on dubious offensive fouls. Refs are just awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Wrong Way Riegels</strong>: Great tip by the Celtics right here. Too bad the points went to the Heat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/L0rcxK5wh6k" height="332" width="590" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Just grab the ball next time. That way we won&#8217;t have to endure a boring OT where only six points are scored. Take that suggestion with a grain of salt, but I think it&#8217;s pretty smart.</p>
<p><span id="more-40355"></span><strong>Do not worry</strong>: LeBron James on <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/celtics-beat-heat-93-91-085854553--nba.html">why he hasn&#8217;t tweeted recently</a> &#8212; &#8220;&#8216;My fans, I&#8217;m still with them, but I haven&#8217;t been on there.&#8221; OK, good.</p>
<p><strong>Tough questions</strong>: It&#8217;s not often that LeBron has to answer questions about fouling out, which is probably why it&#8217;s so funny hearing him talk about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rfSXEpgdpWA" height="332" width="590" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Badownfalloud. Badownfalloud.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Heads up</strong>: This might be the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/f9vti.gif">best Rajon Rondo opening tip maneuver</a> we&#8217;ve seen thus far. That&#8217;s quite an accomplishment given <a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/04/27/video-rajon-rondos-fascinating-tip-off-moves/">all he&#8217;s achieved</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I gotcha</strong>: From an NBA memes standpoint, Rajon Rondo was this weekend&#8217;s MVP.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/L5OgmurpgaI" height="332" width="590" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Between this, <a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/tbj/2012/06/04/video-rajon-rondo-calls-out-the-heat-for-complaining-and-crying-to-the-referees/">insulting the Heat</a>, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWKNS7lNzJE">solid Rondoing</a>, some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukMbpPphioE">nice</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E1vy1ruTG4">passes</a>, and that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMRkXWHyXEU">bizarre Doris Burke moment</a> at the end, Rondo was easily the internet&#8217;s most important player of the last few days.</p>
<p><strong>Scorekeeper&#8217;s ruling needed</strong>: Should Brandon Bass get an assist on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JczpnzZqCuY">this Ray Allen three</a>? Play-by-play data says <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=320603002&amp;period=4">yes</a>, but that&#8217;s really generous towards a guy who just basically dropped a pass.</p>
<p><strong>Other things</strong>: Chris Bosh might <a href="http://www.freep.com/usatoday/article/707830?odyssey=mod|newswell|text|Sports|p&amp;usatref=sportsmod">come back for Game 5</a>, hopefully <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2012/6/3/3061959/chris-boshs-face-will-live-on-forever/in/2825064">making this face</a> &#8230; Congratulations go out to Amar&#8217;e Stoudemire, who <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20600715,00.html?xid=rss-topheadlines">just got engaged</a> &#8230; The Bulls are <a href="http://www.iamagm.com/news/2012/06/03/add.andre.miller.bulls.free.agency.targets.also.maybe.carlos.delfino.and.nick.young">targeting some names</a> you&#8217;ve heard of, which means they probably won&#8217;t actually pay enough to get them &#8230; Rick Barry is <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/thebigevent/2012/05/31/the-fashion-of-rick-barry-a-tribute/#5482-1">styling</a> &#8230;.

<p>Pay attention Spurs and Thunder &#8212; if you meet the Heat in the NBA Finals, just make sure to exploit their &#8220;complaining and crying to the referees&#8221; weakness. I&#8217;ve heard from a very reliable source that taking advantage of those times is an easy way to score points in transition. Just an idea.</p>
