All I can say is DAMN S'pore officials for putting up a lame show, DAMN those fucking terrorists who have nothing better to do and DAMN this corporate so-called non-profit organizations that love to just to suck our taxpayers money through false advertising and giving kidney patients false hope. I hope the NKF CEO can really sleep at night, knowing that he's living, eating and drinking on these ill people's hopes.

And Osama, this NKF scandal has nothing to do with your kidney problems or dialysis shit. I think you just need to smoke some weed, chill out and stop all this Al-Qaeda and JI nonsense.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[There's a huge article on podcasting in Sunday Times and we're mentioned. (Thanks Rory!) Check out the article online here.

Fred Durst's sex tape has leaked out on the inkernet and you can check out the pics and the video here. His hairy pot belly really freaked me out. It's highly unrecommended.I tried to convince Jo into watching it though (coz he was fan *gasp*) but he wasn't too enthusiastic about it.

Did Jamie Yeo start out in the entertainment industry as J C Sum's apprentice on his magic show? I have no proof but that's my theory. I love coming up with absurd theories. It makes me feel important. Anyway, check out the video here. It's the video titled "Crystal Striptease: J C's original stage illusion featuring the vanishing of a girl after she is stripped of her clothes!"]]></description>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[There's a huge article on podcasting in Sunday Times and we're mentioned. (Thanks Rory!) Check out the article online here.

Fred Durst's sex tape has leaked out on the inkernet and you can check out the pics and the video here. His hairy pot belly really freaked me out. It's highly unrecommended.I tried to convince Jo into watching it though (coz he was fan *gasp*) but he wasn't too enthusiastic about it.

Did Jamie Yeo start out in the entertainment industry as J C Sum's apprentice on his magic show? I have no proof but that's my theory. I love coming up with absurd theories. It makes me feel important. Anyway, check out the video here. It's the video titled "Crystal Striptease: J C's original stage illusion featuring the vanishing of a girl after she is stripped of her clothes!"]]></itunes:summary>

      <description><![CDATA[In this episode, Jo talks about the EVA LONGORIA lookalike model he's working with in his photo shoots. Urm, maybe he'll post some pictures up...

And a one-night stand turns out to be something more for Raj. We're expecting hate-mails from female listeners (if there're any) after this.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Tonight, Jo bitches about his boss. "If I see him outside ah, he's going to get it man." Yeap. A very angry episode.

But it ends on a very happy note, I must say!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Tonight, we muse about the women in our lives. Jo sounds depressed but I'm shouting most of the time. No idea why. The bush fires aren't as huge as they're made out to be on TV. We have the inside scoop right here; Jo tells it like it is. Pilot's dad almost got rushed to hospital but it turned out to be a false alarm. All this and much, much more in this episode of the Pilot n' Jo Show. (Actually, I'm just lazy to type it all out...)]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Hey there, lovely fans!! How are you all doing! I'm using this text to speech thingy to come up with this. (Look, I was bored.) Jo doesn't even know I did this. He's gonna go "What the fuuucck is this!?" when he hears this.

You know what, it's Valentine's Day today and I'm all alone. If I see that Cupid fellow around, I would give him a piece of my mind. Unfortunately, for me, the little twerp doesn't exist. So what does an intelligent, mature, young adult like me do in this situation? He gets himself a nice, cold beer and drowns his sorrows. Yup. While all those loving couples are out there declaring their love for each other and getting it on under their sheets, I'm here nursing my Erdinger and thinking about future-predicting black boxes and big dinners. I don't know where this is going to lead me but I don't like it so far. The beer's warming up and starting to taste like curdled monkey piss. But I digress.

I really would like some lovin' right now. Some "sugar", if you will. You think this robot bitch would be interested?]]></description>
