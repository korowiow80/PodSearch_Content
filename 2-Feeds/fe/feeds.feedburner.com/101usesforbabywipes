The evil overlords at Facebook are considering new ways to data mine the populace.&amp;nbsp; Now they're cooking up a way to circumvent privacy laws regarding children and hook our kids on the same brain crack that many adults find themselves hooked on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Introducing Facebook Junior - aka Facebook for kids that should be outside playing instead of sitting in front of a computer interacting with total strangers and racking up hours on inane games, all for the sake of generating marketing data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facebook is evil.&amp;nbsp; Its marketing intentions have never been clearly articulated by  its CEO because if they were, no one would join voluntarily.&amp;nbsp; Remember the Zuckerberg interview at the 'D' Conference and the waterfall of sweat from Mr. Z as he tried to explain what Facebook was up to?&amp;nbsp; Facebook's stock price is currently the butt of  jokes on Wall St. because there is no real value to the company (remember MySpace?).&amp;nbsp; No one trusts Facebook to keep their data safe or secure, their privacy settings have been laughable and their 'errors' in releasing private data have always been to Facebook's benefit and not the users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet like lemmings, adults keep logging in and using it.&amp;nbsp; Up until now, the younger generations have been uninterested in Facebook, preferring to walk into lamp posts, sending TXT messages to people they actually know IRL - in real life - see, I'm plugged in, kids.&amp;nbsp; Truth is, the kids have more common sense about new tech than the adults do, and that's why they're not interested in Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new ploy by Zuck &amp;amp; Co is like the cigarette ads back in the '60s, designed to get kids hooked on smoking, knowing full well they'd stay hooked until they died of lung cancer.&amp;nbsp; Sorry, but I see a strong similarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember: Facebook's product is YOU - the user.&amp;nbsp; Do you want your kids to be a product?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14650484-9104485084473661281?l=101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~4/5fFA77Dha04" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><media:thumbnail url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KhkEtl2GvDI/T8zmUzJoviI/AAAAAAAAAJE/i512ObmKcn4/s72-c/evil-zuck.jpg" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com/2012/06/from-latimes.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Stoned Mom Loses 5 Month Old Baby Off Car Roof</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~3/4JSAl-eVg68/stoned-mom-loses-5-month-old-baby-off.html</link><author>submit@101usesforbabywipes.com (Dennis Gray)</author><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jun 2012 17:00:37 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14650484.post-1144054595242861903</guid><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

really&lt;/i&gt; stoned with her friends afterwards and forgot her baby was on the roof of her car, strapped into his car seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The infant was found in the middle of an intersection in the Phoenix area, and is now in the hands of Arizona Child Protective Services.&amp;nbsp; The irresponsible mom, Catalina Clouser, has now also been arrested on charges of aggravated DUI and child abuse.&amp;nbsp; Evidence submitted by the prosecution consists of a thankfully unhurt 5 month old baby boy and a badly damaged car seat, with paint from the roof of mom's 2000 Ford Focus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ironic car model - Focus - something both mom and the boyfriend lacked as they put an infant in danger twice in one evening as a result of indulging in an illegal substance.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14650484-1144054595242861903?l=101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~4/4JSAl-eVg68" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><media:thumbnail url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9ttX4fgoKhs/T8qlDhzHoxI/AAAAAAAAAI4/Gw0rzV_VwaY/s72-c/weed-image.jpg" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com/2012/06/stoned-mom-loses-5-month-old-baby-off.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Dad Uses Audio Bug To Uncover Abuse At Kid's School</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~3/FAZBqocwM6c/dad-uses-audio-bug-to-uncover-abuse-at.html</link><author>submit@101usesforbabywipes.com (Dennis Gray)</author><pubDate>Wed, 25 Apr 2012 19:07:58 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14650484.post-7779063407113591070</guid><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

Anybody remember Veep Joe Biden during the President's announcement of 'Obamacare'?&amp;nbsp; Or what about the recent fundraiser for the aforementioned President Obama, where the infamous Cee-Lo Green dropped the F-bomb to a hall full of campaign donors in Atlanta?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many are arguing that a suspension would be more appropriate.&amp;nbsp; Even the boy's mom says suspension is fine but expulsion is harsh.&amp;nbsp; Personally, I don't think young Austin Carroll should be punished AT ALL.&amp;nbsp; School administrators have more to do than enforce non-laws by someone who was exercising his 1st Amendment right of free speech, in a forum where such expression is encouraged, and in many cases beneficial for social discourse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the precedent, and example for the country at large has been set by our esteemed administration, in public, and has been deemed acceptable and a form of free speech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I don't like the use of the F-word, and I'm sure that foul mouths are uttering such on the boy's high school campus right in front of the school administrators without any repercussions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it interesting that its the foreign press picking this story up and syndicating it.&amp;nbsp; Looks like it broke on &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/25/austin-carroll-indiana-hi_n_1378250.html"&gt;HuffPo on the 25th&lt;/a&gt;, which had this little nugget of information;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;A bill that would allow schools to punish students for off-campus  activities has advanced in the Indiana legislature, permitting schools  to suspend or expel students for engaging in activities away from school  and after hours that "&lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/16/indiana-bill-would-allow-_n_1282790.html" target="_hplink"&gt;may reasonably be considered to be an interference with school purposes or an educational function&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Where are you, ACLU? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14650484-955510220329017570?l=101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~4/Sm_gVfUT-OI" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><media:thumbnail url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Y1HTaVWB0Oo/T3IpJ-A0b5I/AAAAAAAAAIk/rwDeTxmd-C4/s72-c/F-bomb.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com/2012/03/student-tweets-f-word-gets-expelled.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>The Old Episodes Of Time</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~3/bTkbEIgdcpY/old-episodes-of-time.html</link><author>submit@101usesforbabywipes.com (Dennis Gray)</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Mar 2012 07:15:52 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14650484.post-3972023457213574122</guid><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;

The officers charged with preserving the public safety surely have better things to do than retrieve distraught girls from the bathroom and take them off to high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scenario kept playing out in the the theatre of my mind as I drove...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'm sure that when the girl heard mom call the police, she thought mom was bluffing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;In a way, the high school is like county lock-up, but with more books.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;How is this any different from any house in the USA where there are teenage girls?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is there someone at school with a grudge and a Facebook account?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I hope mom doesn't get arrested for her daughter being truant...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;THAT WAS IT!!&amp;nbsp; Mom was protecting herself legally by notifying police when little Suzy wouldn't go to school.&amp;nbsp; I refer back to my own post in &lt;a href="http://101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com/2011/05/swat-style-sweep-for-parents-of-kids.html"&gt;May 2011&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href="http://www.ocregister.com/news/school-299894-parents-sanchez.html?pic=2"&gt;OC Register reported&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;i&gt; SWAT&lt;/i&gt;-style tactics were being used to round up moms and dads whose children didn't attend school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUR CHILDREN ARE NO LONGER OURS TO CHERISH AND RAISE - THEY BELONG TO THE GOVERNMENT!&amp;nbsp; IF THEY AREN'T IN SCHOOL SO FEDERAL MONIES CAN BE COLLECTED BY THE LOCAL DISTRICTS, THE COPS WILL COME FOR YOU!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we as parents don't make sure the local school districts meet their attendance numbers (and keep their federal income to the district in doing so) the cops will be knocking on our doors!&amp;nbsp; This isn't about keeping kids in school for their benefit, this is about keeping the education establishment in the revenue stream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I need to get rid of the police scanner.&amp;nbsp; Or start home-schooling my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14650484-133447389581997774?l=101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~4/9fAPk1iLRSY" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><media:thumbnail url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-j_xsuUOwEMo/T1ptqnx8e6I/AAAAAAAAAIU/EhmLKgFno9I/s72-c/handcuffs-white.jpg" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com/2012/03/future-of-parenting-call-cops-when-suzy.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>FTC: Apps for Kids aka Digital Wild West (WashPost)</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~3/5GOkhCrecVk/ftc-apps-for-kids-aka-digital-wild-west.html</link><author>submit@101usesforbabywipes.com (Dennis Gray)</author><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2012 07:56:39 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14650484.post-5243701074341991832</guid><description>Fess up Apple and Google!&amp;nbsp;

This means that all my interactions between myself and colleagues, customers, vendors, contractors, takes place in my home studio/office/den/multipurpose room, over Skype or webcam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside there will be no more smoke signals - I have a no-burn ordinance in my neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already had an office at home, and it was a busy one.  I take care of the home business, the charities I work for, the occasional voice-over work all from the comfort of the techno-cocoon the family calls 'the back office'.  I even 'worked from home' a couple days a week in there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While many would welcome such a work arrangement, I find it most unnerving.  Besides having my professional hub of activity for the past decade shut down and stuffed into boxes in my garage, my 'home' i.e. 'back' office is very crowded now, surrounded on ALL sides by computer monitors of various sizes, where only 2 sides were covered before.  It is also very hard to separate 'home' life from 'work' life, since they happen in the same space.  Not to mention the dog barking at a cat outside while I'm in a teleconference spanning 3 continents.  Lacks professionalism somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, here I am, at work, yet on my blog, in sleep pants and a T-shirt, posting away as my son, now 10, stirs and wakes up in his room across the hall on his first official day of summer vacation.  He's still at an age where he wants to spend time with me, but old enough to understand when dad is busy and needs to be left alone.  For that I am blessed, to be able to spend the summer with him in this way really is a gift disguised as cost containment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if the freakin' dog just had a clue, I could deal with it.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14650484-100123207492917945?l=101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~4/6s3Kquj7YcE" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com/2011/06/new-improved-stay-at-home-dad.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Father Shot By Teen Daughter For Taking Cell Phone</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~3/j6ajMDPUeUc/father-shot-by-teen-daughter-for-taking.html</link><author>submit@101usesforbabywipes.com (Dennis Gray)</author><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2011 11:39:49 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14650484.post-1660829967875770569</guid><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DJGrW6apIgE/Td_t9t2ED_I/AAAAAAAAAHs/iaUZVWnOg8g/s1600/archery+target.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="135" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DJGrW6apIgE/Td_t9t2ED_I/AAAAAAAAAHs/iaUZVWnOg8g/s200/archery+target.jpg" width="200" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The girl was despondent, and grounded for bad behavior by her father, so she retreats to her room, gets out a hunting bow and shoots her father, landing a solid shot in his torso.&amp;nbsp; She then goes to him, takes her cell phone back, and prevents dad from using it to call 911.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He crawls out a window, with the arrow still protruding from his body, makes his way to a car and drives 1/3 mile to use the neighbor's phone to call for help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Det.

is reporting that Aaron's used images taken from customer's webcams on PCs they had rented AND PAID OFF IN FULL.  A class-action suit is likely to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the report, &lt;span id="ctl00_MainContent_lblBody"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Crystal and Brian Byrd of Wyoming had completed their rent-to-own contract, but due to some 'clerical error', the rental outift came to their home, armed with pics taken with the webcam on the laptop they had recently paid off, presumably 'evidence' to the ownership of the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Byrds, in their statement to the AP, said that their main concern was for the safety of their family.  They have small children, and if Aaron's had decided to snap a pic while their kids were getting out of the tub, that could be construed as child porn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My concern is this: IF the software used to 'spy' on the Byrd's is found to be&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt; legal&lt;/span&gt;, when does it get de-activated?  The software used also logs keystrokes as well, so is Aaron's intending to monitor the customer's web habits as a form of 'leverage'?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE!  I would suggest that if you buy a PC with a webcam, better wipe the hard disk clean before you use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14650484-8748377344307645148?l=101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~4/p-K3i-BNgXc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><media:thumbnail url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jsCfjsV4xPk/TcFmv3DX8qI/AAAAAAAAAHM/T0TgUzpPDrg/s72-c/Aarons.png" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com/2011/05/pc-rental-outfit-uses-webcams-to-spy-on.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Undercover Survey: Mature Rated Games Hard To Buy</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~3/CpAHNiYTD84/undercover-survey-mature-rated-games.html</link><category>kids</category><category>epic fail</category><category>esrb</category><category>violent video games</category><author>submit@101usesforbabywipes.com (Dennis Gray)</author><pubDate>Thu, 21 Apr 2011 11:40:52 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14650484.post-7398058181114161564</guid><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DY0pKROtFNo/TbB5Xjm9rgI/AAAAAAAAAHE/OxK4TqlGWzE/s1600/kids%2Bwith%2Bguns.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 274px; height: 184px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DY0pKROtFNo/TbB5Xjm9rgI/AAAAAAAAAHE/OxK4TqlGWzE/s320/kids%2Bwith%2Bguns.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5598107782424145410" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to cnet.com's blogger Don Reisinger, the stats show that video games rated mature or higher are 'hard' to buy, with 13% of teenagers who were not age-appropriate being able to score the title anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT IS NOT HARD TO BUY!!

The store founder was quoted saying "It's pure, it's natural, it's organic, and it's free range — and if it's  good enough for our kids, it's good enough to use in our ice cream."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who can argue with that logic?&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14650484-6271899325625062581?l=101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~4/Qw2QSR-rgp0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com/2011/03/breast-milk-ice-cream-pulled-from-uk.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>ACLU Looking into Preschoolers Being 'Chipped'</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~3/y1NzHgmy66w/aclu-looking-into-preschoolers-being.html</link><author>submit@101usesforbabywipes.com (Dennis Gray)</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2010 21:24:09 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-14650484.post-7326364600765900635</guid><description>From&lt;a href="http://www.californiawatch.org/watchblog/aclu-raises-questions-about-microchip-tracking-preschoolers-4476"&gt; 'California Watch'&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;"The American Civil Liberties Union is questioning Contra Costa officials  over their implementation of a microchip tracking program in their  preschool centers.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click the link for the article.

(refer to the blog post from Jan 14, 2009 for background).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Little Adolf Hitler Campbell, along with his sisters, JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell and Honszlynn Hinler Jeannie Campbell, will not be returning to their parents by order of the State of New Jersey.  The ruling comes over a year after authorities removed the children, at the time citing the names as cause.  In fact, the State had to go looking for a reason to keep the kids; the Family Court found no cause to remove them (other than the names, I suspect).  But yet the kids stayed in 'protective custody' while the search for a better reason continued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The State has back-peddled a bit, now denying the names were the reason for revoking parental rights, and disclosing a few more dark details;&lt;br /&gt;1) Unemployed parents who were abused,&lt;br /&gt;2) 'Untreated' psychological problems (both mom and dad),&lt;br /&gt;3) A father who can't read or write,&lt;br /&gt;4) A mother who quit school in the 10th grade,&lt;br /&gt;5) Adolf's vocabulary - at age 4 he can make sailors blush,&lt;br /&gt;6) Accusations of abuse by the dad, Heath, who according to this &lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/parents-cannot-regain-custody-children-nazi-inspired/story?id=11334970"&gt;ABC piece&lt;/a&gt; has been married twice before, with one ex-spouse moving away for her own protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Campbells also have some interesting home decorating ideas, choosing swords and skulls over lace doilies and cut flowers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the State was justified to remove these kids from their parents in light of the new details.  As dire as the state has made this all out to be, its just amazing that the Campbells managed to survive day-to-day.  But to me, if the state is going to use employment status, level of education and/or mental health issues as justification for removing kids from their parents, there may be no home in New Jersey left unchallenged, including the foster homes where these kids will wind up.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/14650484-2508903899616280802?l=101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/101UsesForBabyWipes/~4/XguhpgX9t1E" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><media:thumbnail url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zPrGqWsbdlo/TGDYkhvH_1I/AAAAAAAAAGc/qauc1vKZQ7M/s72-c/Heath-adolf-deborah.jpg" height="72" width="72" /><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://101usesforbabywipes.blogspot.com/2010/08/adolf-hitler-campbell-part-zwei.html</feedburner:origLink></item><copyright>(c) Dennis Gray, Listen and Enjoy!</copyright><media:credit role="author">Dennis Gray</media:credit><media:rating>nonadult</media:rating></channel></rss>
