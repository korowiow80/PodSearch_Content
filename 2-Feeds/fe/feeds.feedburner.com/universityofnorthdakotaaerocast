    <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/UniversityOfNorthDakotaAerocast/~3/CCzL_OobdDM/chandelles_720p.m4v</link> 
    <description>UND CFI's Mike Lents and Anthony Bottini take you, the pilot, through the necessary steps to complete the Chandelle maneuver at the Commercial Pilot level in the Cessna-172. This performance maneuver plays a vital role in the pilot's training repertoire as it builds the skills necessary to smoothly and accurately control the aircraft, as well as teaches the pilot all about maneuvering at very high Angles of Attack, close to the stall margin.  Enjoy this latest UND AeroCast episode and a huge thanks to Kevin and Brenda for another great batch of fan photos. Keep 'em coming!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/UniversityOfNorthDakotaAerocast/~4/CCzL_OobdDM" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

    <title>Faulty Approaches Episode 4: Crosswind Considerations (Large/720P)</title> 
    <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/UniversityOfNorthDakotaAerocast/~3/HddpFU81opE/faulty_approaches_e_4_youtube.m4v</link> 
    <description>UND CFIs Mike Lents and Anthony Bottini round off the last part of the four part series: "Faulty Approaches and Landings."  This final episode discusses numerous hazards that can threaten an otherwise solid approach when a crosswind condition is present.  Since most approaches and landings are executed during some kind of crosswind situation, it is advised that each pilot use this episode to review crosswind landing techniques to really hone their crosswind skills and hopefully avoid crosswind hazards such as touching down in a crab, the dreaded ground-loop and/or experiencing a wing rise after touchdown.  We hope you've enjoyed this four part series.  Let us know what you thought by sending our UND AeroCast staff an email at undaerocast@aero.und.edu and stay tuned for a bunch of future episodes.  By the way, as usual, a huge thanks goes out this time to Timothy and Bret for sending us some truly stunning fan photos.

    <description>UND CFI's Mike Lents and Anthony Bottini team up again to bring to you the third episode of the four part series, "Faulty Approaches and Landings."  Learn all about the hazards of landing in precarious attitudes that can threaten directional control and the structural of your nose-wheel.  This episode highlights three situations where a pilot should exercise caution in regards to his or her nose-wheel to include Hard Landings, Porpoising and Wheelbarrowing.  Enjoy this latest AeroCast episode and stay tuned for episode 4 of the Faulty Approach series.  A huge thanks to Sam Wagener for submitting some fan photos of some random and picturesque northern-midwest flying.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/UniversityOfNorthDakotaAerocast/~4/KLgBjDJmHe0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

    <description>UND CFI's Mike Lents and Anthony Bottini team up again to bring to you the second episode of the four part series, "Faulty Approaches and Landings."  This episode focuses on timing considerations that could impact you and your aircraft during any phase of the approach and landing.  This episode will describe different timing errors, how to make small corrections for a safe landing and when to perform a go-around should the errors cause the approach to depart from a normal, stabilized approach.  The specific errors covered include the High Roundout, the Late or Rapid Roundout, Ballooning and Bouncing.  Enjoy this latest AeroCast episode and stay tuned for episode 3 of the Faulty Approach series.  Thanks goes out this time to Shane Petersen for sharing some amazing photos from the his trip to the far east.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/UniversityOfNorthDakotaAerocast/~4/Ka9H3qeq1G0" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

    <title>Faulty Approaches Episode 1: Energy Management (HD Large)</title> 
    <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/UniversityOfNorthDakotaAerocast/~3/ct3WhZqJQgc/faulty_approaches_e1_large.m4v</link> 
    <description>As a recent addition to the FAA Airplane Flying Handbook, UND Aerospace has decided to tackle the Faulty Approach and Landing on this episode of the UND AeroCast.  This episode is meant to shed some light on that grey area during many approaches when the pilot has to decide, based on the airplane's current state, if the approach can safely continue with minor corrections or if its time to call an unstable approach and go around.  UND Aerospace CFI, Anthony Bottini uses an in-depth script written by UND CFI Mike Lents to outline various factors that could cause any approach to be considered Faulty.  As the first episode in a four part series, the instruction will be geared towards faulty approach concepts that involve the pilot's Energy Management skills.  As always the UND AeroCast staff would like to thank our latest Fan Photo contributor, Rachel Fish, for her photos of the UND Piper Cub with floats.  Stay tuned for episode number two!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/UniversityOfNorthDakotaAerocast/~4/ct3WhZqJQgc" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

    <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/UniversityOfNorthDakotaAerocast/~3/v_qTDyrHqck/normal_landings_large.m4v</link> 
    <description>Its back to basics on this UND AeroCast episode. Although we call it Normal, the Normal Approach and Landing is one of the most challenging parts of any flight to consistently master.  In this episode, UND CFI Anthony Bottini guides you through the procedures and techniques defined by UND Aerospace Standardization that allows the pilot to make safe, stabilized approaches and landings again and again.  If you're a new student, use this episode as a guide during your flight training to aid in building your confidence in making safe approaches and landings and developing the experience to help decide when it is time to go around. For you seasoned pilots, maybe its time to brush up on some basic skills to keep you safe and, well, maybe impress your next group of passengers.  Thanks to Rodolfo from São Paulo, Brazil and to Paula from Grand Forks, ND for sending some absolutely stunning fan photos.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/UniversityOfNorthDakotaAerocast/~4/v_qTDyrHqck" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

For you seasoned pilots, maybe its time to brush up on some basic skills to keep you safe and, well, maybe impress your next group of passengers.  Thanks to Rodolfo from São Paulo, Brazil and to Paula from Grand Forks, ND for sending some absolutely stunning fan photos.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/UniversityOfNorthDakotaAerocast/~4/JaKQDGSjelg" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

    <description>As a newcomer to the AeroCast, but certainly no newcomer to aviation, UND Lead Flight Instructor, Sam Wagener, teaches Seminole standardization in UND's fully digital Piper Seminole.  The Configuration Demonstration is an integral maneuver in any pilot's multi-engine training and helps pilots to understand the effects of configuration changes on one-engine inoperative aircraft performance.  Thanks to Brian and Alec for the fantastic sign-off.
