			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jesus is known for His compassion.  As believers we want to be compassionate.  However, at times our compassion is only for certain types of people in certain types of situations.  Some needs are valued while other needs are not.  The problem arises when our values don&#8217;t match up with God&#8217;s values.  Jesus deals with this issue in a very powerful and often misunderstood story in Matthew 15:21-28.   Imagine if you had created a person, literally knitting them together in their mother&#8217;s womb.  Surely your value for them would be significantly great than the value held by a person who sees them as competition for time, food or space. I suppose if you created everyone individually there really would be no outsiders.</p>
<p>As a believer we need to consider our values in light of those held by God.   If they don&#8217;t match we must change.  Please listen to our message <a title="The Outsider &amp; The Mission" href="http://www.wnlarchive.org/blogfolder/mp3/WNLA_AM_Service_Sun.May.29,2011ED.mp3">The Outsider &amp; The Mission</a> and see what God might want to do in your life.</p>
