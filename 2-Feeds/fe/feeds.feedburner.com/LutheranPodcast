Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me. What have you done?" 36Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is not from here." 37 Pilate asked him, "So you are a king?"

Not one stone will be left here upon another; all will be thrown down." 3When he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, 4"Tell us, when will this be, and what will be the sign that all these things are about to be accomplished?" 5Then Jesus began to say to them, "Beware that no one leads you astray. 6Many will come in my name and say, 'I am he!' and they will lead many astray. 7When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; this must take place, but the end is still to come. 8For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines.

They devour widows' houses and for the sake of appearance say long prayers.  They will receive the greater condemnation."  He said down opposite the treasury, and watched the crowd putting money into the treasury.  Many rich people put in large sums.  A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which are worth a penny.  Then he called his disciples and said to them, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury.  For all of them have contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;(Mark 12:38-44)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15383499-116415617054905384?l=manitedpc.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>ELCA Lutheran Sermon Sermons, Pastor Don Rose "Unbound and Let Go" 2006-11-05</title><link>http://manitedpc.blogspot.com/2006/11/elca-lutheran-sermon-sermons-pastor_05.html</link><author>sunworks@smig.net (Clinton Meyer)</author><pubDate>Sun, 05 Nov 2006 16:53:44 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-15383499.post-116277442381222489</guid><description>&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;As Jesus called Lazurus from the bondage of death and the tomb, so Jesus calls us from the bondage of sin.

It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;39Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, already there is a stench because he has been dead four days.” 40Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?” 41So they took away the stone. And Jesus looked upward and said, “Father, I thank you for having heard me. 42I knew that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me.” 43When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” 44The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped in a cloth.

What do you mean by saying, ‘You will be made free’?” 34Jesus answered them, “Very truly, I tell you, everyone who commits sin is a slave to sin. 35The slave does not have a permanent place in the household; the son has a place there forever. 36So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;(John 8:31-36)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15383499-116251419329795280?l=manitedpc.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>ELCA Lutheran Sermon Sermons, Pastor Don Rose "Dying To Serve" 2006-10-22</title><link>http://manitedpc.blogspot.com/2006/10/elca-lutheran-sermon-sermons-pastor_22.html</link><author>sunworks@smig.net (Clinton Meyer)</author><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2006 10:47:45 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-15383499.post-116153926460077896</guid><description>&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;At this affirmation of baptism (confirmation) we are encouraged to serve Christ in our daily lives instead of serving everybody and everything before we think of serving Christ.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Holy Gospel according to Mark, the 10th chapter:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came forward to him and said to him, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you." 36And he said to them, "What is it you want me to do for you?" 37And they said to him, "Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory." 38But Jesus said to them, "You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?" 39They replied, "We are able." Then Jesus said to them, "The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized; 40but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared." 41When the ten heard this, they began to be angry with James and John. 42So Jesus called them and said to them, "You know that among the Gentiles those whom they recognize as their rulers lord it over them, and their great ones are tyrants over them. 43But it is not so among you; but whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, 44and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all. 45For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;(Mark 10:35-45)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15383499-116153926460077896?l=manitedpc.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>ELCA Lutheran Sermon Sermons, Pastor Don Rose "Then Who?" 2006-10-15</title><link>http://manitedpc.blogspot.com/2006/10/elca-lutheran-sermon-sermons-pastor_15.html</link><author>sunworks@smig.net (Clinton Meyer)</author><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2006 18:19:02 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-15383499.post-116096154212577787</guid><description>&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;If it is true that human beings cannot secure their own goodness and salvation, then who will be saved?

No one is good but God alone. 19You know the commandments: ‘You shall not murder; You shall not commit adultery; You shall not steal; You shall not bear false witness; You shall not defraud; Honor your father and mother.'" 20He said to him, "Teacher, I have kept all these since my youth." 21Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said, "You lack one thing; go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me." 22When he heard this, he was shocked and went away grieving, for he had many possessions. 23Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!" 24And the disciples were perplexed at these words. But Jesus said to them again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! 25It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God." 26They were greatly astounded and said to one another, "Then who can be saved?" 27Jesus looked at them and said, "For mortals it is impossible, but not for God; for God all things are possible." 28Peter began to say to him, "Look, we have left everything and followed you." 29Jesus said, "Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, 30who will not receive a hundredfold now in this age—houses, brothers and sisters, mothers and children, and fields, with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life. 31But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;(Mark 10:17-31)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15383499-116096154212577787?l=manitedpc.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>ELCA Lutheran Sermon Sermons, Pastor Don Rose "Back to the Beginning" 2006-10-08</title><link>http://manitedpc.blogspot.com/2006/10/elca-lutheran-sermon-sermons-pastor_09.html</link><author>sunworks@smig.net (Clinton Meyer)</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2006 09:40:21 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-15383499.post-116041202067784257</guid><description>&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;In the matter of relationships Jesus calls us to consider God's intent in both the beginning as well as the end of time.

He entered a house and did not want anyone to know he was there. Yet he could not escape notice, 25but a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him, and she came and bowed down at his feet. 26Now the woman was a Gentile, of Syrophoenician origin. She begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. 27He said to her, "Let the children be fed first, for it is not fair to take the children's food and throw it to the dogs." 28But she answered him, "Sir, even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs." 29Then he said to her, "For saying that, you may go—the demon has left your daughter." 30So she went home, found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone. 31Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis. 32They brought to him a deaf man who had an impediment in his speech; and they begged him to lay his hand on him. 33He took him aside in private, away from the crowd, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue. 34Then looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, "Ephphatha," that is, "Be opened." 35And immediately his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. 36Then Jesus£ ordered them to tell no one; but the more he ordered them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. 37They were astounded beyond measure, saying, "He has done everything well; he even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;(Mark 7:24-37)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15383499-115809373713812203?l=manitedpc.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>ELCA Lutheran Sermon Sermons, Pastor Don Rose "Matters of the Heart" 2006-09-03</title><link>http://manitedpc.blogspot.com/2006/09/elca-lutheran-sermon-sermons-pastor.html</link><author>sunworks@smig.net (Clinton Meyer)</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Sep 2006 16:40:15 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-15383499.post-115732681506003485</guid><description>&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;The Gift of God in the Savior Jesus changes our hearts that we might live in the fulness of God's grace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Holy Gospel according to Mark, the 7th chapter:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now when the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him, 2they noticed that some of his disciples were eating with defiled hands, that is, without washing them. 3(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat unless they thoroughly wash their hands, thus observing the tradition of the elders; 4and they do not eat anything from the market unless they wash it; and there are also many other traditions that they observe, the washing of cups, pots, and bronze kettles.) 5So the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?" 6He said to them, "Isaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honors me with theirlips, but their hearts are far from me; 7in vain do they worship me, teaching human precepts as doctrines.' 8You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition."14Then he called the crowd again and said to them, "Listen to me, all of you, and understand: 15there is nothing outside a person that by going in can defile, but the things that come out are what defile." 21For it is from within, from the human heart, that evil intentions come: fornication, theft, murder, 22adultery, avarice, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, folly. 23All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;(Mark 7:1-8, 14-15, 21-23)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15383499-115732681506003485?l=manitedpc.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>ELCA Lutheran Sermon Sermons, Pastor Don Rose "Still Offending" 2006-08-27</title><link>http://manitedpc.blogspot.com/2006/08/elca-lutheran-sermon-sermons-pastor_27.html</link><author>sunworks@smig.net (Clinton Meyer)</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2006 11:43:42 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-15383499.post-115670421929337345</guid><description>&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;The words of Jesus were offensive to many who first heard them.

But the one who eats this bread will live forever." 59He said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.   60When many of his disciples heard it, they said, "This teaching is difficult; who can accept it?" 61But Jesus, being aware that his disciples were complaining about it, said to them, "Does this offend you? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;62Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63It is the spirit that gives life; the flesh is useless. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 64But among you there are some who do not believe." For Jesus knew from the first who were the ones that did not believe, and who was the one that would betray him. 65And he said, "For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted by the Father." 66Because of this many of his disciples turned back and no longer went about with him. 67So Jesus asked the twelve, "Do you also wish to go away?" 68Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom can we go?

But what are they among so many people?” 10Jesus said, “Make the people sit down.” Now there was a great deal of grass in the place; so they sat down, about five thousand in all. 11Then Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted. 12When they were satisfied, he told his disciples, “Gather up the fragments left over, so that nothing may be lost.” 13So they gathered them up, and from the fragments of the five barley loaves, left by those who had eaten, they filled twelve baskets. 14When the people saw the sign that he had done, they began to say, “This is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15When Jesus realized that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, he withdrew again to the mountain by himself. 16When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, 17got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them. 18The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing. 19When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were terrified. 20But he said to them, “It is I; do not be afraid.” 21Then they wanted to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the land toward which they were going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;(John 6:1-21)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15383499-115445793088476387?l=manitedpc.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>ELCA Lutheran Sermon Sermons, Pastor Don Rose "The Promise of Compassion" 2006-07-23</title><link>http://manitedpc.blogspot.com/2006/07/elca-lutheran-sermon-sermons-pastor_23.html</link><author>sunworks@smig.net (Clinton Meyer)</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jul 2006 20:37:34 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-15383499.post-115371225403979528</guid><description>&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Jesus sees the need of the people and promises them the gift of compassion, both in the past and in the present and for the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Holy Gospel according to Mark, the 6th chapter:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The apostles gathered around Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught. 31He said to them, "Come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest a while." For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. 32And they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves. 33Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they hurried there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As he went ashore, he saw a great crowd; and he had compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things. 53When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored the boat. 54When they got out of the boat, people at once recognized him, 55and rushed about that whole region and began to bring the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was. 56And wherever he went, into villages or cities or farms, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his cloak; and all who touched it were healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;(Mark 6:30-34, 53-56)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15383499-115371225403979528?l=manitedpc.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>ELCA Lutheran Sermon Sermons, Pastor Don Rose "Easy To Give In" 2006-07-16</title><link>http://manitedpc.blogspot.com/2006/07/elca-lutheran-sermon-sermons-pastor_16.html</link><author>sunworks@smig.net (Clinton Meyer)</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2006 12:41:28 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-15383499.post-115307888816978639</guid><description>&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Without faith and the power of God's Spirit, it is easy to give in to the world and its expectations just as Herod did so long ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Holy Gospel according to Mark, the 6th chapter:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King Herod heard of it, for Jesus’ name had become known. Some were saying, “John the baptizer has been raised from the dead; and for this reason these powers are at work in him.” 15But others said, “It is Elijah.” And others said, “It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.” 16But when Herod heard of it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;17For Herod himself had sent men who arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because Herod had married her. 18For John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” 19And Herodias had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not, 20for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he protected him. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed; and yet he liked to listen to him. 21But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and for the leaders of Galilee. 22When his daughter Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it.” 23And he solemnly swore to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even half of my kingdom.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;24She went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” She replied, “The head of John the baptizer.” 25Immediately she rushed back to the king and requested, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.” 26The king was deeply grieved; yet out of regard for his oaths and for the guests, he did not want to refuse her. 27Immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard with orders to bring John’s head. He went and beheaded him in the prison, 28brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl. Then the girl gave it to her mother. 29When his disciples heard about it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;(Mark 6:14-29)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15383499-115307888816978639?l=manitedpc.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">1</thr:total></item><item><title></title><link>http://manitedpc.blogspot.com/2006/07/just-google-elca-sermons-to-find-links.html</link><author>sunworks@smig.net (Clinton Meyer)</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2006 22:31:55 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-15383499.post-115276871445194568</guid><description>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2152/1185/1600/GoogleBraille.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2152/1185/320/GoogleBraille.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just Google "ELCA Sermons" to find links to our podcasts.

They said, “Where did this man get all this? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What deeds of power are being done by his hands! 3Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they took offense at him. 4Then Jesus said to them, “Prophets are not without honor, except in their hometown, and among their own kin, and in their own house.” 5And he could do no deed of power there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and cured them. 6And he was amazed at their unbelief. Then he went about among the villages teaching. 7He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8He ordered them to take nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts; 9but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics. 10He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place. 11If any place will not welcome you and they refuse to hear you, as you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.” 12So they went out and proclaimed that all should repent. 13They cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;(Mark 6:1-13)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15383499-115272101529460981?l=manitedpc.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>ELCA Lutheran Sermon Sermons, Pastor Don Rose "Hope at the End of the Rope" 2006-07-02</title><link>http://manitedpc.blogspot.com/2006/07/elca-lutheran-sermon-sermons-pastor.html</link><author>sunworks@smig.net (Clinton Meyer)</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2006 07:53:31 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-15383499.post-115228401077274997</guid><description>&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;The hope of faith is realized when we know that though there is nothing that we can do, God can do anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;The Holy Gospel according to Mark, the 5th chapter:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered around him; and he was by the sea. Then one of the leaders of the synagogue named Jairus came and, when he saw him, fell at his feet and begged him repeatedly, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live.” So he went with him. And a large crowd followed him and pressed in on him. Now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years. She had endured much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had; and she was no better, but rather grew worse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She had heard about Jesus, and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, for she said, “If I but touch his clothes, I will be made well.” Immediately her hemorrhage stopped; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. Immediately aware that power had gone forth from him, Jesus turned about in the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?” And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing in on you; how can you say, ‘Who touched me?’” He looked all around to see who had done it. But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, fell down before him, and told him the whole truth. He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease.” &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While he was still speaking, some people came from the leader’s house to say, “Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the teacher any further?” But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the leader of the synagogue, “Do not fear, only believe.” He allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James. When they came to the house of the leader of the synagogue, he saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly. When he had entered, he said to them, “Why do you make a commotion and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping.” And they laughed at him. Then he put them all outside, and took the child’s father and mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was. He took her by the hand and said to her, “Talitha cum,” which means, “Little girl, get up!” And immediately the girl got up and began to walk about (she was twelve years of age). At this they were overcome with amazement. He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;(Mark 5:21-43)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15383499-115228401077274997?l=manitedpc.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><item><title>ELCA Lutheran Sermon Sermons, Pastor Don Rose "The Sea and the Other Side" 2006-06-25</title><link>http://manitedpc.blogspot.com/2006/06/elca-lutheran-sermon-sermons-pastor_26.html</link><author>sunworks@smig.net (Clinton Meyer)</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jun 2006 13:20:58 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-15383499.post-115135325756499838</guid><description>&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;The sea and the other side represent the stormy places of life that can cause fear and anxiety.

Other boats were with him. 37A great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already being swamped. 38But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him up and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?" 39He woke up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" Then the wind ceased, and there was a dead calm. 40He said to them, "Why are you afraid? Have you still no faith?" 41And they were filled with great awe and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;(Mark 4:35-41)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/15383499-115135325756499838?l=manitedpc.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total></item><copyright>SunWorks Ltd. 2005</copyright><media:credit role="author">Clinton Meyer</media:credit><media:rating>nonadult</media:rating></channel></rss>
