			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This episode was put together by Malcolm Garrett and is a pretty comprehensive introduction to the world of Progressive Rock (not &#8216;Prog&#8217; though, there is a difference).</p>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">There was once a time (as the sixties turned into the seventies) when pretty much all music that wasn&#8217;t classified as pop, classical, jazz, or (the dreaded) easy listening, was known simply as &#8216;underground&#8217; or &#8216;progressive&#8217;.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Everything contemporary, unusual and otherwise unclassifiable found its way into a rack in the record store that was labelled just &#8216;progressive&#8217;. Naturally this was the principal place I would look for anything exciting or challenging. I would return to the same few stores in Manchester and thumb through the same collections of discs week by week, wondering whether or not to buy a particular disc, invariably one adorned with a curious image and with an esoteric sounding title, trying to decide if the music would be as enjoyably intriguing as the sleeve. There was no internet to aid research, so almost everything I sampled was based on personal recommendation, or a lead from an enthusiastic NME or Melody Maker review. More often than not I simply bought it on a whim, or after a cursory listen to a track or two in the listening booths still installed in the better stores.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Faced with a mixed lot of largely unknown and previously unheard discs, and with precious little guidance, it is remarkable that most albums I picked up were by and large fresh and eminently listenable. Some of what I found was truly progressive, in a way that I don&#8217;t think has been heard since. The world of music really was opening up. In that first explosion of audio experimentation, I discovered things that are genuinely timeless, and so, with the passing of time, here I am still listening.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">A cautionary note, however. Please do not confuse &#8216;progressive&#8217; with &#8216;Prog&#8217;. At some sad time in the early- to mid-seventies, the likes of ELP, Rick Wakeman and Yes would appear to have embarked upon a willful and systematic ruination of the genre. With each new album they recorded longer and longer pieces, but for no discernible benefit, and with less and less musical discipline or charm. Often they had fairly meaningless &#8216;concepts&#8217; underlying them, in an attempt to imbue them with some sort of higher musical significance.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Thus it was that the perfectly acceptable, and suitably descriptive, tag of &#8216;progressive&#8217; was mercilessly shortened to simply &#8216;Prog&#8217; rock. This was a quite different term for what was quite different music altogether, albeit springing from similar origins. This rather pejorative term has lingered in the collective memory as one which not only sums up this other largely unpleasant musical backwater, but sadly has also besmirched the heritage and credibility of musically sophisticated recordings such as the ones to be found in this collection.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">What we have in this playlist, by way of clarification, is mostly work from those early days of progressive, and is definitely not what I would call &#8216;Prog&#8217;. This, instead, is from the time when pop seemed to turn to rock almost overnight, and the LP found favour as a preferred medium to the 3 minute single, which by then was already redolent of the first psychedelic era. A later playlist will address more directly the transition from pop single to rock LP track, but these recordings are definitely album material only. They are somewhat longer than 3 minutes, no longer constrained by 7&#8243; vinyl nor daytime radio restrictions, and whilst they feature extended instrumental passages, and are musically quite complex, they display a sparkling sense of musical invention. The basic instrumentation of electric guitar, bass, drums was augmented first with keyboards, then often with wind and strings, and most significantly, with their electronic counterpart: the magnificent mellotron.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">This collection begins and ends with pieces by Van der Graaf Generator, who are archetypal &#8216;progressive&#8217;, and a band truly without equal. The opener &#8216;Man Erg&#8217;, from their opus &#8216;Pawn Hearts&#8217;, has been played continuously by me since its release in 1971, and it still chills me with its haunting presence. The last piece is an impassioned live rendition of &#8216;Childlike Faith in Childhood&#8217;s End&#8217;, which was the closing track from the penultimate Van der Graaf album, &#8216;Still Life&#8217;, before they called it a day in 1976, and laid the way clear for Punk.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">I could write much more about the other songs in this list, and detail my reasons for selecting them, but I&#8217;m hoping that you&#8217;ll discover and enjoy this music with that same spirit of enquiry that I did first time around.</div>

		<itunes:summary>This episode was put together by Malcolm Garrett and is a pretty comprehensive introduction to the world of Progressive Rock (not 'Prog' though, there is a difference).
There was once a time (as the sixties turned into the seventies) when pretty much all music that wasn't classified as pop, classical, jazz, or (the dreaded) easy listening, was known simply as 'underground' or 'progressive'.
Everything contemporary, unusual and otherwise unclassifiable found its way into a rack in the record store that was labelled just 'progressive'. Naturally this was the principal place I would look for anything exciting or challenging. I would return to the same few stores in Manchester and thumb through the same collections of discs week by week, wondering whether or not to buy a particular disc, invariably one adorned with a curious image and with an esoteric sounding title, trying to decide if the music would be as enjoyably intriguing as the sleeve. There was no internet to aid research, so almost everything I sampled was based on personal recommendation, or a lead from an enthusiastic NME or Melody Maker review. More often than not I simply bought it on a whim, or after a cursory listen to a track or two in the listening booths still installed in the better stores.
Faced with a mixed lot of largely unknown and previously unheard discs, and with precious little guidance, it is remarkable that most albums I picked up were by and large fresh and eminently listenable. Some of what I found was truly progressive, in a way that I don't think has been heard since. The world of music really was opening up. In that first explosion of audio experimentation, I discovered things that are genuinely timeless, and so, with the passing of time, here I am still listening.

This collection begins and ends with pieces by Van der Graaf Generator, who are archetypal 'progressive', and a band truly without equal. The opener 'Ma</itunes:summary>

<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 20px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">The year is 1972 and I&#8217;ve just met Barbie. I am not long turned 16. Barbie will have an immediate and lasting effect on my life, but, as we&#8217;re just concerned with music here, I want to share with you the music that she shared with me.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 20px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">These were what I consider to be her songs. Yes, this is a collection of songs, whereas at that time my appreciation of music was actually focused at a more specifically sonic level.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 20px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">I tended to like the instrumental passages in the music I listened to, and lyrical detail always rather passed me by. I&#8217;d been enjoying the blues-based riffs of Cream, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and other similar &#8216;hard rock&#8217; bands of that era. At an opposite extreme I was beginning an exploration into the avant garde electronics of the nascent Kosmische Musik of bands from Berlin, Düsseldorf and Cologne. Meeting Barbie introduced me to another sphere of music, and prepared me for another way of listening.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 20px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">I&#8217;d always heard the human voice as another instrument, and it seems I seldom paid attention to the words I was hearing. I enjoyed the cadence of a female voice, say, or a lyric sung in a language I did not understand. I can&#8217;t really have been fully cogniscent of that for I am now genuinely surprised that I feel I am only hearing the songs properly as songs now, and I must previously never have really taken in much specific meaning from what I was listening to at all.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 20px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">This collection, then, displays more depth and maturity than perhaps I did at the time. And over time I&#8217;ve come to appreciate these songs more and more. Barbie adored these songs. She would play them often, and consequently they have stuck with me. That said, there is a somewhat melancholy tone to many of them. This fact was not entirely lost on me, as I thought some of them far too &#8216;girly&#8217; and not at all what a sophisticated music afficianado should listen to. How wrong was I?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 20px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Perhaps the most surprising thing is that so many sad songs were so loved by a girl who had such a bright disposition and always adopted a happy-go-lucky approach to life. Nothing seemed to get in her way, and things in life always seemed to go her way quite naturally. These songs reveal a sentimentality that she did not display in her day to day life. In many ways she quite suited the name Barbie, although she was not blonde, was nobody&#8217;s toy, and had a mind that was already adult, intelligent and focused on a bright future. I wonder what she thinks of this collection now.</div>

It&#8217;s a bit like a hi-fi version of when you were young and you used to mess around with the longwave radio to find foreign stations&#8230;</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;">Oh, and you can play everyone&#8217;s favourite Anglophone game – listen to the tracks and see if you can hear any English words in the foreign-ness. For example, on the final track: &#8220;where am I? Bushey!&#8221;, or on the Sigur Rós effort: &#8220;You sigh low&#8221;, et cetera.&#8221;</div>
