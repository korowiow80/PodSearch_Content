<p>Mark Joyner and his team at Simpleology has just created a multi-media course about blogging.</p>

<p>You might think this is odd given that Mark is no where to be found in the blogosphere. However he maintains that he has a great blog course and he is offering it for a free evaluation if you blog about it.</p>

<p>You can find <a href="http://www.simpleology.com/training/blogging/index.php">all the details here</a>. The course is meant to cover:</p>

<ul><li>The best blogging techniques</li></ul>

<ul><li>How to get traffic to your blog</li></ul>

<ul><li>How to monetise your blog.</li></ul>

<p>I've not received my copy of the course as yet but I'll let you know my evaluation of it as soon as I receive it. In the meantime, <a href="http://www.simpleology.com/training/blogging/index.php">why not request your free copy today</a>?</p></div><div class="feedflare">

who is interested in how to ensure you create high performing teams,
then you will be interested in the next Masterclass I am organising for
the <a mce_href="http://www.associationforcoaching.com" target="_blank" href="http://www.associationforcoaching.com/">Association for Coaching in Ireland</a>.</p>
<p>Our next events will be taking place on the <a mce_href="http://www.associationforcoaching.com/event/ACDUB290108.pdf" target="_blank" href="http://www.associationforcoaching.com/event/ACDUB290108.pdf">29 January 2008 in Dublin</a> and <a mce_href="http://www.associationforcoaching.com/event/ACBEL300108.pdf" target="_blank" href="http://www.associationforcoaching.com/event/ACBEL300108.pdf">30 January 2008 in Belfast</a> and the subject will be "Coaching the Team at Work".</p>
<p>Very little real research has been undertaken into team coaching
outside sport; sports analogies, while often being used in the context
of coaching teams at work, have only limited application to the world
of work.</p>
<p>Team coaching at work is frequently confused with team facilitation
or team building. Professor David Clutterbuck’s will share insights
from his latest book “Coaching the Team at Work”, which is the first
in-depth study of team coaching outside the world of sport.</p>
<p>The workshop will cover:</p>
<ul><li>An understanding of the fundamentals of effective team coaching</li></ul>
<ul><li>Tools, techniques and processes for assessing team dynamics</li></ul>
<ul><li>Insights into some of the most common issues teams face and how the coach can assist the team to address them</li></ul>
<ul><li>Awareness of the ethical and practical issues involved in managing
the complexities of multiple simultaneous clients and customers</li></ul>
<ul><li>An understanding of how to “wean off” the team from the coach so that it coaches itself.</li></ul>
<p>Make sure that you book your place soon for "<a mce_href="http://www.associationforcoaching.com/event/event2i.htm" target="_blank" href="http://www.associationforcoaching.com/event/event2i.htm">Coaching the Team at Work</a>" to avoid disappointment.

<p>Today I received an urgent call from a client who was distressed by a conversation she had had with a potential designer. She had been connected to this person in good faith by her local printer as she wanted to work on developing a new visual identity for her business.</p>

<p>What threw her was the downright rudeness of the designer. During the course of the conversation they completely savaged the website and reputation of one of her colleagues, quoting what can only be construed as gross fabrications and lies - yet they had never met my clients colleague or knew anything about thei business.</p>

<p>They then went on to be dismissive of her business without knowing much about it.</p>

<p>When you are in the early stages of developing a business, it is easy to be put off course by people who are "nay sayers" and this conversation today was of little help to my client.</p>

<p>I was only too pleased to have been on hand to talk to her.</p>

<p>Bottom line, this designer has done nothing to further their reputation or credibility. As my client stated:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>If they are like that about people they do not even know and they are talking about someone I respect hugely, there is no way I could put my trust in them.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">In that short conversation on the phone, that designer has put into question one of the most important things we must develop for healthy relationships in business and our personal life - trust.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It takes time to develop, a moment to destroy and an eternity to rebuild.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While we may have beliefs about our own expertise against that of others, don't forget that to be dismissive and rude about others says more about us than it does of the other person.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Safe to say, my client now has the contact details of four designers I have recommended to her!</p>

<p>Increasingly a growing number of social-networking websites are being developed for people over the age of 50. The Internet monitoring company <a href="http://www.hitwise.co.uk/index.php">Hitwise</a> claims that 14 percent of adult Internet users are older than 55 and it predicts that seniors in Britain will overtake 35 to 44 year olds as the age group with the largest representation online. </p>

<p>Let's take a look at a few great examples of women well over fifty years of age who are building their personal brand online.</p>

<p>If you have not heard of <a href="http://www.grannymar.com/blog/">GrannyMar</a>, she's a podcaster in Ireland. In fact she is possibly the oldest female podcaster I know. I had the honour of meeting her at the recent <a href="http://www.podcampireland.com">PodCamp Ireland</a> - I managed to persuade her to talk about getting started podcasting which was of great interest to many at the conference. You can hear her reflections on the conference at her <a href="http://www.grannymar.com/blog/?p=291">most recent podcast</a>.</p>

<p>Then there is <a href="http://www.jacquelinewales.com/">Jacqueline Wales</a>, herself over 50 and a previous client of mine, who has now become an author, speaker and coach with her great programme <a href="http://www.fearlessfifties.com/">Fearless Fifties</a>. Her business is just over a year old and she has been building her personal brand online through her personal portal, her website and her blog.</p>

<p>And how can I forget the terrrifc <a href="http://www.caralumen.com">Cara Lumen</a> who I have had the honour to work with on a number of events over the last couple of years. She won't mind me telling youthat she is now in her middle seventies and in the last couple of years has built her business on the internet through her information products - of course she is a <a href="http://www.yoursecondwindblog.com/">blogger</a> too.</p>

<p>So if you think your are too old to start to build your personal brand online, think again and take inspiration from Cara, GrannyMar and Jacqueline. </p></div><div class="feedflare">

<p>Did you realise that more than half of the people in any organisation at any one time are either actively looking for another job or would seriously considering leaving if the right opportunity presented itself? </p>

<p>Perhaps you didn’t realise that your competition for finding that next great role would be so great? </p>

<p>If the time has come for you to explore new career opportunities, here are four actions you can take in the next thirty days to jump start your job search.</p>

<p><strong>1. Research the current job market</strong> – If it has been some time since you were looking for a role either inside your business or in the external job market, it is important to get re-acquainted with the market as it currently stands.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a move within your business, you can do this by talking to key people in the department or function you are interested in moving to or with your line manger or business mentor. This has the added benefit that they will also get to know you are interested in a career move so making a great impression with them as you undertake research about your future career is imperative.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a move outside your business, you can research the market through reading specific trade publications, through on-line research, talking to people in your chosen field or through discussions with recruiters.</p>

<p><strong>2. Create and implement your professional development plan</strong> – When was the last time that you invested in learning about your area of expertise that you want to build your career in other than through on-the-job learning? Do not get me wrong, learning skills in your current role and then applying them is not to be undervalued.</p>

<p>However if you really want to position yourself as an expert in your field, it is important to continuously build on your current knowledge and capabilities. This might be through reading current books, articles and attending seminars or conferences.</p>

<p>Capture your professional development plan onto a one page document where you can track the investment you make in your development and also how you put the new skills and knowledge into action.</p>

<p><strong>3. Update your resume or CV</strong> – If you have not looked at your CV or resume in the last six months, I can guarantee that it is out of date. Make sure that you take the time to review and update it. This is not a job to be rushed but is worth every minute that you spend on it. Consider it your personal marketing brochure.</p>

<p>Most times in a job search, your CV or resume will be the only thing that is evaluated or considered before a decision is made by a corporate recruiter to meet you or not. You need to ensure that it stands out from the crowd and your personal brand statement demonstrates your unique point of difference.</p>

<p>As a rough estimate, drafting, reviewing and finalising a professional CV or resume will take on average 8 hours of your time. You might consider this excessive, but isn’t it worth investing the equivalent of just one day to ensure that your years of experience and expertise are represented in the most effective way possible?<br>YOUR PERSONAL BRAND ACTION PLAN</p>

<p>If you are looking for your next career move make sure that you implement these three steps before you commence an active job search.</p>

<p>Before you explore the external market, don’t forget to share your career aspirations with your current line manager. Remember if you do not tell them what you want to achieve in your career and how you can at the same time help them grow the business you are working on now, the chances are that they will never get to learn this. The grass is not always greener in another business, and the opportunity to expand your career could be just a conversation away.</p>

<p>If you do decide that the time has come to move on to a new role outside of your current organisation, taking the time to undertake the three steps mentioned in this article will ensure that you are in a strong position to jump start your job search through on-line job boards, recruitment agencies and executive recruiters.</p>
