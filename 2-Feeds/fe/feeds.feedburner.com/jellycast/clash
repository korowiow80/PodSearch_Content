			<title>Clash Podcast Episode 9 - Beastie Boys</title>
			<itunes:author>ClashMusic.com</itunes:author>
			<description>Five minutes ago we were discussing ‘Hot Sauce Committee Pt. 1’, the Beastie Boys’ eighth studio album. Now, I’m lost in the playful banter of three men who’ve been tight with each other since I was three-years-old. How many ways can you write ‘out of my depth’?  

“It contains the maximum amount of caffeine, nicotine and sugar that you’re legally allowed to put into a drink,” says Adam Yauch, better known as MCA, with a wicked grin plastered across his face. “It’s also combined with snake’s blood and turtle semen, so it’s a really invigorating product. It has natural jojoba in it, but the thing that’s key is that it has analgesics, and it contains an expectorant.” 

He’s describing The Antidote, “a sports drink I’m doing to battle Steven Seagal’s drink, because he’s getting too much heat right now”. Adam Horowitz - Ad-Rock - is curious to learn more. Me? I’m wondering how I’m going to get this interview back on track. (If you are too, the answer is that I don’t.)

			<title>Clash Podcast Episode 8 - Coldplay</title>
			<itunes:author>ClashMusic.com</itunes:author>
			<description>The eyes of the world are watching. The airwaves are waiting. It’s been three years since the four mild-mannered stadium lords last came out survey their lot. But as the glorious summer dawns on 2008, their vast empire has begun to excitedly scurry in preparation of their emergence since the first assertive noises emanated from their self-enforced creative exile.

Finally stepping up once more to their rightful place at the top of rock’s round table, the monarchs of music are ready to reign –with a totally revised regime. All hail the new sound. All hail Coldplay.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/jellycast/clash/~4/onBWMpGZq5Y" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

			<title>Clash Podcast Episode 7 - Duffy/Jamie Lidell</title>
			<itunes:author>ClashMusic.com</itunes:author>
			<description>Riding high on the crest of a soul-wave that has witnessed Duffy race to Number One in the charts with the Lulu-stomping ‘Mercy’, the ash-blonde spark plug grabs a Fifties microphone for leverage and pipes up to her own reigning creation on the iPod stereo. Met with laughter, Duffy gives as good as she gets. “What?” she twinkles. “I don’t know the words to any other songs.” Shaking and shimmying on the spot to ‘Mercy’’s hand-clapping chorus and the verse takes care of itself. This 23-year-old from the small town of Nefyn, Wales, is up for a good time. And boy, is she getting it…

Meanwhile, life has definitely taken a strange turn for Jamie Lidell. He’s still signed to experimental label Warp but now makes music that sounds like the Greatest Hits record Sam Cooke might eventually have ended up with had he not been shot, crazy and naked, in 1964. Jamie’s new album, ‘Jim’, is a riotous journey from the heartfelt pop-soul of the Sixties through leftfield early-Seventies funk and onto the Parliament/Funkadelic era, with a snatch of rock guitar and cheesy Bacharach horn thrown in for good measure. The whole uplifting experience hinges on a voice that really has no business emerging from a bespectacled white boy from Cambridgeshire. It’s a freak of nature.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/jellycast/clash/~4/pkum4B_zZfM" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

Clash and The Kooks go way back, and there’s lots to catch up on, but something is drastically different. There is a dark cloud hovering, and soon the creased faces flip to concerned frowns. This morning we learnt of the irrevocable departure of original bassist Max Rafferty, and for a band as tight-knit as this, it has hit them hard.
