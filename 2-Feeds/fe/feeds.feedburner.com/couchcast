<p>Dr. Furse (PhD (94) is the Associate Vice President for Research at the University of Utah and Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. She received her BSEE in &#8217;85, MSEE in &#8217;88 and PhD EE in &#8217;94 from the University of Utah. Dr. Furse&#8217;s expertise in electromagnetics is applied to sensing and communication in complex lossy scattering media such as the human body, geophysical prospecting, ionospheric plasma, and aircraft wiring networks. She is recognized internationally for development of a system for on-board intermittent electrical fault location for aging aircraft wiring during flight to prevent in-flight fires and loss of signaL. This research is now being commercialized through LiveWire Test Labs, a spin off company from the University of Utah for which Dr. Furse is a founder and Chief Scientist.</p>
<p>Dr. Furse teaches electromagnetics, wireless communication, computational electromagnetics, microwave engineering, and antenna design. Dr. Furse works to interest young students, particularly women and minorities in engineering and routinely volunteers in Utah&#8217;s K-12 schools as an engineering mentor, science educator, and engineering career guidance counselor and is active with the Society of Women Engineers, Junior Engineering State, Expanding your Horizons, Schoolto-Careers, MESA, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. Dr. Furse was the Professor of the Year in the College of Engineering at Utah State University for the year 2000, and Faculty Employee of the year 2002. She also received the Distinguished Young Alumni Award from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Utah and the College of Engineering Distinguished Engineering Educator Award. She is a Fellow of the IEEE.</p>
