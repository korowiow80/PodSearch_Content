<h2>Speed Up Your WordPress Website</h2>
<p>Here are some quick tips to speed up your website:</p>
<p>Clean up your drafts</p>
<p>Delete spam and comments</p>
<p>Delete categories and tags that are not linked to anything.</p>
<p>Delete any leftovers from plugins that have been removed. To remove unwanted plugin and theme data from your database, browse it to find such entries and tables and delete them. Make sure you first deactivate and delete the plugins and themes you don’t need. Also I can not stress this enough,<a title="Backup Creator" href="http://weeklywebtools.com/backupcreator" target="_blank"> make a backup</a> of your database before doing anything. The first place you would want to look at is your <code>wp_options</code> table in your database. Browse the table carefully and see if you can find entries related to an inactive plugin.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Let me start by saying I own backupbuddy. I&#8217;m not super happy with it (basically I have to pay for it every year &#8211; although I can cancel my support). There are tons of plugins to let you backup your wordpress installation (and you should &#8211; I&#8217;ve been hacked a few times in the six years I&#8217;ve been using WordPress). When I found out about Backup Creator I am thinking of jumping ship from Backupbuddy. Here are some features that both share:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.weeklywebtools.com/backupcreator" target="_blank"><br />
<img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px;" title="Backup Creator - Protect Your WordPress" src="http://backupcreator.com/bc/images/bc1_250x250.gif" alt="Backup Creator - Automated WordPress Backup" width="125" height="125" border="0" /></a>1. Super easy to schedule backups</p>
<p>2. Send you back to your computer, send via email, store via FTP, store to Amazin S3.</p>
<p>3. Backup all files &#8211; not just the WordPress database.</p>
<p>4. Both plugins apparently have issues with super large backups (according to some websites I checked, and the fact that mine won&#8217;t backup).</p>
<p>5. Both have super simple restore steps and make cloaning a website super easy.</p>
<h3>Here is Backupbuddy and Backup Creator  differ:</h3>
<p>1. Backupbuddy will scan your files for malware<a href="http://ithemes.com/member/go.php?r=7364&amp;i=b15" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" style="border: 0pt none; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" src="http://ithemes.com/graphics/backupbuddy-125.gif" alt="Backup WordPress Easily" width="125" height="125" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>2. Backupcreator costs $47 for unlimted sites (that you own) while backupbuddy is $75 for two sites and has a once year support payment.</p>
<p>Check out the quick 4 minute video of Backupcreator at www.backupcreator.com</p>
<p>Check out backup a webinar about backupbuddy at <a title="Backupbuddy WordPress Backup" href="http://ithemes.com/member/go.php?r=7364&amp;i=l88" target="_blank">ithemes.com</a></p>
<h2>Thesis Awesome Takes The Thesis Theme to the Next Level</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked about tools to create landing pages before like Optimizepress, and <a title="Premise WordPress Plugin from Copyblogger" href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=337603&amp;u=74276&amp;m=31479&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=" target="_blank">Premise.</a>  We&#8217;ve talked about drag and drop Themes like Builder and Headway themes, and nowI found a tool that seems very powerful for those who are using the Thesis theme for WordPress. This uses the Thesis skins feature and by uploading a few files to your thesis and you can utilize drag and drop technology to create landing pages, coming soon pages, squeeze pages (intergated with Aweber and mailchimp), one time offer pages, launch pages and more. It adds 16 different color schemes, ipad compatability, slide show, with built in call to action buttons.</p>
<p>The documentation was somewhat thin, but then again adding a skin to your blog is pretty easy. You pretty much drag and drop your features into place, save yoru changes and preview your website. If you&#8217;re not happy, just repeat and add additional features. The best part is the &#8220;Product skin&#8221; is only $47 at <a title="Thesis Awesome Product Skin - Great Looking Websites" href="http://www.thesisawesome.com/member/go.php?r=1545&amp;i=b17" target="_blank">thesisawesome.com</a></p>

Thesis Awesome Takes The Thesis Theme to the Next Level
We've talked about tools to create landing pages before like Optimizepress, and Premise. (http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=337603&amp;u=74276&amp;m=31479&amp;urllink=&amp;afftrack=)  We've talked about drag and drop Themes like Builder and Headway themes, and nowI found a tool that seems very powerful for those who are using the Thesis theme for Wordpress. This uses the Thesis skins feature and by uploading a few files to your thesis and you can utilize drag and drop technology to create landing pages, coming soon pages, squeeze pages (intergated with Aweber and mailchimp), one time offer pages, launch pages and more. It adds 16 different color schemes, ipad compatability, slide show, with built in call to action buttons.

The documentation was somewhat thin, but then again adding a skin to your blog is pretty easy. You pretty much drag and drop your features into place, save yoru changes and preview your website. If you're not happy, just repeat and add additional features. The best part is the "Product skin" is only $47 at thesisawesome.com (http://www.thesisawesome.com/member/go.php?r=1545&amp;i=b17)</itunes:summary>

<h2>1Shopping Cart Alternative That Does it All</h2>
<p><!--Begin---> <a href="http://www.weeklywebtools.com/premiumwebcart" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="Premium Web Cart" src="https://www.secureinfossl.com/images/merchantSecuredImages/MER-01013/Large-Rectangle-(336-x-280)-LIGHT.gif" alt="Premium Web Cart" width="202" height="168" border="0" /></a><img src="9778d5d219c5080b9a6a17bef029331c" alt="" width="0" height="0" border="0" /><!--End--->I ran across this service that has all the tools a small business would want. It starts off with a great shopping cart that allows you to sell physical and digital goods, it has a CRM system, Affiliate system, Membership System (with drip feature I might add), Project Management, Live Help System, Ticketing System, Bug Report System, Surveys, and more. It&#8217;s amazing. 1shopping cart has the ability to integrate with other separate systems you purchase, with Premium Web Cart it&#8217;s all under one &#8220;umbrella&#8221; and the best part your support is included AND they have an e-business advisor. There are videos available that explain all the features available. Their support seems impressive (when I clicked on their live support there was actually someone on the other end).</p>
<p>Pricing ranges from 39 &#8211; 149 a month (based on what features you want) you can even save on those prices by purchasing a year in advance. Best of all you can sign up for a 30 day trial for free. If you want the &#8220;Super Jumbo Deluxe&#8221; version (that&#8217;s what I call it) the 30 day trial is $4.97. Check it out the videos at <a title="Premium Web Cart" href="http://www.weeklywebtools.com/premiumwebcart" target="_blank">premiumwebcart.com</a> some include some pretty bad cheesy music!</p>
<h2>WP AD Center Still Not Working</h2>
<p>I purchased WP Ad Center a month ago, and its still not working. I&#8217;m getting the old &#8220;We can reproduce the problem&#8221; so I gave them a login and password to www.feedingmyfaith.com and www.jillianmichalespodcast.com (where I&#8217;m testing the script, where its not working on either site). I switched to the default theme and it didn&#8217;t work (so it&#8217;s not a theme issue). I used it in the sidebar, I&#8217;ve used it in other areas. When people click on the banner, it doesn&#8217;t take them to the destination page. It instead returns them to their original page that they click on. I&#8217;ll keep you posted.</p>

<p>Today is a quick show, so I found a quick plugin for WordPress that puts your social media icons on your sidebar. They have all the tools you can imagine, and there are premade icons for each website. All you do is enter the url, and click save. To find this free plugin, just search for <strong>Social Media Widget</strong> in the WordPress Plugin directory.</p>
<h2>New Weekly Web Tools Facebook Page</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been afraid to start a weekly web tools facebook page as I don&#8217;t live on Facebook (I check it about once a week). However, if you and other supporters of the show would like to communicate on Facebook, I&#8217;ve now created a space. You can find it at www.weeklywebtools.com/facebook</p>
<h2>iTunes Comment Please</h2>
<p>Again, as I start to add these icons, I noticed that the listing for Weekly Web Tools in iTunes has only two reviews. Got a second? Coul you please go to <a title="Weekly Web Tools in iTunes" href="http://www.weeklywebtools.com/itunes" target="_blank">www.weeklywebtools.com/itunes</a> and add a positive review?</p>

To find this free plugin, just search for Social Media Widget in the Wordpress Plugin directory.
New Weekly Web Tools Facebook Page
I've always been afraid to start a weekly web tools facebook page as I don't live on Facebook (I check it about once a week). However, if you and other supporters of the show would like to communicate on Facebook, I've now created a space. You can find it at www.weeklywebtools.com/facebook
iTunes Comment Please
Again, as I start to add these icons, I noticed that the listing for Weekly Web Tools in iTunes has only two reviews. Got a second? Coul you please go to www.weeklywebtools.com/itunes (http://www.weeklywebtools.com/itunes) and add a positive review?</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Special thanks to listner Justin from <a title="Justin B Vocal Voice Over Specialist" href="http://www.justinbvocal.com" target="_blank">www.justinbvocal.com</a> for this one.</p>
<p>With UppSite you can create an application of your website for your smart phone. Best of all its free. This works if you are using a WordPress of <a title="Vbulletin Forum Software" href="http://weeklywebtools.com/v-bulletin" target="_blank">Vbulletin </a>website. This will include ads (of which you get no revenue). If you want to split the ad revenue, then you can purchase the plan that is $9.99 a month. You can also customize your design a bit more (although I was impressed with the free design features). For $9.99 a month, its worth looking into.</p>
<p>You can end up with an app in a store relatively quickly. According to their FAQ page:</p>
<p>After your app creation process is done, your app will be reviewed by our team to make sure it&#8217;s compatible with the different stores and that it works properly. This check usually occurs up to 24 hours from your app&#8217;s completion, but may take longer on weekends and holidays. Once an application is approved by UppSite, it gets sent to your chosen stores and is subjected to the store&#8217;s policy as follows:<br />
•    <strong>Android:</strong> Immediately.<br />
•    <strong>Apple Store:</strong> 2-14 Working days.</p>
<p>Your application will be available on all UppSite supported stores, Apple App Store, Android Market and UppSites Portal app. Check it out at <a title="Uppsite Custom iPhone Application Creation" href="http://www.uppsite.com/" target="_blank">www.weeklywebtools.com/uppsite</a></p>

<h2>Put a News Ticker On your Website</h2>
<p><a href="http://weeklywebtools.com/newsticker" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1017" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="Latest News Ticker Plugin" src="http://weeklywebtools.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/newstickerlogo-300x35.jpg" alt="LAtest News Ticker Plugin" width="300" height="35" /></a>It seems everyone has something grabbing their visitor&#8217;s attention be it Pop Up Domination, or WP Subscribers, etc. The problem is they are all starting to look the same and it&#8217;s (for me) losing its influence. That&#8217;s why I really liked the News Ticker Plugin as it caught my attention because it was different. There is a free version, but the premium is only $19.99 (as of now) and it has 10 different color schemes available plus the ability to put links in your ticker, pick categories and more. If you&#8217;re looking to not just grab the attention of your visitor, but politely smack them over the head, you might check out the Latest News Ticker plugin. For more info go to <a title="Latest News Ticker Plugin" href="www.weeklywebtools.com/newsticker" target="_blank">www.weeklywebtools.com/newsticker</a></p>

		<itunes:summary>We have spoken about Artisteer in the past on how cool Artisteer is, and how it creates custom themese for Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla and more. It's pretty cool and comes in version that are $49 and $129. Its really cool and Iv'e used it before. If you are looking to EASILY make your own Wordpress theme. If you can get a cool banner, your website will look awesome. They even have built in banners that look good.

As Artisteer  (http://weeklywebtools.com/artisteer)does themes for Drupal, Joomla, Wordpress, etc they can't add some customizations as they can't Wordpress stuff that doesn't apply to Joomla, etc.

Enter the templateer (http://weeklywebtools.com/templateer). This tool is for people who are using Artisteer and are creating Wordpress themes. It allows you to add functionality that is not available in Artisteeer, and some of this is actually added so you can adjust them on your website. Thats cool. The best part is it's only $29.00

At the end of 2011 a new player came into the WordPress Ad rotation plugin game. It&#8217;s called WP Ad Center. It is super flexible, super powerful, and super affordable. Here is a quick overview of the features.</p>
<p>unlimited Zones featuring standard ad sizes or create a custom size.</p>
<p>Create campaigns to track performance of each ad complete with easy to understand graphics.</p>

<h3>Cranky Ads</h3>
<p>This is a free plugin that allowsy ou to sell ads on your site. Its flexible and easy to use, and you&#8217;ll give 25% to them for using their service. The other thing I didn&#8217;t like here is your potential sponsor had to sign up with an account at crankyads.com If you are looking for them you have to have some pretty serious traffic coming to your site. I liked the ease of use of this plugin, and if you want to just use your own programs, it can be used for that. You won&#8217;t get any stats, but its hard to argue with free.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>I just found out a great WordPress plugin that records video of your visitors when they are on your site. Want to know why people aren&#8217;t signing up for that newsletter? Want to know why they are not subscribing to that podcast? Ordering that product? Say goodbye to analytics, and say hello to&#8230;..well,,, spying pretty much. This plugin records video of their visit and takes all the guesswork out. Then you can run reports on their activities. It also allows you to create campaigns to track converstions. It&#8217;s really impressive. When I went to their website, I was sure this was going to be a plugin that had a monthly fee, or <em>something</em> to handle to stress of all these video recordings.</p>
<p>What I found was amazing. The pricing for a single wesbite is $47. If you want it on three websites, it&#8217;s only $10 more. If you want it on unlmiited websites, it&#8217;s only $97 which is nothing compared to the insights you will get from this pulgin. This also includes lifetime upgrades. If you&#8217;re looking for a catch, let me know if you find one as I sure can&#8217;t find it.

<h3>Live Statistics Show Who is Slacking at Work</h3>
<p>If you want to track your own productivity, or see live stats of your employees desktime.com will help you. It&#8217;s a great tool that not only works on Mac, PC, but it also works with iPhones and Android devices. When users install DeskTime on their computers, it tracks what kind of applications the person is using and is analyzing it against a modifiable database of productive, distracting and neutral applications. For time tracking DeskTime detects mouse and other input devices. On DeskTime you can group employees into groups like &#8220;Marketing&#8221;, &#8220;Sales&#8221;, &#8220;Management&#8221; etc. Group allows you to define what applications are productive, unproductive or neutral for each group. For example, Facebook and Twitter is a productive application for social media managers while it is unproductive for others. You can set these values by hovering the necessary app in employee view. Additionaly, you can select what groups you want to see in the Dashboard view. It&#8217;s only $9 a month per employee and the boost in productivity could be well worth it.

		<itunes:summary>I just found out a great Wordpress plugin that records video of your visitors when they are on your site. Want to know why people aren't signing up for that newsletter? Want to know why they are not subscribing to that podcast? Ordering that product? Say goodbye to analytics, and say hello to.....well,,, spying pretty much. This plugin records video of their visit and takes all the guesswork out. Then you can run reports on their activities. It also allows you to create campaigns to track converstions. It's really impressive. When I went to their website, I was sure this was going to be a plugin that had a monthly fee, or something to handle to stress of all these video recordings.

What I found was amazing. The pricing for a single wesbite is $47. If you want it on three websites, it's only $10 more. If you want it on unlmiited websites, it's only $97 which is nothing compared to the insights you will get from this pulgin. This also includes lifetime upgrades. If you're looking for a catch, let me know if you find one as I sure can't find it. For more information go to www.firsttimevisitor.com (http://www.firsttimevisitor.com)

Live Statistics Show Who is Slacking at Work
If you want to track your own productivity, or see live stats of your employees desktime.com will help you. It's a great tool that not only works on Mac, PC, but it also works with iPhones and Android devices. When users install DeskTime on their computers, it tracks what kind of applications the person is using and is analyzing it against a modifiable database of productive, distracting and neutral applications. For time tracking DeskTime detects mouse and other input devices. On DeskTime you can group employees into groups like "Marketing", "Sales", "Management" etc. Group allows you to define what applications are productive, unproductive or neutral for each group. For example, Facebook and Twitter is a productive application for social media managers while it is unproductive for others. You can set these values by hovering the necessary app in employee view. Additionaly, you can select what groups you want to see in the Dashboard view. It's only $9 a month per employee and the boost in productivity could be well worth it.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>One of the things I love about helping people with their WordPress sites is I get to see what plugins they are using. Today I came across a new premium wordpress plugin that automatically rates your &#8220;on page&#8221; seo. Great for anyone who does seo and especially for local consultants to use for local businesses. It&#8217;s call Measure My SEO.  It&#8217;s from Jason Fladlien and Wison Mattos (don&#8217;t worry I had never heard of them before either).</p>
<p>What this plugin does is it scores you on things that boost SEO. Such as:</p>
<p><a href="http://weeklywebtools.com/measuremyseo" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-958" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="Measure My Seo Plugin" src="http://weeklywebtools.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/measuremyseochecklist.jpg" alt="Measure My SEO" width="285" height="566" /></a></p>
<p>Is your keyword in your Meta Tag?</p>
<p>Is your keyword in your Meta Description tag?</p>
<p>Is your keyword phrase in your meta keyword tag?</p>
<p>Is your keyword density matching a level that you get to set.</p>
<p>Is your keyword in an H1 tag along with H2 and H3?</p>
<p>Is your keyword phrase in Strong, bold, italic, or em tags?</p>
<p>Is your keyword image in the alt text of an image?</p>
<p>This tools automatically checks your post as you type it (at an interval you set) and then scores your post. You can also have it checked any time you want by clicking on the SEO check button. There is a  video that shows everything and it&#8217;s only a few minutes long. You can check it out at <a title="Measure My SEO Worpress Plugin" href="http://www.weeklywebtools.com/meauremyseo" target="_blank">measuremyseo.com</a> and the plugin is $49.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s SEOPressor but Less Expensive</h2>
<p>I talked about SEOPressor in the past. It&#8217;s a <em>very cool SEO Plugin</em> that does many of the same things that Measure My SEO does automatically. However, <a title="SEOPressor" href="http://weeklywebtools.schoolofpodcasting.com/seopressor" target="_blank">SEOPressor </a>costs $47 for a single license and $97 for an unlimited version. Measure My SEO is $49 and you can use it on any domain that you personally own. Sure it won&#8217;t bold my keywords for me, or mark them with italics, but I can do that for myself to <a title="Measure My SEO" href="http://www.weeklywebtools.com/meauremyseo" target="_blank">save 50 bucks</a>.</p>
<h3>Another Premium WordPress SEO Plugin is Inbound Writer</h3>
<p>There is a free version of Inbound writer that you can use, but it will tag your article with a link to their website at the end. This is if you use their plugin. If you don&#8217;t want that you can create a free account on their website and have their system optimize eight documents per month. If you want unlimted critiques, it&#8217;s 19.95 and I assume that takes the tag off your article. This does provide more posts that Scribe (which only gives 15 for $18, but has keyword tools as well). If you want check out the free version they are at<a title="Inbound Writer SEO Plugin" href="http://weeklywebtools.com/inboundwriter" target="_blank"> inboundwriter.com</a></p>
<h3>Combined with Keyword Winner for a One TWO SEO Knock Out</h3>
<p>I previously reported on Keyword winner premium plugin that analyzes Keywords for traffic and competition in minutes. You could use this tool to find good keywords, and then use measure my SEO to make sure you are getting the most out of these keywords. I see where Keyword Winner is $47, but here is a spoiler alert. If you go to leave the page they knock the price down by 10 bucks and throw in a free ebook on Keywords. Check it out at <a title="Keyword Winner Premium SEO Plugin" href="http://weeklywebtools.com/keywordwinner" target="_blank">keywordwinner.com</a></p>

<h3>From The Audience: Scott eisenhuth sent in these two:</h3>
<p>Ooma- It&#8217;s a VOIP phone service.  Basically the deal is you buy their box hook it to your internet and start making calls. The good part is the price. You pay for the box when you buy and that&#8217;s it, no monthly charge expect for local taxes. Yes, you heard me correct a one-time payment! I took my phone costs down from around $50 a month to about $4 a month now. You can buy the box directly from them or from <a title="Amazon" href="http://weeklywebtools.com/amazon" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, Best Buy or even COSTCO. I&#8217;ve seen the box cost vary anywhere from $150 to $200. They charge $39 to handle the work of getting your current phone number switched over to their system. They do offer $10 a month service with more bells and whistles but I&#8217;ll good with the free service. And yes the free service does have voice mail.</p>

<p>Another thing I like and use is a thing called Splash ID Key Safe. URL:<a title="Splash Data secure USB" href="http://weeklywebtools.com/splashdata" target="_blank">http://www.splashdata.com</a> It&#8217;s a 4 gig USB stick with a program for MACs and PCs on it to store and manage all your passwords. I&#8217;m sure you are like me and have tons of password required logins- this tool is the thing to keep all those passwords handy and yet protected. The program on the USB also has forms to save all kinds of other personal info that needs to be kept secure- like credit card numbers, account numbers, etc. The cost is $30.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Recently Market Samurai had an issue with pulling their queries from Google. I purchased Market Samurai, and to honest, either I have really crappy ideas or I can&#8217;t find a good keyword to save my life. With all the complaining about Market Samurai being out of service for a small period, everyone was looking for an alternative. The common answer seemed ot be Long Tail Pro. This is the software from Spencer from <a title="niche pursuits" href="http://www.nichepursuits.com/" target="_blank">NichePursuits.com</a>. He has been involved in Internet Marketing for about 5 years and has developed hundreds of long tail websites.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.weeklywebtools.com/longtailpro" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-930" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="Long Tail Pro" src="http://weeklywebtools.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ltpstatic-300x250.png" alt="" width="300" height="250" /></a>He has tried dozens of keyword tools and finally got frustrated enough with all of them to just create his own. Because he is so passionate about creating niche websites and because he actually understands why these keywords are so vitally important, he will continuously strive to make Long Tail Pro the most effective software on the market.</p>
<p>Here is what it does:</p>
<p>3 Primary Functions of Long Tail Pro</p>
<p>Keyword Research</p>
<p>Input multiple root keywords at once! (This will save you hours of time over other software – GUARANTEED!)<br />
Generate up to 800 keywords per Seed keyword (must be logged into Google account).<br />
Automatically input your filter settings for all keywords generated (another HUGE timesaver)<br />
Automatically search for exact match domains.<br />
Automatically search for Title Competition (AllinTitle on Google).<br />
Filter keywords based on search volume, CPC, or other criteria.<br />
Export to CSV so you can use the data as you want.</p>
<p>Competitor Analysis</p>
<p>Quickly check all the critical data that you need to see for the top 10 competitors in Google.<br />
Input the keyword and see information on the ranking: URL, Title, meta keywords/description, PageRank, Site Age, SEOmoz Page Links, .edu Links, .Gov Links, Yahoo Directory, and DMOZ directory</p>
<p>Rank Checker</p>
<p>Quickly check the rankings of your websites for your chosen keywords in Google, Yahoo, and Bing<br />
Your websites and keywords are saved so you don’t have to re-enter the information. But you can always change as needed.<br />

<h3>Free PDF to Word Converter</h3>
<p>I found a cool tool for converting a PDF document to word format. You simply go to www.pdftoword.com and upload the PDF and enter your email. They send you the word doc. This is from the people who make Nitro Pro a PDf editing tool thats much cheaper than Adobe acrobat.

I had never heard of it, but he brought up some pretty impressive reports that show exactly where people were looking when they visited your site, and then later where they clicked. It took all the guesswork out of website optimization. You instantly knew what pages needed the most work (which is where Google Optimizer comes into play).</p>

<p>views. While that&#8217;s not cheap, the increase in conversions could easily have the fee paid for in a matter of days. There are form analytics that show you which fields in your forms are being skipped, and how long it is taking to fill out the form (which may lead to you removing those fields that aren&#8217;t 100% needed &#8211; think of this if its an order form).</p>
<p>You can watch your visitors mouse moves as they discover your site. This information is also organized into heat maps so you see where your audience is focusing. You can also do campaign tracking and discover which marketing efforts resulted in the best leads or sales. There are also scroll heat maps so if your information is &#8220;under the fold&#8221; you can see how far people are willing to scroll.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what your visitors are doing when they visit your site, this tool will answer it quickly and let you make adjustments that result in more conversions.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>When I was in college I worked at a Drive in restauarant. I was a car hop. We were all teenagers and college students. Every day someone called easking if they worked, or they drove in on their day off to write down their schedule. We weren&#8217;t the brightest bulb in the bunch. I wish we had When I Work back then. This web based application makes setting up a schedule a breeze. Then your employees can get notified via text, email, or they can check their schedule on the web, or on their Android or iPhone via free apps.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.weeklywebtools.com/wiw" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-914" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="When I work" src="http://weeklywebtools.schoolofpodcasting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wiw.png" alt="" width="204" height="50" /></a>I set up a mock schedule. I set myself up as an employee, and easily put in my availability. I then dragged and dropped me on to a shift and that was it. You can easily control shift swaps, and enjoy a productive work enviornment where you focus on your customers and not your schedule. The best thing is prices start at $9.95 a month up to 10 emplyees. I see this as a now brainer as you waste so much time dealing with the schedule and When I work takes care of it. Check it out at <a title="When I Work" href="http://www.weeklywebtools.com/wiw" target="_blank">wheniwork.com</a></p>
<h3>Stat My Web</h3>

Stat My Web provides detailed stats like &#8211; when it was created, where is it hosted, how much is it worth and where does it rank on the web.</p>
<p>In additional we show estimated visits, alexa traffic rankings, geo tracking, domain name analysis, keywords ranking, indexed pages and links analysis. The list does not end here.

		<itunes:summary>When I was in college I worked at a Drive in restauarant. I was a car hop. We were all teenagers and college students. Every day someone called easking if they worked, or they drove in on their day off to write down their schedule. We weren't the brightest bulb in the bunch. I wish we had When I Work back then. This web based application makes setting up a schedule a breeze. Then your employees can get notified via text, email, or they can check their schedule on the web, or on their Android or iPhone via free apps.

(http://weeklywebtools.schoolofpodcasting.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/wiw.png)I set up a mock schedule. I set myself up as an employee, and easily put in my availability. I then dragged and dropped me on to a shift and that was it. You can easily control shift swaps, and enjoy a productive work enviornment where you focus on your customers and not your schedule. The best thing is prices start at $9.95 a month up to 10 emplyees. I see this as a now brainer as you waste so much time dealing with the schedule and When I work takes care of it. Check it out at wheniwork.com (http://www.weeklywebtools.com/wiw)

If you&#8217;re thinking that you will lose your front page, a way around losing the look of your site is to install WordPress into a subdomain. This makes for great tracking to see how many people are visiting your store.  You can sell physical or digital products, and it works with a large amount of ecommerce sites (paypal etc). It&#8217;s only $55 and you can check out the demo at <a title="Wordpress Shopping Cart Theme" href="http://weeklywebtools.com/markettheme" target="_blank">weeklywebtools.com/markettheme</a></p>

(http://www.markettheme.com/banners/160x160-grn.jpg)Market theme is a flexible (over 20 different color schemes) powerful, and easy to use Wordpress theme that turns your Wordpress installation into a store. If you're thinking that you will lose your front page, a way around losing the look of your site is to install Wordpress into a subdomain. This makes for great tracking to see how many people are visiting your store.  You can sell physical or digital products, and it works with a large amount of ecommerce sites (paypal etc). It's only $55 and you can check out the demo at weeklywebtools.com/markettheme (http://weeklywebtools.com/markettheme)
