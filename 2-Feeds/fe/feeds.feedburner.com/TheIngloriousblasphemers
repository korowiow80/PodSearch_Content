Not at all. &#xD;

It's not for them; it's for other secular minded people, those who come out as atheists and are ostracized from their family and friends, threatened with eternal pain and suffering, and have disrespect flung in their general direction. It's for us. It's a way to spread awareness on what atheism actually is, to show that we are not evil people who want to do away with religious rights. It's a way to get our viewpoints out and encourage others to do the same. &#xD;
&#xD;
We will use this format to show the importance of arguing with evidence, logic, and reason, in order to promote critical thinking. We will show why secularism is a good thing, and why faith is not a virtue. Any de-conversions that may occur are just a happy coincidence. ;) </itunes:summary><itunes:category text="Religion &amp; Spirituality"><itunes:category text="Other" /></itunes:category><item><title>#2 God in Sports</title><link>http://www.spreaker.com/user/blasphemypodcast/2_god_in_sports</link><description>This week, Alex and Josh take a look at religion in sports due to Manny Pacquiao's recent comments about homosexuality. They give a mention to the personality, the character that people like to display using religion in sports (including MMA fighters and Tim Tebow). Representative Lankford of Oklahoma earns douchebag of the week for saying that it is okay to fire anyone who is homosexual due to his belief that it is a preference. As such, it is the preference of this podcast to call you a douchebag.&#xD;theblasphemypodcast.blogspot.com</description><guid isPermalink="false">1032983</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 May 2012 21:54:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="http://api.spreaker.com/download/episode/1032983.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" /><itunes:author>The Blasphemy Podcast</itunes:author><itunes:summary>This week, Alex and Josh take a look at religion in sports due to Manny Pacquiao's recent comments about homosexuality.
