	One of the most sought after technology that is making a storm is Cloud computing. Cloud computing is the ability of users to access server or file remotely and work on that particular server whenever they are located. Many companies use cloud computing to decrease the cost of their IT services. Instead of purchasing a server and managing it in house, they are now able to hire the cloud computing company’s servers and maintenance technicians and relieve themselves on the cost and hassle of maintaining their very on servers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<br />
	This latest breakthrough on computing technology helps a lot in implementing remote access and creates mobility for the companies employee so that they can do their job anywhere they are located. This translate on higher productivity rate and more savings for the employees because they don’t need to travel to the office to finish a job and work more diligently because they have more time to spend with their loves one because they don’t need to waste their time traveling to and from their work place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<br />
	The idea of cloud computing first materialize when ISP provided Virtual Private Network (VPN) access to their users and they allow secured remote connectivity of employees to the servers of their company at the leisure of their own home. Many large IT companies don’t use their IT capacity to the full strength. The full usage of their network and server capacity only spike occasionally thus leaves more room for computing task. To increase efficiency they started leasing their servers to other businesses to create profit coming from their IT infrastructure. Businesses that use these services see the potential of bringing down the cost of their IT infrastructure and avoid the overarching pitfalls of IT server maintenance and purchases.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
	<br />
	Because of the many benefits of cloud computing, we are now efficiently using our time and effort to accommodate more socially active lifestyle yet still pursue our jobs and earn a living. Instead of a gruesome job stuck in an office for half your wake up time, you are now able to actively create more time for yourself and your love one.</p>
