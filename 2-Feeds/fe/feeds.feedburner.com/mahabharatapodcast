&lt;br /&gt;
I talk about the three layers of religious philosophy in the epic-- Vedic Sacrifice, Karma Yoga, and Bhakti. &amp;nbsp;I propose that Karma Yoga was an innovation introduced by the Mahabharata, and I believe Bhakti was inspired by the epic, and subsequently the epic was modified to include that religion. &amp;nbsp;That would explain Krishna's promotion from country cousin to Top God...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next, I discussed some of the characters in the story-- reviewing their actions and whether they were fairly rated "good guys" or "bad guys" by the epic, and by modern listeners in general.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, I compare the epic with other literature, and compare the religious philosophy of the epic with other works and other religions. &amp;nbsp;I hope no one gets overly offended! &amp;nbsp;Please write in my blog and let me have it if I did. &amp;nbsp;I apologize in advance!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-6986045231351667206?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Please be sure to visit my blog and let me know you made it! &amp;nbsp;And then treat yourself to something nice, because you have really accomplished something.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We've reached the end of the story, but this isn't quite the end of the podcast. &amp;nbsp;You can expect a few more episodes-- an epilogue where the story is carried forward up to the time of the Snake Sacrifice. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Following that, if you have any questions or points of discussion, I'd like to make the 100th episode a summing up of the entire podcast. &amp;nbsp;If there's anything you'd like me to address, let me know soon!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Krishna goes home, while the Pandavas go prospecting for gold in the hills. &amp;nbsp;While they are away, Parkshit is born, or rather still-born. &amp;nbsp;Krishna arrives in time to make good his promise and revives the kid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This took some serious reading, since the Anusasana Parva is almost exactly as long as the Book of the Forest, which I covered in 22 episodes!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For better or worse, Bhisma's teachings are not nearly as engaging as the Book of the Forest, so it won't take anything like that many episodes to cover. &amp;nbsp;There are a handful of interesting parables, plus some additional information about a couple of our characters-- Krishna and Vyasa.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mostly, the book is full of wordy dialogues-- it is like a heavily watered-down version of the Bhagavad Gita. &amp;nbsp;At the end, we are treated to all 1,000 of Vishnu's names (and a discussion of each), a list of holidays for worshipping Krishna, and some prayers and songs to Krishna.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So now I'm back to work on producing episodes. &amp;nbsp;Hopefully I'll have one available for you next week!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-4214501278849517554?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
These teachings are exceptionally difficult to convey in the form of a podcast, mostly because they are so boring. &amp;nbsp;There are very few stories, and most of the stories revolve around conversations in which one character instructs the other on good behavior. &amp;nbsp;I have tried to extract the more interesting details from the book, and I included the most interesting of the stories. &amp;nbsp;Hopefully this is enough to convey the nature of this part of the epic, which makes up nearly a third of the entire text!&lt;br /&gt;

These teachings are exceptionally difficult to convey in the form of a podcast, mostly because they are so boring. &amp;nbsp;There are very few stories, and most of the stories revolve around conversations in which one character instructs the other on good behavior. &amp;nbsp;I have tried to extract the more interesting details from the book, and I included the most interesting of the stories. &amp;nbsp;Hopefully this is enough to convey the nature of this part of the epic, which makes up nearly a third of the entire text! </itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2012/01/episode-88-book-of-peace.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/ME-PLIxxpV8/MBp88.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp88.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Episode 87 - Rama's Famous Genocide</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/5aGpzT__bzA/episode-87-ramas-famous-genocide.html</link><category>Rama Jamadagnya</category><category>Charvaka</category><category>Bhisma</category><category>Krishna</category><category>Parashurama</category><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2011 21:27:59 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-8575944184962418108</guid><description>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp87.mp3"&gt;Episode 87&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Yuddistira is finally convinced that he should remain king, and he gets down to business. &amp;nbsp;He marches straight to the palace and has himself anointed and consecrated. &amp;nbsp;He appoints his council and gets his kingdom in order. &amp;nbsp;As soon as he has a chance to catch his breath, Krishna suggests that they hurry over to uncle Bhisma, who isn't long for this world.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I recall that it was Kubera who donated wealth for the construction of the palace at Indraprastha.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is it possible that the legend of Kubera made it all the way to Northern Europe and survived the arrival of Christianity? &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-1846732820627111135?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Ashwatthaman heads of to Vyasa's ashram, Krpa goes home to Hastinapur, and Krtavarman also heads for home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The Rishis step in and order Arjun to put his guns away, but Ashwatthaman cannot retract this weapon once it is unleashed, so instead, he turns it loose on the wombs of the Pandava women, making them sterile and killing their one remaining heir-- Uttara's unborn son Parikshit.&lt;br /&gt;

Fortunately, Krishna revives the kid, but there shall be no more Pandava offspring after this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To help explain how Ashwatthaman was able to pull off this massacre single-handedly, Krishna tells a few stories about Shiva, and just how temperamental and dangerous he can be. &amp;nbsp;In fact, Shiva really comes off as more of a force of nature than a Saddhu living in the hills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My guess is, that if we understood the physics of Time, we might realize that Shiva stands in for one of the main functions of time, which is change. &amp;nbsp;The other aspects of time are novelty (Brahma), and the moment of Now, which I believe is represented by Vishnu.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-3873542692887234097?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
By this point, the only survivors are Krpa, Aswatthaman, Kritavarman, Sanjay, &amp;amp; Duryodhana. &amp;nbsp;Everyone else is dead. &amp;nbsp;The Pandavas still have their tight group of heroes and Draupadi's sons, but most of their troops are dead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Duryodhana finds himself standing alone, abandoned &amp;amp; on foot in the midst of the battlefield. &amp;nbsp;Everyone is dead or has fled the scene. &amp;nbsp;Stunned, he wanders off the field and makes his way aimlessly towards Hastinapur. &amp;nbsp;Sanjay finds his prince, filthy in blood &amp;amp; gore, in a state of shock, standing by a lake shore. &amp;nbsp;When the Kaurava finally comes to his senses, he submerges himself into the lake, where he intends to rest, indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aside from Duryodhana, blind king Dhrtarastra still has one son yet living. &amp;nbsp;It is his illegitimate son Yuyutsu, who had joined with the Pandavas at the beginning of the war. &amp;nbsp;He is given leave to comfort his brothers' retainers &amp;amp; womenfolk and returns with them to Hastinapur. &amp;nbsp;There are no recriminations for his having gone over to the enemy. &amp;nbsp;Now they are just glad that some one son of Dhrtarastra has survived to carry on the line.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-1141507827745460981?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Aside from Duryodhana, blind king Dhrtarastra still has one son yet living. &amp;nbsp;It is his illegitimate son Yuyutsu, who had joined with the Pandavas at the beginning of the war. &amp;nbsp;He is given leave to comfort his brothers' retainers &amp;amp; womenfolk and returns with them to Hastinapur. &amp;nbsp;There are no recriminations for his having gone over to the enemy. &amp;nbsp;Now they are just glad that some one son of Dhrtarastra has survived to carry on the line.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2011/11/episode-80-shalya-dissolution-of.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/x5ZkTI1T9EI/MBp80.mp3" length="15787275" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp80.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Episode 79 - Kurukshetra, Day 17: Down with Dushasan/Killing Karna</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/WN2GfqhcCEI/episode-79-kurukshetra-day-17-down-with.html</link><category>Karna</category><category>Dushasan</category><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2011 20:29:15 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-4658142608617473057</guid><description>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp79.mp3"&gt;Episode 79&lt;/a&gt; - This is a big day in the war. &amp;nbsp;Bhisma fulfills one of his oaths by killing Dushasan and drinking his blood. &amp;nbsp;Now he will be gunning for Duryodhana.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Arjun &amp;amp; Karna finally get busy with their final showdown. &amp;nbsp;The whole universe apparently took sides in this conflict, with everyone choosing a champion to cheer for. &amp;nbsp;The pair begin fighting with conventional weapons, but soon escalate to magical weapons. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At one point, Arjun gets the upper hand, and strikes Karna until he's lost his wits and drops his weapons. Arjun then allows his opponent to recover somewhat before they resume fighting. &amp;nbsp;Krishna scolds Arjun (not for the first time!), for failing to strike the enemy when he's down. &amp;nbsp;Arjun has quit arguing with Krishna over these things, so he resolves to kill Karna at the next possible opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At this point, Fate and Mother Earth have had enough and they intervene directly. &amp;nbsp;Mother Earth seizes Karna's chariot wheel, bringing her enemy to a halt. &amp;nbsp;Karna jumps down to pull free the wheel, but it won't budge. &amp;nbsp;He asks Arjun to think of the Warrior Code, or his Dharma, and not to fire until he could fix his chariot and get moving again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This annoys Krishna, who scolds Karna for even bringing up the subject of Dharma. &amp;nbsp;Where was his Dharma when Draupadi was molested? &amp;nbsp;This speech both shames Karna and enrages Arjun, who finally obeys Krishna's orders and kills his enemy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There's that wheel again! &amp;nbsp;What does it mean that in the course of this war, we've had a Wheel Formation (that killed Abhimanyu), and Arjun's son dies using a Chariot wheel as his only weapon, and then Karna dies, clinging to a wheel which was stuck in the earth. &amp;nbsp;Is there some deeper meaning to the image of a wheel in this war?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-4658142608617473057?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Karna defeats Yuddistira and nearly captures him, but he reconsiders and lets the Pandava go. &amp;nbsp;Yuddistira then flees to his camp to have his wounds tended to, and there he slips into a strange funk. &amp;nbsp;What follows seems completely bogus&amp;nbsp;to me. &amp;nbsp;Arjun retreats to the camp to check on his brother's health, and Yuddistira perversely assumes that he must have already killed Karna.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yuddistira admits that he's been terrified of Karna and hasn't slept for 13 years out of fear for him. When he finds out that Karna isn't killed, he gets really mad at Arjun and suggests that Arjun hand his bow to Krishna and that they change places. &amp;nbsp;Arjun takes great exception to this, and pulls an oath out of his ass that he says he swore when he was younger. &amp;nbsp;This oath was to kill anyone who suggested that he give up his Gandiva bow. &amp;nbsp;So now he must kill Yuddistira.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pretty lame, eh? &amp;nbsp;Krishna is there, and he does his usual thing, by coming up with a "workaround", in which Arjun need only insult his brother, then brag about himself. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Drona's son then pulls the army together and rushes to battle waving his WMD. &amp;nbsp;First he tries to use the Narayana weapon, but Krishna is too tricky for that-- he knows its weakness, which is that it is ineffective against unarmed men. &amp;nbsp;The Pandavas all drop their weapons and the bomb is a dud. &amp;nbsp;One other problem with the Narayana weapon: it's only good for one shot. &amp;nbsp;So much for that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next, he pulls out his Agneya weapon, which is pretty much like a thermonuclear device. &amp;nbsp;Without a second thought, he gets into range with Arjun and sets the thing off. &amp;nbsp;It wipes out perhaps half of the Pandavas' remaining army, but Arjun &amp;amp; Krishna simply brush off the ashes and resume fighting. &amp;nbsp;Not even nukes can take out the incarnated Rishis Nar &amp;amp; Narayan!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Ashwatthaman asks heaven why his nuke failed to have the desired effect, and Vyasa shows up to explain that while his power derives from Shiva, Krishna's power derives from Narayana, so there's no comparison.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, we find a funny reference to Sanjay rushing back to Hastinapur to report on the war. &amp;nbsp;What happened to his divine vision? &amp;nbsp;My guess is that originally the author had him running back &amp;amp; forth from the battle to the palace to report to the king what had happened. &amp;nbsp;This proved to be too limiting for the author's desires, so he switched the premise to include divine sight. &amp;nbsp;But then he forgot to expunge the earlier device from the books he'd already written!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The second big shot to go down is their old guru Drona. &amp;nbsp;I must confess that I never really took a shine to this fighting brahmin. &amp;nbsp;He always seemed over-proud and a bit prickly. &amp;nbsp;Also, I never liked the way he manipulated the Pandava kids into fighting his own grudge match with King Drupad. &amp;nbsp;After he took half of Drupad's kingdom, he said that they could be friends again. &amp;nbsp;Some friend-- he then kills Drupad earlier in the day without a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And what the hell is a brahmin doing fighting anyway? &amp;nbsp;They are supposed to merit their honor of being the priestly caste by dedicating their lives to ritual and spirituality. &amp;nbsp; But here's this guy who demands the highest honor for being from the priestly caste, and yet he fights dirty-- in ways that a kshatriya would be ashamed to fight, such as using magic weapons against footsoldiers. &amp;nbsp;His ounce of loyalty goes to the guys who feed him &amp;amp; pay him, and all the rest of his love is for his own skin, and that of his dear son, Ashvatthaman. &amp;nbsp;More on that punk later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Man, I really don't like Drona!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
By mid-day, with no news from the two Krishnas, Yuddistira begins to worry about them. &amp;nbsp;He hears their conches and interprets the sound to have some urgency. &amp;nbsp;Eventually, his concerns are too much, and he sends Satyaki, his very best&amp;nbsp;bodyguard, off on a solo mission to find and rescue their kinsmen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then Satyaki also crashes through the enemy lines and disappears. &amp;nbsp;Not long after, the lack of news from either Satyaki or the Krishnas again proves too much for Yuddistira's nerves. &amp;nbsp;This time, he sends Bhima away to find the others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now Yuddistira has only Dhrstadyumna to protect him, and the rest of his very best fighters are lost and alone, deep in the hordes of the Kaurava army.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was all too much to fit into a single episode, so we need to wait until next time to find out how the 14th day comes to a close. &amp;nbsp;Will Satyaki and Bhima make it through? &amp;nbsp;Will Arjun complete his vow to kill Jayadratha before sunset? &amp;nbsp;Find out next time!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-9067528360771836176?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

This was all too much to fit into a single episode, so we need to wait until next time to find out how the 14th day comes to a close. &amp;nbsp;Will Satyaki and Bhima make it through? &amp;nbsp;Will Arjun complete his vow to kill Jayadratha before sunset? &amp;nbsp;Find out next time!</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2011/09/episode-72-kurukshetra-day-14-killing.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/2sN91cykjOQ/MBp72.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp72.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Book Review: The Yugas by Joseph Selbie &amp; David Steinmetz</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/mofx1y2qfrk/book-review-yugas-by-joseph-selbie.html</link><category>The Yugas</category><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2011 20:19:39 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-7940821929154806610</guid><description>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;Although I spend a good deal of my free time working through the original text of the Mahabharata and producing the podcast, I also read quite a lot. &amp;nbsp;Not long ago, I was lent a copy of The Holy Science by Swami Sri Yuktesvar. &amp;nbsp;Mostly, it was in line with a lot of spiritual literature from early 20th century India: the author demonstrates the ultimate unity in the world's religious teachings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While I agree with the sentiment, it is also quite commonplace in our day and age for any spiritual seeker. &amp;nbsp;It comes as little surprise to us that the deepest messages of Islam, Christianity, Buddhism &amp;amp; Hinduism are all pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But this little book also contains a chapter on revising the traditional interpretation of the Yugas. &amp;nbsp;Sri Yuktesvar brought the Yuga system in line with the 25,000-year &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession"&gt;Precession of the Equinoxes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have long been fascinated by this astronomical phenomenon, because there are so many hints at this secret knowledge hidden in our most ancient legends and structures. &amp;nbsp;For instance, the beautiful Hindu &lt;a href="http://www.rajuindia.com/indian-luxury-medium-budget-cheap-unique-adventure-desert-wild-tours-travel-packages-plans-safaris-itinerary/fairs-and-festivals-india-deepawali-diwali-festival-of-lights.shtml"&gt;legend &lt;/a&gt;of the Gods &amp;amp; Asuras churning the cosmic ocean to produce the Amrit, or Elixir of Immortality. &amp;nbsp;The way the Amrit was produced was by looping the Cosmic Snake around the base of Mount Meru, and using the mountain as a vast churning stick, the cosmit ocean of milk was churned like butter to produce the Amrit. &amp;nbsp;The Gods were unable to accomplish this alone, so they requested the aid of the demonic Asuras, promising to share in the Amrit for their assistance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Asuras joined in, and together they churned the ocean of milk and produced the Elixir, but then the Gods reneged on their promise, and kept the Amrit to themselves. &amp;nbsp;What followed were many exciting battles over possession of this most sacred substance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This mythology underlies the entire epic of the Mahabharata, in that, once the Asuras were finally defeated, they flocked to be born on the earth, and it was these evil incarnations that lead Mother Earth to request the help of Vishnu and the Devas to come to earth and eradicate them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This myth has long been important to me because the imagery of the northern-most peak revolving like a butter churn matches precisely what one's observations of the Precession of the Equinoxes would look like. &amp;nbsp;If viewed over the course of 25,000 years, we would see the earth's axis of rotation wobbling from one pole star to the next.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is no question in my mind that the legend of the Amrit is referring to the reality of the precessional cycle, so then why was&amp;nbsp;this&amp;nbsp;subtle phenomenon so important to our ancient storytellers? &amp;nbsp;Furthermore, this is just one legend among many. &amp;nbsp;The book &lt;a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Hamlet_s_mill.html?id=ql7ATHGee50C"&gt;Hamlet's Mill&lt;/a&gt; includes numerous references to this phenomenon from all over the ancient world. &amp;nbsp;It is abundantly clear that the slow wobble in the earth's polar axis was something extremely important to our ancient forbears. &amp;nbsp;I have long suspected that we might better understand our ancient stories if we could just crack the code.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The recent interest in the Mayan calendar has also sparked interest in the nature and secret of the Precessional Cycle. &amp;nbsp;For one, there is no question that the Mayan calendar is based on the precession of the equinoxes, and that according to it, we are currently crossing an important landmark in our journey through the cycle. &amp;nbsp;Western Astrology has always been aware of Precession as well, and that is where we get the notion of leaving the Age of Pisces and entering the &lt;a href="http://www.accessnewage.com/articles/astro/ageaq1.htm"&gt;Age of Aquarius&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have had an interest in the precession ever since I read Hamlet's Mill in college. &amp;nbsp;Thus, the traditional Yuga system always seemed a bit odd to me, in that it was the only ancient system that seemed to ignore the precessionary calender and instead talked of period of time in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuga"&gt;millions of years&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, when I read Sri Yukteshvar's Holy Science, I was impressed that he was able to reconcile the two systems. &amp;nbsp; This was not the first time that I came across this timing however. &amp;nbsp;Back in &lt;a href="http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2010/12/episode-38-markandeya-sessions-pt-2.html"&gt;Episode 30&lt;/a&gt;, Markandeya also described the four Yugas as taking 12,000 years to complete. &amp;nbsp;I even commented at the time that it meant that we are no longer living in the Kali Yuga, which is comforting to know!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thus, it was serendipitous that I came across a new work, based on Sri Yukteshvar's analysis, that tries to explain our history in terms of the precessionary cycle, the four Yugas, and the mechanism behind each of these ages. &amp;nbsp;The authors of &lt;a href="http://theyugas.com/"&gt;The Yugas&lt;/a&gt;, starting from this thin chapter out of a thin book by Sri Yukteshvar, provide the framework for a new theory of history which explains many of the conundrums of ancient history and may even be able to predict our future!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I find that is important for our subject here, the Mahabharata, is the way the Yuga cycles run forward and then in reverse. &amp;nbsp;This is the revolutionary part of Sri Yukteshvar's work. &amp;nbsp;The traditional, descending four Yugas from Satya to Kali, is only half the story. &amp;nbsp;The trip from Kali Yuga back to Satya Yuga is not immediate. &amp;nbsp;Nothing in life works that way. &amp;nbsp;Instead, we creep our way slowly back up the Yugas&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_0Wr0UXG14ok/SnHQFM-WI0I/AAAAAAAAAiE/qqtGCE1ZfI0/s1600-h/dwaparayuga.jpg"&gt;in reverse&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Accepting Sri Yuktesvar's calculation of AD 500 as the beginning of the present ascending Kali Yuga, time has an unusual way of running in circles. &amp;nbsp;Thus, the descending era's ancient awakening of Confucius, Buddha, and Socrates coincides with the same time as the ascending era's Renaissance. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Amazingly, it looks like the senseless violence of the Mahabharata War coincides with World War II! &amp;nbsp;Both wars involved senseless slaughter of vast numbers of fighters. &amp;nbsp;As the authors in The Yugas argue, the descending era is about the decline in the power of magic, while the ascending era is about the increase in the power of technology. &amp;nbsp;Thus, just as modern man found himself in the 20th century AD with more technology to kill than they had sense not to fight, in the 10th century BC, an insanely violent war broke out among people with more magic than then had sense not to kill each other with it. &amp;nbsp;The connection is my own, but the coincidence is uncanny.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
It turns out that Abhimanyu is one of those who know its secrets. &amp;nbsp;But with Arjun busy, he is the only one. &amp;nbsp;Helpless to protect himself and his followers any other way, Yuddistira sends the boy wonder into the jaws of death. &amp;nbsp;Even then, they could have protected the boy, except they were stopped by old Jayadratha of Sindh. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember this guy? &amp;nbsp;He's actually related in marriage to Duryodhana-- he married Duryodhana's sister. &amp;nbsp;But one wife wasn't good enough for him, and he stupidly tried to run off with Draupadi, without first defeating the Pandavas. &amp;nbsp;He paid the price of humiliation for his impudence: he was beaten severely and had his head shaved by an arrow head by Bhimasena. &amp;nbsp;Too humiliated to return home, Jayadratha remained in the woods, praying to Shiva. &amp;nbsp;When he finally coaxed Shiva to grant him a wish, he asked for the ability to kill all five Pandavas!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was a bit too much even for Shiva. The best he could do was grant him the ability to stop the Pandavas briefly, but not Arjun. &amp;nbsp;Obviously, now was a perfect moment to use this boon, so Jayadratha rode out to forstall the Pandavas, while Drona, Krpa, Karna &amp;amp; Ashvatthaman ganged up on young Abhimanyu and killed him in an ambush. &amp;nbsp;It was Dushasan's son, Daushasani, who dealt the death blow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Bhisma begs Karna to forget his grievances and to join with his brothers and end the war this moment. &amp;nbsp;But Karna is too far gone. &amp;nbsp;He owes Duryodhana too much, and he has nursed his grievances for far too long to ever reconcile with the Pandavas. &amp;nbsp;It is better that he exit this world in the most honorable manner possible-- on the field of battle, at the loving hands of his famous brother, Arjuna.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This scene ends the Bhisma Parva, and we pick up the story the next morning, in the Drona Parva. &amp;nbsp;Drona is made commander of the Kaurava army, and their strategy is to kidnap Yuddistira. &amp;nbsp;If they get him, then they could force him to gamble and send the Pandavas back to the forest. &amp;nbsp;But Arjun presents a major problem with this plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After one fruitless day of battle, the Kauravas decide to distract Arjun with a suicide squad. &amp;nbsp;The entire army of the Trigartas volunteer to go to their deaths in order to keep Arjun away from protecting his brother. &amp;nbsp;On day 12, they almost pull it off, sacrificing the lives of one half their numbers, but Arjuna is too much for them, and he breaks away just when it seemed Yuddistira would be taken.&lt;br /&gt;

Bhisma begs Karna to forget his grievances and to join with his brothers and end the war this moment. &amp;nbsp;But Karna is too far gone. &amp;nbsp;He owes Duryodhana too much, and he has nursed his grievances for far too long to ever reconcile with the Pandavas. &amp;nbsp;It is better that he exit this world in the most honorable manner possible-- on the field of battle, at the loving hands of his famous brother, Arjuna. This scene ends the Bhisma Parva, and we pick up the story the next morning, in the Drona Parva. &amp;nbsp;Drona is made commander of the Kaurava army, and their strategy is to kidnap Yuddistira. &amp;nbsp;If they get him, then they could force him to gamble and send the Pandavas back to the forest. &amp;nbsp;But Arjun presents a major problem with this plan. After one fruitless day of battle, the Kauravas decide to distract Arjun with a suicide squad. &amp;nbsp;The entire army of the Trigartas volunteer to go to their deaths in order to keep Arjun away from protecting his brother. &amp;nbsp;On day 12, they almost pull it off, sacrificing the lives of one half their numbers, but Arjuna is too much for them, and he breaks away just when it seemed Yuddistira would be taken. Now, at the end of day 12, there is still another half of the suicidal Trigartas, so a final attempt will be made on grabbing Yuddistira on day 13. &amp;nbsp;13 is an unlucky number, and someone will have to pay for Yuddistira's freedom!</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2011/08/episode-69-kurukshetra-days-11-12-drona.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/v3yFnWRmQA4/MBp69.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp69.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Episode 68 - Kurukshetra, Day 10: The Bed of Arrows</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/Yndmqsx6yTU/episode-68-kurukshetra-day-10-bed-of.html</link><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2011 10:30:06 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-1745564382510158278</guid><description>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp68.mp3"&gt;Episode 68&lt;/a&gt; - I know it feels like this war is really dragging on; but I think that is precisely how Vyasa wanted us to feel by this point in the battle. &amp;nbsp;We are all getting tired of the unending violence. &amp;nbsp;Even the main cause of all the violence, Bhisma, is getting tired of this, and he has begun looking for a way out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On day 9, the old Kuru apparently relieved himself of the last of his commitments, which was to wipe out the army of the Saumakas. &amp;nbsp;Now the only thing left for him to do was to find the most noble way to meet his death. &amp;nbsp;On the evening of the ninth day, the Pandavas visit their grand-uncle in his tent and walk away with the old man's permission and even blessing to kill him on the tenth day.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Arjun kindly provides a pillow of arrows and a nice little drinking fountain, so Bhisma may wait until the seasons change and the sun finally resumes its northward course in the heavens. &amp;nbsp;Until then, he's content to hang out on his prickly bed and watch the action from the sidelines.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-1745564382510158278?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I recently listened to those old episodes and sort of cringed at the production quality and the pace of my speaking. &amp;nbsp;I like to think that my production skills have improved somewhat since those early days-- my equipment is certainly much better now-- and I wondered if I might have scared off some proportion of my listeners with those first few episodes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore, I decided to re-record them to bring them up to the quality of our later episodes. &amp;nbsp;I also took the opportunity to edit and include more information than was in the original recordings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Episode 5 could also use some improvement, so in the coming weeks I will also release a new recording of that episode. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I simply replaced the old .mp3 files with a new one of the same name. &amp;nbsp;If you decide you'd like to hear the new version, but it still sounds like the old one, it may be the cache on your computer is holding onto the old file. &amp;nbsp;You may need to clear your browser cache files to get past that problem.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-4916887398052648444?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Arjun and Bhisma seem ready to get down and fight, but it never seems to happen. &amp;nbsp;Maybe on day 9? &amp;nbsp;Duryodhana is quickly losing faith in his general, and Karna is making trouble on the sidelines, so he'd better do something big on day 9...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-4540002478434370119?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Arjun and Bhisma seem ready to get down and fight, but it never seems to happen. &amp;nbsp;Maybe on day 9? &amp;nbsp;Duryodhana is quickly losing faith in his general, and Karna is making trouble on the sidelines, so he'd better do something big on day 9...</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2011/08/episode-66-kurukshetra-days-7-8.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/V2eorQkGWU4/MBp66.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp66.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Episode 65 - Kurukshetra, Days 5 &amp; 6</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/a0EUacVthKk/episode-62-kurukshetra-days-5-6.html</link><category>Bhima</category><category>Bhurishravas</category><category>Abhimanyu</category><category>Satyaki</category><category>Dhrstadyumna</category><category>Arjun</category><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2011 22:53:47 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-914584232856342117</guid><description>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp65.mp3"&gt;Episode 65&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- The fifth and sixth days of the great war. &amp;nbsp;Arjun wipes out an army of 25,000, and we find out Satyaki has 10 fully grown sons. &amp;nbsp;Soon after we learn about these sons, they get decapitated by King Bhurishravas. &amp;nbsp;In return, Satyaki kills off the king's entire army, but the pair are too well-matched and both must be dragged off of the battlefield after sunset.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, just as Yuddistira returns to his lines, he invites anyone who'd like to change sides. &amp;nbsp;Yuyutsu, Dhrtarastra's 101st son, the illegitimate son of a serving girl, volunteers to change sides. &amp;nbsp;Now at least the old king can reasonably hope to have a son who survives this war and can make offerings to his ghost.&lt;br /&gt;

Finally, just as Yuddistira returns to his lines, he invites anyone who'd like to change sides. &amp;nbsp;Yuyutsu, Dhrtarastra's 101st son, the illegitimate son of a serving girl, volunteers to change sides. &amp;nbsp;Now at least the old king can reasonably hope to have a son who survives this war and can make offerings to his ghost. With this betrayal, Duryodhana starts the fight with a raid directly on his cousins. &amp;nbsp;What follows is a litany of the numerous duels, none of which ended in a fatality, and the violent slaughter of the un-named masses. &amp;nbsp;There is a bloody stalemate until the sun reached mid-day, and Bhisma launched a frontal attack on his enemies. &amp;nbsp;More on that next time!</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2011/06/episode-61-kurukshetra-day-1-war-is.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/kpxZgwaERLQ/MBp61.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp61.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Episode 60 - The Gita, part 2: The Godhead</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/oMKoFrA6q9A/episode-60-gita-part-2-godhead.html</link><category>Gunas</category><category>Bhagavad Gita</category><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2011 13:45:49 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-1187378472217500893</guid><description>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;Episode 60 - This concludes Krishna's dialog with Arjun about Dharma, Bhakti, Yoga, and the Gunas. &amp;nbsp;During the course of this, Arjun is granted divine sight, and is able to catch a glimpse of Krishna's true appearance; it nearly blows his mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Getting back to Arjun's original question-- Does Arjun's Dharma really require him to kill his relatives and gurus? and how can this can be a good thing? &amp;nbsp;It seems like a lot of Krishna's teaching is addressed to posterity, because advice to meditate more often isn't exactly going to propel Arjun into the battlefield. &amp;nbsp;I think the convincing part of it for Arjun was the divine vision in which he saw his enemies rushing inexorably to their deaths. Whether he followed his Dharma, or ran away, these guys were dead men walking. &amp;nbsp;So the decision to fight was a personal one. &amp;nbsp;Whether he fired the arrow that killed his grandfather or not, the sin of murder would not be on his conscience.&lt;br /&gt;

It is also worth repeating the observation J.A.B. van Buitenen made about the composition of the two armies facing off at Kurukshetra. &amp;nbsp;It turns out that the armies that allied with the Pandavas all came from kingdoms to the south and east of Hastinapur, while the Kauravas' allies were all from the north and west.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
We begin the story with Amba's abduction, along with her sisters Ambika and Ambalika, by Bhisma to provide wives for his brother. &amp;nbsp;When she announces her pre-arranged betrothal with Shalva, she is freed to go to him. &amp;nbsp;A comedy of errors ensues when he questions her virtue, and then she breaks from her escort, ruining her reputation. &amp;nbsp;But this is a deadly serious matter. &amp;nbsp;The girl is now unmarriageable, and her father would be unlikely to take her back. &amp;nbsp;She has died to her caste and is possibly the most vulnerable person in all of India.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Amba seeks shelter with the Brahmins &amp;amp; ascetics, and finally enlists Rama Jamadagni as her champion. &amp;nbsp;Bhisma is too stubborn to even allow his own guru to make him take a woman of questionable virtue into his house, so Rama kills him. &amp;nbsp;Bhisma has a near-death experience and is reminded of his past existence as one of the divine Vasus, and discovers that his holy brothers are still looking out for him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bhisma cannot die now, because his appointment with Destiny has already been set with the incarnation of the Primeval God, Nara Prajapati-- Arjuna Kaunteya.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
So both sides round up their armies and march on Kurukshetra. &amp;nbsp;When they arrive, each side appoints a Commander in Chief. &amp;nbsp;It is Bhisma on the Kaurava side, and King Drupad on the Pandavas' side.&lt;br /&gt;

From this point until the end of the war, the main narrative frame of the story will be told in terms of a conversation between Sanjay and Dhrtarastra. &amp;nbsp;The Epic has so far not explained how it is that Sanjay knows what is going on at the far-off battlefield, but somehow he knows everything, and is able to relate it all to his king. &amp;nbsp;Occasionally, Dhrtarastra will interrupt with questions or react to the events, so it will be through his blind eyes that we shall perceive the coming war.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But don't be deceived that just because we are on the eve of war, that we will be soon getting to it. &amp;nbsp;The Epic always takes its time, and there will still be quite a few more episodes before the action really starts. &amp;nbsp;After al, we still need to get through the Bhagavad Gita!!!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Poor Karna, always the victim of bad timing. &amp;nbsp;It was way too late for such an offer. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps if Kunti had stood up and claimed him as her son during the Pandavas' first military exhibition, he might have come around then, but now there was too much water under the bridge. &amp;nbsp;Karna had been tossed out as a baby like the day's garbage, and had been scorned as a Suta when he tried to display his Kshatriya nature. &amp;nbsp;His modest Suta parents and the evil Kauravas had been the only ones to come to his aid, and he would never give them up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Krishna failed in turning Karna, but somehow he allowed Sanjay to know of the entire conversation, so the story of Karna's descent and temptation was made known to all the Kauravas. &amp;nbsp;Kunti caught wind of the encounter, and she made a go at turning him. &amp;nbsp;She also failed, but she at least got the promise that he would spare her other sons, and should Arjun die, Karna would take his place as her fifth son.&lt;br /&gt;

Poor Karna, always the victim of bad timing. &amp;nbsp;It was way too late for such an offer. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps if Kunti had stood up and claimed him as her son during the Pandavas' first military exhibition, he might have come around then, but now there was too much water under the bridge. &amp;nbsp;Karna had been tossed out as a baby like the day's garbage, and had been scorned as a Suta when he tried to display his Kshatriya nature. &amp;nbsp;His modest Suta parents and the evil Kauravas had been the only ones to come to his aid, and he would never give them up. Krishna failed in turning Karna, but somehow he allowed Sanjay to know of the entire conversation, so the story of Karna's descent and temptation was made known to all the Kauravas. &amp;nbsp;Kunti caught wind of the encounter, and she made a go at turning him. &amp;nbsp;She also failed, but she at least got the promise that he would spare her other sons, and should Arjun die, Karna would take his place as her fifth son. </itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2011/04/episode-53-temptation-of-karna.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/b8nLR2rTO7E/MBp53.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp53.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Episode 52 - Krishna reveals Himself</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/eWMl52Gp0_Y/episode-52-krishna-reveals-himself.html</link><category>Narada</category><category>Kanva</category><category>Matali</category><category>Nar-Narayan</category><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2011 10:01:02 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-7128520191105069149</guid><description>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp52.mp3"&gt;Episode 52&lt;/a&gt; - The peace talks break down completely. &amp;nbsp;It starts well, when no one can come up with a rebuttal to Krishna's speech. &amp;nbsp;Narada and Kanva tell a couple of parables to help with the decision making, but Duryodhana was not interested. &amp;nbsp;It seems he believed that the terms of the Dice Game were that the Pandavas were to go to the forest forever, not just 13 years. &amp;nbsp;Maybe it's true? &amp;nbsp;What if the Pandavas had indeed been banished for life, but they decided to change the rules when Krishna &amp;amp; Drupad offered to help them overthrow their cousins? &amp;nbsp;How would we know, since we only get the version of the story as told by the survivors of this war!?!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Krishna senses all the bad vibes and decides to only stay &amp;amp; eat with Vidur. &amp;nbsp;He also visits with the Pandavas' poor widowed mother Kunti, whom he tries to console. &amp;nbsp;Surprisingly, Kunti blames her &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;father&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for all her suffering. &amp;nbsp;Kunti's father, Sura, was also Krishna's grandfather, and for some reason he gave her up for adoption to the chieftain Kuntibhoja. &amp;nbsp;It was there, while living under Kuntibhoja's roof, that she was assigned to serve the creepy saddhu Durvasas. &amp;nbsp;The result was that poor Kunti was saddled with an illegitimate baby-- young Karna.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Krishna assures his aunt that the Pandavas will soon make their comeback and all will be well. &amp;nbsp;Then he pays a visit to Duryodhana. &amp;nbsp;Duryodhana attempts to bribe him, but Krishna refuses to even eat with them. &amp;nbsp;The following day, Krishna is summoned before the court of Hastinapur, where he makes his case for a settlement with the Pandavas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The king and his councilors really don't have much to say by way of a rebuttal, so Parashurama breaks the silence by offering to tell a couple of parables. &amp;nbsp;Next time, we'll hear these parables and then see how the negotiations turn out.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Having gone a good long while since Karna last washed his feet, the mess must have started getting to him, because he finally blows his top at Bhisma and swears he will not fight until Bhisma is dead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the course of this debate, we get hints at some other tales that we are yet to hear about. &amp;nbsp;One of these involves Bhisma and Sikhandin. &amp;nbsp;We only get a few tantalizing hints at their back story, but we are told that this warrior is destined to kill Bhisma. &amp;nbsp;Rest assured that Bhisma will tell the full story a little later in the current book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The other unfinished tale involves Karna's enrollment as Parashurama's student. &amp;nbsp;Again, we only get a brief summary, but we hear that Karna had lied to the old Brahmin about his birth, saying he was a fellow Brahmin in order to learn the secrets of the Brahma-head missile. &amp;nbsp;When Parashurama discovered Karna's deception, he cursed him, saying that the weapon would fail him when he needed it the most. &amp;nbsp;I'm not sure when we will get the full version of this tale, because it does not show up in the Book of the Effort, and I do not have an index for the books to follow. &amp;nbsp;It's a good story, so I hope we get to it soon!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Karna is kind of a pitiable figure. &amp;nbsp;While Arjun is getting magical weapons by the cartload heaped on him lovingly by the best of the Gods, poor Karna is forced to sacrifice his natural-born armor for a single measly arrow from Indra, and must compromise his reputation and sacrifice his spiritual tapas in order to get the Brahma-head missile. &amp;nbsp;Despite the sacrifices, both weapons are fatally flawed, since Indra's weapon cannot be used against the Pandavas, and the Brahma-head has been cursed to fail in its objective. &amp;nbsp;Poor Karna-- he never seems to be able to catch a break!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, in a more private setting, Sanjay reveals that he has converted to a new religion! &amp;nbsp;Krishna and Arjun are beginning shed their human aspects and increasingly appear as divine beings. &amp;nbsp;The charioteer was quick to notice the transformation, and he appears to be an early adopter of the new cult of Krishna-worship. &amp;nbsp;With Vyasa present to endorse his newfound religious zeal, Sanjay presents the king with the first tenet of Bhakti worship. &amp;nbsp;Duryodhana remains obstinate, but the king &amp;amp; queen both become converts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-7448914281526925780?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I've mentioned before that the translation of the Critical Edition into English was begun, but not completed, by J.A.B van Buitenen.&amp;nbsp; I've been relying on the print edition of his translation for the bulk of this podcast.&amp;nbsp; The only complete translation is by Ganguli, and I only have that version in my iPhone!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I can't really write my episodes while referring to a 3" iphone screen, so as we get near the end of Book 5, I was getting desperate for a solution.&amp;nbsp; Amazon carries the full Ganguli&amp;nbsp;translation-- all 18 books-- for the low low price of&amp;nbsp;$350 US!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I sort of threw this conundrum out there to my audience to see if anyone had any suggestions on how I might find a cheaper copy.&amp;nbsp; I guess you all&amp;nbsp;are too used to "free" stuff on the internet, because I got a rather tepid response.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One listener kindly offerred to look into buying a copy in India, where it should be cheaper, but it was all rather hypothetical and time is running out.&amp;nbsp; I guess I would have drawn more attention if I'd waited until the end of Book 5, and the podcast came to a stop...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But all that is water under the bridge now.&amp;nbsp; It turns out that Amazon is selling the Kindle edition of Ganguli for $6!&amp;nbsp; All 18 books!&amp;nbsp; Kindles are running for about $189, so for the price of a Kindle, I get Ganguli nearly for free.&amp;nbsp; As long as I use the kindle for something other than Ganguli, I can at least say that I didn't blow another $200 on a podcast that nets me $0 in return.&amp;nbsp; So that's good news...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now the Kindle is in the mail, so as long as the mail gods keep the deliveries on schedule, our podcast should continue to run on its normal schedule!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-6166787259401208059?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Yuddistira sends Sanjay back with his counter-arguments and counter-proposal. &amp;nbsp;When the charioteer returns home, it is late, so he drops in on Dhrtarastra just to let him know he's back and will be delivering the Pandavas' rejoinders in the morning. &amp;nbsp;Now the old blind king is left to stew all night. &lt;br /&gt;

Dhrtarastra cannot sleep, so he summons his younger brother Vidur to entertain him. &amp;nbsp;Vidur treats us to some lengthy speeches on virtue and Dharma, and by the end of the night, he is apparently channeling spirits! &amp;nbsp;We hear from the immortal sage Sanatsujata, but this guy is apparently senile, because none of his teachings make any sense!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Duryodhana wins the first couple of rounds at this game. &amp;nbsp;He rushes to Dwaraka, and gets Krishna to commit his armies to the Kaurava side. &amp;nbsp;The Pandavas get Krishna; as an unarmed advisor. &amp;nbsp;Duryodhana also plays on the generosity of the Pandavas' ally King Shalya, by providing hospitality to Shalya's army while it was on the march. &amp;nbsp;When Shalya offers a boon to his host, Duryodhana presents himself, and asks for Shalya's support in the war. &amp;nbsp;The king has no choice but to grant the request.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The king journeys on to meet with the Pandavas and tells them what had happened. &amp;nbsp;Since Duryodhana fooled them fair &amp;amp; square, Yuddistira accepts the fait accompli. &amp;nbsp;He only asks that Shalya do whatever he can to throw Karna off his game when the big chariot duel between Arjun &amp;amp; Karna takes place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shalya also takes the sting off a bit by telling the story of Indra's Victory. &amp;nbsp;This is a strange story in which the brahmins completely dominate the course of events. &amp;nbsp;A brahmin picks a fight with Indra, and although Indra acts in self-defense, he is nevertheless guilty of brahmin-murder, and he suffers accordingly. &amp;nbsp;The force of the punishment makes Indra sort of resign his post and go into hiding.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Man-God Nahusha is then nominated king of heaven (by brahmins &amp;amp; gods), and the brahmins give him his very own superpower. &amp;nbsp;When Nahusha turns out to be a power-hungry lecher, the brahmin priest Brhaspati advises the gods on how to get their old Indra back. &amp;nbsp;Indra is powerless at this point, so he suggests to his wife that the best way to take down Nahusha would be to get him into a fight with the brahmins. &amp;nbsp;Nahusha walks right into the trap, makes himself a brahmin-drawn chariot, and ends up offending the entire race of priests. &amp;nbsp;It's all over when he specifically annoys Agastya, and gets cursed to life as a snake for 10,000 years. &amp;nbsp;It seems that in this story the "kshatriya" gods are just pawns in a brahmin game!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, the Pandavas and Kauravas have gathered their allies-- 7 grand armies for the good guys, and 11 armies for the bad guys. &amp;nbsp;Now the negotiations can commence!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-298713166725916593?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Kanka, Balava and the twins are all recuited into the army, but Brhannala is left at home. &amp;nbsp;Thus, it is up to the young crown prince and the eunuch to rescue the kingdom from invasion. &amp;nbsp;As they are riding out to meet the Kurus, the 13th year of exile comes to an end. &amp;nbsp;Arjun is free to reveal himself, so he retrieves his magic weapons and takes charge of the defenses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Arjun and Karna finally get their chance to fight, but Karna's boasts don't amount to much, after all. &amp;nbsp;Arjun literally blows him off the battlefield one time, and then later, when Karna gives it another go, he shots an arrow right into Karna's chest, knocking him unconscious and off the battlefield once again.&lt;br /&gt;

Kanka, Balava and the twins are all recuited into the army, but Brhannala is left at home. &amp;nbsp;Thus, it is up to the young crown prince and the eunuch to rescue the kingdom from invasion. &amp;nbsp;As they are riding out to meet the Kurus, the 13th year of exile comes to an end. &amp;nbsp;Arjun is free to reveal himself, so he retrieves his magic weapons and takes charge of the defenses. Arjun and Karna finally get their chance to fight, but Karna's boasts don't amount to much, after all. &amp;nbsp;Arjun literally blows him off the battlefield one time, and then later, when Karna gives it another go, he shots an arrow right into Karna's chest, knocking him unconscious and off the battlefield once again.

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I've spared you the re-telling of that epic, since it would have us out on a sidetrack for possibly months, and, really, the Ramayana deserves a podcast of its own, right?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, jumping over that chapter, we find ourselves back where we were; Yuddistira moping around feeling sorry for himself and for Draupadi. &amp;nbsp;Again, he goes to Markandeya for consolation. &amp;nbsp;This time Markandeya replies with the story of Savitri.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This time, the story apparently works, because at the end of the chapter Vaisampayana tells us that the Pandavas &amp;nbsp;spent the rest of their exile in Kanyaka "without sorrow or fear". &amp;nbsp;That's a pretty effective story!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As it turns out, this is the last of the Markandeya stories. &amp;nbsp;We are nearly at the end of the Book of the Forest, and next episode we'll get back to the main plot with one of Karna's adventures.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-1945773055978248137?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Jayadratha is not nearly so forgiving as the Pandavas, and he seeks revenge for the humiliation he suffered during his captivity at the hands of Bhimasena. &amp;nbsp;He lives in the wilderness, worshipping Shiva until the god offers him a boon. &amp;nbsp;After some negotiation, they settle on granting him the ability to stay the brothers during a cavalry attack, except for Arjun, whom even gods have a hard time stopping!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-5236571148576816817?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Jayadratha is not nearly so forgiving as the Pandavas, and he seeks revenge for the humiliation he suffered during his captivity at the hands of Bhimasena. &amp;nbsp;He lives in the wilderness, worshipping Shiva until the god offers him a boon. &amp;nbsp;After some negotiation, they settle on granting him the ability to stay the brothers during a cavalry attack, except for Arjun, whom even gods have a hard time stopping!</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2011/01/episode-42-kidnapped.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/WZpccSgn4Zg/MBp42.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp42.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Episode 41 - The Golden Plough</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/oyGYaDbogD8/episode-41-golden-plough.html</link><category>Daityas</category><category>Karna</category><category>Vaishnava</category><category>Duryodhana</category><category>Danavas</category><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2011 21:07:44 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-6024605918295232134</guid><description>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp41.mp3"&gt;Episode 41&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- This one covers Duryodhana reaction to the humiliation of being captured by the Gandharvas and then released by the valor of his hated cousins the Pandavas. &amp;nbsp;Unable to face his clan after the ignominious defeat, the prince resolves to sit down and starve himself to death.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I also present my theory that the five Pandavas are somehow correllated with the five extremities of the human body. &amp;nbsp;Yuddistira is clearly the head, while Bhima is associated with the right arm. &amp;nbsp;Arjuna, the "Left-Handed Archer", seems pretty clearly to be linked with the left arm, and the twins make up the pair of legs. &amp;nbsp;Since they are all incarnations of a single being-- Indra-- perhaps Indra had himself dismembered and each limb became a different Pandava. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There is also something sexual about Arjun that is different from the others. &amp;nbsp;We haven't gotten to that part of the story yet, but during the year in hiding, Arjun is disguised as an hermaphrodite, Brihanala, which literally means "Woman with large penis". &amp;nbsp;Much later in the story, we'll discover that of the five sons of Draupadi, it is Arjun's son and grandson who carry on the line of kings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

I also present my theory that the five Pandavas are somehow correllated with the five extremities of the human body. &amp;nbsp;Yuddistira is clearly the head, while Bhima is associated with the right arm. &amp;nbsp;Arjuna, the "Left-Handed Archer", seems pretty clearly to be linked with the left arm, and the twins make up the pair of legs. &amp;nbsp;Since they are all incarnations of a single being-- Indra-- perhaps Indra had himself dismembered and each limb became a different Pandava. There is also something sexual about Arjun that is different from the others. &amp;nbsp;We haven't gotten to that part of the story yet, but during the year in hiding, Arjun is disguised as an hermaphrodite, Brihanala, which literally means "Woman with large penis". &amp;nbsp;Much later in the story, we'll discover that of the five sons of Draupadi, it is Arjun's son and grandson who carry on the line of kings. Markandeya is still telling stories, so we'll have more from him next time.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2010/12/episode-37-markandeya-sessions-pt-1.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/LySEBmL8TEU/MBp37.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp37.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Episode 36 - Bhima and the Snake</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/47fQj7h0E_4/episode-36-bhima-and-snake.html</link><category>Satyabhama</category><category>Kanyaka forest</category><category>Pradyumna</category><category>Markandeya</category><category>Narada</category><category>Krishna</category><category>Nahusha</category><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2010 23:00:44 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-8405532067493495350</guid><description>&lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp36.mp3"&gt;Episode 36&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- The Pandavas journey south, out of the Himalayas and back to the plains. &amp;nbsp;Along the way, Bhima goes hunting and finds himself captured by a giant magical snake. &amp;nbsp;The Snake takes his time and tells Bhima his life story before proceeding to eat the hero. &amp;nbsp;Meanwhile, Yuddistira sees dark omens and heads off to look for his brother on his own. &amp;nbsp;For the purposes of the later story, Arjun stays at home and Yuddistira does the rescuing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Yuddistira gets to the scene, Bhima tells him what is going on, and that the snake is under a curse. &amp;nbsp;If Yuddistira can answer the snake's question, then all would be well. &amp;nbsp;Yuddistira is good at quiz games; the question is basically whether one is a Brahmin by birth or by behavior.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Snake and Yuddistira hit it off really well, and the two discuss questions of the Soul and Karma for a while. &amp;nbsp;Finally, the snake releases Bhima and then dies, his soul returning to heaven. &amp;nbsp;The brothers return to the camp, where the Brahmins scold Bhima-- "He shouldn't have been out hunting anyway! &amp;nbsp;Hunting is bad!"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Pandavas then journey onward to the Kanyaka forest-- the place where they began their exile 10 years earlier. &amp;nbsp;At the Kanyaka forest they meet up once again with Krishna. &amp;nbsp;This time he brings his first wife Satyabhama, and they intend to stay a while.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Krishna brings news of the Pandavas' five sons. &amp;nbsp;They are teenagers now, and are all being raised at Dwarka, learning the arts of war with Krishna's eldest son Pradyumna.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
These are the last three stories of the long series of tales in the Book of the Forest. &amp;nbsp;The Pandavas are finishing up their pilgrimage across India and are moving northward for their rendezvous with Arjun. &amp;nbsp;The first story, &lt;i&gt;Yavakrita&lt;/i&gt;, is particularly interesting in that the protagonist is not a Twice-born. &amp;nbsp;In this case, he's a rude and uppity Vaishya, but he's the main character nonetheless. &amp;nbsp;I find the little detail about the Shudra gaurd particularly interesting. &amp;nbsp;He works for Yavakri's father, and he inexplicably blocks the boy from getting to safety, which results in Yavakri's death. &amp;nbsp;I can only guess that it was thought fitting that a Vaishya rapist be killed at the hands of an even lower-caste menial.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Jantu &lt;/i&gt;seems to fit in among these stories in that it is another case of a Brahmin helping a king with his fertility problems. &amp;nbsp;In contrast to many of the other stories, the king's wives are distinctly un-heroic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The last story, the &lt;i&gt;Hawk &amp;amp; the Dove&lt;/i&gt;, stands out as the most unusual of all the stories so far, especially because it involves a king, two gods, but &lt;b&gt;NO BRAHMINS&lt;/b&gt;! &amp;nbsp;Where are the Brahmins? &amp;nbsp;The Book of the Forest is a very strong piece of propaganda about the importance of having well-bred Brahmins for all occasions, but then this strange tale caps them all off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This story has the strongest feel of Buddhism that I've seen so far in the Mahabharata. &amp;nbsp;The king's self-sacrifice is strongly reminiscent of other Buddhist stories in which the Boddhisatva sacrifices his own life for another's benefit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Jantu seems to fit in among these stories in that it is another case of a Brahmin helping a king with his fertility problems. &amp;nbsp;In contrast to many of the other stories, the king's wives are distinctly un-heroic. The last story, the Hawk &amp;amp; the Dove, stands out as the most unusual of all the stories so far, especially because it involves a king, two gods, but NO BRAHMINS! &amp;nbsp;Where are the Brahmins? &amp;nbsp;The Book of the Forest is a very strong piece of propaganda about the importance of having well-bred Brahmins for all occasions, but then this strange tale caps them all off. This story has the strongest feel of Buddhism that I've seen so far in the Mahabharata. &amp;nbsp;The king's self-sacrifice is strongly reminiscent of other Buddhist stories in which the Boddhisatva sacrifices his own life for another's benefit. Next time, we'll finally get back to the deeds of our heroes, as they make their way to the hermitage of Nar-Narayan way up on the slopes of Mt. Kailash.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2010/11/episode-33-hawk-and-dove.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/zgN1BIYKjNw/MBp33.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp33.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Episode 32 - Sukanya and Cyavana</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/C84rouo1hP8/episode-32-sukanya-and-cyavana.html</link><category>Mandhatar</category><category>Bhrgu</category><category>Cyavana</category><category>Sukanya</category><category>Barghava</category><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2010 22:28:46 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-8158069822619595866</guid><description>&lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp32.mp3"&gt;Episode 32&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Two more stories from the Book of the Forest. &amp;nbsp;The first involves another Bhrgu Brahmin with a Kshatriya wife. &amp;nbsp;The second story, about Mahdhatar, is short, but interesting in how it differs from all the other stories we've had so far from Lomasha. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The story of Nala as it is told in the Mahabharata has some significant discrepancies in the storyline.&amp;nbsp; They are too obvious and numerous to list out in full, but an example would be that Damayanti remained in hiding in her aunt's palace even though she could have told the queen the truth at any time, and could go home at any time.&amp;nbsp; Stranger still, the queen mother does not recognize her neice, because the girl was covered in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; all the time and so her famous mole was concealed by the dried muck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand, the scenes are very dramatic and would have made a wonderful 19th century opera.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I found the detail about the size of Nala's army to be interesting.&amp;nbsp; Clearly, chariots were not the most common vehicle on the battle field.&amp;nbsp; There were 19 elephants and numerous horses, and hundreds of infantry, but just one chariot.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps by this time the chariot was more of a status symbol than an effective military weapon; alternatively, were they so expensive that one chariot was all that could be afforded on this mission!?!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, thanks for the feedback on the identity of Kali.&amp;nbsp; They tell me that Kali is the kali in kaliyuga.&amp;nbsp; His buddy Dvapar is of the Dvaparyuga.&amp;nbsp; I had always thought the names Dvapar &amp;amp; Kali, in that context, were modifiers that somehow described these various epochs.&amp;nbsp; But now it seems Kaliyuga is the epoch that is dominated or (perhaps) ruled by the entity Kali.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I always thought a little better of the Dvaparyuga, since during that period people were more humane, but the character of Dvapar is not at all appealing.&amp;nbsp; As for Kali, he comes off as a small-minded little bastard-- hardly fitting for the demon who dominates an entire Epoch!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-1903938414242423675?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

I found the detail about the size of Nala's army to be interesting.&amp;nbsp; Clearly, chariots were not the most common vehicle on the battle field.&amp;nbsp; There were 19 elephants and numerous horses, and hundreds of infantry, but just one chariot.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps by this time the chariot was more of a status symbol than an effective military weapon; alternatively, were they so expensive that one chariot was all that could be afforded on this mission!?! Finally, thanks for the feedback on the identity of Kali.&amp;nbsp; They tell me that Kali is the kali in kaliyuga.&amp;nbsp; His buddy Dvapar is of the Dvaparyuga.&amp;nbsp; I had always thought the names Dvapar &amp;amp; Kali, in that context, were modifiers that somehow described these various epochs.&amp;nbsp; But now it seems Kaliyuga is the epoch that is dominated or (perhaps) ruled by the entity Kali. I always thought a little better of the Dvaparyuga, since during that period people were more humane, but the character of Dvapar is not at all appealing.&amp;nbsp; As for Kali, he comes off as a small-minded little bastard-- hardly fitting for the demon who dominates an entire Epoch!</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2010/10/episode-29-damayanti-nala-pt-2.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/AoRlfiTK0Ds/MBp29.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp29.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Episode 28 - Damayanti &amp; Nala, part 1</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/KU1ZpxMQreQ/episode-28-damayanti-nala-part-1.html</link><category>Damayanti</category><category>Brhadashva</category><category>Nala</category><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2010 22:21:20 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-3525750359170865541</guid><description>&lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp28.mp3"&gt;Episode 28&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- While Arjun remains in heaven, relaxing with his father Indra, news reaches the Kaurava court of Arjun's exploits.&amp;nbsp; Dhrtarastra then has one of his bouts of regret while Sanjay scolds him for being so stupid.&amp;nbsp; We then cut over to the rest of the Pandavas, who are still living off the dirt in the foothills of Dehra Dun.&amp;nbsp; Bhima is ready to chop off some heads and he takes his frustration out on his elder brother. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
When Krishna is done with his exciting tale, the allies pack up and head for home.&amp;nbsp; The tacit understanding seems to be that they will wait until the 13 years are up and only then will they come up with a plan for action.&amp;nbsp; You can imagine Draupadi stewing as all this goes on.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Things only get worse after the allies leave, and the Brahmins move back in.&amp;nbsp; They surround their beloved ascetic king and praise him for his meekness and self-control.&amp;nbsp; The Brahmins re-iterate how important it is for a king to keep lots and lots of Brahmins around at all times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is finally too much for poor Draupadi.&amp;nbsp; She finally gets fed up and starts berating her husband.&amp;nbsp; The two begin debating the relative value of Dharma vs. Karma.&amp;nbsp; Sitting in the woods like a Saddhu certainly did not appear to be the Dharma for a King!&amp;nbsp; Kings should be men of Action.&amp;nbsp; They should act now and keep acting until they have either succeeded or have died trying, because that is what Kings do!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bhima also chimes in and picks up the argument, taking up Draupadi's side.&amp;nbsp; He points out that the ritual calendar is not the same as normal time, and&amp;nbsp;13 months constitutes 13 years ritually, so they are already done and can start the war right away! &amp;nbsp;But Yuddistira always out-argues them all, and besides, he's the boss.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, things are not allowed to get out of control because Vyasa shows up and gives them something to keep them busy-- find a new forest to camp in, and&amp;nbsp;send Arjun north in search of Weapons of Mass Destruction!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-5698669224573447059?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

Next time, Draupadi will turn on her husbands and really let them have it.&amp;nbsp; Stay tuned!</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2010/09/episode-25-draupadis-lament-krishnas.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/glBcdHBZ5Vo/MBp25.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp25.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Episode 24 - Into the Forest, part 2</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/YrRwkaH-RP4/episode-24-into-forest-part-2.html</link><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2010 22:20:35 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-5300510231489869006</guid><description>&lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp24.mp3"&gt;Episode 24&lt;/a&gt; - The Pandavas are now settled into their forest encampment and receive a surprise visitor.&amp;nbsp; The Kauravas plot to kill the Pandavas while they are defenseless in the forest.&amp;nbsp; Vyasa himself steps in to put a stop to this outrage, and he then introduces the sage Maitreya, who scolds Duryodhana, and then finally curses him to be struck in the "thigh" by Bhima.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The general of that army, Sishupal of Chedi, was particularly outraged by this elevation of a milkman over the heads of all the kings of India.&amp;nbsp; Sishupal had other grievances against Krishna, since his fiance Rukmini had been abducted by Krishna, his boss had been killed by Krishna's plan, and his friend and ally Rukmi had been killed by Krishna's brother.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So Sishupal points out what should be obvious to us all-- that Krishna was a low-class cowherd, who boasted about killing a vulture and&amp;nbsp;a cow, a woman, and an ox cart!&amp;nbsp; Who said that these animals and the woman and the cart were demons?&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, Krishna killed his own king-- a treasonous&amp;nbsp;act of regicide that should be obhorred by anyone who desires law &amp;amp; order in society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, Sishupal suggests that &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; Rukmini had already been used &amp;amp; put aside by himself before Krishna took her as his wife.&amp;nbsp; That does it for Krishna.&amp;nbsp; His killer frisbee comes flying and &lt;a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_Seyk1kk77AA/SCKyO5XWVGI/AAAAAAAAAG0/LMUrGof1ZDg/s1600-h/sisupalabeheaded.jpg"&gt;Sishupal is&amp;nbsp;Beheaded&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Check out that link, it's to the picture I mentioned in the podcast.&amp;nbsp; It's pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;

The general of that army, Sishupal of Chedi, was particularly outraged by this elevation of a milkman over the heads of all the kings of India.&amp;nbsp; Sishupal had other grievances against Krishna, since his fiance Rukmini had been abducted by Krishna, his boss had been killed by Krishna's plan, and his friend and ally Rukmi had been killed by Krishna's brother. So Sishupal points out what should be obvious to us all-- that Krishna was a low-class cowherd, who boasted about killing a vulture and&amp;nbsp;a cow, a woman, and an ox cart!&amp;nbsp; Who said that these animals and the woman and the cart were demons?&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, Krishna killed his own king-- a treasonous&amp;nbsp;act of regicide that should be obhorred by anyone who desires law &amp;amp; order in society. Finally, Sishupal suggests that maybe Rukmini had already been used &amp;amp; put aside by himself before Krishna took her as his wife.&amp;nbsp; That does it for Krishna.&amp;nbsp; His killer frisbee comes flying and Sishupal is&amp;nbsp;Beheaded.&amp;nbsp; Check out that link, it's to the picture I mentioned in the podcast.&amp;nbsp; It's pretty cool. This episode ends with a little vignette of Duryodhana wandering the Pandavas' palace and getting fooled by the illusions of the place.&amp;nbsp; He falls into a pond and gets laughed at by his cousins.&amp;nbsp; I've got more to say about how this scene gets changed over time, but we'll get into that in a later episode.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2010/06/episode-20-king-of-world.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/1vmfAGSL1Vc/MBp20.mp3" length="9574784" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp20.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Episode 19 - Killing Jarasandh</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/IuJtmZKye54/episode-19-killing-jarasandh.html</link><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2010 22:19:05 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-4903710912339813476</guid><description>&lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp19.mp3"&gt;Episode 19&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;This episode, Yuddistira gets it into his head that he should be King of the World! As he has been inclined to do since becoming king, he calls for Krishna to advise him on how to accomplish this task. Krishna tells him to send Bhima and Arjun to Magadha and get rid of his main rival to the imperial title, King Jarasandh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, Krishna, Bhima and Arjun go down to Magadha and pick a fight with Jarasandh. Bhima wrestles the old guy for fourteen days and finally body-slams him, killing him instantly. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This whole Rajasuya thing will result in 13 years of misery for the Pandavas, and finally the destruction of nearly the entire race of Kshatriyas. Since dieing on the battlefield is one of the surest means of getting to heaven, I guess it all worked out OK for the men. All those widows probably wished Yuddistira had stuck to his little kingdom of Indraprastha, and been content with his reservation at Lord Yama's palace...&lt;br /&gt;
Sorry I've slowed down my production lately. I've had some musical commitments that have eaten up my free time. That's mostly over, so hopefully things will pick up a bit from now on!

&lt;br /&gt;
So Arjun ends up coming back from his year-long exile with a new wife-- Krishna's sister-- and leaving&amp;nbsp;a trail of baby boys across the sub-continent.&amp;nbsp; After his return home, he and Krishna spend a lot of time together in Indraprastha, and we are told that they are the re-incarnation of the ancient seers Nar and Narayan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While they are hanging out together, Krishna suggests that they go to the river for a kind of picnic, and while they are there, Agni the god of fire meets them and requests their aid in burning down the Khandava Forest, which was the home of Taksaka the snake and under the protection of Indra.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Arjun and Krishna get some cool new weapons as part of the deal.&amp;nbsp; Arjun gets the famous Ghandiva Bow and an inexhaustible quiver of arrows.&amp;nbsp;Krishna gets his Sudarshana discus.&amp;nbsp; The pair of friends then help the Fire God to burn down the forest, fighting off legions of magical creatures and even an army of Gods.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is interesting that Arjun's marriage to Subhadra was in large part the result of Krishna's suggestions.&amp;nbsp; I also noticed that the pair were sitting near the forest where they could meet the Fire God due to Krishna's suggestion that they have a picnic.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm going to keep score on this and we'll see just how much of this story moves along due to Krishna's well-placed suggestions!&amp;nbsp; It's going to be a lot!!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This episode actually covers the end of&amp;nbsp; Book 1 of the Mahabharata, called the Book of the Beginning.&amp;nbsp; There are 18 books in total, and we'll start Book 2 next time, which is called the Book of the Assembly Hall.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In case you were not able to figure it out, I did start using some of the alternate names for Krishna and Arjun in this story.&amp;nbsp;Some of Krishna's alternate names are: Vasudev &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Madhusudana.&amp;nbsp; I refer to Arjun as Partha, Dhananjaya, and Gudakesha.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-4192072839504857700?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The seventh child, Balaram, was magically transported into the womb of Rohini-- Vasudevas other wife living in Vraja with the Gopas.&amp;nbsp; Unlike Balaram, Krishna managed to be born in his natural mother's womb, but was secretly exchanged with the Gopa chieftain's daughter within hours of their birth.&amp;nbsp; As far as anyone could tell, Krishna was born to the Gopi Yashoda, and Devaki had a daughter who was killed by Kamsa as soon as she was discovered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, while Krishna and Balaram are technically full brothers, it appeared as if they were unrelated, and Krishna was simply the son of a cowherder chieftain.&amp;nbsp; This arrangement worked well in keeping him hidden from Kamsa, but it must have been tricky convincing everyone that he really had royal blood and wasn't just some low-caste nobody!&amp;nbsp; We'll see how he pulls this off in later episodes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Bhagavata Purana is so utterly dazzled by Krishna's divinity that these everyday practicalities seem to fade out in the glare, but I'll try to keep a lookout for how the mundane folks around him-- those who did not recognize his divinity-- tried to make sense of his story and his position in society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have to admit that so far Balaram is a bit of a cipher to me.&amp;nbsp; We are told that he is the avatara of Adisesha, who is the Cosmic Snake; Vishnu's pal.&amp;nbsp; Somehow Adisesha appears as himself when Vasudeva makes his journey with Krishna to Vraja, but Balram was already a child at the time.&amp;nbsp; Later, we are told that Balaram and Krishna are equally avataras of Vishnu.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully we'll be able to untangle this riddle as we go along.&amp;nbsp; So far, I admit that I don't quite get it!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If anyone can explain to me how Balaram relates to Krishna, I'd love to hear it.&amp;nbsp; I'll try to come up with&amp;nbsp;an analysis of the two characters as we move further along into the story.&amp;nbsp; They make an amazing contrast, often taking opposite sides on important issues.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-8401993367004813663?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

The Bhagavata Purana is so utterly dazzled by Krishna's divinity that these everyday practicalities seem to fade out in the glare, but I'll try to keep a lookout for how the mundane folks around him-- those who did not recognize his divinity-- tried to make sense of his story and his position in society. I have to admit that so far Balaram is a bit of a cipher to me.&amp;nbsp; We are told that he is the avatara of Adisesha, who is the Cosmic Snake; Vishnu's pal.&amp;nbsp; Somehow Adisesha appears as himself when Vasudeva makes his journey with Krishna to Vraja, but Balram was already a child at the time.&amp;nbsp; Later, we are told that Balaram and Krishna are equally avataras of Vishnu.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully we'll be able to untangle this riddle as we go along.&amp;nbsp; So far, I admit that I don't quite get it! If anyone can explain to me how Balaram relates to Krishna, I'd love to hear it.&amp;nbsp; I'll try to come up with&amp;nbsp;an analysis of the two characters as we move further along into the story.&amp;nbsp; They make an amazing contrast, often taking opposite sides on important issues.</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2010/03/episode-12-krishna-at-play.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/9D462NcrKfg/MBp12.mp3" length="7297402" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp12.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Episode 11 - The Loves of King Yayati</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/vSrlpFA_8QU/episode-11-loves-of-king-yayati.html</link><category>Yayati</category><category>Devayani</category><category>Krishna</category><category>Puru</category><category>Sarmishta</category><category>Yadu</category><category>Vrishaparva</category><category>Shukra</category><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2010 22:16:22 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-7513792083454648406</guid><description>&lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp11.mp3"&gt;Episode 11&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- This episode is the first in&amp;nbsp; a series that will break away from the Mahabharata and use the Bhagavata Purana as the primary source instead.&amp;nbsp; This is necessary if you want to find out Krishna's life stories.&amp;nbsp; Up until the Pandavas meet Krishna at Draupadi's Swayamvara, no mention is made of Krishna's birth, childhood, or rise to power.&amp;nbsp; That information is only available in other books, and the main source is the Bhagavata Purana. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first time I read a faithful translation of the Mahabharata, I was shocked that Krishna just appears in the story, fully grown, and no information is given about his background.&amp;nbsp; So in the next two or three episodes, I will try to rectify that, starting with Krishna's common ancestor with the Pandavas, King Yayati.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I meant to push on and cover Krishna's birth and childhood in this single episode, but I was afraid that all the names and details would get overwhelming if I tried to put all this together, so next episode we'll cover Krishna's birth and toddler-hood.&lt;br /&gt;

I spend some time at the beginning of this episode describing what we're up against in terms of the original Mahabharata as a source.&amp;nbsp; Then the story gets under way, where we meet the two Gurus Krpa and Drona, and find out some of the early enmities between the Pandavas and their cousins the Kauravas.&amp;nbsp; Duryodhana's maternal uncle Shakuni&amp;nbsp;makes his debut in the role of chief conspirator, which he will maintain to his dying day!&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;

As for Kuru, we only hear that he recovered the throne of Hastinapur sometime after his father lost it to the King of Panchala.&amp;nbsp; The story of Yayati and his sons is much longer, but it is also quite odd.&amp;nbsp; I'm going to save it for later because it also bears on the descent of Krishna, plus I'm anxious to get going with the main story!&lt;br /&gt;

So for this time, it's the story of Bharata, his mother Shakuntala, and his jerk of a father, King Dushanta...</itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>Mahabharata,Mahabharat,Podcast,Epic,Epic,Literature,Ancient,India,Krishna,Purana,Bhagavad,Gita,Indian,Philosophy,India,History,Hinduism</itunes:keywords><feedburner:origLink>http://mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com/2010/02/episode-4-shakuntala-and-king-bharata.html</feedburner:origLink><enclosure url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~5/wKopJI2rnJM/MBp4.mp3" length="0" type="audio/mpeg" /><feedburner:origEnclosureLink>http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp4.mp3</feedburner:origEnclosureLink></item><item><title>Episode 3 - A Fishy Beginning</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/MahabharataPodcast/~3/CZLVkfJV6IE/episode-3-fishy-beginning.html</link><category>Vaisampayana</category><category>Mahabharata</category><category>Satyavati</category><category>Vyasa</category><author>mahabharatapodcast@comcast.net (Lawrence Manzo)</author><pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2010 22:13:33 PDT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5100791158359408086.post-3005688735197061014</guid><description>&lt;a href="http://home.comcast.net/~mahabharatapodcast/MBp3.mp3"&gt;Episode 3&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;nbsp;Vaisampayan begins telling the Mahabharata, beginning by telling us that Vyasa spent three years daily working on the poem.

&lt;br /&gt;
There are a lot of different interpretations of the Mahabharata out there, and they are all so different from each other, because the original writing is often so obtuse that it is very hard to get past. But buried beneath all the archaic language and reptition is a really fascinating story. My problem with the abridgements and adaptations out there is that they all without exception change the facts of the story, and skip a lot of the detail that I think gives one a real feeling for the authors' original intent. I will try to remedy this as best I can in this podcast. Finally, I really appreciate all those great podcasts out there that help me to while away the boring moments of my life, and I hope this offering is a way of giving back. &amp;nbsp;I hope you enjoy it!&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5100791158359408086-8371158030376275444?l=mahabharatapodcast.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;
