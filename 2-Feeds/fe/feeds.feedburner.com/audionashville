            <title>Pearl Heart (Part 1)</title>
            <description>Several years ago I had an idea for a show. I was going to  interview songwriters just getting to town, and some who had been here a while,  to give the audience a taste of what life here is like before you have a bunch of hits under your belt. I did a few  interviews with people I really liked but the show never got produced. These  interviews sat on the shelf until now. 

One group I was impressed with was three young  ladies who had just moved to town. Since that interview they  have been finalist on Nashville Star, and have recently signed a production  deal with Jeffery Steele's 3 Ring Circus Records. So we dug this recording out of the archives  and will present it now. Listen closely to the end of this interview and you'll  see that AudioNashville predicted this group was going somewhere in the next 5 years. They proved us wrong, getting national attention within 2 years of  coming to town. 
Now AudioNashville proudly presents the lost interview with Pearl Heart.</description>

            <title>Denny Martin</title>
            <description>One of the most important steps to getting a song cut in Nashville is the demo. A great demo producer can take a melody and lyrics and make the song come to life.

He is the owner of the Denny Martin Music Studio, one of Nashville's best independent recording studios. He has over 30 years experience in the music business as a singer, performer and recording engineer-producer.
