			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.acting-and-theatre.com/images/kingsxdog_crop copyright.jpg" alt="capacity for play" width="450" height="359"/></p>
<p><em>Dramatic Impact: Acting and Theatre in Alberta</em> is two and 1/3 years old now, and we have had 25 episodes in total. In all that time I have not been tempted to mouth off about anything in this podcast blog. But today I discovered something that I am passionate about, which I suspect that many engaged in the pursuit of acting are prone to take less than seriously.</p>
<p>I believe that the core of acting depends on developing our capacity for play and imagination. I take this belief for granted because it has been confirmed by so many directors, teachers, and actors that I respect. But I think there is a disdain for that approach out there, possibly because it is hard enough to gain respect for what we do as actors and to be regarded as professional. And even those of us who are not full-blown professional actors want to be regarded as professional in our approach. It makes it that much less appealing to openly legitimize the role of play and imagination in what we do.</p>
<p><em>In True and False: Heresy and Common Sense for the Actor</em>, a book that has generated much controversy, David Mamet acknowledges an actor’s fear of being perceived as childish:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not childish to live with uncertainty, to devote oneself to a craft rather than a career, to an idea rather than an institution. It’s courageous and requires a courage of the order that the institutionally co-opted are ill-equipped to perceive.</p></blockquote>
<p>(If you are interested in hearing more about this book and others that have inspired me, listen to <a href="http://www.acting-and-theatre.com/?p=516&amp;preview=true" target="_blank"><em>Episode 22: One Big Massive Retweet, The Books, Part 1</em></a>)<br />
Actors have traditionally been mistrusted, sometimes even feared and have been seen as little more than prostitutes and criminals. We don’t want to be perceived as children too.</p>
<p>So if you don’t believe in the role of play and imagination, check out the <a href=http://www.acting-and-theatre.com/resources-and-inspiration-for-acting-and-theatre-addicts/fourteen-essential-books-on-acting-theatre-and-the-emotional-life-of-an-artist/ target=”_blank”> books of Michael Chekhov, Harold Guskin, and Keith Johnstone</a>. Chekhov, who lived from 1891-1955, is still and Guskin and Johnstone are considered to be highly respected teachers and professionals in the international acting community.</p>
<p>It is an accepted standard that an actor is the most powerful when that actor is “in the moment”, not showing you what he or she rehearsed but truly creating a moment as if for the first time. That comes from the ability to be spontaneous, and what better way to develop spontaneity than through play? Hence, you have veteran teachers and directors that are never too jaded to get their actors to play and rediscover their spontaneity. Another way that this gets expressed by teachers and directors is the idea that the intellect inhibits spontaneity. And what better way to get around our habitual use of the intellect than to use games and physicalization and exercises to develop the imagination?</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean the intellect has no role. After an actor has discovered the core of the scene or the character, he or she can bring in the intellect to refine their choices. But if it is too prevalent in the beginning, an actor may stiffen up, and we end up giving dead performances, museum pieces.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think in the comments, but please be respectful. People think that if you actually express a point of view strongly that you must be an arrogant person. Actually, before I started this podcast, I was terrified of putting my voice out there. Now I am more used to having a public voice and have gotten to the point where I can put my views out there when I feel strongly about them. Let me know what your point of view is. I welcome discussion. In any community, there must be room for differing points of view.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to fill you in on what to look for over the next little while on <em>Dramatic Impact</em>. I will be posting an interview with actor Richard Lee Hsi in early January, 2010.</p>
<h3 class="entry">One Big Massive Retweet</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m planning something very different, an episode that I&#8217;m calling &#8220;One Big Massive Retweet&#8221; in honour of the popularity of Twitter. I&#8217;m just using the term to refer to the fact that I&#8217;ll be recommending podcast episodes, books, and web sites that help sustain my enthusiasm and passion for acting and theatre. So I&#8217;m using the term &#8220;tweet&#8221; very loosely here. Nothing to do with Twitter. There will also be a corresponding blog page that will link to all of these fantastic resources.</p>
<h3 class="entry"><em>Honest, You Won&#8217;t Get Hooked</em></h3>
<p>As part of my life as an actor and owner of the business Often Seen New Media, Inc., I played a small part in, and I am volunteering to help publicize a short independent film by Edmonton filmmaker Ben Babchishin. It is an outrageous comedy about smoking and our society. </p>
<p>Read the <a href="http://www.often-seen.com/HiredGun/Honest_Synopsis.pdf" target="_blank">synopsis</a>. And if you are interested, join the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?v=wall&#038;gid=160737252323" target="_blank">Facebook Group</a> for the film to see stills from the film and shooting, to see related videos, to see the trailer, and to be notified when the film is released.</p>
<p>See the film online starting March 1, 2010 at <a href="http://www.hiredgunfilms.com" target="_blank">www.hiredgunfilms.com</a>. Or if you are in Edmonton, come to the screening.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you remember the “Secrets of the Actor” episodes from last summer ? An extension of those episodes is currently being featured on psychologist Douglas Eby’s <a href="http://theinneractor.com/secrets-of-the-actor/" target="_blank">The Inner Actor</a> web site. The guest post includes an article about “Secrets of the Actor” (including links to those episodes if you never heard them) and a new short 5 minute podcast called Secrets of the Actor, Part 3.</p>
<p>Part 3 contains some of my own ideas about how the pursuit of acting can give us insight into our own lives and can influence our personal development. I originally recorded these ideas as part of the “Secrets of the Actor” episodes but then cut them out because I didn’t want the episodes to be too long. I hope you’ll find that my ideas echo and elaborate on some of the ideas in Parts 1 and 2 that came out during the interviews.</p>
<h3 class="entry">Technical Difficulties with the RSS Feed</h3>
<p>If you are one of the original subscribers to the show from when it was still on the Theatre Alberta web site, you may have noticed that you didn’t get the latest video episode I posted on the site, Episode 18: Technical Theatre at Grant MacEwan College, Part 2. I finally identified the source of the problem (a server that crashed and lost a crucial setting). It should be working again now, but if you ever need to resubscribe, our feed address is</p>
<p>http://feeds.acting-and-theatre.com/dramaticimpact</p>
<p>In iTunes, just choose Subscribe to Podcast . . . from the Advanced menu, and copy and paste that address into the window that pops up. It’s a similar procedure in other feed readers.</p>
<p>Also Parts 3 and 4 of the Technical Theatre video episodes are now up on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/elrodalta" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>Something new for <em>Dramatic Impact</em>, an audio documentary. This is also our first episode about a play that was researched and created outside the traditional theatre community. <em>The Invisible Project</em> is a play that was created collectively and researched in Calgary&#8217;s homeless shelters. The performances of the play that I recorded last January were at Calgary City Hall and at the Calgary Drop-In Centre, a shelter that can house up to 1250 men and women per night and that serves up to 3500 meals per day. The Drop-In Centre was also where the play&#8217;s director and facilitator, David van Belle, assistant director, Aviva Zimmerman, stage manager, Paisley Sim, mask maker, Douglas R. Witt, mask assistant, Carla Ritchie, set and lighting designer, Terry Gunvordahl, and actors Molly Flood, Richard Lee Hsi, and Jed Tomlinson rehearsed and researched the show.</p>
<p>The music in the play was captured from adhoc &#8220;performances&#8221; given by clients at the Drop-In Centre. I also used snippets of this music for segues in the documentary.</p>

<p>On this episode we&#8217;re hearing from the talented and delightful Michele Brown, a veteran Canadian actor who was featured in <em>Episode 7: Secrets of the Actor, part 1</em>. This is the first of the “Rest of the Interviews” series, in which I’m going to present material that I recorded for Episodes 7 and 8 that did not pertain to the <em>Secrets of the Actor</em> topic. It’s fascinating material that you won’t want to miss.</p>
<p>Michele discusses her origins as an actor, her creative process, the satisfaction that she gets from helping students at the University of Alberta discover their own creativity, and how her motivation for being an actor has changed over the years.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 class="entry">Welcome</h3>
<p>The <em>Dramatic Impact</em> podcast now has a permanent home on this web site. Welcome to any current listeners and to any new visitors. Over the next few months, I&#8217;ll be adding content to the site that I hope will be of interest to fellow actors and theatre addicts.</p>
<h3 class="entry">New Feed Address Will be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>On July 7, our feed address will be changing from http://feeds.theatrealberta.com/dramaticimpact to one based on this site. After I set the feed up with Feedburner, I&#8217;ll post the address of the new feed. Or if you are already subscribed and all goes well, you should automatically be redirected to the new feed on July 7. If you lose us, please come back to this site and re-subscribe.</p>
<h3 class="entry">Duplicate Episodes and Other Weirdness</h3>
<p>If you are a subscriber and got some duplicate episodes and a test audio file, I apologize. It&#8217;s all part of the craziness of switching to a new feed address. Everything should be back to normal after next month, so please feel free to delete those extra files. Or if you are using a news reader and can&#8217;t delete the extra posts, you can re-subscribe after I post the new feed address.</p>
