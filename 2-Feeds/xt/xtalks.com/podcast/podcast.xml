Greg Garcia (Information Technology Association of America),Michael Assante (National amp; Homeland Security Idaho National Lab (INL)), James Chou (Apani Networks)
</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>Information Security has been thrust to the forefront in recent months with many companies losing information and customer data.  Companies are making the move in a desperate attempt to protect consumer as well as critical data from invasion and security breaches.  The question by many consumers is whether government should make it mandatory for companies to ensure that customer data is properly secure, while government officials are seeing the recent attacks as a threat to National security.  These attacks have therefore left companies clamoring for answers to their now vulnerable IT infrastructures.

	<itunes:summary>With the aging population and the challenge of recruiting and retaining qualified employees, it is very important that we facilitate the employees we do have in getting and staying healthy. The workplace is the place to influence this action as this reinforces the company as caring for their human resources as well as building employee loyalty and the companys image as an employer of choice. Wellness offerings can no longer be seen as a good thing to do for the employees but as a strategic business investment with ways to document return on investment. Join us as we present the new frontier of Health and Productivity Management as the new tool to control our health care crisis.

	<title>New FDA/USDA Food Security Initiatives and the 5 key steps for improving your plants security</title>
	<itunes:author>Xtalks</itunes:author>
	<itunes:subtitle>Discussion led by Louis J. Carson (Food and Drug Administration), Lance Reeve (American Institute of Baking)
	</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>Food safety and food security are both integrated and high priority goals for the Food and Drug Administration.  Since 9/11 the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition has devoted significant resources to food defense. In general terms FDA has focused on three main areas in relation to food defense. preparedness, response and recovery. The development of a food defense strategy has involved a variety of approaches one of the most important of which was to determine vulnerabilities using an operational risk management approach. By examining a variety of agents, food commodities and various scenarios between the farm and the table it was possible to determine the quot;higherquot; risk combinations and thus focus resources based on a determination of risk. This approach has driven a number of activities including the development of guidance documents, research activities and emergency response planning. This preventative strategy has been augmented by new research for the development of rapid and sensitive methods, as well as the development of a clear emergency response plan should a deliberate food contamination event occur. Current activities are further focused on CARVER assessments of the higher risk foods and close interaction with stakeholders to further ensure preparedness. The 2002 Bioterrorism Act has further extended the protection of the U.S. food supply through the development of a number of rules.  Overall, while there has been a significant increase in focus on food defense this has been integrated as far as possible into food safety activities which remain an ongoing and high priority for FDA.
