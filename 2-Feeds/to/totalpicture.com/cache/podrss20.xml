James Marvin: "You can pack your parachute a thousand times, but at some point you're going to have to jump and trust that you're going to know what to do in the unlikely event you have a malfunction."

Welcome to a special Career Transition channel podcast on TotalPicture Radio this is Peter Clayton reporting. Joining us today is retired Navy SEAL, Commander James Marvin. Among many assignments during his distinguished twenty year military career, James was the Executive Officer at the Naval Special Warfare command, located on the Island Kingdom of Bahrain. In November of 2004 Commander Marvin was transferred to the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island where he received a Master of Arts in National Security and Strategic Studies.

James retired from active duty in 2009, and now lives in Seattle, WA, where he formed a consulting practice, Federal Green Solutions. James is helping the Department of Defense reduce its dependence on oil and increase operational capability. I was introduced to James by executive career coach Beth Ross, who said, "James really gets it. He did the transition from his military career exactly right."]]></description>

Francie Dalton

‚ÄúA one-size-fits-all command and control management approach puts leaders on a fast-track to failure,‚Äù according to Francie Dalton, president of Dalton Alliances, Inc. ‚ÄúTo be successful in today‚Äôs multi-generational workplaces, managers need to be adept at navigating multiple personalities.‚Äù

A popular speaker for associations and corporations, Dalton has lead hundreds of workshops, and is frequently quoted in the media in the areas of leadership and performance.

In her latest book, "Versatility: How to Optimize Interaction When 7 Workplace Behaviors Are at Their Worst," Dalton takes a tough love point of view on how leaders can neutralize the most challenging behaviors, at any level in an organization.

			<title>Jesse Canella, CEO and Co-Founder, HonorVet.org: Working to &quot;Win the War at Home&quot;</title>
			<itunes:author>TotalPicture Radio with Peter Clayton</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[There's another war. It's behind the curtains of U.S. homes, seen at businesses, unemployment lines, roadways, hospitals, VFW's and on your block. It's the war returning servicemen and women face as they struggle to re-adjust to life in the states. Many are beset by depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), substance abuse problems, lack of economic opportunity, anxiety, injuries, and assorted family issues."

More than 1.6 million American troops have been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11, and many have come home with mental health issues. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine estimated one in eight suffer from PTSD symptoms; another estimates that up to 300,000 have developed some mental health problem. But many don't see a psychiatrist or psychologist, some because they fear the stigma of being labeled mentally ill, some because they won't ‚Äî or can't acknowledge that they need help.

The unemployment rate for returning veterans hit 21.1% in March of last year.

Welcome to a Big Picture Channel Podcast on TotalPicture Radio with Peter Clayton reporting. HonorVet.org was founded by two US Marine Vets; Jesse Canella and Jimmy McCain ‚Äî after they returned from active duty in the Al An Bar Province, Iraq. The organization is devoted to providing resources and support for veterans, service members and their families. I'm honored to have on the show Jesse Canella.

The number of service members discharged specifically for mental health reasons is up 64 percent from 2005 to 2009.
The unemployment rate for returning veterans hit 21.1% in March of 2010
According to USA Today, the Army reported suicides were at a record high in June 2010.
More than 60 percent of Service Members report receiving some kind of mental health care since returning from Iraq or Afghanistan. More than 5 percent of recently returning Service Members showed signs of significant mental health problems.
Even more alarming, when these same Service Members were reevaluated 3-6 months later, up to 40 percent exhibited signs of severe emotional distress.
According to a recent report by the Department of Veterans Affairs, an average of 18 Veterans commit suicide everyday.
Questions Peter Clayton asks Jesse Canella in this podcast:

You served in Iraq with Jimmy McCain, Senator John McCain's son. Tell us about the inspiration for forming HonorVet.

I've read you were gripped by depression when you returned from Iraq, can you share with us your personal story?

Figures released by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in 2010 show a dramatic increase in suicide among veterans aged 18 to 29, due in large part to multiple deployments and the overall stress of combat. These are veterans you don't see in the VA hospitals, am I right?

What are some of the biggest challenges facing soldiers transitioning to civilian life?

The tagline on HonorVet.org is "The Next Generation Community for Veterans." How so?

You recently partnered with System One, a staffing and solutions firm. Tell us about the partnership.

Jesse a lot of recruiters, sourcers, and HR professionals listen to this podcast. How can we help you and the HonorVet community?

			<title>Flip the Funnel ‚Äî How To Use Existing Customers to Gain New Ones. A Conversation with Joseph Jaffe</title>
			<itunes:author>TotalPicture Radio with Peter Clayton</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[When Joseph Jaffe and I realized we were neighbors, we decided to conduct our interview in person. About 90% of my podcasts are phone based; it's always enjoyable to have a chance to meet in person. Especially someone as interesting and accomplished as Jaffe.

Joseph's new book, Flip The Funnel: How to Use Existing Customers to Gain New Ones (Amazon.com affiliate link), became the topic of conversation when I met with my business partner, Valerie LaSusa, for lunch last week. She has been doing a great deal of research on traditional marketing funnels: eyeballs>> (awareness > consideration > preference > action> loyalty>) >> buyers, and what happens when you turn the funnel upside down. When I pulled Jaffe's book out of my backpack, it was one of those "you must be kidding" moments. Our two hour lunch could have easily gone on for eight hours, discussing the concepts Jaffe writes about in his new book. The author is the former president and "Chief Interruptor" of Crayon, a conversational marketing company, specializing in community, dialogue and partnership. Crayon recently merged with Austin Tx based Powered. Val purchased a copy of Flip the Funnel and helped me prep the interview with Joseph. 
Stay tuned... Joseph's interview podcast will air Wednesday!

Joseph Jaffe Background

One of the most sought-after consultants, speakers and thought leaders on new marketing, Joseph Jaffe is Chief Interruptor of Powered, a conversational marketing company, specializing in community, dialogue and partnership. 

Prior to merging with powered, Jaffe was president of crayon, where he worked with companies including P&G, The Coca-Cola Company, Dunkin‚Äô Brands, TiVo, Motorola and Fox Interactive Media. Before that, Joseph was Director of Interactive Media at TBWA/Chiat/Day and OMD USA, where he worked on Kmart, ABSOLUT Vodka, Embassy Suites and Samsonite. 

Jaffe‚Äôs popular blog and audio podcast, "Jaffe Juice‚Äù, provides daily and weekly commentary respectively on all things new marketing. You can join the conversation at .

His first book, ‚ÄùLife After The 30-Second Spot: Energize Your Brand With A Bold Mix Of Alternatives To Traditional Advertising‚Äù (Wiley/Adweek) was released in June 2005 and focuses on how advertising is evolving in a world ruled by an empowered consumer and no longer governed solely by the 30-second spot. His second book titled, ‚ÄúJoin the conversation: How to engage marketing-weary consumers with the power of community, dialogue and partnership‚Äù was published by Wiley in October 2007. 

Joseph is a Senior Fellow at the Center for the Digital Future at the USC Annenberg School, as well as the Society for New Communications Research. Hailing from South Africa, he lives with his wife, daughter and two sons in Westport, CT.This morning I happened across the above graphic in an older Center Networks post and it triggered a quick thought on a familiar theme.]]></description>
