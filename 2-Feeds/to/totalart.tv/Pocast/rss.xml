Na'rimbo was founded in 1998 by young marimba players who studied the contemporary and classical techniques of the instrument and have a strong grounding in the traditions of marimba music in the state of Chiapas, known as the Land of the Marimba, in southeastern Mexico. Under the leadership of Israel Moreno, the group has performed in several national and international festivals to the acclaim of critics and music lovers and has won many awards and prizes. Na'rimbo showcases unique fusions of traditional jazz instruments to create a sound where folk music, latin rhythms and jazz styles meet in an explosion of extraordinary percussion music. For centuries the marimba has played a fundamental role in life in Chiapas and many talented marimba builders have become gifted players. In Chiapas, the marimba is much more than a musical instrument. It is a cultural symbol that unites and identifies the people of this land with a tradition that has envolved from profound artistic roots as part of an artisan and musical expression shared by all. Na'rimbo seeks to show the world another side of mexican folklore and to promote the traditional culture and music of the southeastern regions.&lt;br/&gt;</description>

Aguamala was born in Playa del Carmen Mexico in February 2004, the band is integrated by Fernando Toussaint (drums), Enrique Pat (keyboards), Bernardo Ron (guitar) and Luis Ernesto Lopez (bass). A fine mix of influences, a base of jazz with touches of funk and rock, all that giving a particular sound to Aguamala. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its six year history the band has had the participation of musicians and singers such as Caro Montes, Christian Beck, Natalia La Fourcade, Eugenio Toussaint, Diego Maroto, Dirk Freymuth, Mark Anderson and Sabo Romo among others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aguamala has been presented at several international forums and has become the host group in the Riviera Maya Jazz Festival, giving them the opportunity to share the stage with music icons such as Marcus Miller, Gino Vannelli, Screaming Headless Torsos, Tom Custer, Tower of Power, George Benson, David Sanborn, Kool And The Gang, George Duke, Ivan Lins, Caribbean Jazz Project and Mint Condition, among others. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aguamala is hard to classify and the band members are just instruments without rules to follow just trying to capture and interpret with respect a small part of the infinite amount of music that is in the air. Now &amp;quot;13:20&amp;quot; their new album, a technically impeccable work, with the precision demanded by the genre and above all, with their heart in every single note. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this new album Aguamala, is now reaching very important music forums in México and not only for Jazz but also of Mexican Rock, being invited for the first time to one of the most important Rock Festivals The &amp;quot;Vive Latino&amp;quot; 2010 in Mexico City. &lt;br/&gt;</description>
