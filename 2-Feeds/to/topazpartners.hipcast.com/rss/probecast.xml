      <title>PRobecast Episode #77: Jaw Branding </title>
      <description><![CDATA[When it comes to marketing and branding, the conventional wisdom is that the “elevator pitch” is a must-have.  You should be able to boil down what your company does in 30 seconds, the length of an average elevator ride. 

Marketing consultant Steven Melanson is a contrarian. He says the elevator pitch is misguided -- that it’s too long and overlooks a key branding objective: differentiating you from your competition.

Steven is President of <a href=”http://www.melansonconsult.com”>Melanson Consulting</a>, a "verbal branding development and instruction company." He is also the author of <a href=”http://www.melansonconsult.com/?page_id=11”>Jaw Branding™</a>, a book and audio CD "that  describes the verbal gap in the branding services marketplace, Jaw Branding™ philosophies for verbal interactions, the relationship to memory and psychology, its superiority to traditional sales or communications approaches for revenue generation, and the implications of verbal branding for organizational culture."

Steven joined Topazers Glen Zimmerman, Anne Dalyrymple, and Wendie Larkin for a special episode of PRobecast, which you can listen to in this podcast. ]]></description>

      <title>PRobecast #76 - The No Politics Show</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In this long-awaited episode of PRobecast, Tim Allik, Anne Dalrymple, and Glen Zimmerman manage to completely avoid what may be the most historic presidential election in history and talk PR, journalism and social media, pure and simple:

1. The <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com"><i>Christian Science Monitor</i></a> goes to a web-centric delivery and distribution model and we like it.  Private ownership has distinct advantages in the media world. <p>
2. <a href="http://www.wbur.org">WBUR</a>, Boston's NPR news station, uses <a href="http://www.twitter.com/wbur">Twitter</a> to set up live meetings in the studio with its listeners, and we like that too!<p>
3. This tech economy isn't like the one we experienced in 2001, thank goodness.  We talk about <a href="http://techprgems.com/2008/10/remember-2001/">how it's different this time</a>. <p>
4. <a href="http://techprgems.com/2008/10/the-personal-professional-side-of-social-media-and-just-slacking-off/">Social media and productivity</a> is once again on the agenda. How we've already been faced with  a "distraction challenge" with email, and what we should have learned from it.

      <description><![CDATA[Welcome to episode #75 of PRobecast, Topaz Partners’ occasionally weekly podcast exploring the latest developments in the world of social media and public relations! Todd Van Hoosear is joined by Wendie Larkin, Glen Zimmerman, Tim Allik, Ann Dalrymple, Joanna DiTrapano, Katelyn D'Eramo and Malinda Singh to chat about:

1. It’s the economy, stupid! The major indices were hurting this week. Will Web 2.0 save us?
2. Did you Tweet about the debate? Is mixing politics, business and technology a good idea? Do Democrats own the social media space? Are new online polls accurate because of this? 
3. Does your entire online social network know your birthday? Your pets’ name? Your mother’s maiden name? They might be able to assume your identity!
4. Does citizen journalism work? It didn’t for Apple.
5. Should the About Us page be banned?
6. What's next for Todd?

You can send your feedback to probecast@topazpartners.com. You can also call your feedback into 781-404-2410. Or leave a comment on our blog!

PRobecast’s opening music is "Junk In A" by Pat Zelenka, available on the Podsafe Music Network. Our closing music is "Show Me" off of The Blizzard Of 78's self-titled album, available on iTunes or on CD from their site.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Welcome to episode #72 of PRobecast, Topaz Partners’ weekly podcast exploring the latest developments in the world of social media and public relations! Rob Capra is joined by Todd Van Hoosear, Wendie Larkin and Ann Dalrymple to chat about:

1. Obama needed to score big at the DNC. Biden flopped. How did Obama do?

2. Giving up: it's not just for wimps anymore. Why companies like Circuit City and AMC should just give up control, unlike Babs.

3. Disclosure: Did it help or hurt the Social Media Group and Livingston Communications? We all agree that disclosing the break-up was the right thing to do, but could they have avoided all the publicity, positive and negative, if they'd waited until they were done with the due diligence before announcing the merger?]]></description>

1. Obama needed to score big at the DNC. Biden flopped. How did Obama do?

2. Giving up: it's not just for wimps anymore. Why companies like Circuit City and AMC should just give up control, unlike Babs.

3. Disclosure: Did it help or hurt the Social Media Group and Livingston Communications? We all agree that disclosing the break-up was the right thing to do, but could they have avoided all the publicity, positive and negative, if they'd waited until they were done with the due diligence before announcing the merger?</media:text>

      <description><![CDATA[This week on PRobecast, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/timallik">Tim Allik</a>, Wendie Larkin, and Glen Zimmerman discuss:

How uncool is <a href="http://www.cuil.com">Cuil</a>? The new search engine launched with the best buzz money could buy but landed with a thud. The PR lesson learned? Great PR just isn't enough. 

Corporate blog relations. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/25/technology/25comcast.html">Friday's New York Times</a> covers the trials and tribulations of blogger Brandon Dilbeck, who gribes about Comcast on his blog - and then complains when the company emails him to ask if they can do anything to work things out. Earth to Brandon, you can't have it both ways. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself keep a personal diary. Otherwise, prepare to engage. And kudos to Comcast for reaching out. 

Help a Reporter Out. At <a href="http://www.helpareporter.com">www.helpareporter.com</a>,  Peter Shankman's effort to distribute reporters' request for sources is taking the PR world by storm, with 20,000 subscribers to the service in just a few months. Are the folks at Profnet quaking in their boots? They probably should be, because HARO is free. D'oh! Our panelists float and consider a related idea: Could PR folks create a aggregated list of PR pitches (protecting embargoes and anonymity, of course) that could then be distributed on a regular basis to reporters? What do you think? 

Is the press release dead? Before you start yawning in the face of the age-old question, consider our experience at Topaz with our client <a href="http://www.languageweaver.com">Language Weaver</a>, a leader in statistical machine translation.  We distributed a press release that linked to <a href="http://blog.languageweaver.com/2008/07/09/language-weaver-cto-says-improvements-to-statistical-machine-translation-expand-opportunities-for-government-customers/">a podcast with one of the company's founders</a>. The release itself was interesting enough for famed inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil to link to it from his website, <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/news/frame.html?main=/news/news_single.html?id%3D9076">www.kurzweilai.net</a>. The one element missing from this equation? A reporter.]]></description>

      <title>PRobecast B2B Special #1: John Cass</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There are lots of good examples of B2C social media successes out there (you have to dig, but they're out there). 

But try looking for B2B examples. They're few and far between. 

We're trying to put an end to that. We're therefore launching a PRobecast series that will highlight the B2B social media examples and (hopefully) successes. 

Our first guest of the series is John Cass (http://pr.typepad.com/pr_communications/), SNCR founding fellow (http://sncr.org/2008/01/15/sncr-founding-fellows-advisory-board-members/) and online community manager at Forrester Research. I had a chance to meet up with John at Podcamp Boston 3 this weekend.  

John shared some excellent B2C examples at the June Social Media Club Boston event (http://techprgems.com/2008/06/social-media-in-the-enterprise/), but these weren't really focused on B2B.

So today, John and I talked about a few B2B social media examples, including:

* Scuderi Group (http://www.brightcove.tv/title.jsp?title=1352562216&channel=1156873648)
* Emerson Process Management (http://www.scoutblogging.com/success_study/blogger_interviews/emerson_process_management_deb.html)
* Indium Corporation (http://www.scoutblogging.com/success_study/blogger_interviews/indium_corporation_rick_short.html)

Do you have examples of B2B social media success you'd like to share? Drop us a line! We'll have you on the next installment!]]></description>

      <title>PRobecast #67: The A.P., Ownership and Measurement</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Hello and welcome to episode #67 of PRobecast, Topaz Partners’ weekly podcast exploring the latest developments in the world of social media and public relations! Todd Van Hoosear is joined by Amy Krigman, Stephanie Shultis, Wendie Larkin, Chia-Hsuan Wu and Rob Capra.

Please send your feedback to our NEW email address: probecast@topazpartners.com. You can also call your feedback into 781-404-2409, or leave a comment on our blog at techprgems.com. 

1. THE A.P. CRACKS DOWN ON BLOGGERS 
The A.P. “has seen the enemy, and it is blogs”. It issued takedown orders to the Drudge Retort for including quotes of AP content. Is YOUR blog next?

2. WHO OWNS SOCIAL MEDIA?
Jeremiah Owyang is putting together a series of social media FAQs, and yesterday he asked “who owns social media?” It’s a VERY good question. 

3. MEASUREMENT
Poor K.D. It seems that ‘ad equivalency” just won’t die. Why?

4. THE CAMPAIGNS EMBRACE SOCIAL NETWORKING
On Tuesday, Obama hit the 1 million supporter mark on Facebook. McCain is putting videogames and videos up on his site. People are competing to get seats on campaign buses. What’s next for the campaigns?

5. For more on the A.P. story, Twitter and Twebinars, check out this week’s Media Bullseye Radio with yours truly as a guest. 

PRobecast’s opening music is “Junk In A” by Pat Zelenka, available on the Podsafe Music Network. Our closing music was composed by our own Rob Capra. We’ll be back next week—see you then!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Hello and welcome to episode #65 of PRobecast, Topaz Partners’ weekly podcast exploring the latest developments in the world of social media and public relations! 

Todd Van Hoosearis joined by Tony Sapienza, Wendy Larkin, Glen Zimmerman and Ann Dalrymple. 

Feel free to send your feedback to our NEW email address: probecast@topazpartners.com. You can also call your feedback into 781-404-2409. Or leave a comment on our new blog!

1. SCOTTYGATE: CBS News’ Legal Analyst Andrew Cohen blasted the PR profession, but is the legal profession any better? http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/01/sunday/main4142947.shtml

2. POPCORN AND CELLPHONES. Scary, but is it true? And what should Orville Redenbacher and CTIA do about it? 
http://www.whatsnextblog.com/archives/2008/06/this_is_your_brain_on_cellphone.asp 

3. PRESS RELEASE GRADER
David Meerman Scott called our attention to HubSpot’s new Press Release Grader
http://www.webinknow.com/2008/05/grade-your-pres.html 

4. Are technology companies losing their edge? 

5. SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF
Lessons for PR folks from eWeek’s Joe Wilcox on why you shouldn't try to hide information. 
http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/desktop_mobile/nettop_puts_xp_below.html?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535 

6. Have you gotten in line for your iPhone yet? Do you like Apple? Do you like how Apple markets its products?
 

7. SUMMER READING SUGGESTIONS
Ours include:
* Tom Perkins (of Kleiner Perkins), Valley Boy
* K.D. Paine, “Measuring Public Relationships”
* Josh Bernoff, “Groundswell” – at least for the case studies
* Don Tapscott’s and Anthony D. Williams’ “Wikinomics”
* A couple of USA Today reporters got together to write “Zero Day Threat”, a real-life book about cybercrime that reads like a novel. 
 * I guess we have to add Scott McClellan’s book too…

8. WHAT TO DO NEXT WEEK
Enterprise 2.0 is next week, and with it is their Enterprise 2 DOT OPEN show. Also, LP&P is hosting this month’s Social Media Club Boston event on enterprise social media case studies.

Doug Haslam, tim Allik and Adam Zand discuss:

1. Free Scoble! Are Facebook's terms of service evil or did Robert Scoble overreach in his testing of a data-scraping application. Does Plaxo deserve some blame?

3. Free the Webkinz rooms. Webkinz welcomes kiddies to the world of virtual world service outages. 

4. Not-so-free Social Media Event. Social Media Club Boston and the local PRSA chapter join forces for "Beyond Blogging: PR and Today's Social Media Revolution" on Thrusday January 10.

      <description><![CDATA[Welcome to the PRobecast, Episode 31 of Topaz Partners' weekly PR podcast.
 Rob Capra,  Sandy Kalik and Tim Allik discuss:

1. Poor old Yahoo!’s unintentional news leakage of its new “Mash” social media platform. The element of surprise is certainly lost, but isn’t Yahoo! Late to the game anyway?

2. A Techcrunch post by Nick Gonzalez that asks the unsubtle question, Does social media make you dumb?”  We didn’t know the answer to that one. But seriously, folks … 

3. Rob’s musings about the of nude pix of “High School Musical 2” star Vanessa Hudgens and her subsequent PR campaign (We wondered if this story will boost PRobecast’s Digg ranking. See #2, above.) 

4.  AT&T’s rebranding campaign. AT&T wireless became Cingular, which became AT&T again. BusinessWeek’s Matt Vella asks if it has resulted in an identity crisis for the company. But our team begs to differ: we’ve been pleasantly surprised at how short the public’s collective attention span seems to be when it comes to the AT&T/Cingular/AT&T brand.

   3. Kryptonite redux: Kryptonite attacked on the blogs again, but this time they're ready.
   4. ComScore report on global reach of social networks: re-capping Doug's grumpy blog post, and how do we use them as PR people? Plus, obligatory Twitter mention!
   5. After BlogHer: a discussion on pitching bloggers. Again. With mostly common sense points that can be applied to traditional media pitches as well.
   6. Elton John says shut down the Internet because it destroys creativity. Whatr's a creative way to say Shut. Up. Elton.

      <description><![CDATA[Welcome to the PRobecast, Episode 24 of Topaz Partners' weekly
PR-related podcast.

Doug Haslam, Rob Capra and Sandy Kalik discuss:

   1. The "Public Relations" entry on Wikipedia: Is it ok if PR people contribute to it--pretty please, Mr. Wales?
   2. We discuss a new white paper, "Relating to the Public; the Evolving Role of Public Relations in the Age of Social Media," by Paul Rand and Giovanni Rodriguez. We talk particularly about integrating social and traditional media, recruiting, and teach new media in PR classes.
   3. "Social Media Influence" index: Do we need one? Is it useful? Should we create one that shows Tech PR Gems to be the most influential blog?
   4. Cheering on the Grammar Vandal: striking a blow for proper English. Plus, yet another appeal to get rid of "Post Mortem" in business usage.
   5. On the Blog: Facebook vs. LinkedIn, Facebook vs. MySpace, and focusing social media usage
   6. On the Blog: Read alison Raymond's post on Technorati!
   7. What to do next week: social media-driven film screening for "No Reservations" at Fenway Theater in Boston, July 24.

      <media:text type="plain">Welcome to the PRobecast, Episode 24 of Topaz Partners' weekly
PR-related podcast.

Doug Haslam, Rob Capra and Sandy Kalik discuss:

   1. The &quot;Public Relations&quot; entry on Wikipedia: Is it ok if PR people contribute to it--pretty please, Mr. Wales?
   2. We discuss a new white paper, &quot;Relating to the Public; the Evolving Role of Public Relations in the Age of Social Media,&quot; by Paul Rand and Giovanni Rodriguez. We talk particularly about integrating social and traditional media, recruiting, and teach new media in PR classes.
   3. &quot;Social Media Influence&quot; index: Do we need one? Is it useful? Should we create one that shows Tech PR Gems to be the most influential blog?
   4. Cheering on the Grammar Vandal: striking a blow for proper English. Plus, yet another appeal to get rid of &quot;Post Mortem&quot; in business usage.
   5. On the Blog: Facebook vs. LinkedIn, Facebook vs. MySpace, and focusing social media usage
   6. On the Blog: Read alison Raymond's post on Technorati!
   7. What to do next week: social media-driven film screening for &quot;No Reservations&quot; at Fenway Theater in Boston, July 24.

Adam Zand, Doug Haslam and Tim Allik  discuss:

   1. Sicko: Michael Moore's new film comes with a rash of PR topics: a Blue Cross executive's memo, a Google blogger trying to drum up advertising business to combat the movie's effects, and the did leaking of the movie on the Internet prior to release have any impact on the bottom line? Also, Tim's review of the movie. 
   2. Second Life Lawsuit: the issues behind a real-life copyright infringement lawsuit filed by one Second Life user against another
   3. Shameless self-promotion. The Social Media Board Game, and an invitation to make your own version.
   4. Shameless promotion of other people's stuff: Chip Griffin's e-book, "The New Media Cocktail"
   5. Scooter Commuted: If you have bad news you want to slip by relatively unnoticed, July 3 is not a bad choice. Plus, tim brings up the Bright Side, in which he points out that Paris Hilton is a hardened ex-convict by comparison.
   6. What to do this weekend: "Life is Good" event at Fenway Park. Please let us know a better word than "good" so he can impress his 5th grade English teacher (Life is reasonably pleasant? Life is relatively unsorrowful?).

      <description><![CDATA[
In this week’s episode of PRobecast, Tim Allik and Rob Capra discuss the Apple Incorporated’s <a href=” http://www.kltv.com/Global/story.asp?S=6707498&nav=1TjD”>successful effort to build an unprecedented amount of buzz</a> over what amounts to be a new phone.  Who cares? Quite a few people, obviously. 

We also discuss a Topaz Partners Tech PR Gems blog post this week about phone calls, <a href=” http://topazpartners.blogspot.com/2007/06/cant-we-just-talk.html”>“Can we just talk??”</a>
According to Newsweek, Some bloggers are refusing to take telephone calls from reporters, insisting that all communication be through e-mail.   Is talking on the phone for business a dying art form? 

Next up: <a href=” http://ymusicblog.com/blog/2007/06/26/yahoo-music-goes-radio-silent/”>Save net radio</a>. June 26th was a “day of silence” for net radio activists, who say they can’t pay for impending higher royalty fees.   The duo concludes that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Wake up and smell the coffee, net broadcasters! 

The Bright Side winner of the week is MSNBC television newsreader Mika Brzezinski, who was afforded the opportunity to display her “journalistic integrity” this week by refusing to report a story about Paris Hilton being released from prison. Brzezenski, the daughter of  Jimmy Carter’s National Security Advisor  Zbigniew Brezinski, <a href=” http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6252290.stm”>attempted to burn her script on live television.  In a following segment, she crumpled the script. Finally, she put the script through a shredder</a>.

      <description><![CDATA[Welcome to the PRobecast, Episode 21 of Topaz Partners' weekly PR-related podcast.
This week, we record from the lovely Blue Shutters Inn facing good Harbor Beach in Gloucester, MA, with a bigger than usual gang of suspects.

Tony Sapienza, Todd Van Hoosear, Susan Koutalakis, Tim Allik, Doug Haslam and Adam Zand discuss:

   1. "Don't Be This Company." Spell check your pitches, because you never know when, say, Michael Arrington of TechCrunch might be grumpy to call you out in public.
   2. Tech publishers in trouble? What will be the impact of the consolidation of CMP properties, and the sell off of Ziff Davis' enterprise magazines?
   3. Topaz making the rounds: Tony Sapienza talks about his recent speaking engagements at BullDog and PRSA, and Todd Van Hoosear recaps the latest Social Media Club Boston event on Social Media ROI.
   4. Juvenile behavior report: Google holds a party during eBay Live, eBay retaliates by pulling advertising.
   5. Hillary Clinton chooses her campaign theme song, and the blog debate spills over into PRobecast.
   6. Things to do: Internet Radio Silence Day in protest of impending RIAA fees, and getting in line for the iPhone (plus Doug tells the worst PR joke ever).
   7. Coda: Christina Carlson feels bad for the AT&T employees who have to cancel vacations due to the iPhone launch.

Welcome to the PRobecast, Episode 20 of Topaz Partners' weekly
PR-related podcast.
This week, Doug Haslam, Rob Capra and Adam Zand discuss:

1. Liveblogging and sports: should the NCAA have expelled a
Louisville Courier-Journal reporter/blogger from an NCAA baseball
tournament?
2. The New York Islanders embrace hockey bloggers.
3. PR Measurement comes up again, courtesy of PR News. And a
preview of Katie Paine's appearance at the next Social Media Club
event in Boston.
4. Presidential Social Media (Again!): an upcoming Democratic
debate will use questions submitted via YouTube.
5. Listener-submitted question: comparing Catchpole, PRSourceCode,
and Marketing with Honors, along with Harrington Communications
6. Having your client deliver the pitch: good strategy or ceding
control?
7. We recap recent visits to Topaz from David Berlind of ZDNet and
Karen Testa of the Associated Press Boston bureau.
8. What to do this weekend: celebrate FIR's 250th episode, boo
Barry Bonds at Fenway, check out the Playboy sim in Second Life and
please tell Doug what they heck they are doing there (CC Chapman does
have some clues).

Welcome to the PRobecast, Episode 20 of Topaz Partners' weekly
PR-related podcast.
This week, Doug Haslam, Rob Capra and Adam Zand discuss:

1. Liveblogging and sports: should the NCAA have expelled a
Louisville Courier-Journal reporter/blogger from an NCAA baseball
tournament?
2. The New York Islanders embrace hockey bloggers.
3. PR Measurement comes up again, courtesy of PR News. And a
preview of Katie Paine's appearance at the next Social Media Club
event in Boston.
4. Presidential Social Media (Again!): an upcoming Democratic
debate will use questions submitted via YouTube.
5. Listener-submitted question: comparing Catchpole, PRSourceCode,
and Marketing with Honors, along with Harrington Communications
6. Having your client deliver the pitch: good strategy or ceding
control?
7. We recap recent visits to Topaz from David Berlind of ZDNet and
Karen Testa of the Associated Press Boston bureau.
8. What to do this weekend: celebrate FIR's 250th episode, boo
Barry Bonds at Fenway, check out the Playboy sim in Second Life and
please tell Doug what they heck they are doing there (CC Chapman does
have some clues).

It was quite an interesting group. Rather than the Technology PR folks we are used to in Boston, this chapter included an intersting mix of educational, goivernmental and nonprofit communicators, among other professional practitioners. 

They all share a passion for communicating, and as I am constantly discovering, know more about social media than I-- or they-- have thought]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[PRobecast #15 -- The Topaz Partners Podcast -- Second Life, 
Journalism, Fortune magazine and fights at the Boston Pops 

Adam Zand as host; Rob Capra on 12-string; Peter Gorman on stand-up 
bass with Stray Cats Strut stage moves

Topic 1 – Is Second Life still relevant after the media blitz? 
Reminder about Social Media Club Boston at Harvard Club, May 17

Three innovations in Second Life we checked out the past week:

1) www.virtualive.tv – Morpheus Media and some actual cool social 
media bands (sorry Doug) – Keep on rocking in first and Second Life 
together?

2) Virtual Thirst campaign for Coca-Cola by Crayon – Cleon Goff, a 
very cool avatar and his friends have a Coke and a Smile.

3) CNet interviews Jimmy Wales, founder, Wikipedia with dance moves at
the virtual auditorium. 

Topic 2 - Question: Why be a journalist?

Answer 1:Good news update – Harry McCracken is back at PC World (Just 
how does Sam Whitmore get such great scoops? Check out his blog) 

Answer 2: J-School outlook – Great research out of University of 
Georgia and Prof. Lee Becker gives us hope.

Topic 3 - Clip of the Week: JumpTap in Fortune with Dan Olschwang 
named Top 25 innovator.

Topic 4 – Update on Cartoon Network and light brites that shut down 
traffic
Community improvement by Cartoon Network’s haircut experts 

Topic 5 - Bright side of PR: 
No beer in some club houses of MLB but still flowing with fights at 
the Boston Pops on opening night. 

Things to do next week:
We forgot to mention that Topazer Doug Haslam and PRobecast listener 
Chip Griffin of Custom Scoop will be speaking at PRSA Yankee Chapter –
May 15. Road trip!

very cool avatar and his friends have a Coke and a Smile.&#13;

the virtual auditorium. &#13;
&#13;
Topic 2 - Question: Why be a journalist?&#13;

Answer 1:Good news update – Harry McCracken is back at PC World (Just &#13;
how does Sam Whitmore get such great scoops? Check out his blog) &#13;

This week's panel, Adam Zand, Doug Haslam and Rob Capra, discuss:

1. PR Newswire and Umbria team up to bring blog tracking to wire

Splashcast about their blogger and podcaster relations campaign to
deal with concerns arising from their new MyPodcastNetwork service

      <description><![CDATA[Welcome to the PRobecast, Episode 8 of Topaz Partners' weekly Tech PR podcast.

This week's panel, Tim Allik, Rob Capra and Doug Haslam, discuss:

    * Opening notes-- thanks to Sam Whitmore for the mention in his latest Media Survey podcast
    * Listener comment -- Bryan Person of Bryper.com and the New Comm Road podcast on Bum Rush the Charts, and does mainstream media coverage matter for an online event?
    * Listener comment 2-- Chip Griffin of Custom Scoop, Pardon the Disruption and the Disruptive Dialogue podcast on Vegas and the New Comm Forum, and his comment on RSS leads us into a new discussion of podcast listenership numbers from Edison Media Research.
    * Coldwell Banker now selling real estate in Second Life. Honest commerce or another scandalous intrusion into virtual worlds? Nevertheless, Coldwell Banker takes our weekly Bright Side award.
    * Ron Jeremy-- forget Engadget, this is the latest must-get for consumer tech PR.
    * Rob updates us on the podcast theme music challenge. Heather Green of BusinessWeek has accepted our challenge. Watch this blog for word of the start of the challenge.
    * Things to do this weekend: March 24, Shutdown Day.

      <description><![CDATA[Welcome to the PRobecast, Episode 6 ofTopaz Partners' weekly Tech PR podcast.

This week's panel, Tim Allik, Susan Koutalakis and Doug Haslam, discuss:

    * Technical note-- the Levelator is working quite well for us
    * Susan on pitching trade shows--what is the reporters' reception to pitching 6 clients at once for a trade show, as Topaz is doing for CTIA? Also, some trade show media lists are not, shall we say, accurate (hat tip to Chuck Tanowitz of Media Metamorhosis)
    * Ghostwriting blogs. Revisiting the PRSA Boston social media panel, and the subsequent online debate about PR people writing blogs for clients (Hat tip to Sterling Hager, John Cass, and our own Todd Van Hoosear; by the way, the word of the day is: "Sanctimonious")
    * Tim praisesUSA Today, which has stopped moderating comments-- plus we take an easy shot at Boston.com's "blogs."
    * Doug does Twitter redux (he found it useful after all), and a report by Adam Zand from the New Communications Forum
    * Bum Rush the Charts: scheme to put an indy band on top of the iTunes charts March 22.

      <description><![CDATA[*Pardon the multiple postings-- all technical burps have been fixed*

Welcome to the PRobecast Episode 5, Topaz Partners' weekly Tech PR
podcast.

Back to sounding good (even better!) this week, but with the same old
theme music (more on that in weeks to come)

This week's panel, Tim Allik, Rob Capra, and Doug Haslam, discuss:

* Where's Adam Zand? Among his travels in the next week, he will
be at the New Communications Forum. We look forward to his report in
one of our upcoming podcasts
* PRSA Boston-- some impressions on last Monday's session, "Social
Media: Practical Tips, Tricks, Tools and Pitfalls," where Topaz's own
Todd Van Hoosear was a panelist. A hat tip to panelist Paul Gillin's
summary of the evening, which also included panelist Todd Defren and
moderator John Cass.
* Rob discusses municipal PR; in particular, the city of New
Orleans' search for professional PR help, evolving into a discussion
of community blogging, including our own participation.
* The U.S. Army tells troops not to talk about Walter Reed Army
Medical Center expose-- Tim awards the weekly "bright side" award to
the U.S. military for their handling of the issue, because it can only
get better (with a vote for Jet Blue's own PR regression)
* Twitter; Doug expands on his post on Twitter burnout (and pulls
out the word of the day, "onomatopoetic").
* Politics and PR!(?); Hillary vs. Barack vs. David Geffen, and
John Edwards gets psyched out in Second Life.
