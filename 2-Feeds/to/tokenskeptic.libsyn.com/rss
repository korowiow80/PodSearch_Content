			<title>Token Skeptic #121 - Women, Media And Science - Interview With Ben Radford</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-119-women-media-and-science-interview-with-ben-radford]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Are women easily fooled by ideal images promoted by the media? Does reporting on science findings contribute to girls feeling social pressure to conform to beauty and gender-stereotyped expectations? Should we trust media reportage of scientific papers,&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;those that concern women?
After reading Ben Radford's articles on the Discovery website about&nbsp;a teenager protesting airbrushing in fashion magazines,&nbsp;gendered marketing in advertising&nbsp;and&nbsp;common (but mistaken) beliefs about the number of teen births, I found I had some questions on whether media and science work well together to inform the public - and just how skeptical we should be.
Benjamin Radford&nbsp;is the deputy editor of Skeptical Inquirer science magazine and a Research Fellow with the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. He's the author of hundreds of articles on a wide variety of topics including urban legends, the paranormal, critical thinking, and media literacy.

			<title>Token Skeptic #119 - On Evolution In Action With Brilliant Bioluminescence - Siouxsie Wiles</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/episode-one-hundred-and-nineteen-on-evolution-in-action-with-brilliant-bioluminescence-siouxsie-wiles]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Imagine a kickstarter for science, helping to get cool and critical projects into action? That's what&nbsp;Crowdfunding for Science,&nbsp;the SciFund Challenge is all about - supporting science and involving the public with innovative new projects.
With only nineteen days of donations left to go,&nbsp;Evolution in Action&nbsp;has a goal to investigate how diseases evolve, using bioluminescent&nbsp;bacteria in mouse poo to track its progress. It may sound quirky, but the science behind the story has world-wide ramifications when it comes to investigating&nbsp;antibiotic resistance and stopping new diseases emerging.
Evolution in Action is just one of the many projects that&nbsp;Dr Siouxsie Wiles&nbsp;is involved with - sharing her twin passions of bioluminescence (think glow worms and fireflies!) and infectious diseases to engage the public and promote scientific progress.
Dr Siouxsie Wiles&nbsp;studied medical microbiology at the University of Edinburgh, UK and did a Ph.D. in microbiology at CEH Oxford (formally the Institute of Virology and Environmental Microbiology) and Napier University, Edinburgh. She then spent her postdoctoral years at Imperial College London, developing bioluminescent derivatives of various infectious organisms.
Dr Wiles' work on Citrobacter rodentium culminated in winning the inaugural 3Rs prize from the UK National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) in 2006. She works at Auckland University, where she heads the&nbsp;Bioluminescent Superbugs Group&nbsp;in the School of Medical Sciences and can be found writing about miscellaneous science and skeptical stories at&nbsp;Infectious Thoughts on Sciblogs, the biggest blog network of scientists in New Zealand and ranting about pseudoscience on the&nbsp;Completely Unnecessary Skeptical Podcast.

			<title>Token Skeptic #118 - On The Self Illusion - Interview With Bruce Hood</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-118-on-the-self-illusion-interview-with-bruce-hood]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Most of us believe that we are an independent, coherent self&ndash;an individual inside our head who thinks, watches, wonders, dreams, and makes plans for the future. This sense of our self may seem incredibly real but a wealth of recent scientific evidence reveals that it is not what it seems &ndash; it is all an illusion.&nbsp;In&nbsp;The Self Illusion,&nbsp;Professor Bruce M Hood&nbsp;reveals how the self emerges during childhood and how the architecture of the developing brain enables us to become social animals dependent on each other.
Professor Bruce M Hood&nbsp;is the Director of the&nbsp;Bristol Cognitive Development Centre&nbsp;in the Experimental Psychology Department at the University of Bristol. He has been a research fellow at Cambridge University and University College London, a visiting scientist at MIT and a faculty professor at Harvard. He is the author of a number of books, including&nbsp;SuperSense, a popular science book on the origins of supernatural beliefs that has been published in twelve countries (as previously featured on the&nbsp;Token Skeptic #11&nbsp;and a transcript at the&nbsp;CSICOP Curiouser and Curiouser site).
Professor Hood continues to conduct research in diverse fields of human psychology specialising in the cognitive development of children. You can see his&nbsp;fantastic series of 2011 Christmas lectures at The Royal Institution site&nbsp;and&nbsp;follow his blog&nbsp;- he'll be appearing at the&nbsp;Las Vegas Amazing Meeting&nbsp;later this year!

            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-117-on-hoaxilla-the-skeptical-podcast-from-germany]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Hoaxilla - a green monster from the credulous deeps? Is it a German Skepticality, with a German-speaking Derek and Swoopy? Or a podcast about to celebrate&nbsp;its second birthday at the World Skeptics Congress?
Alexa and&nbsp;Alexander of&nbsp;Hoaxilla&nbsp;deal with modern and urban legends, media, culture and science from the skeptical perspective, without taking themselves too seriously. Past episodes include investigations into&nbsp;Titanic, Bigfoot, The Philadelphia Experiment,&nbsp;Mothman,&nbsp;chemtrails, vampires, subliminal messages and&nbsp;much more.&nbsp;Hoaxilla&nbsp;appears every Sunday at their official site at&nbsp;http://www.hoaxilla.com.&nbsp;They'll be at the&nbsp;World Skeptics Conference in Berlin, this month!

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Hoaxilla - a green monster from the credulous deeps? Is it a German Skepticality, with a German-speaking Derek and Swoopy? Or a podcast about to celebrate&nbsp;its second birthday at the World Skeptics Congress?
Alexa and&nbsp;Alexander of&nbsp;Hoaxilla&nbsp;deal with modern and urban legends, media, culture and science from the skeptical perspective, without taking themselves too seriously. Past episodes include investigations into&nbsp;Titanic, Bigfoot, The Philadelphia Experiment,&nbsp;Mothman,&nbsp;chemtrails, vampires, subliminal messages and&nbsp;much more.&nbsp;Hoaxilla&nbsp;appears every Sunday at their official site at&nbsp;http://www.hoaxilla.com.&nbsp;They'll be at the&nbsp;World Skeptics Conference in Berlin, this month!

			<title>Token Skeptic #116 - On The Hidden Ingredients Of Chinese Medicine</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-116-on-the-hidden-ingredients-of-chinese-medicine]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[From Nature News, 12th April:
Chinese herbal medicines contain ingredients derived from endangered animals, toxic plants and livestock, a genetic audit has discovered. Few of these ingredients were listed on the packaging.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s absolutely no honesty in the labelling of these products. What they declare is completely at odds with&nbsp;what&rsquo;s in there,&rdquo; says Dr Mike&nbsp;Bunce, a geneticist at Murdoch University near Perth, Australia, who led the study.
For this episode, I talk to&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Bunce&nbsp;of the Ancient DNA Research Laboratory&nbsp;about the study, what is involved with genetic auditing and what it might mean for the health and welfare of not only humans, but endangered animals. His work&nbsp;revolve around using ancient DNA to study evolutionary processes and using ancient DNA profiles to investigate past biodiversity. The research his lab are focused around using ancient DNA as a tool to profile past biodiversity and extinction events.&nbsp;

            <description><![CDATA[This episode begins with being skeptical about lipstick... and takes you around the world, interviewing the scientists and consumer rights activists who&nbsp;know the advertising claims made by cosmetics and the resulting myths about makeup!
In the USA&nbsp;-&nbsp;Perry Romanowski&nbsp;is a&nbsp;member of the&nbsp;Beauty Brains Podcast&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Chemists Corner Website,&nbsp;where he&nbsp;reviews cosmetic products and solves consumer problems. He most recently worked in the hair care innovation group at Alberto Culver, and has written and edited numerous articles and books, taught continuing education classes for industry scientists, and developed successful websites.&nbsp;His latest book is&nbsp;Beginning Cosmetic Chemistry - 3rd Edition&nbsp;published by Allured.
In UK -&nbsp;The Skeptical Beauty Blog&nbsp;is written by an anonymous beauty product addict in the UK, a scientist who loves data and has experience of working for the biggest cosmetics products producer in the world and knows all the insider secrets. That's why we can't show you her face on a podcast (or even tell you her name)!
In Australia&nbsp;-&nbsp;Christopher Zinn&nbsp;joined&nbsp;CHOICE in 2007 as media spokesman, after an international career in journalism. In 2010 he became director of campaigns and communications. His&nbsp;achievements at CHOICE include the Shonkys, which showcase the worst and the CHOICE awards, which showcase the best.

			<title>Token Skeptic #109 - On Freethinking Students - Interview With Rhys Morgan And Lyz Liddell </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-109-on-freethinking-students-interview-with-rhys-morgan-and-lyz-liddell-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[In Australia, it's the start of the University year. But is it so simple to find or start a club for your atheist / secularist / skeptical / freethinking undergraduate self ? I've taken the challenge to find out what happens if you are a student who says&nbsp;"Perhaps there is no God..."
In 2010, Rhys Morgan&nbsp;made headlines across the UK for discovering a disturbing and hazardous &ldquo;cure all&rdquo; called Miracle Medical Solution, lent his name to a libel reform claim and investigated the claims of the Burzynski clinic. On&nbsp;Rhys&rsquo; blog, he wrote:&nbsp;&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re involved in the skeptical and/or atheist community, it&rsquo;ll have been pretty hard to miss the University College London Atheist, Secularist and Humanist Society storm in which they were&nbsp;asked by their union to remove this image&nbsp;from a promotional Facebook page for their weekly pub meet&nbsp;because someone had found it offensive and complained.&rdquo;&nbsp;Since that time, Rhys has also become an advocate for speaking out about supporting student groups.
Lyz Liddell is the Director of Campus Organizing for the Secular Student Alliance, coordinating the campus organizing team to deliver the SSA&rsquo;s services and resources to affiliate groups and individual students. She leads development of new resources and helps build relationships with other organizations to promote acceptance of secular students.&nbsp;She volunteers with her local off-campus organization, the&nbsp;Humanist Community of Central Ohio, and is a member of the&nbsp;Challenge the Gap&nbsp;advisory board for&nbsp;Foundation Beyond Belief.
Many thanks also to&nbsp;Madge and Ash of the UWA Atheists and Skeptics Society&nbsp;and&nbsp;Felix Bloomfield of The&nbsp;ANU League of Extraordinary&nbsp;Atheists.

			<title>Token Skeptic #108 - On James Randi's An Honest Liar - Interview With Justin Weinstein And Tyler Measom</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-108-on-james-randi-s-an-honest-liar-interview-with-justin-weinstein-and-tyler-measom]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[A first for the Token Skeptic podcast: an interview with Justin Weinstein and Tyler Measom, who are the directors/producers of the forthcoming documentary on James Randi, called An Honest Liar.
An Honest Liar profiles the life of famed magician turned professional skeptic James "The Amazing" Randi as he embarks on a series of public crusades to expose America's beloved psychics, mentalists, preachers, and faith healers with religious fervor. Along the way, the film will show how easily our perceptions can be fooled - by magicians, con artists, and even documentaries. 
Justin Weinstein has been making documentaries for broadcast, theatrical release, or commercial clients for over 10 years. Most recently, he wrote and edited Being Elmo; A Puppeteers Journey, which premiered at Sundance in 2011 (Special Jury Prize). Prior to that, Weinstein produced science and environmental documentaries, including Face Off at Coal River Mountain for Al Jazeera English, and the feature documentary about the global coal problem Dirty Business, produced in collaboration with Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney. Earlier, Weinstein produced numerous projects for ABC News, Peter Jennings Reporting, and PBS, including Hot Politics for Frontline and the ABC News special, Last Days on Earth.
Tyler Measom is the co-director/producer of the documentary film Sons of Perdition, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, screened at over 45 festivals and was acquired by the Oprah Winfrey Network. Measom is also the producer of the feature film, TAKE, starring Minnie Driver and Jeremy Renner. He has written, produced and directed over one hundred commercials, short documentaries and industrials for a wide range of national and international clients.

			<title>Token Skeptic #107 - On The Young Atheist's Handbook - Interview With Alom Shaha</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-107-on-the-young-atheist-s-handbook-interview-with-alom-shaha]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Alom Shaha grew up in a strict Bangladeshi Muslim community in South-East London in the 1970s and 80s. He was expected to go to mosque regularly and recite passages in Arabic from the Quran, without being told what they meant. Alom spent his teenage years juggling two utterly different worlds: a chaotic, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic family life on a council estate, and that of a student at a privileged private school set amongst the idyllic green playing fields of Dulwich. In a charming blend of memoir, philosophy, and science, Alom explores the questions about faith and the afterlife that we all ponder.
The official site for the Young Atheist's Handbook is at http://alomshaha.com/yah.html.
Alom will be touring Australia at the end of February:&nbsp;Alom Shaha's "The Young Atheist's Handbook"&nbsp;tour will be heading to Perth (for the Perth Writers Festival), Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra (and possibly Sydney) - more details here.

			<title>Token Skeptic #106 - On Friends Of Science In Medicine An Interview With Dr Rob Morrison</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-106-on-friends-of-science-in-medicine-interview-with-dr-rob-morrison]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[
Here's a little something you might not know about me - I'm a student at a university that offers courses in&nbsp;alternative medicine. As a consequence, this leads me to be concerned that there's graduates from my school believing that their these courses are fully endorsed by the scientific community at large.
But if you're a student studying for qualifications in homeopathy, reflexology, naturopathy and the like - I say you should be rethinking what your college is offering you.&nbsp;More recently there's been a number of scientists and supporters of science, who have been voicing their concerns too.
As reported in the&nbsp;New York Times:&nbsp;Friends of Science in Medicine &mdash; a recently formed group that includes more than 400 prominent scientists, doctors, academics and consumer advocates from Australia and overseas &mdash; wrote to the vice chancellors of Australian universities last month. They outlined their concerns about what they called the &ldquo;diminishing of the standards applied to the teaching of science in our universities&rdquo; and &ldquo;the increased teaching of pseudoscience.&rdquo;
Dr Rob Morrison is the National Vice-President of the Australian Science Communicators, a patron of National Science Week South Australia and a&nbsp;Freelance Science writer / Broadcaster and Professorial Fellow Flinders University. He's also one of the founding members of Friends of Science in Medicine.&nbsp;The Friends of Science In Medicine&nbsp;have&nbsp;a number of documents online for you to read as to their goals&nbsp;and here's a&nbsp;list of supporters.

Here's a little something you might not know about me - I'm a student at a university that offers courses in&nbsp;alternative medicine. As a consequence, this leads me to be concerned that there's graduates from my school believing that their these courses are fully endorsed by the scientific community at large.
But if you're a student studying for qualifications in homeopathy, reflexology, naturopathy and the like - I say you should be rethinking what your college is offering you.&nbsp;More recently there's been a number of scientists and supporters of science, who have been voicing their concerns too.
As reported in the&nbsp;New York Times:&nbsp;Friends of Science in Medicine &mdash; a recently formed group that includes more than 400 prominent scientists, doctors, academics and consumer advocates from Australia and overseas &mdash; wrote to the vice chancellors of Australian universities last month. They outlined their concerns about what they called the &ldquo;diminishing of the standards applied to the teaching of science in our universities&rdquo; and &ldquo;the increased teaching of pseudoscience.&rdquo;
Dr Rob Morrison is the National Vice-President of the Australian Science Communicators, a patron of National Science Week South Australia and a&nbsp;Freelance Science writer / Broadcaster and Professorial Fellow Flinders University. He's also one of the founding members of Friends of Science in Medicine.&nbsp;The Friends of Science In Medicine&nbsp;have&nbsp;a number of documents online for you to read as to their goals&nbsp;and here's a&nbsp;list of supporters.

            <description><![CDATA[At a time when we really need our children to be gaining a good understanding of the nature of science, pseudoscience seems to be on the rise. Rather than ignore it, or lambast it in a general way, a better approach may well be to make use of the teaching opportunities that pseudoscience offers&rdquo;.
Alison Campbell&nbsp;is a&nbsp;blogger for the NZ Science Blogs&nbsp;and works at the&nbsp;University of Waikato in the science and engineering faculty.&nbsp;With many thanks to the New Zealand Skeptics, this talk featured at the 2011 Conference on the 27th August, held in&nbsp;the Rochester-Rutherford Hall in Christchurch (on the Canterbury University campus) and Gold, the Chair-Entity of the New Zealand Skeptics. Thanks also to the&nbsp;CUSP podcast, who have featured an interview with me on their show.
The 2012&nbsp;New Zealand Skeptics Convention&nbsp;will be held on&nbsp;Friday 31 August-Sunday 2 September at&nbsp;Otago University, Dunedin.

            <description><![CDATA[
I'm heading north to Europe - again!&nbsp;The Sixth&nbsp;World Skeptics Congress, May 18-20, 2012 in Berlin, Germany!&nbsp;
Episode One Hundred and Four features an interview with the renown German skeptic Armadeo Sarma, who is the&nbsp;the founder and Chairman of the German Society for the Scientific Investigation of Para-Sciences (GWUP), Chairman of the European Council of Skeptical Organisations (ECSO) and Fellow and Executive Council member of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. He has written, lectured and debated on dowsing, methods of investigation, the Shroud of Turin, homeopathy and the goals of skeptical organisations.
The Sixth World Skeptics Congress&nbsp;will be an intellectually stimulating three-day event, dealing with claims ranging from the paranormal and supernatural, to fringe science issues and scams. Major topics at this event will be science and pseudoscience in education, addressing in particular anti-evolution claims and origin myths, and the problems of risk and benefit assessment, addressing alternative medicine.

            <description><![CDATA[

Veritasium -&nbsp;An element of truth - the science video blog from atoms to astrophysics.
Veritasium&nbsp;is a science video blog which aims to present topics in all areas of science from the simplest to the most complex. The goal is to make scientific ideas clear, accessible, and interesting.&nbsp;This is an interview with&nbsp;Derek Muller, including&nbsp;the methodology behind Veritasium and why he thinks Khan Academy videos might not work as well as you might think.
Included in this episode are sound-bites from the&nbsp;"Supersized-Slo-Mo Slinky Drop", the "What Is Chemistry?" and "Why Does The Earth Spin?"&nbsp;videos.
Mentioned at the start of the show:&nbsp;The 2012 Australian Science Communicators National Conference - 27th-29th February.

			<title>Token Skeptic #102 - On Skeptical Science With The Debunking Handbook And NCSE</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-104-on-skeptical-science-with-the-debunking-handbook-and-ncse]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[
Just when you thought skeptical podcasts&nbsp;weren't saying enough about climate change denialism this week!
Stephan Lewandowsky&nbsp;is a Winthrop Professor and an Australian Professorial Fellow at the University of Western Australia. He is the co-author of the&nbsp;The Debunking Handbook: now freely available for download&nbsp;at the&nbsp;Skeptical Science website.&nbsp;The Debunking Handbook is a guide to debunking misinformation - although there is a great deal of psychological research on misinformation, there&rsquo;s no summary of the literature that offers practical guidelines on the most effective ways of reducing the influence of myths. The Debunking Handbook boils the research down&nbsp;into a short, simple summary, intended as a guide for communicators in all areas (not just climate) who encounter misinformation.
Josh Rosenau&nbsp;has been a Public Information Project Director at NCSE since 2007. He pursued a doctorate at the University of Kansas, studying the ways ecological competition shapes the ecological niche and geographical ranges of species. When creationists on the Kansas board of education sought to undermine evolution education in 2005, Josh worked with grassroots groups and the media to improve public understanding of the issues, and to defend honest and accurate science education. He blogs at&nbsp;Thoughts From Kansas at ScienceBlogs.com.&nbsp;Check out the NCSE's&nbsp;new climate change website section, and consider&nbsp;joining NCSE.

            <description><![CDATA[
The one-hundredth episode.
Contained within this show are segments from a talk I did for the New Zealand Skeptics, called "Token Skepticism - Adventures in Skeptical Podcasting", recorded at the New Zealand Skeptics Convention in August, 2011. It also contains clips from the second "half" of the last one-hundred episodes.
Song segments used within this show are all by&nbsp;Marian Call:
Good Morning Moon; Dear Mr Darcy; The Avocado Song; Ina Flew The Coop; The Underground (One Bird At A Time); Early Is As Early Does; Temporal Dominoes;&nbsp;Coffee by Numbers (Faon's Song).&nbsp;All of these are available on the album&nbsp;Something Fierce.
Thank you to all of the listeners and I mean that: I'm one of the least-known and least-talked-about skeptical podcasters out there and you do make a difference. Future suggestions as to content always welcome, just drop me a line.
Special thanks to Gold of the New Zealand Skeptics and all of the NZ Skeptics; everyone who has graciously granted their time to be interviewed or allowed audio to be used on the show.

			<title>Token Skeptic #99 - On Token Skeptic Live: Dr Steve Novella, Barbara Drescher And Derek Colanduno  </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/episode-ninety-nine-on-token-skeptic-live-dr-steve-novella-barbara-drescher-and-derek-colanduno-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[
Generally about gaming. Mostly very silly.&nbsp;Interrupted&nbsp;by a fire-alarm before I get to ask any more questions, because that&rsquo;s just how I roll. Please note: at certain points the audience were tortured by being fed Australian food and I physically attack Derek for not turning his phone off.
This episode is brought to you with tremendous admiration and genuine, sincere thanks to&nbsp;Derek Colanduno of Skepticality.com&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mark Ditzler at Abrupt Media. Recorded at Dragon*Con 2011.
Dr Steve Novella&nbsp;apparently has a site and some kind of semblance of a podcast, but I guess you know that.&nbsp;Barbara Drescher is the bomb.&nbsp;Derek&nbsp;really should learn not to have an operating phone anywhere near me. Thank you all for being a part of the journey - and more thanks than ever to the Dragon*Con SkepTrack, which has to be the best ever experience in terms of a convention that I've ever had.

"While some skeptics have been having conniptions about the film, others have wondered what the big deal is.&nbsp;After all, it&rsquo;s just a movie. Of course, so was Oliver Stone&rsquo;s&nbsp;JFK, but like&nbsp;Anonymous, it was also propaganda for a genuine conspiracy theory.&nbsp;Anonymous&nbsp;features several prominent Shakespeare denialists, like Derek Jacobi and Mark Rylance, who will no doubt use the film&rsquo;s release to promote their conspiracy theories, and since they sound more intelligent and less crazy than other conspiracists, like 9/11 truther Charlie Sheen, people will perhaps pay attention to them. After all, they&rsquo;re Just Asking Questions..."&nbsp;-&nbsp;Skeptical Humanities,&nbsp;Shakespeare Denialism: The Roland Emmerich Study&nbsp;Guide

			<title>Token Skeptic Special Episode - Stop The AVN Fly-By At Woodford Folk Festival</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-special-episode-stop-the-avn-fly-by-at-woodford-folk-festival]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[
An exclusive interview with four members of the Stop the Australian Vaccination Network (Stop the AVN on Facebook)&nbsp;on the&nbsp;day of the protest at the Woodford Folk Festival -&nbsp;Jason Brown,&nbsp;Dave The Happy Singer, Daniel Raffaele and Robin Hilliard.
Operation Nutcracker Media Release.

While unhappy that Ms Dorey will still be speaking at Woodford, the Stop the AVN Facebook group, a loose-knit consortium of concerned citizens, scientists, &nbsp;doctors and nurses, decided to use a little humour in order to have &lsquo;the last word&rsquo;.
The group has hired an aircraft to fly over the Woodford Folk Festival site during the two hours surrounding Ms Dorey&rsquo;s appearance.&nbsp;Between 1.45 and 3.45pm on Thursday, 29 December, the plane will tow a banner with the message: VACCINATION SAVES LIVES.&nbsp;Volunteers will be on the ground to hand out flyers after Ms Dorey&rsquo;s appearance in the Blue Lotus tent at 2.15pm. The flyer addresses some of the myths about vaccination and counters them with facts.

Mentioned during the show:
Article in MamaMia on Woodford Folk Festival Protest
The HCC ruling against the AVN - Wings Over Woodford
Thanks to Skeptimite for the on-the-scene at Woodford photos.

            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-96-on-critical-thinking-and-santa-again-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[
Recently Matt Lowry wrote a blog-post on&nbsp;Using Mythology as a Critical Thinking Tool: The Lesson of Santa for&nbsp;Kids&nbsp;- just as Tim Minchin wrote a piece for the&nbsp;New Statesman&nbsp;about&nbsp;his own efforts to balance a pro-naturalistic worldview&nbsp;and&nbsp;living a life unencumbered by superstition, while raising kids and encouraging a love of fiction.
Matt Lowry is best known as the Skeptical Teacher&nbsp;-&nbsp;a high school physics teacher, plus a part-time physics and astronomy college professor, contributor to the James Randi Educational Foundation Education Advisory Group and awesome presenter for kids&rsquo; shows at Dragon*Con.
For this interview we talk about all of these things (and whether Santa might actually be a Time Lord with a sleigh made out of&nbsp;quantum-something-or-other).&nbsp;During the discussion, we also talk about Barbara Drescher's blog-post at the JREF Swift:&nbsp;An Argument for Santa, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and (gasp!) Even Jesus.&nbsp;Here's another great link to the Physics of Santa!

			<title>Token Skeptic #95 - On Skeptical Women Online Julia Lavarnway, Susan Gerbic and Desiree Schell</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-95-on-skeptical-women-online-julia-lavarnway-susan-gerbic-and-desiree-schell]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[As the number of people who choose to become involved with skeptical outreach and pro-science&nbsp;initiatives increases, so&nbsp;do the&nbsp;ways&nbsp;they choose to contribute - and these can greatly vary.&nbsp;Traditional print media, blogging, editing Wikipedia, producing national radio shows and popular podcasts all play a part -&nbsp;and for this episode of the Token Skeptic, these people&nbsp;all just happen to be women.
If it&rsquo;s true that role models and mentorship is a vital part of encouraging women to participate, then let&rsquo;s look at some examples that exist out there on the internet.
Julia Lavarnway&nbsp;is the managing editor of the&nbsp;Skeptical Inquirer&nbsp;and the &ldquo;News and Views&rdquo; columnist for&nbsp;Free Inquiry&lsquo;s quarterly newsletter,&nbsp;Secular Humanist Bulletin. She started&nbsp;We Are SkeptiXX&nbsp;out of her&nbsp;frustration and dismay over the lack of support for and recognition of women in many organizations in the formal skeptics movement.
Susan Gerbic&nbsp;is a professional portrait photographer living in Salinas, California, an attendee of a number of skeptical conferences world wide, who presented at TAM9 in 2011. She's an editor of Wikipedia, updating articles with a skeptical theme, and adds pictures from her vast collection of photos. Her website, which guides and mentors fellow skeptics into contributing to Wikipedia, can be found at&nbsp;Guerilla Skepticism on Wikipedia.
Desiree Schell&nbsp;is the host of the live Canadian call-in radio talk show and podcast&nbsp;Skeptically Speaking. Desiree explores the connections between science and skepticism, and strategies for promoting critical thinking beyond the ranks of current skeptics.&nbsp;In her work as a labour organizer, Desiree creates curricula and teaches courses on effective activism.&nbsp;Skeptically Speaking&nbsp;records&nbsp;interviews live every Sunday night at 6 pm MST&nbsp;and is rebroadcast by several radio stations in Canada and the United States. The show is also available as an MP3 download on the website and&nbsp;iTunes.&nbsp;She has presented at a number of conferences, including Dragon*Con and Amazing Meetings.

			<title>Token Skeptic #91 - On Stanislaw Burszynski, Streisand Effects And Standing Up For Skeptical Bloggers - Andy Lewis of Quackometer</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-91-episode-ninety-one-on-stanislaw-burszynski-streisand-effects-and-standing-up-for-skeptical-bloggers-andy-lewis-of-quackometer]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The UK Observer on Sunday 20th November 2011, published a moving article about a four-year old girl, Billie Banbridge, and an effort to raise money to seek treatment for her inoperable brain tumor. Despite the noble goal and heartwarming effort, featuring the contributions of a number of celebrities like the band Radiohead and Cheryl Cole, the treatment being sought was at Stanislaw Burszynski clinic in Texas.
A number of bloggers, who have been keeping track of the claims of this clinic over several years, voiced their concern that patients like Billie and their families were risking time and money, as well as putting their health in danger. The first blogger to report a threat from an employee of clinic itself was&nbsp;Andy Lewis of Quackometer, who has been lending support to fellow bloggers and maintaining a vigilant approach to communicating the facts under significant pressure to be silenced.
References made during the show:
Josephine Jones&rsquo;s blog
Rhys Morgan&rsquo;s website
True to Andy Lewis&rsquo; words,&nbsp;on Tuesday, 29th November, The Guardian newspaper reported on Rhys Morgan&rsquo;s posting&nbsp;of the entire correspondence from Marc Stephens on his blog. The Burszynski clinic has revealed that Stephens was only a web marketing contractor and that &lsquo;no one approved [Stephens] sending pictures of Morgan&rsquo;s house to him&rsquo;. At time of podcasting this episode, more and more bloggers are continuing to question claims by the Burszynski clinic.

But even women who don&rsquo;t put their pictures or real names online are subject to virtual harassment. A recent study showed that when the&nbsp;gender of an online username appears female, they are 25 times more likely to experience harassment. The study, conducted by the University of Maryland, found that female user-names averaged 163 threatening and/or sexually explicit messages a day.&nbsp;The Guardian, 2007.
This is a follow-up to the earlier podcast episode&nbsp;(which featured on the CSICOP website), called&nbsp;'Codes of Conduct'.&nbsp;Features interviews with:
Jennifer Ouellette&nbsp;-&nbsp;Jennifer is the author of three popular science books, specialises in physics and many related topics, with particular emphasis on how science intersects with popular culture, as well as science communication and outreach. She is also a prolific blogger, writing regularly for&nbsp;Discovery Newsand maintaining a blog at&nbsp;Scientific American&nbsp;called&nbsp;Cocktail Party Physics. We discuss her article 'Is It Cold In Here'.
Karen Miller&nbsp;of the More Women In Skepticism Blog (www.morewomeninskepticism.wordpress.com)
Viv&nbsp;Smythe -&nbsp;Australian writer, webwrangler, blogger - creator of&nbsp;Hoydens About Town&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Finally A Feminism 101 Blog(www.finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com)
Since writing&nbsp;Civility, Inclusivity, Sexism and Skepticism, I&rsquo;ve received a number of emails about the issues raised and I was even approached several times in person at the SkepTrackDragon*Con about it. The case of Karen Stollznow and her experiences with the Australian Skeptics, the James Randi Educational Foundation&rsquo;s &lsquo;Code Of Conduct&rsquo; at the Amazing Meeting 9, and the history (or &lsquo;herstory&rsquo;?) of women within the skeptical movement were of particular interest to many, and I&rsquo;m glad to say that I&rsquo;ve been encouraged to continue writing and podcasting on this and related topics.
Many, many thanks to additional voices of:&nbsp;Michael Marshall and Hayley Stevens of the&nbsp;Righteous Indignation Podcast.&nbsp;KO Myers of the&nbsp;Skeptically Speaking Podcast.&nbsp;Milton Mermikides, whose&nbsp;work you can buy yourself from The Theme Attic: 'Spyder (The Lady Geek Spy Theme)' and 'Skeleton Key (Theme from TAMLondon)'.

But even women who don&rsquo;t put their pictures or real names online are subject to virtual harassment. A recent study showed that when the&nbsp;gender of an online username appears female, they are 25 times more likely to experience harassment. The study, conducted by the University of Maryland, found that female user-names averaged 163 threatening and/or sexually explicit messages a day.&nbsp;The Guardian, 2007.

			<title>Token Skeptic #85 - On Something Fierce - Interview With Marian Call</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/episode-85-on-something-fierce-interview-with-marian-call]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[&ldquo;The music is a little silly but mostly very sincere and honest, mostly acoustic, occasionally symphonic, eclectic, rhythmic and warm with a&nbsp;side of whimsy.&rdquo;
Singer-songwriter Marian Call&nbsp;has just finished her &ldquo;49&gt;50 Tour&rdquo;, which went all around the US (and most of the provinces of Canada). She lives in Anchorage, Alaska but has a huge following around the world for her complex harmonies and witty lyrics, which include references to Firefly, Battlestar Galactica and being a geek (even if it&rsquo;s not going to always be chic).
Something Fierce&nbsp;and it&nbsp;is a fan-funded album&nbsp;as well as being a&nbsp;double album &ndash; volume I is called &lsquo;Good Luck With That&rsquo; and volume II is called &lsquo;From Alaska.&rsquo; For this interview we discuss her music, how fabulous her fans are &ndash; and just how many instruments does she play (besides the typewriter)?
The songs used in this episode - "The Nerd Anthem (I'll Still Be A Geek After Nobody Thinks It's Chic)", "Dear Mr Darcy", "Temporal Dominos", "It's Good To Have Jayne On Your Side", "Perilous Road", "Good Morning Moon" and "Vanilla (I'm Not Sexy)".&nbsp;

			<title>Token Skeptic #82 - On Forty Days Of Treats - Interview With Liz Lutgendorff</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-82-on-forty-days-of-treats-interview-with-liz-lutgendorff]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA["We need to show support in some way, but also not directly confront these people, because a lot of the time it's just completely pointless. Combative is not the way we wanted to go about this. We thought this was a good-will campaign that everyone could get involved with."
In response to the anti-abortion &ldquo;40 Days for Life&rdquo; campaign, which organises protests outside abortion clinics, Carmen D'Cruz and Liz Lutgendorff&nbsp;started a counter-campaign called&nbsp;40 Days of Treats. &nbsp;The idea behind 40 Days of Treats is to show support for the staff of the British&nbsp;Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), whose offices are currently being targeted by the&nbsp;40 Days for Life protesters.&nbsp;As the 40 Days of Treats website explains: &ldquo;A counter protest for 40 days doesn&rsquo;t seem right - why draw attention to them? Instead, let's do something for the people who are probably most affected and could use the boost.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s give the nice people at BPAS 40 days of treats."&nbsp;
For more background on the UK politician Nadine Dorries and her views on abortion,&nbsp;see this link&nbsp;and&nbsp;this link:&nbsp;[Dorries] bid to outlaw institutions with a "financial interest" in carrying out abortions providing such advice was roundly rejected in a Commons vote after a rowdy debate.&nbsp;Labour&nbsp;dismissed her argument&nbsp;as a "shoddy, ill-conceived attempt to promote non-facts to make a non-case" and some of Ms Dorries' Conservative colleagues&nbsp;took issue with the evidence she cited.

The Guardian article referenced in the interview is&nbsp;featured here:&nbsp;Cakes and the right to choose&nbsp;by&nbsp;Homa Khaleeli.

			<title>Token Skeptic #80 - On Paranormal Belief In Queensland - The Truth Told By Dr Martin Bridgstock</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-80-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Recorded at the New Zealand Skeptic Convention in Christchurch, 27th August 2011.
QEDCon! More information available at http://qedcon.org.
Until recently, Queensland was regarded as the hillbilly state of Australia. It was dominated by fundamentalism and flirted with bogus cancer cures and creation science. After determined action by skeptics, and some major political convulsions, the state has changed completely. Still, the question remains: how much of the early sentiments remain in Queensland today? 
In this presentation Martin Bridgstock tells of how he and Kylie Sturgess surveyed a representative sample of over 1200 Queenslanders, to investigate their paranormal and related beliefs. The results are quite startling, and give a comprehensive picture of exactly what Queenslanders believe.
Dr Martin Bridgstock's book, Beyond Belief: Skepticism, Science and the Paranormal is available through Cambridge University Press.
Many, many thanks to Gold, Vicki Hyde, the New Zealand Skeptics, the fantastic people I met at the conference and (of course) the ever-wonderful Dr Martin Bridgstock.

            <description><![CDATA[Apologies for the delay due to jetlag, travel and settling in back home... before getting back into podcasting again! Here's an interview about a great new online resource for young skeptics!&nbsp;To help kids to grow into intelligent, critically thinking adults, Robert Todd Carroll, author of the fabulous Skeptic&rsquo;s Dictionary, has written just the thing: The Skeptic&rsquo;s Dictionary for Kids.
We talk about the origins of the site and how he first began this extensive online resource; his work as a teacher of critical thinking and the future of scientific skepticism, particularly the ongoing (and much needed) discussions on just what makes skepticism 'skepticism'.
The Skeptic's Dictionary For Kids is featured at&nbsp;http://sd4kids.skepdic.com.
The Skeptic's Dictionary&nbsp;was published in August 2003 by John Wiley &amp; Sons.&nbsp;The Skeptic's Dictionary online (for all ages!) is at&nbsp;http://www.skepdic.com.&nbsp;

            <description><![CDATA[I'm back... and this is a little double-interview (for the price of one!) with two wonderful people: Jack Scanlan of the Young Australian Skeptics and Sara Mayhew of and 'Legend of the Ztarr' fame!
They are both first-time&nbsp;Amaz!ng Meeting attendees&nbsp;(Sara presented on the main stage!) and prime examples of new blood in the skepti-sphere.&nbsp;They are popular bloggers, as well as sharing similar artistic interests - Jack as a musician and Sara as a mangaka artist.&nbsp;For this episode we talk about their experiences at the Amaz!ng Meeting 9, their views on organised skepticism and what projects they have planned in the future.
You can check out their work here:
Jack Scanlan - Naontiotami Blog / Young Australian Skeptics 
Sara Mayhew - There Are Four Lights / Legend of the Ztarr
In addition, Sara Mayhew will be appearing at Dragon*Con at the end of August - if you're going, her main&nbsp;presentation on the SkepticTrack is scheduled for Sunday, 11.30am.

			<title>Token Skeptic #75 - On Codes Of Conduct: A Brief History of Civility, Inclusivity, Sexism and Skepticism</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-75-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Firstly, a three minute message about WHAT. HAS. BEEN. GOING. ON. and why an episode was delayed for a MONTH. Truly sorry, but unexpected circumstances.
Then what? An audio version of an essay that I've written for CSICOP's&nbsp;Curiouser and Curiouser&nbsp;about skepticism, sexism, diversity and all the things you might roll your eyes about - but may not have realised that it's been a concern for a very long time. So, it's going to continue that way unless we work on it even more. Enjoy!&nbsp;
Many thanks to Dr Karen Stollznow, Michael McRae, Desiree Schell, Barbara Drescher and The Digital Cuttlefish for advice, suggestions and guidance while writing this piece.
The written version of this podcast will be appearing on the&nbsp;CSICOP website&nbsp;- but the quotes and references I make (and in some cases directly read out) are as follows:

The Code of Conduct for the Amazing Meeting:&nbsp;With TAM Right Around the Corner, Some Important Announcements&nbsp;- for JREF's TAM9
Dr Karen Stollznow's leaving of the Australian Skeptics:&nbsp;Sceptic's Fight Defies Belief
The 1997 &lsquo;CSICOP&rsquo;s Rational Feminist Alliance&rsquo;
Sara Mayhew's blogpost 'Some Practical Thoughts: Women in Skepticism'

			<title>Token Skeptic #74 - On Seeking The Evidence And Reporting A Rort - Interview With Bayani Mills</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-72-on-interview-with-bayani-mills]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Welcome to episode #73! People can turn to the internet to quickly get information about claims and consumer rights, particularly regarding their health. But where do you go when reporting a dodgy claim or seeking advice about getting your money back? Bayani Mills is a recent addition to skeptical activism in Australia; he only got started at the end of 2010!
In 2011 Bayani created Report a Rort, which focuses on consumer action and bringing information to the public on making effective complaints. This includes how to best contact relevant government watchdogs like the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission, on pseudo-scientific health claims. He's also incorporated a brilliant new plug-in for Google Chrome that was created by Simon Perry in the UK and adapted for Australians and other countries - called FishBarrel.&nbsp;
In addition to this, he's the creator of another new site called&nbsp;Seek The Evidence&nbsp;- a much-needed reource dedicated to promoting rationality and logical reasoning in the public arena through local activism. It has already started gathering materials like models for flyers, posters and handouts for activists and hopes to have a global reach as well as relevance for Australians.
Bayani's website can be found at&nbsp;http://www.bayanimills.com.au.&nbsp;The site for Report a Rort is http://reportarort.wordpress.com - the site for Seek The Evidence is www.seektheevidence.org.

			<title>Token Skeptic #73 - On The Nightingale Collaboration - Interview With Alan Henness</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-73-on-the-nightingale-collaboration-interview-with-alan-henness]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[With many thanks to the organisers of QEDCon - an interview with Alan Henness and the Nightingale Collaboration presentation!
QEDCon was a two-day science and skepticism conference which took place in the Manchester Piccadilly hotel from February 5-6 2011. Keep track of their future events by checking out the Greater Manchester Skeptics Society and the Merseyside Skeptics Society.
In addition - happy wedding day to Allan Callister (@acallister) and Janis Bennion (@janisbennion)! 
The Nightingale Collaboration has been highly influential with its efforts in the UK and inspires other countries to try similar strategies. They suggest that supporters &lsquo;focus complaints on one area of healthcare each month, as this will mean they can focus their research and adjudication process.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[With many thanks to the organisers of QEDCon - an interview with Alan Henness and the Nightingale Collaboration presentation!
QEDCon was a two-day science and skepticism conference which took place in the Manchester Piccadilly hotel from February 5-6 2011. Keep track of their future events by checking out the Greater Manchester Skeptics Society and the Merseyside Skeptics Society.
In addition - happy wedding day to Allan Callister (@acallister) and Janis Bennion (@janisbennion)! 
The Nightingale Collaboration has been highly influential with its efforts in the UK and inspires other countries to try similar strategies. They suggest that supporters &lsquo;focus complaints on one area of healthcare each month, as this will mean they can focus their research and adjudication process. Hopefully, this will enable the ASA to deal with complaints more quickly and effectively.&rsquo; This is done via the site, on Focus of the Month. You can also check out Simon Perry&rsquo;s useful guide to submitting a complaint to the ASA &ndash; A Step By Step ASA Complaint.

            <description><![CDATA[Tremendous thanks to both&nbsp;Simon Taylor&nbsp;for helping me secure this interview and&nbsp;Belinda Nicholson (who appeared in the 365 Days of Astronomy episode 'The Stars Are Her Laboratory&rsquo;&nbsp;for lending me the astrophysics tea-room at the University of Melbourne to record it!&nbsp;Please note -&nbsp;Simon has a GREAT new project, a skeptically-funny comic series called 'Flim Flam'&nbsp;- send in your support by sending in your pledge to get it happening.
Lawrence Leung&nbsp;is an Australian comedian, writer and director from Melbourne, Victoria. He is best known for his television series&nbsp;Lawrence Leung's Choose Your Own Adventure.&nbsp;If the truth is out there... then let's look at the evidence!&nbsp;This is Lawrence Leung's 'Unbelievable'.
He has performed in shows in London's&nbsp;West End, at the&nbsp;Edinburgh Fringe&nbsp;festival, and around Australia extensively. This interview investigates the origins of the show, his history as a questioning comedian regarding interesting paranormal claims and what exactly was he up to when he was at Melbourne University (that you won't find on Wikipedia)??&nbsp;
Special guest stars during this interview - occasional astrophysics students looking for a cup of tea.

            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-in-southwark-and-shakespeare-s-globe]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[A short film from the early morning after QEDCon in London, February. This is one of my favorite parts of the city - listening to the bells at St Paul's Cathedral, walking across the Millennium Bridge and then down the Bankside Jetty to visit Shakespeare's Globe.
Here you can see the wrought-iron gates, called the Bankside Gates. Each emblem is inspired by insects, animals and characters from Shakespeare's plays and were created by the best blacksmiths from around the world.
A key to the emblems is featured here:&nbsp;Key To Motifs On Southwark Gates.
Finally - the paving stones around the Globe list sponsors features a joke by two members of the Monty Python's Flying Circus, John Cleese and Michael Palin. Apparently,&nbsp;John Cleese&nbsp;paid for both his and&nbsp;Michael Palin&lsquo;s pavers, on the condition that Michael Palin&rsquo;s name was spelt incorrectly.&nbsp;]]></description>

			<title>Token Skeptic #66 - Interview With Sean Williams And SciFi Meets Education</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-66-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[SwanCon is a science fiction convention held in Perth, Western Australia. It is Australia's longest running science fiction convention, and probably the longest running in the southern hemisphere. Questions about the relevance of Science Fiction and Fantasy to education is not unheard of - there's a great number of discussions going on all the time about what is suitable and what helps promote a greater understanding of both fact and fiction. As a life-long fan of Star Trek, Doctor Who, Star Wars, films with special effects and everything that will guarantee a good read - this educator is not alone when it comes to supporting the sometimes-maligned genres of Science Fiction and Fantasy!
This is the second time that SwanCon has featured on the Token Skeptic podcast; last year I interviewed Scott Sigler (Episode #14 - On Science Fiction and Skepticism: Interview With Scott Sigler). This year I interviewed Sean Williams - he's a number one New York Times bestselling author of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed and has published thirty novels for readers of all ages, seventy short stories across numerous genres and the odd poem. In addition to that interview, you'll be hearing from Bevan McGuinness, a teacher of upper-school Science at Wesley College in Perth, who presented on 'Mad Scientists: Using The Science In Science Fiction In The Classroom' with Peter Van DerKwast of Kolbe Catholic College. I also spoke to the Track Director of the SwanCon Edustream, librarian Tahani Wesley.

			<title>Token Skeptic #65 - On Starsuckers And Taking Liberties - QEDCon Lecture By Chris Atkins</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-65-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[With many, many thanks to the organisers of QEDCon - here's a special episode from the convention that has to be heard to be believed.
Chris Atkins is the director of both BAFTA nominated Taking Liberties and the 2009 tour-de-force Starsuckers. The documentary Starsuckers involved the production team planting fake celebrity-related stories in the UK media, such as a claim that the singer Avril Lavigne had fallen asleep in a nightclub and how a variety of&nbsp;tabloid newspapers accepted the stories without corroboration or evidence.
He's a clear voice in accessibly exposing how the public are manipulated through the real-world motivations of the media in creating and perpetuating news and celebrity. As the perpetrator of the recent 'Urban Fox Hunter' hoax, Chris demonstrated the ease by which the national and international media can be fooled.

			<title>Token Skeptic #64 - On Tribal Science – Interview With Michael McRae</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-64-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Thanks to everyone who has continued to subscribe and check out the show during the technical-issues hiatus! Here's to getting more content out and I'm looking forward to your continued feedback. :)
Science is a tribal endeavor. It&rsquo;s a social behavior humans engage in, one that is based on shared values of logic, reason, empiricism and the right to debate the merits of belief.
What are the ideals of the science methodology and what is the reality of how people actually use (or don&rsquo;t use) their brains? 
Michael McRae is an Australian science writer working for the CSIRO&rsquo;s education department. He graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science from QUT and followed this with several years as a medical scientist working for a Queensland pathology laboratory. With a Bachelor of Education in science and mathematics, Michael taught in Brisbane and then London. In 2006 he earned a Diploma of Science Communication via the joint ANU/Questacon &lsquo;Science Circus&rsquo; program, and he is currently reading for his Masters in Culture, Health and Medicine at ANU.
In addition to all of that, he&rsquo;s presented public talks on science history and philosophy, optical illusions, skepticism, communication and the nature of epistemology. He&rsquo;s appeared twice before on the Token Skeptic podcast and his first book, &lsquo;Tribal Science &ndash; Brains, Beliefs and Bad Ideas&lsquo; is due for release in early 2011 through University Of Queensland Press.
The site for Michael's blog is www.tribalscience.wordpress.com.

			<title>Token Skeptic #63 - On Reaching Out Reasonably - Panel From QEDCon</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-63-on-reaching-out-reasonably-panel-from-qed-con]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Last week to give feedback via the Token Skeptic survey - merchandise from the podcast coming soon (!!!) and check me out being interviewed for the Skeptical Experience Radio Show - http://skepticalexperience.com, Episode 8 with Richard Godbehere!
Many, many thanks to the organisers of QEDCon who have allowed me to play the audio from this panel.
Moderated by Janis Bennion of the Greater Manchester Skeptics and featuring Eugenie Scott of the National Center for Science Education, Sile Lane from Sense About Science, David Kirby, Senior Lecturer in Science Communication             Studies from the University of Manchester and Kylie Sturgess.
What is skeptical outreach, and how does it differ to scientific outreach? Is there any benefit to skeptical events whose focus is socialising? How much does a podcast count as outreach, and does it need to be? Should you or should you 'not be a dick'? And ultimately; does true skepticism require true grit?
Within the skeptical community, especially within the UK, there has been a huge amount of discussion focused around how, why and when to do skeptical outreach in the best way.

Transcription of the interview breakdown of the George Hrab album 'Trebuchet' features on Milton Mermikide's site -&nbsp;Trebuchet: The Interview - Geo and Milt Geek Out.&nbsp;Subscribe to Milton's&nbsp;Posterous.com blog for more of his work.


The&nbsp;Perth Atheists are planning a meetup for this Sunday, 27th March at 7.30pm to watch the live broadcast of the Sydney show together at the High Wycombe Tavern in High Wycombe.&nbsp;Details are on the Perth Atheists Meeetup.com site.

For an additional episode this week for the Token Skeptic podcast - &nbsp;this show features two-interviews in one!
David Tyler, a member of the Launceston Skeptics on their stall at the Body and Soul Festival in Tasmania, and Jason Brown on the forthcoming Australian SkeptiCamp - the very first, called Sydney SkeptiCamp.
David Tyler, a member of the Launceston Skeptics, tells us about a successful stall to promote&nbsp;Science and&nbsp;Rational Thinking at the recent Body and Soul Festival. It's something they called an "Island of Reason in a Sea of Rainbows and Unicorns".
Their hope was to get attendees to have a chat and perhaps take away some of the material they put together. They&nbsp;designed a special webpage to mark their attendance (bodynsoulfestival.launcestonskeptics.com) which has links to free resources that promote&nbsp;Science and&nbsp;Rational Thinking.&nbsp;
Secondly - Jason Brown, the creator of The Skepticator.com website and member of the&nbsp;Sydney Atheists, is starting the very first Australian SkeptiCamp in Sydney! It will be called Sydney SkeptiCamp and he discusses the origins, ideas and planning of the event.  Head to Jason's site at http://www.mycolleaguesareidiots.com or Tweetstream at http://twitter.com/drunkenmadman.

For an additional episode this week for the Token Skeptic podcast - &nbsp;this show features two-interviews in one!
David Tyler, a member of the Launceston Skeptics on their stall at the Body and Soul Festival in Tasmania, and Jason Brown on the forthcoming Australian SkeptiCamp - the very first, called Sydney SkeptiCamp.
David Tyler, a member of the Launceston Skeptics, tells us about a successful stall to promote&nbsp;Science and&nbsp;Rational Thinking at the recent Body and Soul Festival. It's something they called an "Island of Reason in a Sea of Rainbows and Unicorns".
Their hope was to get attendees to have a chat and perhaps take away some of the material they put together. They&nbsp;designed a special webpage to mark their attendance (bodynsoulfestival.launcestonskeptics.com) which has links to free resources that promote&nbsp;Science and&nbsp;Rational Thinking.&nbsp;
Secondly - Jason Brown, the creator of The Skepticator.com website and member of the&nbsp;Sydney Atheists, is starting the very first Australian SkeptiCamp in Sydney! It will be called Sydney SkeptiCamp and he discusses the origins, ideas and planning of the event.  Head to Jason's site at http://www.mycolleaguesareidiots.com or Tweetstream at http://twitter.com/drunkenmadman.

            <description><![CDATA[This is what happens when you try to put as many episodes in before Garage Band crashes. There's plenty more that I love - like Embiggen Books, the interviews and panels - go check them out!
What does feminine intuition really mean? Why do we believe in weird things? How do you become an effective activist for science and reason? What is critical thinking and what can we do to encourage it more in education? This is the Token Skeptic podcast &ndash; a weekly look at the latest ideas, issues and the people on the cutting edge of all those questions. As the Token Skeptic, I even question how much progress is being made with science communication, skepticism and learning.
If you enjoy hearing interviews with popular figures in science and skepticism? If you&rsquo;re keen to hear from fellow educators and be enthused about encouraging critical thinking in the classroom and beyond? If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about how we communicate and understand science and the challenges we all face? Then I hope that you&rsquo;ll join me in my journey to learn how to improve my own skills as a communicator.  
Thanks for joining me for this 'best of collection' &ndash; if this is the first time you&rsquo;ve listened to the show, you can keep track of all the episodes at www.tokenskeptic.org. 
This show is available on Zune, mp3 via Libsyn or iTunes. Visit www.tokenskeptic.org &ndash; and I&rsquo;d love to get your feedback at tokenskeptic@gmail.com.

			<title>Token Skeptic #58 - On Magic And Pieces Of Mind - Interview With Simon Taylor</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-58-on-magic-and-pieces-of-mind-interview-with-simon-taylor]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This is a special early-episode of the Token Skeptic - this weekend I'll be attending the live concert of Tim Minchin and I'll also be interviewing my friend Michael McRae on his recently released book 'Tribal Science'.
I was recently interviewed for Meet The Skeptics - check out the mp3 here! Forthcoming interview for The Skeptical Experience later this month.
However, if you're not in Perth but in Adelaide or Melbourne - you should be checking out the performances of Simon Taylor this month and during the Melbourne Comedy Festival!
Former psychology student turned award-winning entertainer, Simon Taylor attempts to solve the puzzles of the mind. He knows what you are thinking-and will make you laugh out loud as he tells you.
A pertinent panel on 'Entertainment and Skepticism' at TAMOz last year featured an impassioned and memorable walk-out by mentalist and magician Simon Taylor, as he urged us all not to look down at others based on their approach to thinking and factor in emotion and empathy when we communicate.
&nbsp;
In this interview, we discuss his interest and ongoing research on the topic of magic and deception; his successful TEDx talks; visual impairment and performance; science communication and the ethics of magic and being an atheist - and not stealing towels at hotels.
Simon's show 'Pieces of Mind' is playing during the Adelaide Fringe at the The Science Exchange on Saturday 5 March and from Tuesday 8 to Saturday 12 March. Details at http://www.aroundyou.com.au/events/adelaide-fringe-2011-pieces-of-mind-comedy.
The Melbourne Comedy festival will feature Simon's forthcoming gigs at  www.comedyfestival.com.au/the-festival/2011-comedy-festival.

			<title>Token Skeptic #57 - On Miracle Cures And Changes To The ASA In The UK – Interview With Rhys Morgan</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-57-on-miracle-cures-and-changes-to-the-asa-in-the-uk-interview-with-rhys-morgan]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[During my time at QEDCon, many people were talking about the changes that were pending with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). During an interview I conducted with Alan Henness of the Nightingale Collaboration (which should soon feature on Skepticality), the website countdown until the 1st of March was referenced.
How much hope do skeptics and pro-science activists in the UK hold for these changes really making a difference? What is the current situation faced by those who wish to have a say and are already fighting pseudoscience in regards to health claims online?
Since tomorrow is the 1st March, a great many pro-science activists are preparing to write into the ASA about pseudoscience and quackery perpetuated online. I got the chance to interview one such activist: Rhys Morgan, a teenage blogger who recently featured on BBC News Cardiff, after speaking at the Skeptics in the Pub during a night that also featured Simon Singh.
Rhys Morgan's Website can be found at http://thewelshboyo.co.uk and he is on Twitter at RhysMorgan. 
From the ASA News Release, as featured on Dr Ben Goldacre's secondary Posterous blog:
"From 1 March 2011, the ASA's online remit now extends to cover companies' own marketing claims on their own websites and in other non-paid for space they control. This landmark development brings enhanced consumer protection, particularly for children... The UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, which includes rules to make sure advertisements do not mislead, harm or offend, will be applied to all UK based company websites regardless of the sector or size of business or organisation."

            <description><![CDATA[Many thanks to the talented Jasmine Marosvary for this short film about the 10:23 campaign in Brisbane! 
We will be meeting up at 9.30am at the two large metal spheres between the Treasury Casino and the Brisbane Library across George Street from the Queen Street Mall. We&rsquo;re meeting early in order to set up our homeopathic preparations as well as to hand out amongst participants the information sheets and flyers for interested passers-by, and prepare for the arrival of the media. The event will climax with the mass &lsquo;overdose&rsquo; at 10:23am were volunteers will consume ridiculous amounts of pre-vetted homeopathic products in front of onlookers, the gathered media, and our own cameras for video to be promptly uploaded online.
The Brisbane campaigners included Rion Adsett, Jasmine Marosvary, Trent Voigt, Jayson Daniel Cooke and Kayla Howard. Official site for the Griffith University Skeptics Society is at http://gussf.wordpress.com.

			<title>Token Skeptic #55 - On The Geek Manifesto - Interview With Mark Henderson</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-55-on-the-geek-manifesto-interview-with-mark-henderson]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[A special episode about The Geek Manifesto!
When I was in London, I was fortunate enough to secure an interview with Mark Henderson,  who is the Science Editor of The Times. He's in the process of writing  and crowd-sourcing information for his book about  science and politics.  It&rsquo;s called The Geek Manifesto, and it will be  published next spring  by Bantam Press.
As he writes on his site at www.geekmanifesto.wordpress.com:
The  idea behind the book is fairly simple. The geeks, nerds and  dorks  of  this world are no longer apologising for their slightly  obsessive   interest in science and critical thinking. Through events  such as Simon Singh&rsquo;s libel case, the sacking of Professor David Nutt as the British Government&rsquo;s chief drugs adviser, and the Science is Vital campaign to protect British science against spending cuts, they&rsquo;re beginning to    gather the confidence to fight for the causes that matter to them.  They   are creating an emerging political force, and one that is sorely   needed.
Thanks to James O'Malley of The Pod Delusion and the fine people of   Westminster Skeptics, the talk he gave about The Geek Manifesto on   Monday 11th January with Evan Harris was recorded. You can listen to it here.
This show is available on Zune, mp3 via Libsyn or iTunes. Visit  www.tokenskeptic.org &ndash; and I&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback at  tokenskeptic@gmail.com. Theme songs are 'P&amp;P' by Derek K Miller of www.penmachine.com and '365' by Milton Mermikides, of www.miltonmermikides.com]]></description>

			<title>Happy Lunar New Year At Singapore's Changi Airport - Token Skeptic Podcast </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/happy-lunar-new-year-at-singapore-s-changi-airport-token-skeptic-podcast-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Before I headed to #QEDCon, I had a little time at Singapore's Changi Airport. It's my favorite airport and on Thursday, 3rd February, I arrived just in time for some celebrations!
You can see the koala I was taking for Janis Bennion at QEDCon and spot me at the very end, running off to find my gate to leave. :)
Lunar New Year is the most important festival celerated by Chinese communities in Singapore and other parts of the world. To the Chinese, the Lunar New Year symbolises a fresh start to a new year and one's life, bringing with it new hopes for happiness and prosperity for the coming year. Each lunar new year is associated with one of the 12 chinese zodiac animals - in 2011, it is the Year of the Rabbit. The rabbit symbolises character traits such as creativity, compassion and sensitivity. 'Rabbits' are friendy, outgoing, and prefer the company of others. They also prefer to avoid conflicts in confrontational situations.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This is an additional, short interview for this week - which you can also hear on the most recent Pseudo Scientists podcast, the show of the Young Australian Skeptics!
Due to travelling (which I'm about to do in about ten minutes after writing this), I didn't have the chance to record an additional summation of the research - so it's on the Token Skeptic website. Many thanks to the interviewees and you can check out the media release that they mention on the RMIT website here - 'Balance Unaffected By Power Balance Wristbands: Study'.
There is a copy of the abstract of the paper, 'The effect of close proximity holographic wristbands on human balance and limits of stability: A randomised, placebo-controlled trial' on the Token Skeptic site, along with the questions I ask.

			<title>Token Skeptic 53 - On Loving The Lake Monster - Interview With Benjamin Radford</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-53-on-loving-the-lake-monster-interview-with-benjamin-radford]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[I've passed the 'one year' mark! Many thanks to everyone who continues to listen to the show and as always, feel free to send in ideas and feedback. :) The next episode I do may very well feature on the Young Australian Skeptics podcast, called the Pseudo Scientists, so if you are expecting something next Monday, I suggest checking out their show instead?
This is a short interview that deals with something that occurred to me when I attended a workshop on paranormal investigations at Dragon*Con last year, which was run by Benjamin Radford. That and the fact if I can work a David Bowie allusion into my work, I will.
If you don't know who he is, then you should be listening to the Monster Talk podcast and reading his books like 'Hoaxes, Myths, and Manias: Why We Need Critical Thinking (with sociologist Robert E. Bartholomew); Media Mythmakers: How Journalists, Activists, and Advertisers Mislead Us, and Lake Monster Mysteries: Investigating the World's Most Elusive Creatures (with Joe Nickell).
If that isn't enough for you, you can also watch him appear on documentaries and TV shows like the new Oprah Network  show "Miracle Detectives", and various online articles in places like Discovery News, the Center for Inquiry website and SheThought.com - and (most importantly!) subscribing to the Skeptical Inquiry magazine, of which he is the managing editor. He even has a board-game out, he's that multi-talented. By the way - Julie Burchill says he's 'brilliant' - and that's enough reason in my mind to find an opportunity to say likewise by interviewing him on emotional attachments to monsters.
His new book - out later this year - is called Tracking The Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast In Fact, Fiction, And Folklore. His official site is at http://www.radfordbooks.com.

If you don't know who he is, then you should be listening to the Monster Talk podcast and reading his books like 'Hoaxes, Myths, and Manias: Why We Need Critical Thinking (with sociologist Robert E. Bartholomew); Media Mythmakers: How Journalists, Activists, and Advertisers Mislead Us, and Lake Monster Mysteries: Investigating the World's Most Elusive Creatures (with Joe Nickell).
If that isn't enough for you, you can also watch him appear on documentaries and TV shows like the new Oprah Network  show "Miracle Detectives", and various online articles in places like Discovery News, the Center for Inquiry website and SheThought.com - and (most importantly!) subscribing to the Skeptical Inquiry magazine, of which he is the managing editor. He even has a board-game out, he's that multi-talented. By the way - Julie Burchill says he's 'brilliant' - and that's enough reason in my mind to find an opportunity to say likewise by interviewing him on emotional attachments to monsters.
His new book - out later this year - is called Tracking The Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast In Fact, Fiction, And Folklore. His official site is at http://www.radfordbooks.com.
This show is available on Zune, mp3 via Libsyn or iTunes. Visit www.tokenskeptic.org &ndash; and I&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback at tokenskeptic@gmail.com. Theme songs are 'P&amp;P' by Derek K Miller of www.penmachine.com and '365' by Milton Mermikides, of www.miltonmermikides.com

            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/little-sugar-pills-why-fall-for-homeopathy-token-skeptic-special-episode]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Little Sugar Pills - Why Fall For Homeopathy?
There's a variety of reasons why someone might believe in homeopathy.
Homeopathy isn't as powerful as its supporters claim it is - the power of the human mind is greater. Which is why we have to use our minds, when it comes to getting the message out. There's more to stopping homeopathy than taking an overdose of little sugar pills.

			<title>Token Skeptic 52 - On Thinking Freely In Western Sydney - An Interview With Alan Conradi</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/on-thinking-freely-in-western-sydney-an-interview-with-alan-conradi]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[AGAIN - Glitches! Thanks to everyone for their patience - expect bonus ep again this week! :)
Mentioned during the intro of this show:

Token Skeptic on the Righteous Indignation podcast #82, with Eugenie Scott! Head to: http://parafort.com/ri/?p=1428
365 Days Of Astronomy podcast. http://365daysofastronomy.org.
The Sydney Atheist Podcast - http://www.sydneyatheists.org/node/1154 - a hat-tip to Embiggen Books! 
The Sceptic Science column with Brad Newsome. http://www.nationaltimes.com.au/opinion/blog/sceptic-science 
The Desiree Schell (Skeptically Speaking - skepticallyspeaking.com) interview on skepticism and activism over at my CSICOP column 'Curiouser and Curiouser'! 
Finally - the Young Australian Skeptics Blog Anthology, on its way soon - and thanks to Gold of NZ Skeptics, a new activism project!

"My use of the term 'Freethought' is an attempt to join the various groups together. It does not come with the negative connotations of the various other labels that have been assigned to such groups before and is therefore more accessible to the wider community. Freethought seems to be less likely to shy away from any topics, which means that in a freethought society there is no boundary other than reason and there would therefore be a wide range of interesting things that could be discussed."
Alan Conradi is a skeptical atheist and psychology graduate who works in disability services, and he enjoys learning about and discussing belief systems, science, philosophy and much more. A keen musician who plays guitar, bass, drums, vox and pretty much anything else he can get his hands on, he's best known as a host of The Critical Mass podcast, the Three Thinkers podcast, a member of the Sydney Atheists and the Western Sydney Freethinkers. Overall, Alan is a keen activist, brilliant organiser and a popular guy! You can find him on Twitter as ZombieAlan.

            <description><![CDATA[SORRY FOR THE TECH ISSUES! Episode now out and an extra one this week - the 10:23 Campaign in Australia.
Welcome to Episode Fifty-One! Thanks to everyone who is supporting the show; Token Skeptic and the Pseudo Scientists podcast are the only shows I'll be working on and every bit of help is greatly appreciated. Stay tuned later this week for a special bonus episode on the 10:23 Campaign in Australia.
First - Sceptic Science! Brad Newsome is a Melbourne journalist who often wonders why people believe weird things - which has led him to write the Sceptic Science entries for the National Times, which is syndicated across The Brisbane Times, Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and WA Today.
I was very honored to be interviewed by his column on the topic of women and belief in the paranormal, which has gained over a hundred comments and discussions since its publication. Supporting good journalism is of interest to everybody, which is why I took the opportunity to talk to Brad about how and why he came to be a sceptic (with a 'c')!  Check out the Sceptic Science column in the online site at  http://www.nationaltimes.com.au/opinion/blog/sceptic-science.

            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-47-on-a-little-bit-of-douglas-adams-with-maynard-and-seasons-greetings]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[As a present to my listeners - this is about a five-minute segment of a twenty-year old interview that is done by Maynard of  http://www.maynard.com.au.
How come this audio is available? Well, firstly, I met Maynard in Sydney, earlier in the year, and mentioned that I kept on one of my audio tapes this very interview. The full story of how I became a keen listener of Maynard's show back in the 1980-1990s features on the Token Skeptic website, under the show notes for Episode #47.
From Wikipedia: Douglas Adams (1952 &ndash; 2001) was an English writer and dramatist. He is best known as the author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which started life in 1978 as a BBC radio comedy before developing into a "trilogy" of five books that sold over 15&nbsp;million copies in his lifetime, a television series, several stage plays, comics, a computer game, and in 2005, a feature film.
Maynard's interview is with the author Douglas Adams and this is only a part of it has to feature - I'm certain that Maynard will feature the whole thing on his show very soon. He's already put a few teasers online via Twitter, and you can find his account at MaynardComAu. Please listen to his show and send him your support, as you do my show. Many, many thanks to him, the very best to all of you for the season, and thanks for being an important part of my skeptial-activities this year.
This show is available on Zune, mp3 via Libsyn or iTunes. Visit www.tokenskeptic.org &ndash; and I&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback at tokenskeptic@gmail.com. Theme songs are 'P&amp;P' by Derek K Miller of www.penmachine.com and '365' by Milton Mermikides, of www.miltonmermikides.com.]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-46-on-the-australian-book-of-atheism-perth-launch]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[First and foremost and absolutely before anything &ndash; thanks to Jane and Beaufort Street Books in Mt Lawley, Warren Bonett and Peter Cartledge.
We had a live-Skype crossover Q&amp;A with Warren in front of a packed bookstore to talk about The Australian Book of Atheism.
This episode features how the book started, the contributors and how it was pulled together; what the history of atheism in Australia tells us about the growth and development of rationalism in this country is like; the favorable response by the media; the need for an Australian book of atheism and the hopes for future editions and what they might include. Lots of great questions from the audience, everyone really seemed to enjoy themselves. I even got to read out Tim Minchin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Storm&rsquo;, from the book!  Thanks again to everyone who helped and took part - The Australian Book of Atheism is available from good bookstores near you, like Beaufort St Books and Embiggen Books!

			<title>Token Skeptic #44 - On Pink Microscopes - A Strange Quarks Submission</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-44-on-pink-microscopes-a-strange-quarks-submission]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This is a short essay that was submitted to the new podcast 'Strange Quarks' - and I strongly recommend that other podcasters consider sending in their own short essays! This is a short overview on the contribution of science education to challenging paranormal and pseudoscientific beliefs in females.
The influence of mainstream education in the face of numerous factors that encourages anomalistic beliefs naturally diminishes, although a good science education can definitely play a part in improving the lives of young people. Especially when the sciences are so important to the future progress of every country. Even the skeptically-minded themselves should be critically evaluating how they challenge predominant attitudes towards homeopathy, alternative medicine and the like in young women - and whether making a difference requires different approaches that are more sensitive to the influences on their lives.
Strange Quarks is a podcast on science, pseudoscience, skepticism and evidence-based policy. It is made by Michael Marshall and Martin Robbins for the Pulse Project. http://strangequarks.net/. Many thanks to Jean-Michel Abrassart of http://scepticismescientifique.blogspot.com, who always encourages me to keep doing essays.

            <description><![CDATA[Welcome to episode forty-three! TAMOz, TAM Australia, whatever you want to call it - have an hour of what it's like to be me in Sydney, losing my delusions about what Australian Skeptics are and what it could be.
Interviews include:  Nicholas and Alex Southhall  - Warren Bonett and the Booksellers for Embiggen Books - Simon Singh - Jack Scanlan of the Young Australian Skeptics -  Madge Carew-Hopkins the winner of the TAMOz student scholarship - Thom Perry, one of the webdesigners and branding experts for the TAMOz convention - Paul Willis - Simon Taylor - Julian Morrow - Loretta Marron - Peter Ellerton - James Randi - Dr Rob Morrison.
We talk about education, the Bent Spoon nomination for ACARA, science communication, popularity, effectiveness, outreach, activism, coffee mornings, not enough sleep, magic, psychology, the best books ever and why blogging does matter. Many thanks to the organisers, everyone who was kind enough to talk to me and to the likes of Brian Dunning&nbsp; for only standing still long enough around me for one photo. Ah well. Maybe next year I'll be famous enough... :p

			<title>Token Skeptic #37 - On The 10:23 Campaign In 2011 – An Interview With Andy Wilson</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://tokenskeptic.org/token-skeptic-37-on-the-10-23-campaign-in-2011-an-interview-with-andy-wilson]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Science and rationality are political issues, whether we like it or not. Amanda Marcotte, Get Opinionated: A Progressive&rsquo;s Guide to Finding Your Voice (and Taking a Little Action).
On  Jan 30, 2010 at 10:23am, more than three hundred skeptics in the UK  (and a handful of groups internationally) took part in a mass  homeopathic 'overdose' in protest at the high-street pharmacy / drug  store chain Boots' continued endorsement and sale of homeopathic  remedies, and to raise public awareness about the fact that homeopathic  remedies have nothing in them.
But then what? Clearly Boots and  many other retailers like them continue to sell homeopathic products.  Did it change people&rsquo;s minds as well as reach the news? Is there more to  activism than &lsquo;placebo&rsquo; stunts - and what really ensures effective change? In  2011, skeptics internationally are challenged to take it further &ndash; and  come up with their own, locally-inspired activities. The next 10:23  Campaign (http://www.1023.org.uk) will take place across the weekend of the 5th and 6th of February, 2011.
Andy Wilson is a Board member of Merseyside Skeptics Society and co-founder of the 2010 10:23 campaign against the use of homeopathy in mainstream health.&nbsp; Andy lives in  Southport, Merseyside and is also host of the satirical, skeptical panel  show podcast, InKredulous.

            <description><![CDATA[Welcome back to more regularly scheduled programming post-Dragon*Con!
I'd like to say some very big thanks to the people I hung out with in Atlanta this year, especially Derek and Swoopy of Skepticality, KO Myers and Desiree Schell, Barbara Drescher, Daphne Ross, Heidi Anderson, Daniel and Cheryl Loxton, Ben Radford, Donna Mugavero, Jenna Griffith, the Skeptic Zone team, Laurie and Rob Tarr, Colin Thornton and the rest of the Podcast Beyond Belief team, Jennifer Haythorn, Josh Meyer, Abe the Alien - and especially every wonderful member of the SkepTrack team: Mykel Alvis, Ann Gillett and Mark Distler of Abrupt Media and his audio team. To people I only met for the first time, it was wonderful to see you in person - to the people who saw me running around and only got in a brief word or two, I really hope to spend more time with you next year! I hope all the little videos on Token Skeptic somehow make up for it!
I was contacted late last week by Jayson Cooke of the Griffith University Skeptics and Freethinkers in Queensland, about his efforts to raise awareness about a Seminar that was planned to be held at the University of Southern Queensland's Hervey Bay campus, by Creation Ministries International:
I happened  to be looking at my inbox on Friday  afternoon, September 17, 2010, when I received my regular email update from  Creation Ministries International (CMI)... It  wasn&rsquo;t until I glanced at the subject line of  the email that my jaw dropped involuntarily and uncomfortably to my desk: &ldquo;University&ndash;Sponsored Creation  Seminar at Hervey  Bay, University of Southern Queensland." 
The official site for the Griffith University Skeptics and Freethinkers is at www.gussf.wordpress.com.
Happy birthday, Benjamin Radford! This show is available on Zune, mp3 via Libsyn or iTunes. Visit www.tokenskeptic.org &ndash; and I&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback at tokenskeptic@gmail.com.

            <description><![CDATA[I hope everyone enjoyed Australia's Science Week! Hello to all the new subscribers and I hope you enjoy earlier episodes as well - all available at Token Skeptic and on iTunes.
This episode features Deb Hodgkin of Science-at-home.org!
Deb studied Human Biology and Archaeology in her Bachelor of Science, then did Honours in Anatomy.&nbsp; With her Post-Graduate Diploma in Education, she taught in remote communities and towns for nine years before she had children - which led to the creation of her website, Science At Home! Deb has taught all sorts of things in addition to Secondary Science and Maths and with her Masters in Education, she applies her experiences and insights when promoting science activities for parents.
As she says on her site, 'Science@Home':
Children are natural scientists.&nbsp; Take advantage of their questioning with fun activities to share and develop their love of science and critical thinking.

            <description><![CDATA[This episode would not be possible if it were not for the opportunity given to me by Christ Church Grammar School - particularly the Centre for Ethics and Reverend Canon Frank Sheehan and Teresa Scott - and St Hilda's Anglican School for Girls.
This  is an interview conducted on August 2nd, 2010 at Christ Church Grammar  School, of Ayaan Hirsi Ali by Reverend Cannon Frank Sheehan.
Somali-born writer, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, sees her journey from tribal   community to membership of modern  democratic society in terms of   enlightenment.
After spending time as a parliamentarian in  the  Netherlands,  Ayaan moved to a conservative Washington think tank.  As  both an activist and an academic, she writes and speaks about the   problematic relationship between some forms of Islam and freedom of   thought and expression as it has come to be accepted and treasured in   the West. This has naturally led to hurt and bewilderment on both sides   of the discussion.
Ayaan Hirsi Ali continues to pay a high  price for her  readiness to embrace liberty of thought as is evidenced  by her need  for protection. She gained enormous fame for her book  Infidel (2007)  and her most recent work Nomad. She has been the  recipient of numerous  awards and has been named as one of Time  Magazine&rsquo;s 100 most influential  people.

Finished watching it? What you have just seen is part of a 2004 Ig  Nobel award-winning study - which makes the  following interview really quite special.
Christopher Chabris and Prof Daniel Simons have released a book about  their ten years of research - on why people succumb to  everyday  illusions and what we can do to  inoculate ourselves against  their  effects. Called The   Invisible Gorilla, it details the experiment and how it might   explain such things as why companies spend billions on product they   knows will fail and why award-winning movies are full of editing   mistakes. They combine the work of other researchers with their own  findings on  attention, perception, memory, and reasoning to reveal how  faulty  intuitions often get us into trouble.
The  Invisible Gorilla And Other Ways our Intuition Deceives Us is  available from bookstores world-wide and I do suggest you check out my  favourite bookstore online, Embiggen Books, for a copy. You can head to  the official site to learn more, at http://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com.

			<title>Token Skeptic #28 - On Secular Ethics Classes - An Interview With Dr Phillip Cam</title>

            <description><![CDATA['Did you know that children whose parents make a conscientious  decision  to have them opt out of Special Religious Education (SRE) are  prohibited  from any form of instruction during this period? NSW  Department of  Education policy provides for the supervision of these  children but  specifies they are not to have access to 'ethics, values,  civics or  general religious education.' - St James Ethics Centre. 
Hello and welcome to one of the few live rather than Skyped  interviews that I conduct for this podcast. Last week I attended the Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools  Association annual conference, held at the University of NSW. One of  the presenters was Dr Phillip Cam.
Dr Philip Cam is Associate Professor in the School  of History and Philosophy at the University of New South Wales. He has  particular interests in the philosophy of the mind, education, social  philosophy and philosophical inquiry for children. Dr Cam has written  several books related to philosophical inquiry for children, some of  which have been widely translated, and he is the author of many articles  on related aspects of education.
In 2004, I attended a Level 2 training course in Philosophy for  Children, with about fifteen other teachers, attending lectures and  workshops run by practioners,&nbsp; including Dr Cam. At the FAPSA  conference, he did a short presentation about the state's 10-week trial for secular ethics classes, which has  caught some media attention - so I hoped to clear up a few  misconceptions about the trial and whether it was, as some claimed,  really 'in competition' with religious education classes.

			<title>Token Skeptic #27 - On The Separation Between Scientific Truth And Belief - Interview With Dr Pamela Gay</title>

            <description><![CDATA[Welcome to episode twenty seven of the Token Skeptic!
 Dear listeners - firstly apologies for getting out two episodes out so soon after one another. Next week I'll be traveling, so it is unlikely that I'll get out an episode next week, so I hope you don't mind that there's a little space between this and episode twenty-eight. I'll be attending a Philosophy and Education conference in Sydney, on the other side of Australia, and will include the content from that in the next show.
This episode is called 'On Separation Between Scientific Truth and Belief'. This is a very current 'news' item online, involving a blog-post written by Dr Pamela&nbsp; Gay and the response it has got from a variety of people, including Dr PZ 'Pharyngula' Myers. It is called Separation Between Scientific Truth and Belief, on her Starstryder blog.
Dr Gay is an astronomer, writer, and podcaster, who focuses on using new media to engage people in science and technology. On her website 'About' page, she writes that she is often asked about her belief system and created a page to answer that question here.
What this episode features is the second half of an interview - the first half with Dr Gay will feature on the Skeptic Zone podcast later this week, and I urge people who are not familiar or have not kept in touch with the work that Dr Gay does for astronomy and education, to download that too.

			<title>Token Skeptic #26 - On Chronic Illness, Deaf Culture And Skepticism - Interview With Joey Haban</title>

            <description><![CDATA[Welcome to episode twenty six of the Token Skeptic!
This week I&rsquo;m interviewing Joey Haban of the blog Newly Nerfed. Newly Nerfed is a blog about chronic illness and disability, science and skepticism, and geekery of all kinds, that you can find at http://newly-nerfed.net.
She describes herself on her site as 'a 36-year-old geeky gal living in Los Angeles, with a husband (a videogame technical director) and two unemployed Burmese cats, Zen &mdash; the one with the game controller &mdash; and Satori.' She has a BFA in Dramatic Writing from NYU, and finished the coursework for her master&rsquo;s in teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL). Prior to becoming disabled, she was a sign language interpreter in the college setting, and later taught English grammar and writing to underprepared deaf college students. She is also a staff writer for AbleGamers and contributes to the Grassroots Skeptics.
Some of the topics we discuss are inspired by an excellent and thought-provoking blog-post called 'Bitten And Shy', which investigates how people may have a good reason, although not an excuse, to reject medical science. Joey shares some insights from her time as an interpreter of American Sign Language (ASL) and views on skepticism. You can follow her on Twitter at ZenMonkey and join her Facebook page at http://www.facebook.com/pages/Newly-Nerfed/260287547080

			<title>Token Skeptic #24 - On Trebuchet - Interview Of George Hrab By Milton Mermikides</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/tokenskeptic/Token_Skeptic_24_-_On_Trebuchet_-_Interview_With_George_Hrab_By_Milton_Mermikides.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Dear George Hrab,
You're a very silly man and I'm not going to interview you.
Milton Mermikides is going to do it instead.
Regards,
Kylie Sturgess.
&nbsp;
Trebuchet features 17 songs about skepticism, science, atheism, falling, flying, remnant evolutionary behavior, and the usefulness of one plastic lobster.
This is the first thirty-minutes of an extended interview by Milton Mermikides with George Hrab; the rest of the interview may feature on the Geologic Podcast.
Multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, producer, composer and heliocentrist George Hrab has written and produced five independent CDs; published one book; performed for President Clinton; shared the stage with countless numbers of musicians and acts; and has traveled across the country as drummer, vocalist, musical director, and event host for the nationally recognized Philadelphia Funk Authority. As defacto Despot-for-Life of his own original ensemble The Geologic Orchestra, George humbly follows in the footsteps of such icons as Frank Zappa, Mark Twain, Carl Sagan, and Will Rogers, making it a personal quest to improve the cognitive thinking skills of each and every American by reaching them through their funny bones and dance shoes. His music, skepticism and wit have been featured on many radio broadcasts, TV shows, and podcasts - his podcast is found at www.geologicpodcast.com
Milton Mermikides lives in London and enjoys a life working as a performing and session guitarist, composer of many styles, band leader, producer, recording engineer, leukaemia activist, lecturer and academic. He has a BSc from the London School of Economics, a BMus from Berklee College of Music and is currently completing a PhD at the University of Surrey in Performance and Composition.&nbsp; At the age of 28, Milton was appointed a Professor of Composition at the Royal Academy of Music followed by the position of Head of Music Technology. He is also professor of Jazz Guitar at the Royal College of Music. In 2004, Milton was appointed Designer and Director of the Creative Technology Lab - the Electro-acoustic research centre at the Royal Academy of Music, for which he received the ULU Laurel award for services to Music Technology. His website is www.miltonmermikides.com. 
You can purchase Trebuchet via iTunes or at http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/hrab6 (which includes the option to purchase either the downloadable version or a physical copy that comes with a twenty-page booklet).

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Dear George Hrab,
You're a very silly man and I'm not going to interview you.
Milton Mermikides is going to do it instead.
Regards,
Kylie Sturgess.
&nbsp;
Trebuchet features 17 songs about skepticism, science, atheism, falling, flying, remnant evolutionary behavior, and the usefulness of one plastic lobster.
This is the first thirty-minutes of an extended interview by Milton Mermikides with George Hrab; the rest of the interview may feature on the Geologic Podcast.
Multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, producer, composer and heliocentrist George Hrab has written and produced five independent CDs; published one book; performed for President Clinton; shared the stage with countless numbers of musicians and acts; and has traveled across the country as drummer, vocalist, musical director, and event host for the nationally recognized Philadelphia Funk Authority. As defacto Despot-for-Life of his own original ensemble The Geologic Orchestra, George humbly follows in the footsteps of such icons as Frank Zappa, Mark Twain, Carl Sagan, and Will Rogers, making it a personal quest to improve the cognitive thinking skills of each and every American by reaching them through their funny bones and dance shoes. His music, skepticism and wit have been featured on many radio broadcasts, TV shows, and podcasts - his podcast is found at www.geologicpodcast.com
Milton Mermikides lives in London and enjoys a life working as a performing and session guitarist, composer of many styles, band leader, producer, recording engineer, leukaemia activist, lecturer and academic. He has a BSc from the London School of Economics, a BMus from Berklee College of Music and is currently completing a PhD at the University of Surrey in Performance and Composition.&nbsp; At the age of 28, Milton was appointed a Professor of Composition at the Royal Academy of Music followed by the position of Head of Music Technology. He is also professor of Jazz Guitar at the Royal College of Music. In 2004, Milton was appointed Designer and Director of the Creative Technology Lab - the Electro-acoustic research centre at the Royal Academy of Music, for which he received the ULU Laurel award for services to Music Technology. His website is www.miltonmermikides.com. 
You can purchase Trebuchet via iTunes or at http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/hrab6 (which includes the option to purchase either the downloadable version or a physical copy that comes with a twenty-page booklet). 
Thanks Milton, I couldn't have done this.

			<title>Token Skeptic #23 - On Big Pharma - Interview With Dr Leslie Cannold and Michael McRae</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/tokenskeptic/Token_Skeptic_23_-_On_Big_Pharma_-_Interview_with_Dr_Leslie_Cannold_and_Michael_McRae.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Welcome to Token Skeptic #23 - a discussion between Dr Leslie Cannold and Michael McRae on perceptions of pharmaceutical companies!
After reading &lsquo;The Immortal Cells of Henrietta Lacks&rsquo; by Rebecca Skloot and talking to my students about medical ethics, and more recently, the Australian Vaccination Network - I really wanted to investigate the public perception of pharmaceutical companies and why it seems to have such a strange &lsquo;either for or against!&rsquo; approach for many.
The questions I asked include:  What do you think is the public perception of pharmaceutical companies and why? Have we learned from history about how drug companies gather and report results and are things improving? What should be the future of pharmaceutical products and whose responsibility is it to make sure that happens?
The article that we discuss around the twenty-minute mark is 'Ghost Stories', by Richard Guilliat, published in the Australian Magazine on April 3rd, 2010, about the multinational drug firm Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and the investigation into its promotion of Premarin hormone-replacement drugs.
http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/ghost-stories/story-e6frg8h6-1225848936455
Dr Leslie Cannold is an author, researcher, ethicist and vocalist. Her website is http://www.cannold.com
She worked for years at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne, and now holds an Honorary Fellowship at Melbourne, as well as an Adjunct Senior Lecturer position at Monash University. Leslie sits on various boards and committees, including the ethics panel of the Infertility Treatment Authority and the Human Research and Ethics Committee of the Victorian Department of Human Services. She is president of Reproductive Choice Australia and Pro-Choice Victoria, grass-roots advocacy groups that seek to maximise the reproductive rights and freedoms available to Australians.

			<title>Token Skeptic #6 - On Trial By Ordeal - Witch-Hunting And Superstition</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/tokenskeptic/Token_Skeptic_6_-_On_Trial_By_Ordeal__Witch-Hunting_And_Superstition.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Professor Peter T. Leeson&rsquo;s paper on 'Ordeals' looks at the medieval superstition 'iudicium dei' &ndash; or the judgment of God - the practice of judging a person&rsquo;s innocence or guilt by ordeal. This could include putting your arm into boiling water, being dunked or even being burnt alive.
"It was expected that God, approving the act imposed or permitted by an authorized judge, would give a distinct manifestation of the truth to reveal the guilt or innocence of the accused. It was believed from these premises that an equitable judgment must surely result."
While many of us can see the humor in the overeager peasants wanting to burn a witch in the film 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', belief in witchcraft and use of torture in their confession has continued for centuries. Even now, it demonstrates how sometimes superstitions can not only draw in mob support - but can be used to kill.
The article read out during the episode is called 'A Nigerian Witch-Hunter Defends Herself' from the New York Times, from the 22nd May, 2010, written by Mark Oppenheimer.
To learn more about the work of Leo Igwe, his work is documented at www.iheu.org/iheu and you can find some of his articles on his website.
Professor Peter T. Leeson is the BB&amp;T Professor for the Study of Capitalism at the Mercatus Center, George Mason University&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <description><![CDATA[It&rsquo;s a missing episode! This is an interview that is thanks to Expanding Horizons. Expanding Horizons is a Unitarian church radio show from South Australia, featured on Radio Adelaide 101.5 and hosted by Brian Menzies.
With a wide range of topics and investigations, Brian was kind enough last year to call upon both Michael McRae and I to talk about our experiences as teachers and to address that tricky question: &lsquo;What is critical thinking&rsquo;?
I thought this was a fun and insightful opportunity to address some of the misconceptions people have, that there&rsquo;s a &rsquo;set&rsquo; definition of critical thinking, that it&rsquo;s equivalent to skepticism and how there&rsquo;s a lot going on out there that people might not know about. I hope you enjoy this addition to the podcast &ndash; and thanks again to Brian and the Expanding Horizons team, whose show you can find at their official site.
Sorry about the picture &ndash; it&rsquo;s the only one I have with Michael and myself; we&rsquo;re at TAM5 with Matt Stone of South Park!

			<title>Token Skeptic #19 - On Skepticism And Education (Interview With JREF's Michael Blanford)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/tokenskeptic/Token_Skeptic_19_-_On_Skepticism_And_Education_Interview_With_JREFs_Michael_Blanford.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[It's Episode 19 - and I'm getting back into the swing of things by releasing the two missing episodes AND the required 'one episode a week'! Can't say how much I appreciate all the listeners, considering how this show has gone in a variety of directions and subjects which (I assure you) wasn't the original intention!
Where are we now? We're listening to Michael Blanford, who you may have noticed has recently joined the James Randi Educational Foundation! He's the new Director of Educational Programs! As a high-school teacher myself, I've got a lot of questions and vested interest in knowing how he's going to help with the 'E' in JREF.
"With an academic background in zoology, Blanford began his career as a field biologist, studying amphibians and reptiles in the United States and Costa Rica. &nbsp;While he enjoys doing research, he has spent much of the last 15 years promoting science literacy and appreciation. &nbsp;He has developed science curricula, programs, and informal content for a number of institutions, including schools, community centers, and museums. &nbsp;Most recently, he was coordinator for the Saint Louis Science Center&rsquo;s Life Science Lab, an innovative space with the mission of exposing the public to the tools and methods of scientific research.
Michael lives with his family in Saint Louis, Missouri, where he spends much of his spare-time promoting grassroots skepticism through a number of organizations. &nbsp;Michael is founder of the Saint Louis Skeptics Meetup, founder and President of the Skeptical Society of Saint Louis, co-founder of Saint Louis Skeptics in the Pub, and has served as Vice President of the Rationalist Society of Saint Louis, America&rsquo;s oldest continuously meeting free thought organization."

			<title>Token Skeptic #18 - On The Placebo Protest (Science Communication Part Three)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/tokenskeptic/Token_Skeptic_18__On_The_Placebo_Protest_Skepticism_And_Communication_Part_Three.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Welcome to Episode Eighteen! This particular episode is another conversation with Michael McRae, about the #boobquake day, held on the 26th April, earlier this week.
I also, thanks to the Virtual Drinking Skeptically chat which inspired me, have Desiree Schell of Skeptically Speaking included! As a community outreach worker, she brings her own experiences in terms of rallies and protests - what did she think and what did fellow feminists and skeptics say to her?
After Michael McRae published an essay on the SheThought site, I decided to clear up a few things in regards to what really was happening, was it about communicating science, as some claimed - or was it something that really showed how not many of us are reflecting on the impact of actions skeptics take?
From Michael McRae's 'The Rise of the Placebo Protest': 

"However, for skeptics who actually desire a public change in attitude and have hope that the next generation will have a better grasp of critical thinking, protests and stunts shouldn&rsquo;t be considered as part of the solution. What&rsquo;s more, they should be considered as potentially counterproductive, sacrificing the very things that make science so useful for a grab for headlines and nodding heads. In the very least, they should be treated as if they will actually produce some form of results.
Dismissing criticism of such events is no different than those who defend religion, alternative medicine or a belief in fairies as in the least harmless and at the most productive thanks to the mere possibility of their illusionary benefits. Placebo protests are fundamentally little different to placebo medicines, and demand the very same critical evaluation for evidence.
There will be more Boobquakes, homeopathic suicides and similar skeptic protests in the future. They&rsquo;re simple and get a response that satisfies our confirmation-biased brains. Such events aren&rsquo;t intrinsically good or bad. But to claim they&rsquo;re useful for engaging the public in science, promoting skepticism or encouraging more people to think critically simply isn&rsquo;t supported by the evidence."

Desiree Schell can be heard on www.skepticallyspeaking.com and Michael McRae's work can be found at Science By Email.

            <description><![CDATA[Welcome to the special episode that celebrates SheThought.com!
Today, the 22nd of April, you can contribute and read a variety of blog entries at SheThought.com on the subject of 'We Only Like You Because You&rsquo;re Good in Blog':
How do you start a blog, pick a name, get and keep readers, and deal with trolls, cliques, and flame wars? How has the recent UK libel case vs Simon Singh changed blogging? Why blog at all? How is blogging different from journalism?
Share your secrets and tips, and learn from your peers! Because after all, what fun is it to be good in blog alone?
In 2009, the Dragon*Con Skeptic Track featured a panel on 'Blogging Skeptically'. Thanks to Derek and Swoopy of Skepticality, I'm playing the entire panel, unedited, for your listening pleasure. Enjoy and remember to check out the SheThought site and all the blog entries contributed!

			<title>Token Skeptic #8 - On Skepticism And Cosmetic Claims</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/tokenskeptic/Token_Skeptic_8_-_On_Skepticism_And_Cosmetic_Claims.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Here's the first of my 'filling in the missing episodes' - and many thanks to those who continue to subscribe and support the show, I really appreciate it!
This is an edited version of a presentation done at The Australian Skeptics convention held in Melbourne, in 2006. It was the first Australian skeptical convention I'd ever attended, and it really made an impact upon me, because I'd heard of people talking about paranormal claims and science education before - but never about the science behind make-up claims.
The presentation is by Rosemary Nixon, and it is thanks to her and Richard Saunders of the Skeptic Zone podcast that I'm able to play this for you. I hope to speak to her again about pseudoscience and dermatology in the near future.
You'll hear references to the slides and advertisements used in this presentation and I'll be seeing about putting some of those up on the Token Skeptic podcast. So if you have difficulty imagining some of the standard adverts that are used by companies that say how pomegranate and tomato extract is meant to benefit your skin, you can refer to examples on my site at www.tokenskeptic.org.
Thanks again to the listeners and you'll be getting another two episodes out this week, including one for 'You Only Like Me Because I'm Good In Blog' Day - April 22nd. Head to the Shethought.com website, a place where anyone can contribute entries and essays, to learn more about how bloggers are dedicating a day to talking about maintaining and sustaining their writing online.
So - here's Rosemary Nixon, Senior Fellow at the Department of Medicine at St Vincent's Hospital, at the University of Melbourne - with her presentation on "MythBusting: A Dermatologist's Approach to Cosmetic Advertising".

			<title>Token Skeptic #16 - On One Woman's Struggle For Secularism</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/tokenskeptic/Token_Skeptic_16_-_On_One_Womans_Struggle_For_Secularism.m4a]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Rise Of Atheism, 2010 Global Atheist Convention featured one of the most engaging speakers I've ever heard - Taslima Nasrin. This is her presentation, called ''On my Struggle for Secularism, Human Rights, Freedom of Expression and For Women's Freedom'.
When I started researching all the presenters that I was going to introduce, I knew that a) most people in the audience would have no idea who she was and b) they were going to be completely blown away by her story when they did hear her speak.
Taslima Nasrin is from Bangladesh, was raised as a Muslim and has long been targeted by Muslim extremists. In 1994, she was forced into exile from her native country after mass demonstrations demanded her death for blasphemy and the government charged her with 'hurting religious feelings'. In 2007, after moving to the neighbouring Indian state of West Bengal, Muslim protests forced Taslima out of India. She is able only to visit, and even that seems quite tentative. In an editorial comment on the riots, The Hindu newspaper strongly defended Taslima Nasrin and noted that 'By violently protesting every instance of publication of her articles, the religious fundamentalists obviously want to force a ban, otherwise legally unsustainable, on her critical and creative works.'
From my own perspective, it was incredibly daunting to be on a stage when there were bodyguards surrounding it, because of the threats to her life. You can hear for yourself at the end of this recording, how there was a solid minute and a half of applause for her presentation.
There were some sound difficulties during the Question and Answer segment, so if you're not quite sure about what was happening there, it was because presenters on the stage couldn't hear the questions due to technical difficulties.
I asked the Atheist Foundation of Australia for permission to use the audio and they said as long as credit was given to the GAC for providing the resource and to Gary Bryson of the ABC was given, it was fine. So, many thanks to both of them!

			<title>Token Skeptic #15 - On Women's Intuition And Myths In Psychology</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/tokenskeptic/Token_Skeptic_15_-_On_Womens_Intuition_And_Myths_In_Psychology.m4a]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Women&rsquo;s intuition? Is it just a myth? And if it is just a commonly held misconception &ndash; should we be more understanding? I interview Dr. Scott Lilienfeld, a Professor of Psychology at Emory University in  Atlanta on this and much more!
Professor Lilienfeld is a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, a  Consulting Editor for Skeptical Inquirer and the Founder and Editor of the CSI journal Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice. His principal areas of research include evidence-based practices in psychology and the challenges posed by pseudoscience to clinical psychology. His latest book, 50 Great Myths of Popular Psychology: Shattering Widespread  Misconceptions About Human Behavior, co-written with Steven Jay Lynn,  John Ruscio and the late Barry Beyerstein.
Earlier this year he lectured on &lsquo;Blink or Think?  A Skeptic&rsquo;s Guide to the Pros and Cons of Commonsense Intuition&lsquo;, which involved critical evaluations of recent popular claims that intuitions, gut hunches, and &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; are useful guides for evaluating the natural world and for distinguishing scientific from pseudoscientific claims.
Additionally mentioned in this episode is the bookstore &lsquo;Embiggen Books&lsquo;, which is an Australian supplier of excellent pro-science and skeptical books! http://embiggenbooks.com. I also recommend you check out the interview conducted by Point of Inquiry&rsquo;s Dr Karen Stollznow.

            <description><![CDATA[An exclusive! Scott Sigler - New York Times best-selling author and podcaster was in my town for this weekend!
SwanCon is a science-fiction convention that is held across the 2010 Easter break at the Four Seasons hotel in Perth, Western Australia. Scott Sigler was a guest on several panels and made presentations, such as the pitfalls of publishing, his expertise in science fiction and horror genres and advice for budding authors.
Scott's works combine many genres, including science fiction, horror and thriller. His second major published novel, Contagious, made the New York Times best seller list. Its precursor, Infected, has been optioned as a motion picture production. Scott was also responsible for releasing the world's first podcast-only novel, Earthcore. All of his stories are freely available to listen to as audiobooks in serialised form.
Scott's re-release of his novel, Ancestor, was available at the convention - at the same time, 'The Starter' was released during his time here and has already hit nearly 1000 copies sold! We talk about science, fiction, skepticism and literacy just as the convention wrapped up for this year.
Scott Sigler's official site can be found at http://www.scottsigler.com/

            <description><![CDATA[Thanks to everyone who picked up one of the Token Skeptic stickers at the Global Atheist convention last weekend - and here&rsquo;s a little bonus just for you!
I interviewed Julian Morrow of the Chaser, who featured at the Saturday night dinner. The Chaser is an Australian satirical comedian group, most famous for their television programmes on Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The Chaser originated as a satirical newspaper which was known to push the limits as to what it published and for enacting its mission statement, &ldquo;striving for mediocrity in a world of excellence&rdquo;.
The full interview (since this is only a segment of a larger interview) will feature in a forthcoming episode on the Skeptic Zone podcast. This is just a little thanks to everyone who showed support and to commemorate the wonderful experience I had taking part in the convention.
Do send in your thanks to the organisers of the Global Atheist Convention if you attended and haven&rsquo;t zipped them a note already - I look forward to seeing you all again (and more people!) at future events that the Token Skeptic podcast will take part in.
By the way - the sticker that people got at the convention is the brainchild of the most wonderful Catherine of Faster Pussycat Productions. I&rsquo;ve found no better in terms of creating special products like my snappy business card, the stickers and many more items like the badges and flyers that you&rsquo;ll see at Skeptic Zone and Token Skeptic appearances. Do check her site out!

            <description><![CDATA[Welcome to an interview on a topic that has been buzzing all over the blogosphere! Daniel Loxton's posts on Skeptic Blog, called &ldquo;The Standard Pablum&rdquo; &mdash; Science and Atheism and Further Thoughts on Atheism discuss reviews and issues raised by his new book Evolution: How We and All Living Things Came to Be.
Since comments on those posts have numbered over two-hundred and the debate has raged onto other people's sites - I took this opportunity to get Daniel's perspective and gain some understanding on his views about skepticism, atheism and his thoughts on how people viewed his new book.

			<title>Token Skeptic #11 - On Cognitive Dissonance And Hopeopathy</title>

            <description><![CDATA[Why is Professor Hood featuring on this episode of the Token Skeptic? Because if you follow his blog at www.brucemhood.wordpress.com, you'll see how he is very much involved with some rather 'unbelievable' developments in the UK.
Firstly, his efforts to challenge fake bomb-detectors - costly dowsing-rod-like devices being used by the military in countries world-wide - has been broadcast on BBC news and discussed by governments in places like Thailand and Iraq.
Secondly, he has some very interesting insights on homeopathy (or as he put it, hope-o-pathy!) and the report on the funding of it in the UK by the National Health Services. His site has practically exploded with comments by the skeptically-minded due to his breakdown of 'why hopeopathy is not likely to disappear.'
Since this show is about superstition and the science behind it (as well as the occasional other topics that intrigue me as a skeptically-minded person who always wants to know more) - I asked him to clarify his position and respond to some of the arguments that were posed.
He's very active on Twitter with his account called Supersense - so that's where I began the following interview!

            <description><![CDATA[Welcome to another special episode of the Token Skeptic - and thanks to everyone who keeps on subscribing to this show despite there being a gap between the episodes. Just when I think I&rsquo;ve solved one technical hiccup, another appears - this time my recordings were apparently too soft to register and the quality had even me straining to figure out what I said!
So, I'll be rerecording the missing episodes and I really am very grateful that people continue to listen and comment.
Comments is what this episode is all about - it's a discussion between Michael McRae, who you heard in the last episode of the Token Skeptic and Eran Segev. Eran Segev is a reporter on another podcast we have in common, called the Skeptic Zone. Eran is also the President of the Australian Skeptics.
Many thanks to SkepReview: http://www.skepreview.com and to Alom Shaha for inspiring me.

            <description><![CDATA[When I was at the recent 10:23 Event at the Perth Skeptics, plenty of new people came to ask questions about what skeptics and skepticism is achieving. They included such things as - is this really science communication? Could we be doing more harm than good by such stunts or is it part of an important 'bigger picture' that's being presented? What should be the next step? Were people drawn in because of nerdy stereotypes or skeptics being 'sexed-up' - and is it misleading or preventing progress to go down those paths when promoting skepticism?
All of these notions and views have intrigued me since taking part in the 'What Do I Do Next? Leading Skeptics Discuss 105 Practical Ways to Promote Science and Advance  Skepticism' document. In response to my experiences I took an opportunity to speak to Michael McRae, a science communicator and former science teacher. He's the author of 'Tribal Science: Brains, Beliefs and Bad Ideas', out in 2011, and he blogs at www.tribalscientist.wordpress.com.
Other episodes backdated and out by end of this weekend - thanks for your patience and thanks for continuing to listen to the show! Themes by Derek Miller ('P &amp; P') at www.penmachine.com and Milton Mermikades ('365') at www.miltonmermikades.com.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[New Year superstitions have always intrigued me - simply because there's so many of them and not much has been said about 'why?' From the recent news of injury in the Philippines due to unsafe use of celebratory fireworks, to the Scottish tradition of 'First Footing', there's a lot going on to commemorate the start of the New Year.Music used in this episode includes the Brobdingnagian Bards of www.thebards.net.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[New Year superstitions have always intrigued me - simply because there's so many of them and not much has been said about 'why?' From the recent news of injury in the Philippines due to unsafe use of celebratory fireworks, to the Scottish tradition of 'First Footing', there's a lot going on to commemorate the start of the New Year.Music used in this episode includes the Brobdingnagian Bards of www.thebards.net.

			<title>Token Skeptic #1 - On Santa</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/tokenskeptic/Token_Skeptic_1_-_On_Santa.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On Santa - a first-run effort at the show! Re-release for December, 2010.While listening to a great Skepticality podcast episode (www.skepticality.com), I found I had many unanswered questions. Delving into the research, I started checking out what research has been done into belief in Santa. Is it such a bad thing to believe in Santa... and how would you gather evidence about the pros and cons? Could belief in Santa, the Easter Bunny, the tooth fairy and so forth, be a natural part of childhood development... and can it be used to tell us more about human nature?
Intro song is 'P &amp; P' by Derek K Miller of http://www.penmachine.com.Outro song is "What If Every Day Were Christmas", by Podsafe for Peace, produced by Slau and co-written by Orlando Pagan, from www.podsafeforpeace.org.&nbsp;]]></description>
