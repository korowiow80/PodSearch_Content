            <description>We're back! Technically, this is the fifth entry in the Tohubohu Productions Producer Podcast, but let's be honest. The last three were prerecorded commentary tracks. Valuable and educational, perhaps (and not available to the general public before now), but not exactly original. So at last we've got some new content for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This time, your host William Coughlan is joined by longtime Tohubohu storyboard artist and D.P. Adam Young. Topics include the latest team updates and some information on the tools of the no-budget indie trade, specifically Dan Selakovich's book &quot;Killer Camera Rigs That you Can Build.&quot;</description>
