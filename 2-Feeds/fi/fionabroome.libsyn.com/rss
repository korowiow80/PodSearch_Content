			<title>Ghosts - Residual Energy Solutions</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://fionabroome.libsyn.com/ghosts-residual-energy-solutions]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Lately, many people have asked me about hauntings that -- to me, anyway -- sound like they're dealing with residual energy.<br /><br /><em>Remember:</em> Many ghost hunters believe that emotionally charged events leave an imprint or energy residue on the physical objects nearby.<br /><br />That energy residue can manifest as an odd feeling, or an overpowering emotional flood, and it can even trigger EMF spikes.<br /><br />These hauntings can be triggered by certain personalities. They can also happen on anniversaries (such as when a battle happened) or even on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.&nbsp; (Gilson Road Cemetery in NH seems to become active every day starting at about 11:30 a.m.)<br /><br />Residual energy hauntings don't involve ghosts.&nbsp; I'm not sure that residual energy hauntings can cause EVPs, but if the voice is always the same and saying the same things over &amp; over again, it might be residual energy.<br /><br />Residual energy hauntings will usually decrease over time.&nbsp; That time period may be days, months, years or hundreds of years.&nbsp; It all depends on the original event that left energy there, and how much the energy has been recharged.<br /><br />However, if you'd like to disperse the energy sooner, we seem to have the best luck using alternative sensory approaches.&nbsp; I use a Feng Shui "singing bowl" while others often like sage smudges or incense.<br /><br />If that's too weird or <em>woo-woo</em> for you, try a vacuum cleaner instead.&nbsp; The louder the vacuum, the better.&nbsp; Vacuum every part of the room, especially the corners that are often overlooked, including the corners at the ceiling.<br /><br />Or, use a radio or CD player and turn the music up so it's really loud.<br /><br />You'll need to experiment with this, as different sensory tools seem to work better in different environments.&nbsp; In addition, your initial results may not be permanent, so you may have to repeat the vacuuming (or whatever) over and over again.<br /><br />One warning: If you use sensory tools to disperse the residual energy and the haunting gets dramatically worse, you might be dealing with an actual entity such as a ghost.&nbsp; So, if the problem gets worse, don't repeat the sensory approach.</p>

			<title>EMF and Ghosts</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://fionabroome.libsyn.com/emf-and-ghosts]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this 7-minute mini-podcast, author and ghost hunter Fiona Broome offers alternative explanations for EMF at haunted locations.</p>
<p>Her explanations for "ghostly" EMF include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The EMF is the energy display of a ghost.</li>
<li>High EMF indicates an opening between the worlds.</li>
<li>The EMF is actually generated by the living people at the site, perhaps as a beacon or a defense mechanism.</li>
<li>EMF may be a response by the physical location (residual energy haunting) to paranormal stimuli.</li>
</ul>
<p>The logical questions would include: If EMF surges aren't actually created by the ghosts, how can we use EMF detectors to get answers to yes/no questions?</p>
<p>The simplest answers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The EMF doesn't come from the ghost, but the ghost knows how to manipulate it to cause different readings.&nbsp; (For example, he or she may be able to open and close the "window" through which EMF leaks into our world from the other side.)</li>
<li>Someone in the area is able to (consciously or unconsciously) manipulate the EMF meter (perhaps with PK) or the actual EMF energy levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fiona's point is:&nbsp; TV shows and other "experts" insist that EMF is actually emitted by a ghost.&nbsp; We can't prove that, and it's a mistake to work with that assumption.</p>]]></description>
