Hill and Steve Bremner chat it up again, and this time cover 'the new Jezebel'--which is nothing more than a newly packaged old lie, which basically discourages anybody from asking questions or challenging things that are said or done.  It's a subtle form of manipulation that some leaders use in order to insulate themselves from being challenged.  It's a form of manipulation, plain and simple.

We discuss how this works, and spend the second half of the conversation discussing practical ways we can change this in our own personal lives and in our fellowship with one another.  Give it a listen as it's definitely the most insightful conversation the three of us have had together on the podcast so far.

<p>We shoot the breeze and discuss the <a href="http://mikebreen.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/the-difference-between-huddles-and-small-groups-and-why-many-people-use-both/">differences between missional community and house churches</a>.  Is it just an alternative to &#8220;big churches?&#8221;  What is a community on mission together?  When the writer of Hebrews talks about not forsaking gathering together, is this referring to attending a weekly service, or something more profoundly missed in our modern context?</p>
<p>Mark and Shaun also brought up some very interesting points in this discussion, about how there is no &#8216;<a href="http://mikebreen.wordpress.com/2012/01/20/churches-looking-for-a-silver-bullet-in-a-microwave-culture/">magic silver bullet</a>&#8216; to community, but it takes lots of time and hard work.  Are you willing to put in the commitment and sacrifice?  In launching missional communities, or in planting house churches, by and large, are we going to the pattern of Scripture for our foundation, or looking at the culture around us and mixing it in with our desires and preferences for what an MC is supposed to look like?</p>

<p>Join us this week as <a href="http://stevebremner.com/about/" target="_blank">Steve Bremner</a> has a sacred cow barbecue with a couple of insightful authors:  SJ Hill, international speaker and author of <em><em>Enjoying God </em></em>and previous recurring guest on the podcast, along with Dr Stephen R. Crosby, author of <em><em>Authority, Accountability and the Apostolic Movement</em></em>.</p>
<p>We tackle this stuff today: Do we base our idea of accountability on the Bible, or businesses or even the military?  Is accountability enforced or lived out by signing documents?  Does the Bible <em>really</em> teach pastors or leaders are superior in any way to the rest of the Body of Christ?</p>

<p>With all the much ado being made about a certain large mega church having made members sign documents for &#8216;discipline&#8217; in the name of adherence to Matthew 18, and all the opinion being spouted online in blogs and some news articles about the subject matter, we thought we&#8217;d give our two cents worth and spend time interpreted the whole of the chapter of Matthew 18 for context and ask if people properly apply the principles laid out in this chapter of the Gospels.</p>

Do you know the purpose of your generation?  According to several surveys and studies, the current generation in America under the age of 30 outnumbers the Baby Boomer generation, and these are the ones who are going to be tomorrow's leaders, innovators, politicians, and.....church leaders.  But yet only 1 in 20 consider themselves spiritual or Christian.

We also, primarily talk today about this current generation, as well as continue where we left off last week and talk about the messes of the gift of prophecy, and have safe environments to grow in the prophetic.

How do we deal with conflicting prophetic words from well-known credible men of God and church leaders, not the least of which includes dealing with when prophetic words never come to pass and they remove their prophecies from YouTube or their webpages?

How can we know when it's OK to reject a Word someone gives us, AS they're giving it to us, even if their track record is excellent?

Are there such things as 'divine appointments'?

Does God have a pre-arranged soulmate for each one of us?

Can we know whether we're in God's permissive will or His perfect will?  Or do such distinctions even exist in the God journey?

This was definitely a fascinating discussion for me as we touched on some sacred cows.

<p>We post this rather urgent discussion about eternity and eternal matters, because in a current season when many people are talking about hell, it seems most are just watering it down or re-writing Scripture.  So, that&#8217;s why today on the podcast, Joel Crumpton shares his thoughts with Steve Bremner concerning this important and sobering subject, as well as his expertise  in soul winning on the streets for over 27 years.  Joel shares powerful testimonies of God using him, and encourages  you to share your faith with others.</p>

<p>We tried to discuss and answer some of the following questions: Does God really send disasters and calamities to cities and nations in order to teach its people lessons?  If so, does it work?  Does a ‘rapture mentality’ produce a people interested in what happens in the earth during their generation?  Does the Church have way too pessimistic of an outlook when it comes to God’s involvement in the earth today? Does the Church embrace too much fatalism when it comes to dealing with every day events and natural disasters as they happen around the world?</p>
<p>How Is The Church specifically, and the culture in general, supposed to deal with ‘doom and gloom prophets whose ‘prophecies’ don’t come to pass?  No, we’re not talking about fringe groups but ones who are more mainstream and accepted in both evangelical and charismatic circles.</p>

<p>Are you multiplying yourself into other people?&nbsp; What about those who you call ‘disciples’? Are you actually discipling others or keeping them at a distance, teaching them with words or studies, but unwilling to allow them access to you?</p>

<p>We cover the usual passages this topic elicits, and look today in depth at Acts chapters 2, 8, 10, 15, and 19 mostly and had little time for much else, so it might be a topic we revisit in the near future, and spend a little bit of time in 1 Corinthians 14.</p>
<p>What does “do all speak in tongues” mentioned in passing in 1 Cor 12:30 refer to? Are all tongues created equal?  Does the Bible really say that one needs an interpreter every time they speak in tongues?</p>

<p>Is it really beneficial or even necessary for the believer in the New Covenant?  What is true fasting? Do we have any commands in the New Testament that we&#8217;re to fast, or was that part of Jewish culture?  Is it about abstaining from only food, or other things?  In what situation did Jesus say &#8220;this kind only goes out by prayer and fasting?&#8221;  You may be surprised, so join us in what is going to be the first in at least two parts on the subject.  This week&#8217;s intro, &#8220;<em>Fire To My Soul</em>&#8221; by Demon Hunter.</p>
<p>Check out Steve&#8217;s exposition of Matthew 17:14-21 here in an article called &#8220;<em><a href="http://stevebremner.com/2009/04/because-of-whose-little-faith/" target="_blank">Because of Whose &#8220;Little Faith?</a></em>&#8220;And visit here for David&#8217;s article on <em><a href="http://www.fireonyourhead.org/2009/04/10/the-hidden-manna/" target="_blank">The Hidden Manna</a></em> mentioned during the discussion.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Join us today as we finally have back on the show our guest and Fire On Your Head blog author Bryan Purtle.  Today we discuss the crucial role Israel plays in the unfolding of God's end time plans.  If you have enjoyed the previous two shows on the rapture, make sure to check this out as we give focus to just the role Israel plays.  What Is replacement theology? How does the timing of the rapture fit into all the Old Testament prophetic writings concerning Jacob's trouble? Find out as we discuss a raptured escaped Church versus a "Corrie ten Boom" generation.  This week's intro: Absolute, by Thousand Foot Krutch.

Articles by Bryan:

Yahweh is Coming With Fire, Beholding The Coin of Israel, The Cruciality of Israel &#x38; Eschatology,

		<itunes:summary>Finally, a new episode is up!  It's been a crazy summer--or winter here in Peru!  We have S.J. Hill today talking about Romans 14 and First Corinthians 9--not judging one another over personal preferences in our walks with God, AND giving up things when we know we're a stumbling block to others.  S.J. shares some humorous and yet sad examples of what some of our 'convictions'  do to others when we put them on others when the Holy Spirit is not dealing with them in that area.  What is the difference between a conviction and a preference?  How do we have grace with and for others who may not share our personal convictions?  All in all, an important topic, and a must listen.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/4274/stonestonguegg4.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="174" align="left" />Are tongues <em>always</em> a heavenly language, or are they <em>only</em> known languages&#8211;or both?  Is it Biblical or even a good idea to Google search the tongues you speak to see if they are actual words in other languages?  Join us today as our favorite fiery Russian apologist Dima Kurovsky shares his findings after deciding to give it a shot and see if the tongues he prays are actual words in any other languages. The results will make you laugh sometimes, but mostly encourage and surprise you&#8211;in a good way.</p>
<p>Hopefully the next show will be with Dan again, and will cover updates on the time in Holland these past weeks.  This week&#8217;s intro: <em>&#8220;Coming Back To Life</em>&#8221; by Blindside</p>

Were some of the healing commands God gave the disciples only for them to do in their generation?  Does Matthew 7:21-23 teach that healing ministers are apostate?  Does healing the sick really interfere with God’s sovereignty?  How does sowing and reaping play a part in sovereignty and divine healing?</p>

What about those godly people who’ve sought God for healing but never got it, and even died in some cases?  Does Scripture really teach that God gives us something different than what we ask Him for?

Hill joining us, whose all-consuming passion is to see the Church come to an understanding of the beauty of God's incredible personality.  We sit down over Skype with him and talk about the heart of Father God, and ask him questions regarding these issues that he's so passionate about sharing.

Do you have to get the sin out of your life <em>first</em> before God can heal you or use you to heal others?  What is the atonement?   Join us as we barbecue some sacred cows about healing, and do our best to convince you that God doesn’t play favorites with his children on this matter. Summer school update: we have one confirmed speaker.  Listen to find out who it is, <a href="http://www.netbits.nl/client/FIRE/signup.html" target="_blank">click here</a> if you&#8217;d like to register.  Also expect a bit of a hiatus until June in terms of how often new Fire On Your Head episodes get posted, as Steve will be in Peru for 6 weeks.</p>

Many Christians are like Peter – they have no clue and have not left their comfort zone to know how ill-prepared they are for the cause.  Satan has lulled many to sleep in peacetime to be blind and comatose to the war we are in.

<p>Listen to this message by Jerome Ocampo about why a transfer needs to take place, and the generations must join together in order to accomplish in the earth today what God has in mind for this generation—or miss it altogether.
