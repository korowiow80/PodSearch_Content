      <title>Episode 85: Prophetic Vision &amp; Today&#8217;s Technology</title>

Do you know the purpose of your generation?&amp;nbsp; According to several surveys and studies, the current generation in America under the age of 30 outnumbers the Baby Boomer generation, and these are the ones who are going to be tomorrow's leaders, innovators, politicians, and.....church leaders.&amp;nbsp; But yet only 1 in 20 consider themselves spiritual or Christian. Dave Edwards and Steve Bremner discuss a bit of what living in a post Christian culture is starting to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also, primarily talk today about this current generation, as well as continue where we left off last week and talk about the messes of the gift of prophecy, and have safe environments to grow in the prophetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we deal with conflicting prophetic words from well-known credible men of God and church leaders, not the least of which includes dealing with when prophetic words never come to pass and they remove their prophecies from YouTube or their webpages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we know when it's OK to reject a Word someone gives us, AS they're giving it to us, even if their track record is excellent?&lt;/p&gt;
