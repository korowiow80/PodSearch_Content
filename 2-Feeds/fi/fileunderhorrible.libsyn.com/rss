            <link><![CDATA[http://fileunderhorrible.libsyn.com/fu-hcast-episode-057-grind-that-organ]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Board up you windows, the FUHcast has risen! Bill hacks his was through the Rundown before Jim discusses his NON-murderous Memorial Day weekend and shares his SPOILER FREE review of Men In Black III. Bill wonders (aloud) why Saturday Night Live is still on the air before sharing his stories of electronic child abduction, shameless self-promotion, and drunkenness while on his vacation in "the Hamptons of the Midwest, Door County Wisconsin". The discussion turns to the recent horrific news events concerning homeless face eating, intestine tossing, and biochemical spills of Romero proportions. News of DC Comics rebooting a Green Lantern as a gay superhero sparks a discussion on discussions concerning gay and straight comic books some slightly confusing aspects of that whole.......topic. A quick game of "What's A Sex Organ" is played before FUH confirms that comic books cannot turn children gay. George Lucas announces that he's making a change in &nbsp;his life as if anyone will care or notice. Bill and Jim expose "indie" for what indie is: not indie. The guys make their predictions for the upcoming Electronic Entertainment Expo (2012) to close out the show. They'll give you a report on E3 if a report is worthy to be given next week. Bill also apologizes for killing Ween. We'll see you next week!</p>

			<title>FUHcast Episode 056: Top 5 Horrible Songs Of The 1990s</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://fileunderhorrible.libsyn.com/fu-hcast-ep-56-mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It doesn't matter if you were a flannel wearing mumbler or sweating-too-much mother-knocker-outer, you lived through the 90s and it's music helped you make it out alive. Like everything else in life, there was definitely some good, bad and HORRIBLE music in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Join Bill and Jim as they take you through an audio retrospective of the decade of discontent. The guys tasked themselves with each finding 5 songs from the 90s that they feel deserve placement in the "HORRIBLE" category. There is bound to be some controversy, so grab a Boku and a Fruit By The Foot and try not to spaz out.&nbsp;</p>

			<title>FUHcast Episode 055: Y'all Dost Protest Too Much</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://fileunderhorrible.libsyn.com/fu-hcast-episode-055-y-all-dost-protest-too-much]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Jim dons his riot gear and pushes back the rundown. The guys get local and talk about Chicago's fast and furious heat wave and the not so fast and annoyingly furious protesters at the Chicago NATO Summit.&nbsp;Jim gives us another spoiler free review of the ever so creepy Jonny Depp in Dark Shadows.&nbsp;The topic switches over to girls who grow up on camera and the men who covet them just a little too early (like Creepy Uncle Jim).&nbsp;Will Smith was caught on tape bitch slapping a celebrity news reporter in Russia recently. Was it a love tap or a premeditated Fresh Prince of "Bitch, I'll Split Your Wig"? Details in the story lead to a short discussion on gay marriage and FUH's thoughts on President Obama's recent statement on the topic.&nbsp;The future of SNL is brought up quickly before Jim gets to talk about the recent backstage firing on his favorite television show, NBC's Community. Bill believes that the internet is the new bastion for television shows that are put out to pasture. Thirty minutes of (previously exclusive) audio from The Water Cooler podcast's 12 hour podcast marathon for St. Baldrick's charity is unearthed and shared with the File Under Horrible audience for the first time in it's entirety to close out the show! We'll see you next week when we travel back in time to the 1990s to jam out to some horrible songs!</p>

<p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small;">What was I saying! Oh yeah! Welcome to&nbsp;FUHcast! Bill chimes in with the rundown. Nothing much happened this week for the boys, so we get right down into it. Jim talks about his frustration with the Ultimate Spider-Man comic series. The guys examine Harvard's recent study on Facebook over sharing. Is it really as satisfying as a sexual encounter? Hear about what happened to Bill after he took on 30 ounces of milk. Bill wants to create a college course dedicated to proving that Alton Brown (who Jim LOVES) is a zombie. The conversation then switches to John Travolta's sex scandal, but not before a discussion on Estelle&nbsp;Getty, loose meats, words some people don't enjoy, the trouble with talcum powder and poor commercial placement, and special vaginal products. How in the hell do you&nbsp;pluralize&nbsp;masseuse? After finally getting to the "meat" of the Travolta story, the guys discuss gay Hollywood before touching upon the music of Stevie Wonder and the possibility of Stevie accidently impregnating his sister. The guys break down the hoopla surrounding the breast feeding mom on the cover of Time magazine. Television is the next topic casualty as&nbsp;FUH&nbsp;discusses new shows, renewed shows and canceled shows. An excellent stop by the Imagination Theater helps everyone to understand how some of these horrible shows get made. The guys try some reverse psychology before signing off on another&nbsp;<span style="color: #000000;"><span color="#ff0000" style="color: #ff0000;">FUHcast</span></span>!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Check your privacy settings, it's time for another FUHcast! Bill skeets his way through the rundown before welcoming his good friend Sean on as guest co-host. Jim is off at Anime Central this week. Sean is also attending the convention, which prompts a discussion on cosplay and general wild wooliness of geek cons. The conversation heads straight to the gutter as Bill and Sean perform an audio critic on the lastest YouTube craze: The Facebook Jack-Off Bandit. Hear the touching love story of a blue haired gal and her red mohawked fella sharing their love in a Chicago public restroom as told on Craigslist. After a rant from Bill on subject of overly complicated music genre names, we'll hear a song from Sean's "dirt rock/psychobilly" band 13 Angels. A disgusting new law in Egypt which may actually turn necrophilia into a civil right gets thrown into the FUHcast Imagination Theater. Are kids really drinking hand sanitizer to get drunk or has the the American public simply run out of things to blame on kids? All this and a little bit more on this week's FUHcast!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Holy nerd hygiene Batman, it's a brand new FUHcast! This week, the guys return to the mics after a weekend full of geeky festivities at the Chicago Comic and Entertainment Expo (C2E2). The guys were very proud to say that this was the first event they attended as press. You'll hear tales of the sights that were to be seen, the flesh that was to be touched (or avoided at all costs), and some of the general and wonderful weirdness that was to be experienced. Hear how fun parking at a Chicago convention center can be. The guys remind us to check out the site for some written reviews and more in-depth coverage from this extremely visual event. The topic of podcasts and podcasting in general is briefly discussed. The focus then switches to messages left on the FUHcast Hotline; something that you won't want to miss. We'll see you next week!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Open wide, little ones, it's time for FUHcast! Bill starts off the show by chewing up and spitting out this week's Rundown. Get ready Chicago nerds, FUH is coming to C2E2 this month! Movie Talk is the highlight of this week's show: The racist Twitter lash out at The Hunger Games has the guys turning different colors in anger. Eddie Murphy injects some color into a sequel to a cheesy 80's buddy movie. Step back into the glass house of emotion with anchor Ron. Alicia Silverstone mistakes her house for a nest and her toddler Bear for a bird. Justin Bieber gets his kicks by pimping out phone numbers of the elderly. The nerds get off their asses and into the post office; armed with baked goods. Bill and Jim give you some lessons in social network spoiler&nbsp;etiquette. Won't spoil it, but you'll definitely want to listen ALL THE WAY to the end of this week's FUHcast! See you next week, kitty cats!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Drop kick your jacket, it's time for FUHcast! Jim returns to the show and runs through this week's Rundown. Mass Effect 3 is so full of controversy that people are starting to sue. Bill thinks the whole thing is stupid and that people need to get over it. Let him know what you think! A new caller to the FUHcast Hotline gets personal which leads to tales of carnivals and copious amounts of man juice. Michael Bay shell shocks movie fans and 80's pop culture fans when he reveals his plans to rape a beloved cartoon franchise. The boys discuss the latest news in the CBS V Kitty Glitter Amazon Kindle debacle. You really need to read Kitty if you hope to understand Kitty. Our crazy friends in Florida are at it again: this time, a man calls the police because his wife won't go to sleep. A very brief discussion on Dark Shadows, another Tim Burton/Johnny Depp love affair, goes off the rails for nearly 20 minutes as FUH discusses beloved 80's and 90's sitcoms and other things that will have you questioning what the topic was in the first place. See you next week!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Grab your tissue, it's time for FUHcast! Effie sits in as special guest co-host as Jim battles The Great Allergy Plague of 2012. Bill chugs on through the Rundown. Effie has been getting some Revenge on the TV while Bill is busy loudly cursing at Mass Effect 3. T3 calls in with a Mario Kart question and opinion request. The thirst for internet has landed jobs for the homeless, but it's definitely not what you might think. A quite dead chap in the UK insists on sending email to his friends and family. Bill re-imagines "Ghost" in modern times. The guy behind the Kony instant activism video was caught "serving the warlord of man sauce" in public (NICE!). Bill and Effie talk a bit about the local Chicago news (or lack of). By public demand, "The Garbage Pail Kids" are coming back to the big screen!........There is a public demand, right? Bill and Jim be appearing at Chicago's C2E2 this year (if only Bill could remember ANY information)! Take your Benadryl and we'll see you next FUHcast!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Don your raincoats, this FUHcast is droppin' loads! Jim starts us off with some Rundown foreplay. FUH mini reviews (no spoilers!) are first up: Jim saw Disney's John Carter, Bill stayed awake through NBC's Awake, and Bill is hooked on Mass Effect 3. Shitty Spielberg! Whatcha gonna do when Hulk Hogan's sex tape surfaces and completely kills your sex drive, brother? T3 calls in to wish Jim a happy birthday. &nbsp;Hear File Under Horrible's EXCLUSIVE Hogan porno promotional ad that is not meant for your ears! Speaking of sex and things that aren't meant for your ears.......Rush Limbaugh is a thing that is happening. Wesley Crusher: Teenage F*ck Machine is required reading. Hear about that and other weird books on Amazon.com. Somehow, white trash in clown makeup have figured out how to use the internet; find out what website to stay away from. Is the "new" iPad worth the asking price? Do you care? Figure it out and come back next week!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Stop your vehicle and check your pants, it's time for FUHcast! Bill takes control of the Rundown to start off the show. T3 calls in with a long awaited voicemail that unfortunately results in the unexpected return of a former "guest". Bill found Billy Crystal's retro racist Oscars performance to be rather boring. Bill Murray decides that busting no longer makes him feel good, leaving Ghostbusters 3 in limbo. An unplanned, yet in-depth discussion on a painfully boring Bill Murray movie ensures. Bill discusses why he no longer considers himself a gamer. Jim does still consider himself a gamer and has an opinion on Sony's Vita. Japan has created something even more disturbing than tenticle porn: a HUGE device that is capable of making people literally choke on their words. Apple may be planning new iPads that are suitable for usage cycles; light or heavy. Bill explains to Jim the importance of professional wrestling school and how it is not at all like a clown college. Wanna hear the story about the guy in Florida who got a DUI while having a "sexual anal plug in his rectum"? If not, better skip the last six minutes of this week's FUHcast!</p>

Jim blasts The Rundown into your ears before Bill admits to totally screwing up The Oscars (more than Billy Crystal did) for everyone. A FUHcast Hotline caller totally agrees with Bill on his thoughts on The Office. &nbsp;Borat is going to take a huge dump on the red carpet. The guys get real when the examine racism on the internet when the discuss the bigot Florida teens on YouTube. FUH is going to play a small part of a huge podcast event and they tell you how to hear it. There is finally a way to kill helpless homeless folks with your smartphone. Ever wonder if the judicial system could do anything as crazy in real life as they do on television? Hint: It happens and it involves Facebook. See you next week!</p>

			<title>FUHcast Episode 040: Widdle a Dizzle For My Fizzle</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://fileunderhorrible.libsyn.com/fu-hcast-episode-040-widdle-a-dizzle-for-my-fizzle]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Bill kicks off the show with the Rundown. Jim recounts his weekend. Tales of raw fish, incontinent friends, and improv theater. A spoiler free review of 'Chronicle'. Osama Been Rottin' is on the jihad path in a new B-horror zombie flick that YOU can fund. Scotland Yard and the FBI get a "C" in their "A &amp; B" conversation in the form of everyone's favorite hacker group. A man in Nigeria is convinced that his wife is hell bent on killing him with sex. You won't believe the tangent that comes off of this already bizarre story. Horrible, horrible music created by doting celebrity musician fathers is discussed (with audio!). Bill disagrees with annoying songs that get stuck in his head and with the logic behind their use in commercials. Bill shows us how easy it is to create a crappy indie song. Rizzle out with your dizzle out to this week's FUHcast!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Mind your slip, Mildred! Them boys from the FUHcast are eyein' you again! Jim kicks it off with another rousing Rundown. Bill gives quick reviews on Fox's new shows: Alcatraz and Touch. Jim saw a new silent movie (The Artist) and didn't even take a Delorean to go see it. Google is putting their hands all up in your privates. Do you actually need to be concerned? Twitter is going to start censoring is certain countries (YES!). Nintendo is getting ready to blast off (back) into the year 2000 with the new "Nintendo Network". Is it too little, too late for the big N? (And does calling Nintendo "The Big N" make anyone else uncomfortable?) A drunk in Wisconsin let a ghost beat the crap out of his wife and got arrested for it, but not really. Is there a sign above our storage facility that says "Dead Grandma Storage"? Find out (the answer is "no") on this week's FUHcast!</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://fileunderhorrible.libsyn.com/fu-hcast-episode-038-defamately-libel-to-be-sued]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>You can stop protesting! It's time for another FUHcast! Bill starts off the show with a Rundown that Jim believes may get FUH sued. Bill talks about the trials and tribulations of kicking a nasty habit. With the Golden Globes behind us and the Oscars in our future, Jim leads off with some movie talk. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is briefy (and without spoilers) reviewed. Out of nowhere, the guys have a discussion on indie music. SOPA and PIPA may be nearly dead, but should we be worried about the OPEN Act or embrace it as the happy, fluffy, squishy piece of legislation that everyone seems to be making it out to be? Hacker group Anonymous came back with a vengence and took out some fairly impressive targets. What's next for the mysterious hackers in masks? The guys rip apart the disgusting human Twinkie that is heart hating "cook" Paula Deen in light of her recent get-rich-off-secret-diabetes venture. Get your ticket for a quick trip to File Under Horrible's Imagination Theater; where "Sex, Hives, and Chicken Nuggets" is being shown. All this and more (that is sure to be mentioned in court) on this week's FUHcast! See you next week!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>What's red, black, white, and back in your ears? NO! It's not bloody, waxy discharge. Geez! It's a BRAND NEW FUHcast! Jim kicks off the first episode of 2012 with the Rundown. After a brief explanation as to what the hell happened to the original episode 37, we actually get to hear the surviving bit of that episode. Bill takes his handheld into the third dimension. Hopefully he doesn't poke his eye out (or get arrested)! Jim has had a lot of time to surf the internet during the extended break; hear what he's into. Hear what happens when Sam Jackson gets on Xbox Live!. Is Sesame Street in need of some good old fashioned mother's milk? Geek out with Bill's impressions of Windows Phone 7.5. All this and a few extra phallic jokes, all on this week's FUHcast!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Return your trays to their upright positions, it's time for another FUHcast! Bill kicks off this weeks rundown before Jim fills us in on what Chicago's Christkindlmarket is all about (hint: there will be sausage). Bill wrestles certain doom on the highway when his car decides to stiffen up. We play audio from Jim's favorite internet clip of the week featuring a weird moment in day time TV chat. Presidential hopeful Rick Perry's new "Strong" video is getting a lot of (well deserved) e-hate. Even Jesus Christ has something to say. FUH salutes the newly departed comic book great Jerry Robinson. We break down the recent Alec Baldwin dancing of shame. A man in the UK used to love her, TRIED to kill her, and failed harder than a Chicago sports team. Nintendo has some big news.....or do they? The easiest way to find out is by listening to this week's FUHcast! We'll see you next week!</p>

Horrible baby names are discussed when the guys talk about a couple in Germany who gave their ginumbous baby an......interesting name. Hanson, those annoying tow-headed little bastards from the 90's are back and this time, they are serving up some mmm-beer! Bill channels his inner James Brown as FUH discusses other possible celebrity booze products. "Drag Bill To The Movies" event results are in: Will Bill go BACK to the movies? The Muppets (movie) is discussed with *MINOR SPOILERS*. Blame Canada for ginger hate crimes? Yes! The boys explore the workings of the recent Kick-A-Ginger Day held in one Canadian grade school.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's Cyber Monday's best deal going: free FUHcast! Bill mows down the Rundown before Jim depresses everyone with a recent death announcement. Is Google's cloud based Chome OS the future of computing? Black Friday came in like a lion (on crank) and left like a pepper spraying nutjob. Bill and Jim talk about the true meaning of the Christmas spirit. Ever think: "Hey! I think crotchless panties are what every 7 year old girl should be wearing!"? One Colorado clothing store does. A wannabe plastic surgeon transvestite with a flare for car maintenance tries her/his hand at a butt-job with painful results. Lock your barns! The Amish are coming for your sacred beards! Who exactly do you call when there is a ghost orgy in your living room? The only way to find out the answer to that important question is to listen to this week's FUHcast!&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Jim kicks off this week's show with an unintentionally naughty rundown. Porn and violence claims it's rightful place on Facebook; is it as big of a problem as everyone claims? From the pan to the bedroom, bacon isn't just for breakfast anymore. PETA takes on Super Mario with the aid of some hilariously bad flash games. Lothgar the Mixer Demon returns to aid the guys in telling the tale of a man and his donkey with "The A/V Club From Hell". Joker be damned, Batman is now setting his sights on cyber pedophiles! Strange Google Maps sightings in China have the conspiracy theory nutjobs (and FUH) buzzing. Pixar premier's the latest trailer for Brave. It has a lot of Heart. Ratings slump puts the future of NBC's Community in more danger than Chevy Chase's prostate. Jim loves the show and Bill wonders why horrible shows get the green light. Enjoy FUHcast while you can.....the government might be shutting down the internet by way of SOPA. What's SOPA wit dat? Enjoy your Turkey Day(s) and we'll see you next FUHcast!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hold on to your trucker hats, it's time for another FUHcast! This week, Bill and Jim visit a topic they haven't talked about in a while: VIDEO GAMES! Is the 3DS worth the investment? Skyrim and COD:MW3(wtf?) are all the rage this month. Are the guys into it? Matthew Fox portrays himself in "I'm A Whiney Drunk Bitch: The Matthew Fox Story". Detroit tries to keep their rich musical heritage respectable by attempting to kick Nickelback back to Canada. FUH discusses football coaching, book writing child molesters.....which turns into a rant about Ashton Kutcher....ehhh..you'll just have to listen. An Illinois man called the paramedics for his broken iPhone five times. Bill can't make too much fun and he shares some audio to explain why. Scandal hits the Oscars: Billy Crystal is in, Eddie Murphy is out. Confused? It'll all make sense as soon as you finish listening to this week's FUHcast!</p>

			<title>FUHcast Episode 030: The Beatings Will Continue</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://fileunderhorrible.libsyn.com/fu-hcast-episode-030-the-beatings-will-continue]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>They may not have won The People's Choice Podcast Award this year, but morale is up! It's the 30th episode of File Under Horrible's FUHcast! The guys talk a bit about the awards and what it was like to be nominated along side (and be beaten by) one of their favorites. Jim responds to a FUHcast Hotline question in a way that will have you reconsidering ever using the internet again. Movie talk spotlights what is coming to theaters....and what might put Bill to sleep. Harold "Pastor Doom" Camping retires after multiple failures at predicting the destruction of the world. Look out, Crips and Bloods! The Juggalos are looking to spray Faygo all over your turf, according to the FBI. Bill annouces the first listener event for FUHcast. If you are in the Chicagoland area, you'll definitely want to hear the pseudo-details. The video of the child beating Texas judge is discussed in a fairly uncomfortable segment. Equally uncomfortable is the strangulation story involving a man and his Star Wars toys. Geocaching is sweeping the nation and Bill's household seems to be the nerve center. The show closes with a fond farewell to Andy Rooney. Spend more than just a few minutes with this week's FUHcast!</p>

Bill and Jim try their best to recast 1987's disasterous Masters Of The Universe at the request of a caller on the FUHcast Hotline. Hear the golden tale of an Irishman who tries to do more than simply polish a turd. The guys weigh in on how much is too much when it comes to what to share on Facebook.

Sleep texting is becoming a problem for many cell phone users, including/especially Jim. Find out what creepy and cryptic messages he's been sending Bill in his slumber. Being a douchebag may actually get Fred Durst a TV sitcom. That Harry Pothead joke finally has something too it now that one of the cast got his wizard ass locked up on a drug charge.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Geeks ahoy! Jim opens up a can of auditory whoop ass with the rundown. Very special thanks are given to The Retroist (retroist.com) for their recent promotion of File Under Horrible and to all of those who helped nominate FUHcast for The People's Choice Podcast Award. The Michael Jackson death trial is underway and some disturbing Jacko audio is unearthed. Amazon unveils it's non-tablet tablet thingy, the Amazon Kindle Fire. Bill says it's a non-competitor in the category and Jim somehow finds a way to talk about his private parts, pushing Bill over the edge. Netflix splits in two; which way does FUH fall on the subject? Jim geeks out with some comic book movie talk while Bill would rather be fishing (or something). Jim heats things up with a little impromtu striptease; something that doesn't transfer well in an audio podcast. Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes are coming for Facebook. Bill tells you all about the new "timeline" and what he thinks of it. The show ends with a bizarre rant on the price of Legos before galloping into the geeky sunset of this week's FUHcast!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Bill kicks it off with the rundown (done on the 2nd try this time). Bill is hooked on AMC's Breaking Bad and a great sci-fi novel. FUHcast was on SAVE_US.T3 Live last week......did ya see it? Jim is looking forward to A LOT of new and returning TV shows this fall; the guys discuss what to watch on the tube. Crapping on a dead hedgehog in public will cost you less than the cost of an iPad. A discussion on celebrities and why they need lessons in "famous people with cell phones etiquette". The boys tell you to how keep your right to sue Sony with others. Did a not-so-sexy hot beef injection kill a woman in Illinois? Nasa gets a little closer to a galaxy far far away. All this and more stuff that will make you feel about as uncomfortable as Charlie Sheen's speech at the '11 Emmy Awards.....only on FUHcast! See ya next week!</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://fileunderhorrible.libsyn.com/fu-hcast-episode-021-black-market-bantha-fur]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A slow news week makes for a pretty weird FUHcast! The boys announce that they will be appearing on Save_Us.T3 LIVE on September 11th (brought to you by UStream) in full living color! They then dig into the news, starting with Matthew Fox vs Bus Driver Vagina. Green Day frontman gets thrown off flight due to his droopy pants. Did Apple REALLY lose ANOTHER iPhone prototype in a bar, or is it just a lame marketing job? Bill and Jim re-enact the situation in which a woman got scammed with a wooden iPad. Does a YouTube creep-o have a pedophile's chance in prison of becoming the next US President? A Russian cannibal makes links and balls out of his internet date. An urban legend straight out of FUH's backyard gets a film treatment....but why? George Lucas is now the focus of geek rage with his "enhancements" to the&nbsp;Star Wars original trilogy Blu Ray release. Bill throws Jim off his game with some childish behavior. All this and a bag of black market Russian man meats on this week's FUHcast!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>20 episodes! HOLY CRAP! Jim opens the can on the big #20 with the show rundown. Bill and Jim take a moment to send happy thoughts out to FUHcast fans who are in the path of Hurricane Irene. AMC lets it slip as to what really happened on the set of 'The Walking Dead'. Universal Pictures thinks Stretch Armstrong has a better chance than Clue. Bill is fearful of what another Ghostbusters sequel might bring. Jim Carrey gets ultra creepy in a home made love letter video (with audio). Cousin Oliver sends his regard on while on his way to ......where? A bizarre traffic jam forms in Nashville when a bus drops a nasty load. Steve Jobs takes a bow as Apple CEO and then Apple hires an enemy. The discussion gets heated when GameStop pulls a shady move on it's customers. Jim is passionate about the topic while Bill is slightly apathetic. All this and so much more! See you next week when FUHcast can legally drink!</p>

			<title>FUHcast Episode 018: The Explicit Tag Is Earned</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://fileunderhorrible.libsyn.com/fu-hcast-episode-018-the-explicit-tag-is-earned]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hide yo kids! This FUHcast definitely earns the "EXPLICIT" rating. Jim kicks it off with the rundown of what's to come on this week's show. Big thanks to everyone who listened to and gave feedback on The Saturday Morning FUHcast (Episode 017) Jim tells us a little about his trip to GenCon. Bill gets addicted to AMC's 'Mad Men'. The new trailer for 'Battleship' is discussed, but the big story is who (or what) the film's director looks like. Did AMC risk losing 'Breaking Bad' and 'Walking Dead' just to keep 'Mad Men'? George Lopez joins the bread line and the guys aren't too shocked given the state of late night talk shows. James Spader takes control of 'The Office'. Are Bert and Ernie homosexuals? Do Bill and Jim care? The London riots prove that teenagers everywhere are stupid. And Comcast throws an e-bone to those less fortunate. All this and more on this week's FUHcast!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Grab a frosty glass of chocolate milk, some cookies, and your View-Master! It's the Saturday Morning FUHcast! Join your hosts, Jim and Bill, as they use the power of their voices (and some internet found audio) to transport you to a bygone era when kids ruled the remote on Saturday mornings. The guys bring their list of 5 cartoons from THEIR childhoods that made being a kid more bearable. They dig deep into each cartoon series; talking about the history, the memories, and the list worthiness of each one. You'll hear some hilarious PSAs and a special compilation of retro Saturday morning audio that is sure to drag you out of your boring adult lives and back into the past; for better or worse. Favorites from Twitter, Facebook, and email using listeners are also talked about. Be sure to stick around to the end of the show for a shockingly funny FUHcast Hotline message from listener Gutter Monk! See you next week with another FUHcast!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The show opens with the trademark greeting and rundown of this week's topics. Listener voicemails kick off the show; one caller has a nasty issue that FUHcast must solve and Gutter Monk wants to get to the flavorful bottom of an otherwise tasteless. Mike situation. Jim brings us more movie news and reviews; topics include 'Crazy Stupid Love', 'Knights of Badassdom', 'Horrible Bosses', and Bill's wet dream, Disney's 'The Muppets'. In TV news, 'The Walking Dead''s producer walks on out, 'Thundercats' gets re-clawed, and Fox bitch slaps antenna users. Bill thanks a great guy and fellow digital entertainer (and plugs his show). Bill and Jim have it out over Nintendo's DS line when chatting about the recent 3DS price drop. All this and more, bursting at the seams, in this week's FUHcast!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week's show opens with a brief rundown of what's to be discussed. Amy Winehouse joins the Forever 27 Club. The boys look into the possible future and discuss a world in which Apple owns Hulu. Bill's new favorite (Jim likes it, too) web show, 'The Booth at the End' is briefly examined with an excellent audio sample. File Under Horrible's upcoming special edition podcast is discussed and the guys need your help! The good, the bad, and the undecided of Google+ and why File Under Horrible isn't really wanting a part of it right now. The movie industry must be in big trouble if they are once again looking to family board games for inspiration/source material; Jim gives the lowdown. All things Comicon are discussed: tv shows, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and a funky new way to watch a movie. Downloadable Xbox Live Arcade titles Bastion and Fez are given a once over just as the show comes to a close. See you next week!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Holy Hell is it hot in Chicago! Bill and Jim sooth the burn of their 2k11 Video Game Summit experience with some male on male garage saling. The bassist of one of Jim's favorite bands is a pill popping criminal, but what rock star isn't? Netflix explodes the internet and customer tempers with their recent price changes, but Bill thinks it pretty much makes sense. Bill says radio is dead and that podcasting is the future. Jim is over the moon for the 'Another Earth' movie trailer. Is SyFy's (file under HORRIBLE branding) 'Alphas' a flop in tights? As the show comes to a close, the heat starts to get to Bill and things get a little weirder than usual. Stay chilly until the boys melt your face off with next week's FUHcast!</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://fileunderhorrible.libsyn.com/fu-hcast-episode-013-my-google-face]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Jim returns from the land of the dead to the land of the FUHcast. Jim is very excited about George R.R. Martin's newest fantasy novel 'A Dance With Dragons'. Elijah Wood's new Australian import FX television series, 'Wilfred', is discussed. Bill tears apart MTV's 'Teen Wolf' teen drama which brings an old topic back from the dead. Listener Gutter Monk poses a new question pertaining to "tainted words/phrases" via way of the FUHcast Hotline. Why is the White House supporting ISP throttling? Bill and Jim have had some time to play with Google+. Can Google+ kill Facebook? The boys debate whether or not Facebook was better than MySpace during MySpace's dominance. Jim answers some Facebook listener questions about Netflix and sneaky bath drugs. The overstuffed show comes to a close with Jim's less than favorable review of Michael Bay's 'Transformers: Dark of The Moon'. See you next week!</p>

			<title>FUHcast Episode 012: He's Dead, Jim</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://fileunderhorrible.libsyn.com/fu-hcast-episode-012-he-s-dead-jim]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's a podcast of firsts on this week's FUHcast! Jim calls in sick and beaten leaving Bill to search for not only FUHcast's first guest, but first guest co-host. Bill makes a very wise decision in choosing his wife, Effie, as his co-host. Effie is a writer and co-founder of thebrokehousewives.com and is well suited to handle whatever Bill can throw at her. The wedded duo get the show rolling with another Gutter Monk voicemail which leads to Bill uncovering a vast music industry conspiracy. The controversy over the book "Go The F*ck to Sleep" is examined and betrated. FTC gives SIC the "okay" to keep tabs on e-life and Effie doesn't like it. Bill and Effie discuss the finer points of the erogenous zone.....speaking of which, here's a stroy of how Mrs. Brady was cookin' up crabs and wasn't seafood! Bill is pissed that Adam Carolla's podcast is jumping all over his Vagina Eyes rocketship to podcast infamy. MSNBC does NOT think Obama is a dick, but Bill thinks Morning Joe is. Will Jim rise from the dead and take back his podcast chair? Find out on next week's FUHcast!</p>]]></description>

			<title>FUHcast Episode 011: Please, Don't Hack and Drive</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://fileunderhorrible.libsyn.com/fu-hcast-episode-011-please-don-t-hack-and-drive]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This podcast is ready to 'splode! Bill's recent haircut does nothing to quell his zombie uprising paranoia (and why would it?). Jim succeeds in delivering a completely SPOILER FREE review of J.J. Abrams' 'Super 8'. A new message from the FUHcast Hotline is heard, albeit a bit too late. The recent outbreak of hacker attacks is discussed, per Facebook fan request. Apple's shiny new patent is analyzed. The big ISPs are about to lay the smack down on pirates....sorta. The show turns a bit serious when the recent death of reality star Ryan Dunn and drunk driving is discussed. Happiness returns when Jim dives into the wonderful world of MMOs with three stories that even Bill (a non MMO player) is interested in. See you next FUHcast!</p>

			<title>FUHcast Episode 010: Drunk Dialing The Internet</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://fileunderhorrible.libsyn.com/fu-hcast-episode-010-drunk-dialing-the-internet]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Double digits! Your hosts celebrate the #10 milestone and announce their new partnership with Stitcher Smart Radio, along with reminding everyone where else FUHcast is available. Moving on, Jim fills us in on what's playing on the big screen and what we have to look forward to this summer. Internet meme about girl using her cellphone in the theater is just one reason why Bill hates going to the movies. Bill eats his foot when Jim unearths a drunk-dial voicemail. Some Wii U news is discussed. Bill Warren isn't the only one looking for Osama's body; Cousin Oliver wants a taste. Rebecca Black frees YouTube from her soul blackening clutches; a story that drags the boys into a discussion about the music industry. And that'll do it until next week's FUHcast!</p>
