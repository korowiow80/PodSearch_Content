      <description><![CDATA[Founded in 1999, Most Valuable Playaz (also knows as MVP or simply Mo'Playaz) was the cream of the crop when it came to drum'n'bass. Releasing mostly tracked modules, it has been a home for many nowadays big d'n'b names such as Muffler, Psidream,
Krii aka Resound and Mad-E.
When MVP went inactive in 2002, the scene lost one of the last quality tracking groups. Bitjam brings you a best-of Mo'Playaz special, exclusively mixed by labelhead tEiS and featuring the biggest MVP hits as well as unreleased material. Tune in, junglist!

      <description><![CDATA[Just For Fun, this was the motto of the long awaited online music competition, organized by www.scene.hu with Slyspy's leadership.
The compo was a big success: 30 musicians entered. This is a nice summary, because the hungarian demoscene is small
(around ~250ppl nowadays).
This podcast will guide you trough the entries in "Viva chartshow style", starting from the last placed song to the first.
Have fun!

Now being a completely international team, Brainstorm doesn't always take itself too seriously and relentlessly keeps injecting some humour into the scene.

Once again we present some tracked drum'n'bass music from the 1990s - and this time it's about two trackinggroups: Theralite from Hungary and Rebound from Finland. Both hosted some big artists, in terms of demoscene credit as well as later "reallife" d'n'b status. So here we go with some big tunes - speed up and headbang with us again in the second Drum and Bass podcast episode!

      <description><![CDATA[Episode #20 - 20 years of scenemusic
This episode is a homage to the last 20 years of demoscene music - one tune from each year from 1987 until 2007. Please note that the year of the demo was used rather than the year the tune was made, for example Physical Presence was made in 1993 but FLT^VD - Love was released in 1994. Also as this is episode #20 we would like to thank all who have supported us with their own podcasts and given us ideas and feedback.
Thanks to Alecs^BRS for his help!

Back in 1992 the new Atari Falcon arrived. Its specifications like a Motorola 68030 CPU, True Color graphics, a DSP and high quality sound was a great new playground for demomakers. While the Atari ST scene was largely dying, a lot of great demos, full of high skilled craftwork and innovative ideas, where created on the Falcon around the middle of the 90s. This episode presents a selection of the music that came along with those colorful demowonders. Have a nice trip back into these lovely times.

      <title>Bitjam Episode #37 - Atari ST tunes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Episode #37 - Atari ST tunes
During the period of 1989-1992, which one could call the peak of the classic Atari ST demoscene, a huge amount of ST-megademos were released. The were full of wobbling logos, flexible and entertaining scollers, dot effects, sprites, bobs, flat shaded 3d... and all that along with YM-chipmusic. The dominating musician back than was doubtlessly Mad Max beeing responsible for about 90% of the Atari demomusics in some way. Nevertheless quite an amount of other chipmusicians participated in the demproductions as well. Some of the heartpieces of all those musicians are compiled in this Podcast.
For an Atari ST scener its likely a mix of very well known tunes and speaking personally, some of the tunes wake some really good old feelings in me still today. For other demosceners it might be a bit of a best-of-compile from those years - when three channels were an orchestra, 16 colors were enough for our oil-paintings and so many limits still had to be broken.

It seemed only fitting then, that we should dedicate an episode of the podcast to these tunes - some with an oriental feel, some that just kicks your ass. Enjoy!

Few people acknowledge how much the scene influenced the games of the era, and thus in turn the games influenced the scene. I've selected several pieces that over the years influenced me, pieces that I still have in my playlist and much to my wife and kids dissapointment play in the car. With such a wealth of material to pick from, a bank so much richer than the mainstream, please consider omissions merely due to my lack of space.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Episode #44 - Roland LAPC-I tunes
The LAPC-I is an 8-bit ISA sound card for the IBM-PC, released by Roland in 1988. Containing the same technology of the Roland D-50, it allowed composers to create their own sounds at a much lower price. Being targetted towards home users, it was also supported in many MS-DOS games in the late 80s and early 90s.
Unfortunately, most gamers couldn't afford one, so they missed out on superb music and were stuck with the cheaper Sound Blaster sound cards. This podcast has been put together to bring back the game music you once missed.

In 2009, Brainstorm is celebrating it's 20th anniversary, so we're hereby paying the group its tribute. We chose not to do so with old tracks, but with mostly new ones from its Tracked in Time musicdisk. Add to that a bit of tracks from 1994 and 2009 and you'll be just fine. And you can rest assured that the group shows no signs of slowing down in 2009 and beyond.

Some time ago we at Bitfellas decided to try and organize an interesting compo - we picked three tracks for other musicians to remix and compete in who can make up the best reinterpretations of these songs. The competition itself, as you know, ended on a dismal note, but we decided not to let the tracks end up unused, so here's a brand new podcast compiled from the (purely subjectively selected) best tracks of the competition!

Watching the demoscene evolve on the Amiga in the early 90's had a definite feeling of wonderment about it - certainly in no small part due to the amazing music the talents in the field magically made appear from our speakers. 8 bit, 4 channels, and some of these guys could still make these humble sound chips sound like the symphony orchestra. It is with the hope that you experience some of that wonderment tonight, we present to you BitJam Podcast 63. For further exploration into the demoscene, we recommend you to visit our sister site, BitWorld, where you can lose yourself in demoscene magic 24/7. Enjoy!

      <title>BitJam Episode #78 - Oriental and Far East Music</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Episode #78 - Oriental and Far East Music
The special oriental style of music has been an inspiration to demoscene musicians ever since the very beginning, and has resulted in a long line of tracks with an oriental feel, or which borrow heavily from oriental music tradition. Even entire demos have been dedicated to this style, and it has had a profound impact that has created a subgenre all of its own. We leave you today with something quite unique - The BitFellas podcast oriental style. Enjoy.

      <description><![CDATA[Episode #79 - Amiga Crack intro trax
For too many of us, our first contact with what we later learned to be the demoscene, were the colorful little introductions that got tacked on the games we "found" for our first computers. We got used to the names in the logos, came to think of them as our friends, and found ourselves humming our favourite little tunes from the intros. This issue of the BitFellas podcast pays tribute to those pioneering, early steps in the demoscene evolution. So, close your eyes, take yourself back to that magical time, and... pop that imaginary cracked game disk in the floppy drive.

Gloom: "While working on the 4k podcast it occured to me that I would really like to do a podcast with music that could have been heard in any decent club on a saturday night. A full-on DJ mix so to speak, with only "commercially viable" tunes. A "break out" podcast, if you will. How does this idea sound?"
It sounds really cool!

But then again, there was the chance to look into this little plastic box of a monitor on the desk and a bit of relief came up. An own creative and colorful world, nobody could disturb, with so much to discover on one single disk. The feelings back then are hard to describe, take this Podcast to get an idea what the taste of 1991 was about.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[For long time, there have been rumours in print magazines about new machines coming up. Finally, in the autumn of 1992 new machines appeared on the horizon. Amiga 1200 and Atari Falcon 030 were their names. This was reason for so much joy, due to the new and faster 68020/68030 processor, unbelievable 16.7 million displayable colors and chrystal clear sound capabilities of 50khz. Virgin lands of state of the Art of technology waited to be explored. On the other side, some of us were in deep love with the good old and trusty Amiga 500 or Atari ST. And some of them were even a bit afraid, that the new machine may make everyone forget about their little brothers. Still, having both old and new at the same time induced a big push in creativity. Feel it again with this Podcast!

      <title>BitJam Episode #98 - Industrial and EBM Tracks</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Episode #98 - Industrial and EBM Tracks
Def.: Industrial
Experimental music style, often including electronic music, that draws on transgressive and provocative themes. The premise behind creation of industrial music was to "pursue music in the context of the late industrial society, a dehumanized world increasingly alienated from nature"
Def.: Electronic body music
EBM or Industrial dance is a music genre that combines elements of industrial music and electronic dance music, characterized by hard and often sparse danceable electronic beats, clear undistorted vocals, shouts or growls with reverberation and echo effects, and repetitive sequencer lines.
BitJam warning: Cold, hard and energetic sounds. NO softener included!

      <title>BitJam Episode #100 - Milestone - The Flow</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Episode #100 - Milestone - The Flow
Flow theory: "… flow – the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it." (Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, 1991)

100 is a cool number. Not as cool as 128 or 64, of course, but at least it looks like 64 in hex. Anyway. For most things, a 100th episode is a big step - a proof-of-concept, if you will. For us, it means that our podcast has been running for more than two years now on a weekly basis, and that people are still enjoying the noise they make when compiled into hourly blocks. Our hope is to do at least another 100 episodes, and that you all like it as much as you did the previous one - cheers!

Oh, and we have a torrent including episode 51-100, cue files, banners, info, etc, etc...

Has it really been 4 years? So it seems. Today, the BitFellas forum and all the subprojects it houses, celebrate their fourth birthday! Founded in 2006, there is no denying the impact that BF has had on the scene. From its news service to its scene radio (BitJam),
its podcasts (BitJam Podcast), its large collection of articles, interviews and diskmags (SceneCity), its huge Amiga archive (BitWorld)
and the newly reopened scene graphics artchive (ArtCity) - BF has become a staple in most sceners everyday online life.
So come celebrate our 4th with us - open a beer, and listen to the BitFellas 4th year celebration podcast. Cheers.

      <description><![CDATA[Episode #112 - Atari 8 bit Music - Classics & Covers
The soundchip of the Atari XL/XE computer wasn't necessarily regarded as its major strength. It got four channels, which made Atarians proud. Yet those four channels were of pretty little sound power. But this makes the classic tunes by Rob Hubbard, David Gilmore and others appear even more impressive. It is an amazing range of sound design, that those pioneers reached in the 80s already. But this was not the end of the story of the Atari 8-bit music. During the more recent years a lot of development has been made to reach a sound quality incomparable to what one would expect from the poor old Pokey - both from a composing and technically view: great compositions and covers, 8 channels stereo, filtering and more. Get an insight into the realm of Pokey with this compilation of Classics & Covers.

      <title>BitJam Episode #136 - The Immortal Podcast</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Episode #136 - The Immortal Podcast
Immortal 4 enriches the world of computer game music, featuring remixes of the music from 35 Amiga games in newly arranged studio productions (German Report at .deMOSZENE). BitFellas pays tribute to the fantastic Immortal project and presents a selection of fine music from the Immortal CDs in BitJam Podcast #136, including a previously unreleased track.

The acclaimed “Immortal” project started to take shape in the mind of Portuguese game music composer Ruben Monteiro in 1997. The idea behind this project was (and still is) to release the greatest soundtracks from games released for the Commodore Amiga computer on CD - newly arranged and recorded in the studio, but not necessarily in a chart-compatible way. Instead, the “Immortal” producers aim to work with the original artists whenever possible: Chris Hülsbeck, Allister Brimble, Bjorn Lynne, Barry Leitch, Jason Page, Tim Wright and many others contributed exclusive tracks in the past. As of April 2011, four volumes have been released in the “Immortal” series, featuring music from classic games such as Shadow of the Beast, Turrican, Speedball 2, Pinball Dreams, Wing Commander, Alien Breed, Lemmings, or Cannon Fodder.

Hello podcast peeps, today we bring you a mix of a slightly less common genre of music to come out of our beloved demoscene; orchestral music. It has to be said though; when they do it, they do it very well and this mix is no exception - featuring the wonderful work of artists as diverse as Lizardking, Moby, Firestorm, Skaven, Blaizer and a whole lot more this is a real joy to listen to and it should be noted that this mix is the first of many orchestral ones we have in the works. So kick back, have a nice cup of tea and enjoy this mix of orchestral styling's from some of the best talents in demoscene audio!

      <title>BitJam Episode #148 - Moby Special</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Episode #148 - Moby Special
It's Sunday, the 29th! It's "Moby day" at BitFellas!
Moby... Do we really have to explain who he is? In short: demoscene legend, famous videogame composer, true lover of hard guitar sounds. He recently published his second own album called Hijack with his band Plug-In, which delivers such an incredibly powerful and pleasant blast to the eardrums coupled with fine melodies that we just had to do an interview with him! We chatted with him not only about Hijack and video game music, but also asked him about his start in the demoscene, as well as chatted to him about some very special song experiments.

That's not all for today, because we've prepared a nice podcast episode, a special "Moby special", for you, featuring some of the finest tracks, old and new, from Moby's demoscene history. BitFellas - Let the bass rock!

      <title>BitJam Episode #151 - Turrican Special</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Episode #151 - Turrican Special
The classic "Turrican" games brought nonstop action to all gaming systems of the 80's and 90's (including the C64, Amiga, Atari ST and PC, as well as the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo). The beautiful synthesizer soundtracks for the series were created by Chris Huelsbeck, arguably one of today's most popular game music composers in the world. His music certainly played a major role in shaping "Turrican" into a digital legend over the years. Chris has recently announced plans to bring the cosmic warrior back from retirement, with the production of a "Soundtrack Anthology" - an epic limited edition box set of no less than four CDs, which will feature almost every melody from the saga in newly arranged and recorded versions! More information on this box set, which will only be available until June 3rd, 2012, can be found at www.turricansoundtrack.com.

Almost two decades after the last "Turrican" title was released, BitJam pays tribute to these games and their wonderful music with a dedicated podcast episode. Featured tracks include remixes by Chris himself, as well as a selection of fan arrangements, handpicked by Huelsbeck and the co-producers of his "Turrican Soundtrack Anthology".

Xenox^AFL says: BitJam and me are proud to present another fresh Remix of wonderful Commodore 64 music, this time with a complete serie of "Jeroen Tel" tracks. Since the very beginning, I'm a big fan of Jeroen's work and it was a matter of time, to do a complete remix of his music.
It was a pleasure for me to present this episode "live on stage" at the Retro-Börse in Oberhausen, Germany.
