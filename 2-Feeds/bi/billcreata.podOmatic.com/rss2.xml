Goldman is a &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; bailed out company with strong connections to the U.S. Government. Political donations have not made Goldman immune from fraud charges but my commentary shows that the S.E.C is a sham operation and this could prove to make even more money for Goldman in the long run.
