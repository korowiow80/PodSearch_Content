    <description>Bigmikeydread Reggae Radio is and has been for many years one of the most well received Jamaican music online offerings,... but don't take this self publicists word for it; here are some of the comments over on itunes:

by Frutchey2020

I gotta say I love this podcast. Mikey says it's too eurocentric but to be honest we Americans ned more non-American stuff thrown at us. I really love the music, the fake ads, ah just everything about this.
     
by Ron Dillon

This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest podcasts out there. The music is always terrific and the commentary is personable and friendly, just like the music. Mike plays music that'll bring a smile to your face and make your toes tap.

It was not only the quality of the selections you played but what made me fall in love with the podcast,is the delivery of the tunes,because you always show such a love and passion for jamaican music,which I have always identified with.</description>

Well you've come to the right place...
There's a certain sound to commercially minded Calypso, some of which was being performed for the exotically inclined holiday maker in the 50s and 60s and this 'sound' is what I wanted to get across on this particular show.. I hope I have expressed this adequately?

6.Harry Belafonte - Man Smart (Woman Smarter)
7.Count Frank - Calypso Island
8.Talbot Brothers - Atomic Nightmare
9.The Barbados Steel Orchestra - House Of The Rising Sun
10.Vincent Martin and Peanuts Taylor - Everybody Sing Whem The Boat Pull Out

13.Lord Anticss and the Merry Boys - Woop Wap Man
14.The Mighty Terror with Rupert Nurse's Calypso Band - No Carnival In Britain

It was my pleasure to 'interview' and eat biscuits while discussing Phil Etgart's new TRIPLE CD compilation 'Jumping the Shuffle Blues' recently.
Phil is a well respected musical sleuth and this release and show sees a compilation of American Shuffle Blues and R&amp;B that was played on Jamaican Sound Systems 
before Jamaica's own home grown recording industry was born.

This release (and hopefully show on Bigmikeydread Reggae Radio) is an invaluable guide to this era of Jamaican music and an extremely pleasurable listen.
Bigmikeydread Regae Radio was not sponsored in any way to do this show, it is a pleasure to alert listeners to this most excellent of releases... and was a pleasure to spend more time in Phil's company.

JUMPING THE SHUFFLE BLUES is on the Fantastic Voyage record label and is available from the 20th June to buy at all good music retailers (including all the major online ones) NOW!

In Part 2 of this virtual radio expo Mike Murphy &amp; Ian Causer try desperately to impress the Jamaican music cognecenti with a musical spagetti and a splashing dashing sauce.

In Part 2 of this virtual radio expo Mike Murphy &amp; Ian Causer try desperately to impress the Jamaican music cognecenti with a musical spagetti and a splashing dashing sauce.

Please take a dip into this musical trip. Happy holidays.

In Part 1 of this show Mike &amp; Ian hope to delight with a subtle melange of ripe berry fruits combined with a robust vintage musical selection, with just the merest suspicion of a languorous humourous hubris.

In this resumption of 'normal' service Mike returns to the Mic dragging Ian kicking and screaming from his London hideaway into the wilds of deepest Sussex to unite in an effort to create nuff vibes... welcome.

Join us for this dip into some of music's half shadowed recesses and the world, in particular sounds abound of Jamaican music. Reggae in particular.The show is dedicated to the thousands of Japanese civilians who have suffered and to Smiley Culture latterly of the Saxon Sound System.

      <title>Bigmikeydread Reggae Radio - London Trip</title>

Basically, the show has been 'offline' for about 7 weeks while I moved house and got  new internet service up and running, while we were offline I put a little something together just to keep the tapes running.

The London Trip consists of sounds listened to on a recent'ish visit to the smoke, where I met up with RWMN and Ian's House of Reggae, Clive 'Daddy Bones' and Ben to do a show, and then a couple of tunes and some sounds from Tighten Ups Reggae night in Finsbury Park in January....

It's not the usual show.

I'll have something like a normal resumption of service very soon, in the meantime, this is a London Trip...</description>

I know I know, not very original, but there's a good reason for another Studio One show! 

When I first started listening to Jamaican music in any kind of serious manner, I didn't really 'get' Studio One and Sir Coxone Dodd's productions.
I don't know why, I just thought they sounded a bit cheap, a little woolly and not overly impressive. My enjoyment of Studio One seems to have co-incided with my growing knowledge and understanding of Jamaican music, and there's a good reason for that.
Studio One IS Jamaican music. Simple as that. You don't get more 'Roots' than Studio One, where it all begun....

1. Roland Alphonso - Four Corners
2. Cedric 'Im Brooks - Glory To Version
3. Cedric 'Im Brooks - Shaft

6. Emile Straker? - Please Be True
7. Freddie McGreggor - Rastaman Camp
8. Burning Spear - Foggy Road
9. Pablove Black - High Locks
10. Winston Francis - Let's Go To Zion

      <title>066 Bigmikeydread Reggae Radio presents The Steve Barrow Special - Part 2</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/28672/600x600_2495160.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
He's even recorded a toilet for Lee 'Scratch' Perry!

If you want to know more about the Reggae scene in London from the 60s through to the present, or an insight into record label runnings from the 70s onwards, then this may make for essential listening.
 
Steve wrote for Black Echoes in the 1970s, ran his own record stores, compiled records for Island, Trojan, and later his own label Blood and Fire records. He co-wrote the Rough Guide To Reggae, a bible for all Jamaican music fans. Amongst his close friends are people like Bunny Lee, Dennis Alcapone, Glen Brown, Lopez Walker, U-Roy and Trinity.

I had the honour of travelling up country to join Steve and his partner Sue at their house in Forest Gate, London, for an afternoon of chat, record playing, tea and biscuits. The ensuing interview spread over 4 hours of recording and will be presented in a number of parts for you to listen to. This is the final part, part 2. His insight and experience makes for essential listening for all Jamaican music fans. I know I learnt more from him in 5 hours than I have on my own in 5 years!

Background music comes from Blood and Fire releases.

Here is part 2 - 

The tracks included for your listening pleasure are:


Prince Jazzbo - 'Blank' - Ting A Ling Version
Owen Gray - On The Beach
Roland Alphonso - Ethiopian War
Lynn Tait - Soul Food
Lloyd Clarke - Untitled (possibly 'Hell and Heaven') + Dubwise
Winston Francis - Chain Gang
Righteous Flames - Ride On Version
Leroy Sibbles &amp; Beenie Man - Original Full Up 
Roland Alphonso &amp; the Soul Vendors - Ringo Rock
Jah Joe - Love On The Scene
U-Roy - High Priest
Big Youth - Black On Black
