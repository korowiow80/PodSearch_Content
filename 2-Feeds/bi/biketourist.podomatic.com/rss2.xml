      <title>Episode 23- A Tour Around Home</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/34188/600x600_1777919.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, a tour can be something simple that can be made even without planning. This happened to me this weekend, when I went for a little ride with my son and the ride turned into a small tour. In my book, a tour is about discovery and exploration of places you have not been or care to explore before. This, in my opinion is the difference between a bike ride, where you might have a route you know and a tour, where you deviate from the known and head on to the unknown, to explore and experiment.

We also talk about how the bicycle culture is getting more mature as a mean of personal enjoyment and utility, versus the racing only bike mind.

In the picture, beautiful flowers is just one of the things we found in this little, unplanned adventure!</description>

The Burren Chernobyl project is the entity that is making a difference for these kids, and as an active member, Andy is doing his part to let the world know and give the opportunity to help Andy's website is http://www.pedalpowered.ie

      <title>InterShow #3: Sky City Cultural Center and Haak'u Museum</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/34188/600x600_657798.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the BTP Intershow #3. In this edition, we have some information we would like to share as well as the audio from our visit to the Haak&#8217;u Museum at Sky City.

The first thing we would like to share is that the Tour of Life, a 68 miles bike ride which has been taking place for a couple of years now in the city of Guaynabo Puerto Rico, has been canceled for 2007. The tour was way to raise funds to help in the research and treatment of catastrophic diseases, and it was being organized by Bristol Myers Squibb. No clear reasons were given for the cancellation, which have led to a little speculation that the cancellation could be related to the state of the pro cycling world, which has nothing to do with this kind of fund raising activities, but it affects cycling&#8217;s image in general, proponents say. On my part, I don&#8217;t think this was the reason but it would be good that Bristol Myers Squibb explain a little about the decision and put the matter to rest. I was planning to ride the tour, but I guess we have to look elsewhere for a group ride, or better yet, go on a little tour around the island!

But, if you would like a bike race that is different, you should take a look at the Tour of Acoma, which is going to be held at Sky City New Mexico on September 23, 2007.  It is a 25-50-100 mile bike race which will cover The Acoma and Laguna Native American pueblos. I rode part of the route during the Tour of the Nations, and I can tell you, that even if you don&#8217;t like to be part of races, the surroundings vistas alone are well worth participating, even if you take it at your own pace. If you go, take plenty of water with you and don&#8217;t forget your sunscreen. New Mexico is very dry and the sun really shines.

Now, let&#8217;s go on with the visit to the Haak&#8217;u Museum, which is located at the Sky City Cultural Center. As we mentioned in Show #19, The Haak&#8217;u museum houses a beautiful collection of both ancient and modern examples of the Acoma&#8217;s art and from time to time, it also holds examples from other Native American cultures.

or call 1-888-759-2489

Listen to this episode as our guide, Mr. Melvin Juanico, take us in a cultural journey to the past, as well as the present of the Acoma's art.

      <title>Show #16: Interview with Randy Fay and Nancy Lewis</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/34188/600x600_657802.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this episode we interview Mr. Randy Fay and Ms. Nancy Lewis. They share with us the adventures on their ongoing tour from the north pole to the south pole. As we go on with the interview, it becomes clear that a bike tourist have to be flexible and make changes to an already laid out route plan. This way, more things can be discovered as it happened to them while touring in Mexico. The experiences gained by this approach are incredible and prove that bike touring is not just going from point A to point B as straight as possible, but wander following advices from locals and taking time to know the places and make friends for life. This is one of the reasons why I love bike touring, and it is great Randy and Nancy share some of it with us!

Randy and Nancy have a website that tells all about their trip, have wonderful photos and other good stuff. Visit them at:

http://www.hobobiker.com

and listen to their podcast! yes, another bike touring podcast. Give it a listen, I like it very much and I am sure you will too!

Just recently, Randy and Nancy entered Guatemala. In the photo above, see them as they enter their next adventure's homebase. I wish them the best!</description>

      <title>Show #15: Interview with Jeff Miller and Lotte Shlengel</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/34188/600x600_657803.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Touring in Puerto Rico! In this episode, we cover the ins and outs of touring the island of Puerto Rico, U.S.A. As bicycle touring in P.R. is a virgin activity, most of the locals just can't imagine anyone doing it, and the car culture does not help much. Anyway, if you are coming to do a bike tour, you are in to enjoy a place where the visitor is welcome and people  go to extremes to help you.  Adventure Cycling's own Jeff Miller and Lotte Shlengel can vouch for that, as they did a 9 day bike tour around the perimeter of the island. Enjoy this interview to just get a glimpse of the things the island has to offer to the bike tourist.

If you will be camping, check the Compa&#241;ia de Parques Nacionales website for the location of cheap camping spots along the coastline:

http://www.parquesnacionalespr.com/ofrecimientos.htm
http://www.parquesnacionalespr.com/ofrecimientos_acampar.asp

Other option is the DNRA, although it requires a permit at one of the regional offices:

http://www.gobierno.pr/DRNA/RecursosForestales/AreasAcampar/AreasAcampar_Tabla.htm

And for a PDF map od the island, just go here:

http://www.dtop.gov.pr/act/mapaisla.htm

As you can notice, websites are in Spanish, which can be a turnoff for some people. This will change soon.

In any case, with close to no planning you can have a blast of a trip, as it was the case with Jeff and Lotte.

Enjoy!

In the Photo, Jeff Miller and Lotte Shlengel, just as they finished the PR tour.  I took this photo while we enjoyed a nice lunch at Pi&#241;ones area. Did they had a good time? Just look at their faces!</description>

The e-mails are getting bounced back to the source. Thanks Friedel for the heads up in this matter! 

To cope with the situation, I have created an e-mail address at Yahoo:

biketouristpodcast@yahoo.com

From now on use this address for all communications with the podcast and remember that you can always sen audio comments using the podcast's phone 1-206-350-3691 (yes, you can use Skypeout if you so desire!)

To the tourists on the road, specially Tim and Cindy, I apologize if you tried to communicate with the podcast!

Thank You for your patience, Ride Safe, but Ride!</description>

      <title>Show #10: 46,000 Miles Around the World; The  Mr. Alastair Humphreys' Interview </title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/34188/600x600_657811.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this episode, we have the great honor to interview Mr. Alastair Humphreys from London, England, about his epic 4 years, 46K miles bike tour around the world! Memories from his journey, life lessons learned and a renewed appreciation for family and friends left behind back home. This tour is a celebration of humanity and kindness that one could only dream, but that is very real and is out there waiting to be discovered.  a bike tour is a way to discover a different world than the one the media present to us, full of hope, of welcoming smiles and care for complete strangers, and a complete feeling of security from the places less expected.

Join us on this incredible journey, brought to you by the Bike Tourist Podcast!

Also, we have a new BTP show in Spanish! The material and shows will be a bit different and more suited for the hispanic riders, but with the same dynamics as your good ol' show! If you have latin friends, let them know about the show.

In this show we talk about what is touring, the different ways of touring that comes to mind (Have another one? Please tell us, leave a comment or call the phone listed below and talk about it. If it is cool, we might include it on the next show!). In this show we include a cool interview with Dr. Wade Pearson, from St. Louis, Missouri. We took the chance, as he is visiting the island to do research at UCC. He did a solo tour in Dakota of about 800 miles. He shares with us his experiences and problems as well as cool moments during his adventure. He took a few minutes of his loaded agenda to do this for you, our dear listeners. Thanks Wade! Do you know a bike tourist with adventures to share? Let us know, and we will do our best to get the interview!

Also, we would like to salute the McClain Brothers (Tim and Greg), and Phil and Mark Archer, who recently finished a tour across Indiana. The same goes to Dale, the Raven, who did a Tour to the Florida Keys. Check the Journals at Crazyguyonabike.com</description>
