<p align="justify">Hosted by the Lord of Sheppey and the multiple personalities of Them (formerly known as &hellip;) this is the best episode yet. These guys just keep getting better, a bit like a fine wine or funky French cheese!</p>
<p align="justify">Along with the Lord and Them is the Robcast&rsquo;s first guest: Vulgar, whose filthy blend of humour compliments the Robcast perfectly. Vulgar is an old school friend who hails from the land of the Sheep.</p>
<p align="justify">Join the filthy buggers as they reminisce about their experiences at school in the 90s and take a surreal trip back in time and back to the Isle of Sheppey, where you will meet some of the strangest teachers and fellow students in the world! </p>
