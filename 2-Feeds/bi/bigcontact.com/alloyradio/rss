<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> sound he has been looking for. Although he is always learning new<br/>
things and constantly searching for new ideas, he has recently begun            to<br/>
settle into his own style of music writing. Greatly influenced by the<br/>
likes of Jeff Buckley, Ours, and Led Zeppelin, Dan pushes the limits            of<br/>
his vocal range to produce a powerful and heartfelt sound that keeps            the<br/>
audience listening.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Performing mostly in the New York City area, Dan has kept rooms full            of<br/>
total strangers captivated by the pure emotion and natural talent he            puts<br/>
into his music.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Dan performs alone when the environment is suited for it, but also packs<br/>
venues when performing with his live band featuring Ricardo Rodriguez<br/>
(bass), Jerry James (guitar), and Felipe Torres (drums).<br/>
Dan released his debut album, &quot;Where            I Stand&quot; in 2006.<br/>

<br/>
&nbsp;In the sea of musicians in this crazy world, there are not many that can stop you in your tracks with the sound of their voice and their poetic lyrics that cut to the bone like Sami Akbari can. Sami Akbari is an artist that amazes people with her talent each and every time she performs, sometimes leaving listeners in tears with her heartfelt, bluesy vocals. Raised outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Sami began singing and writing at the early age of six. She began to hit the Philadelphia open mic circuit in 2002, and since then, has made tremendous strides both with her emotion evoking song lyrics and soulful voice. Sami moved to Brooklyn in June of 2005 to continue writing, singing and performing her music to anyone who will listen. She quickly established a place for herself in the New York City music scene playing at prestigious venues such as The Bitter End, Pianos, and CBGB's--all within 6 months of being in the city. Her performances are unique due to her rare talent, her immense passion for the music, and her off the wall banter in between songs; you will never know what will come out of her mouth next. She has also performed at venues in Philadelphia, PA, Charleston, SC and Roanoke, VA. Currently, Sami can be found performing around New York City and is about to go into the studio to record her anxiously awaited 5 song EP, &quot;Somebody Elses Stranger.&quot;</span></span>]]>

<![CDATA[<span class="haudio"><span class="audio-title">Make It Last</span><br/><em>By</em> <span class="contributor">The Bowmans</span><br/>Download : <a href="http://alloyradio.com/music/TheBowmans_MakeItLast.mp3" target="_blank" rel="enclosure">MP3 Audio</a><br/><br/><span class="description"><a href="http://myspace.com/thebowmans" target="_blank"><img src="http://alloyradio.com/artists/BioPicTheBowmans.jpg" alt=""/><br/>
http://myspace.com/thebowmans</a><br/>
<br/>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The            Bowmans began their performance career as &quot;singing puppeteers&quot;            in their hometown of Davenport Iowa. Sarah and Claire&rsquo;s ability            to harmonize was discovered (by their parents, of course) at the age            of three. The twins began creating their own imaginative songs immediately            upon the delivery of their first tape recorder in 1984, upon which they            cut their first album, &ldquo;Chicks and Families Radio Rocks,&rdquo;            a compilation which included performances by various artists such as            Snot the pig, Little Bear Second Brain, and Bellbina. The seeds of a            lifelong partnership were sown from the far-reaching success of that            first album.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
The twins have performed together regularly since then, early becoming            fixtures throughout the Midwest from coffee-shops to huge outdoor festivals.            At Duquesne they furthered their craft, playing several venues in and            around Pittsburgh area while studying at the university. After finishing            college, the Bowmans moved to Baltimore and continued performing together            throughout the Balto-D.C. corridor, despite the demands of Sarah&rsquo;s            duties as an orchestra teacher.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
These days, The Bowmans seem to be everywhere on the New York City music            scene. And why shouldn&rsquo;t they be? Sarah&rsquo;s lyrics and vocals            range from reminiscently droll to poignantly sublime. Coupled with skillful            cello and guitar playing, Sarah has already afforded recognition as            one of the top musicians on the city scene. Claire is an artful fiddler            and evocative vocalist to match. Together, the twins&rsquo; harmonies            sound as if they come simultaneously from one astonishing voice. Sarah            and Claire share the rare, almost telepathic bond common to twins, and            because of this they are clearly always on the same musical page.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
The latest phase of The Bowmans&rsquo; development began in 2004, when            Sarah did what nearly all the American musicians do - made the move            to New York City. She quickly became a fixture on the Anti-Folk scene            as a solo artist and guest cellist, sharing the stage with more than            a dozen of the hottest musicians and bands in town. No doubt noting            her sister&rsquo;s immediate impact on the scene, Claire was quick to            join Sarah, making the move up north later that year. The Bowmans reunited            and the people of New York noticed. In a very short time, they have            become nearly ubiquitous, receiving rave critical reviews and garnering            themselves a devoted following from the famed Sidewalk Caf&eacute; in            the East Village to the burgeoning Whiskey Breath weekly event in Williamsburg.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
The Bowmans&rsquo; sound is at once unique and prototypically American.            Shades of Americana connect with characteristics of modern singer-songwriters;            vaudeville blends with indie-folk; undertones of classical influences            meld with loads of rock and roll edge. Though the Bowmans have worked            together almost since their birth, they are beginning an enlivening            new chapter to their richly musical lives.</font></p></span></span>]]>

</a>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="4">The            Bowmans </font><br/>
</strong><a href="mailto:bowman.twins@gmail.com">Email Artist</a> |            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thebowmansmusic.com/">Visit Website</a>            | <a href="http://myspace.com/thebowmans">Myspace</a> | <a target="mainFrame" href="mailto:bowman.twins@gmail.com?subject=Add%20me%20to%20your%20email%20list">Join            Email List</a></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The            Bowmans began their performance career as &quot;singing puppeteers&quot;            in their hometown of Davenport Iowa. Sarah and Claire&rsquo;s ability            to harmonize was discovered (by their parents, of course) at the age            of three. The twins began creating their own imaginative songs immediately            upon the delivery of their first tape recorder in 1984, upon which they            cut their first album, &ldquo;Chicks and Families Radio Rocks,&rdquo;            a compilation which included performances by various artists such as            Snot the pig, Little Bear Second Brain, and Bellbina. The seeds of a            lifelong partnership were sown from the far-reaching success of that            first album.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
The twins have performed together regularly since then, early becoming            fixtures throughout the Midwest from coffee-shops to huge outdoor festivals.            At Duquesne they furthered their craft, playing several venues in and            around Pittsburgh area while studying at the university. After finishing            college, the Bowmans moved to Baltimore and continued performing together            throughout the Balto-D.C. corridor, despite the demands of Sarah&rsquo;s            duties as an orchestra teacher.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
These days, The Bowmans seem to be everywhere on the New York City music            scene. And why shouldn&rsquo;t they be? Sarah&rsquo;s lyrics and vocals            range from reminiscently droll to poignantly sublime. Coupled with skillful            cello and guitar playing, Sarah has already afforded recognition as            one of the top musicians on the city scene. Claire is an artful fiddler            and evocative vocalist to match. Together, the twins&rsquo; harmonies            sound as if they come simultaneously from one astonishing voice. Sarah            and Claire share the rare, almost telepathic bond common to twins, and            because of this they are clearly always on the same musical page.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
The latest phase of The Bowmans&rsquo; development began in 2004, when            Sarah did what nearly all the American musicians do - made the move            to New York City. She quickly became a fixture on the Anti-Folk scene            as a solo artist and guest cellist, sharing the stage with more than            a dozen of the hottest musicians and bands in town. No doubt noting            her sister&rsquo;s immediate impact on the scene, Claire was quick to            join Sarah, making the move up north later that year. The Bowmans reunited            and the people of New York noticed. In a very short time, they have            become nearly ubiquitous, receiving rave critical reviews and garnering            themselves a devoted following from the famed Sidewalk Caf&eacute; in            the East Village to the burgeoning Whiskey Breath weekly event in Williamsburg.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
The Bowmans&rsquo; sound is at once unique and prototypically American.            Shades of Americana connect with characteristics of modern singer-songwriters;            vaudeville blends with indie-folk; undertones of classical influences            meld with loads of rock and roll edge. Though the Bowmans have worked            together almost since their birth, they are beginning an enlivening            new chapter to their richly musical lives.</font></p>

If you can get a New York City straphanger to purchase your CD in the            30 seconds it takes for their next train to arrive, you're damn good.            Theo Eastwind's intoxicating lullaby style is guaranteed to hook you            in, wrap you up, and stop you dead in your tracks.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Described as &quot;New York's Own&quot; by The Village Voice, Theo is            the essence of a self- made man. He arrived in this country 7 years            ago with nothing. He has since gone on to form his own production company,            TheoSophical Music, from which he has produced three albums. He has            also attracted a sizable following of devoted fans by playing in the            subways and clubs of NYC were he has sold over 12,000 CDs.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
The story of Theo Eastwind begins in Vienna, Austria. Theo's mother            cleaned office buildings and his father worked for the city library            as well as conducted a small local orchestra in the 17th district of            Vienna called The Hernalser Chamber Orchestra. Theo received his musical            roots from his father, but was never given any attention or support            towards his talent as a musician.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Dyslexia and strabismus in his left eye (corrected later in life through            a surgical process) made school extremely difficult for Theo. He quickly            grew impatient and dropped out of school in the ninth grade. He then            enrolled in a trade school and started an apprenticeship for a degree            in the confectionery arts. There, a new passion and talent for baking            was found. He specialized in Viennese and French pastry and various            types of bread.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
In 1995, Theo answered an unemployment notice seeking a baker to run            a Viennese bakeshop called &quot;Lipizaner&quot; in New York City. He            was given a round trip ticket to fly to the Big Apple, but by the time            he arrived, the business had lost all its backers and the venture had            fallen through. Theo was left on his own in a strange city with his            life savings in his pocket. His only possession was a beat-up old guitar            strapped to his back.<br/>
He was too proud and stubborn to return to Vienna, but his savings quickly            ran out. With no place to live, and without knowing a soul in this new            country, the reality of the tough city was now setting in. Down and            out, strolling through the subway, a voice captured his attention. A            man, Carlton, was singing a cappella for money. This subway musician            inspired Theo to do the same.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
He began by singing cover songs by Nirvana, Sade, Live, Fountains of            Wayne, and Oasis. He was inexperienced, shy, and could barely make five            cents in three hours. Theo realized he had a lot of hard work to do            if he was going to eat and pay the rent.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Theo furiously practiced day in and day out, determined to cultivate            his musical technique. Out of his effort to simply survive, he stumbled            across a gold mine of talent. He began, with no formal training, to            write his own music and lyrics. Today, his extraordinary voice conjures            up images of Jeff Buckley, David Grey, and Sting, and his captivating            songs elicit comparisons to Dave Matthews and Nick Drake. His guitar            playing is raw, passionate, and loaded with heart and soul. Put all            these elements together and you have the alchemical Theo Eastwind.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
In 1998, Theo joined forces with bassist, Steve Brown, who became his            close friend. Together, they played and became regulars in such New            York clubs as Under Acme, Mercury Lounge, The Livingroom, CB's Gallery,            and The Cutting Room. They also started writing commercial jingles freelance            as a business.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Ruth Dibbel, a mutual friend, then loaned them a generous amount of            money. Enough to set up a project studio. A company was born, TheoSophical            Music. With all the music Theo had accumulated over the years, he and            Steve immediately began recording their first album, the shimmering            and soulful, W.I.P. (Work in Progress). Their second album, Oh La La            Li&hellip; in 1999, was dedicated to Nick Drake, one of Theo's biggest            inspirations. Oh La La Li&hellip; showcases Theo's raw, expansive talent            and intimate lyricism that can reduce a room to silence.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Theo's third album, One, was recorded in 2000. One is richly textured            and emotionally diverse. Jamie Lamm at Fearless Music, NYC, produced            and mixed the album. One was a collaborative effort of many talented            and accomplished artists, including Matt Johnson (former drummer for            Jeff Buckley), Steve Holley of the Saturday Night Live Band, Billy White            (electric guitarist from Dokken), Steve Schlitz from Longwave, and many            more.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
After One was released, the band went in different directions and Theo            branched out on his own. He collaborated with several different artists            including Soul Farm and Rachel Sage where he had the opportunity to            play at such clubs as Irving Plaza, The Bottom Line, and the Hard Rock            Cafe.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
The fourth album, The Story of the O, which is currently in pre-production,            will be completed in early 2003. The songs are being recorded at Soundtrack            Studios in Manhattan.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
2002 has been busy and fruitful for Theo. He will be starring in two            different documentaries on two of the biggest networks in Germany this            fall. The first is to be aired on channel ARD and is a full feature            length film about Subway musicians in New York City. Other featured            underground artists included are Kathleen Mock and Mega Bodega. It will            be aired in November 2002 across Germany, several International Film            Festivals, and will also be picked up by the BBC. The second is a magazine            documentary on Speigel TV, which will be aired on channel ZDF.<br/>
On Halloween of 2002, the song &quot;7500&quot; from One, will be released            nation wide in a new independent film called &quot;The 13th Child&quot;.            The film stars Robert Guillaume, Christopher Atkins, and Cliff Robertson            in a horror film based on the legend of the New Jersey devil. It's quite            gripping and scary! Log on and check it out at www.13thchild.com.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Over these seven years, Theo has successfully achieved the goals that            he has set for himself. He has come a long way and is still continuing            to surge on to greater heights. Hand in hand, NYC and Theo Eastwind            have created a successful partnership with one another. He knows the            heartbeat of this city. What a pleasure it is to watch someone frantically            scramble to catch their train, and then gladly miss the next in order            to hear Theo play another song. So enjoy it while it lasts, because            he won't be underground for long.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
In the words of Johnny Cash as he handed Theo a dollar, &quot;Your going            places kid!&quot;</font></font></p>

<p align="left">Early 2001 Breadfoot landed hisself in Brooklyn, NY. He            started kicking around Manhattan's East Village music scene. Couple            of self released recordings and several trips to the UK later he got            tangled up with NYC's Paleface and formed Just About to Burn.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
JATB recorded a full length that was released on ArtMonkey Records Kicked            some shows in the UK and then after returning from two weeks on the            road in the states with JATB, well Breadfoot decided it was time to            move on.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
It was right around then Breadfoot got word that the good folks at Holden            Records had gotten an earful. Result was the release of the Funhouse            Recordings Jan. 05 in both the UK and Europe.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
That same spring right on the heels of the Funhouse release Breadfoot            returned to London to record Tea with Leo. The new record got worked            up at Caf&eacute; Music in London. It was produced by Leo Abrahams,            (Ed Hardcourt, David Holmes, Brian Eno), and features London based violinist            Anna Phoebe, (String Master and Lead Soloist For the double platinum            selling TSO).</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
Tea with Leo was released on Jeeziepeezie Records back in October and            is getting great reviews. Music from the release has been featured on            NPR and in the documentary 10MPH.</p></span></span>]]>

A singer/songwriter known for his passionate performances,            Wynn Walent&rsquo;s music exudes a quiet confidence and a simple sincerity.            Wynn's songs are melodic and heartfelt and he delivers them with an            urgency and purity that is captivating and endearing.
<p align="left">Fueled by an early love of timeless acts such as Paul            Simon and the Beatles, Wynn was always singing songs, and began playing            clubs and coffee shops throughout his hometown of Richmond, Virginia            at the age of 14. Wynn played throughout Virginia, attending college            in Charlottesville and quickly becoming a local favorite. </p>
<p align="left">2004 saw a move to NYC, where he quickly planted roots            at prominent Brooklyn and Lower East Side venues such as Galagpagos            Art Space and Piano&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Here, he has developed a local fanbase            who enjoy his brand of melodic and sincere songwriting and was a finalist in the Williamsburg Singer Songwriter competition 2004.&nbsp; Depending on            the night you catch him, Wynn can be found playing a stripped-down solo            acoustic set, or fleshing out his honest songs with cello, trumpet,            piano, bass and drums.</p></span></span>]]>

Those stock press bios have been irking me lately. So, here's my version:            Born in Louisiana, what is somtimes referred to as 'The Dirty South,'            the Mississippii River runs straight through downtown. Spent much of            my adolecent life plotting to escape Louisiana, loaded up a ford tarus            with my life (guitars, notebooks, and some tony cachere's cajun seasoning)            and landed in nyc a few years ago for what was supposed to be a semester            exchange program lasting 6 months, then back to louisiana. the universe            had it's way with me, the music was calling, so i cut the 'going back            to louisiana' part, quit school, and headed forward into being a full            time musician.
<p align="left"> i invested in a winter coat (the first coat i ever bought!),            ramen noodles, and an &quot;apartment&quot; in east village that was            at best 110 square feet, with no kitchen, and a sad excuse for a 'shared'            bathroom down the hallway, shared between myself, the asian guy who            shit in the shower, jeff-the friendly dj/street-wise intellectual/pot            dealer, and larry- a retired veteran who had a pot belly, white as ghost            hair (bald on top), and not once was seen not wearing his cowboy boots            (he even wore them to the shower, his bar of soap, a towel around his            waiste and those boots!). i worked at a moroccan kosher restaurant to            save myself from utter poverty, i wore a morrocan shirt and black slacks,            ate entirely too much hummus and couscous, and my co-workers introduced            me to 'drinking on the job' and for free! I mean, we had to have some            sort of recompense for those terrible outfits. of course i realized            needing to be libated to not entirely hate a side-job had it's shelf            life. it didn't take me long to figure out how to make enough via music            to quit that other job.</p>
<p align="left"> i spent a lot of time in that shitty little apartment,            somehow managed to even cram an upright piano into it (I slept on-top            of it), i learned quickly of this brave new world of vice and virtue            that is called manhattan. my southern sweetness and naivity soon shed            itself against the pavement. i grew up. sort of (this is still debatable).            humans growing up makes for good changes musically. my head/hands/heart            now can process experience and observation into sounds that i've been            quite pleased with in recent time. </p>
<p align="left">i really love music, a lot. it's where the soul of what            otherwise seems mundane, comes together for me. the songs and the shows            are just a piece of a really grand, stellar universe, right at our fingertips.            so, since my ungraceful arrival here, i have actually settled in and            carved a little path out for myself. have regular gigs in the city and            touring around the east coast, have a great manager, and a slowly but            steadily building group of folks who believe in those sounds and want            to bring them to more people's ears. i've been pretty blessed ....and            i've just barely started. there will be more music, more shows, more            uncomfortable living situations, persuasions and revelations. and i            can't wait for that to come.</p>

&ldquo;You only have to listen to a few seconds of Kristin Diable's            &quot;Sister Sadie&quot; to hear that she sings songs that have roots            in the blues, folk, and soul. Just 22, Kristin's been writing her own            songs for about six years now. Her songwriting and performing is strong            enough to have established her as one of New York City's more promising            young artists. &rdquo; - Voice of America </p></span></span>]]>

Mp3hardplay            calls her new Hoboken Demo EP &quot;pure rock fudge...a modern jewel            with a '70s sound, an essential purchase for fans of real, intimate            rock.&quot;
<p align="left"><br/>
After recording and touring with several NYC bands (False Prophets,            Karyn Kuhl, Plastique), Deb kicked off her solo career by licensing            four songs to the critically acclaimed film STRIPPED: Exposing The Business            Of Baring It All, broadcast on Sundance Cable Channel in August 2003.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
At director Jill Morley's request, Deb also wrote the film's theme song,            Take It Off, and starred in the music video that Morley directed for            the STRIPPED DVD. Meanwhile, Deb licensed two songs to Driven: Tim McGraw,            which aired on VH1 and CMT.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
Encouraged, Deb put a band together and began performing at CBGB, Arlene's            Grocery, and other NYC clubs. She recorded the Electric Goddess EP,            which David McClean of Tinfoil Music called &quot;hands down the best            CD to land in my pile of review discs so far this year&hellip;reveals            DeSalvo to be a major up-coming force on the rock scene.&quot;</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
In June 2005 Deb licensed three songs from Electric Goddess to the feature            film Getting Off, starring Christine Harnos (ER, Dazed and Confused),            which debuted on Showtime in September 2005. In July, Deb, Duke and            John recorded Hoboken Demo at The Pigeon Club with Wayne Dorell. In            December 2005 Deb signed with music licensing company Sugaroo!.</p>
<br/>
Deb has written articles for Guitar, Guitar School, and Guitar World            and an instructional column for Guitar.com. Her book The Language of            the Blues: From Alcorub to Zuzu (with a foreword by Dr. John) is out            January 2006 from Billboard Books.</span></span>]]>

<a href="http://Mikejacober.com">Mike Jacober</a> <br/>
<br/>
Manhattan-based performer Mike Jacober just released            his first solo album, Before and After. As a disciplined and accomplished            musician, Jacober&rsquo;s songs tribute Richie Valens and The Five Satins            with open tunings and multi-part Marcel&rsquo;s-like harmonies. A Rhode            Island native and recent Penn State grad, Jacober&rsquo;s songwriting            is in a vital stage of growth, where college bar rock and singing sixties            tunes in the kitchen slams into adulthood, replete with heartbreak,            loss, and self-confrontation. However, Before and After leaves a listener            walking forward with Jacober&rsquo;s composed stride: that peace of            mind is always both the before and the after.</span></span>]]>

Influences from Steely Dan, Tom Waits, the Band, Dylan, Billy Joel, Harry Neilson and The Beatles to Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis, Jimmy McGriff and Bach.<br/>
City slick meets hillbilly soul and goes hippy hopping thru pastures of rainbow pop on a nobby tired green bike. Sometimes smooth, sometimes rocky, but always thinking and chasing the winds right down to the waterhole.<br/>
So light a candle and dim the lights, sit back and enjoy this musical journey you've stumbled upon.<br/>
Mascot's Distance is Jordon Rothstein's band and debut album.</span></span>]]>

</font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="mailto:info@mikeferraro.net%20">Email            Artist</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mikeferraro.net/">Visit            Website</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://myspace.com/mikeferraro">MySpace</a>            | <a target="mainFrame" href="mailto:info@mikeferraro.net?subject=Add%20Me%20To%20Your%20Email%20List">Join            Email List</a></font></font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"> While growing up in suburban north Jersey during the            grunge '90's (circa '1991: The Year Punk Broke!'), all young Mike Ferraro            wanted to do was rock. But as Mike soon learned, rocking out to his            favorite bands on the radio wasn&rsquo;t satisfying enough. For lying            dormant throughout these formative listening years were clandestine            aspirations to learn to sing and play guitar--maybe even for a project            of his own one day. And learn he did: first covers of rock songs by            the likes of Nirvana, Guided by Voices, Sebadoh and Neutral Milk Hotel            eventually finding his own voice in original compositions, beginning            in earnest during the fall of 1998 while attending Rutgers University.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
Since those autumnal collegiate nights, Mike has refined his singing            and songwriting in a variety of projects, ranging from a home-recording            collaboration to an acoustic coffeehouse duo to a frenetic rock trio            and back again, all the while favoring melody over gimmickry, minimalism            over complexity, with the song itself always the focus. Ferraro&rsquo;s            evocative work has been compared favorably to its major influences (Dylan,            Barlow, Mangum) while simultaneously transcending the pastiche so common            among the hordes of retro-imitators and indie rock hipsters. As one            critic noted: &ldquo;Music this sweet is universal.&rdquo; (Channel            4 (UK) Teletext Planet Sound review)</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
From summer '03 on, Mike has played a variety of venues throughout NJ            and NYC and beyond, most notably appearing at Maxwell's in Hoboken,            NJ, opening for Lou Barlow (Dinosaur Jr., Sebadoh, Folk Implosion).            Other highlights include: appearances at Arlene's Grocery, Pianos and            CB's 313 Gallery in NYC, completing a string of solo dates in the UK            this past spring, releasing a collection of home recordings on the new            mp3 indie pop label, A Bunch of Beatniks Riding a Rocket (BOB006), and            seeing a tune from that release, 'Song for Friendship,' featured on            NPR's All Songs Considered: Open Mic.</p></span></span>]]>

The Undisputed Heavyweights met in highschool during band practice.            Teachers didn't recognize the pure brilliance of each of the members            until it was too late. They had already chosen the dark side and would            not be lured back into the realm of trite middle of the road music ever            again. After appearing on several record breaking albums such as the            Dark Side of the Moon, OK Computer and Thriller as guest musicians and            stacking up chips they decided to go for self and started The Guardians            of the Galaxy. After releasing several albums <a href="http://www.betterthanelvis.com/discography.htm">[see            discography www.betterthanelvis.com]</a> the band disbanded due to internal            conflicts and reformed 3 weeks later as The Undisputed Heavyweights            with renewed energy. The internal conflicts still play a large part            in the dynamics between the individual members and break ups are frequent.            Usually after every gig.</font></font></p>

<p align="left">In 2002, the M SHANGHAI STRING BAND got together in the            basement of a Chinese bistro in Brooklyn to share good food and play            some music. This acoustic-culinary combination was too special not to            repeat, and the band (named after the restaurant) was born. Their debut            album &quot;Up From the Ground Below&quot; was recorded in the restaurant's            dining room. Its twenty songs were captured completely live in one day.            At their CD release party, the MSSB played four live sets to a standing            room only crowd. Brooklyn's best kept secret was out.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
&quot;The banjos spit fire, the acoustics soothe the soul, and the vocals            tell honest tales. Every song from Up From the Ground Below is a perfect            combo of old time American folk and the music as it stands today...            a musical performance that is enduring.&quot; -Chris Lewis SHUT EYE</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
An adventurous take on Americana, the M SHANGHAI STRING BAND's songs            are not easily classified. They are remeniscent of traditional roots            music styles, yet innovative in their musical form and modern lyrical            content. The dynamics range from barnstorming breakdowns to achingly            beautiful ballads, expressing originality and simplicity in the same            breath.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
The MSSB have gained a reputation around the New York City area as a            must-see live act. The band alternates from five to eleven players at            any given show; a tight knit extended family that performs as a true            ensemble. As machine-made, mistake-free music becomes the norm, the            M SHANGHAI STRING BAND creates music the way it used to be: heartfelt            performances on the human scale, recorded live with a sense of dangerous            abandon. It's an old-fashioned idea rendered new, and the results are            both vibrant and timeless.</p></span></span>]]>

<p align="left"><font size="2"><strong><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Randi            Russo </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
</font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="mailto:info@randirusso.com%20">Email            Artist</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://randirusso.com/">Visit Website</a>            | <a target="_blank" href="http://myspace.com/randirusso">MySpace</a>            | <a target="mainFrame" href="mailto:info@randirusso.com?subject=Add%20Me%20To%20Your%20EMail%20List">Join            Email List</a></font></font></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Randi Russo is a southpaw who spawns unique and interesting            chords by playing her guitar upside-down and backwards. Her velvety            singing style is as equally intense and beautiful as her guitar playing            is edgy and unusual. She shines as her hypnotic, pulsing guitar riffs            accentuate her raw emotions and brutally honest lyrics. As Venus Magazine            put it, &ldquo;the intensity of her sound is something to be heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
Randi recently returned from her second UK/France tour to support her            latest release, &quot;Still Standing Still&quot;, which highlights some            of her best work yet. The song &ldquo;Parasitic People&rdquo; shows            her garage/indie-rock side, while tracks like &ldquo;Born Free Blood            Flow&rdquo; and &ldquo;Locked-Down Fade&rdquo; show her melancholic,            folk-noir side. &quot;Waiting for a Sign&quot; runs the gamut with three            distinct sections that'll take you through a number of aural mood swings.            &ldquo;Come Away&rdquo; is the most catchy song on the album, scoring            some extra attention when it was chosen to be featured on NPR's All            Songs Considered Open Mic program.<br/>
</p>
<p align="left">In the past, Randi has drawn comparisons to fellow New            Yorkers Patti Smith, The Velvet Underground, and Sonic Youth for her            chaotic and pensive songwriting. As is the mark of the most enduring            and adored artists, Randi innately knows how to mix equal parts of toughness            and tenderness in her songwriting and performances. Her quieter avant-folk            material has just as much intensity as her rock music. The Village Voice            has said that &ldquo;her guitar playing is sweet when it needs to be,            but nasty in all the right places. All she needs is one gig opening            for somebody like Cat Power, and her fame is pretty much guaranteed.&quot;          </p>
<p align="left"><br/>
Her notoriously noisy rock album, &quot;Solar Bipolar&quot;, was released            by local indie label Olive Juice Music. The song &ldquo;Dead Citizen&rdquo;            was added to Australia's KaosFM's Radio Hit Disc with the song hitting            #7 on their charts. The record received critical acclaim in select indie            magazines, notable online zines and prestigious papers. Later, &quot;Solar            Bipolar&quot; landed a distribution deal through Big Daddy Music and            now is available in stores across the country. </p>
<p align="left"><br/>
In 2002, Randi released a track on Olive Juice's Compilation, &quot;Call            It What You Want: This Is Antifolk&quot;, along with well-known artists            such as Daniel Johnston&rsquo;s Hyperjinx Tricycle, Kimya Dawson and            Adam Green (of the Moldy Peaches) and Jeffrey Lewis. </p>
<p align="left"><br/>
In the summer of 2004, Randi and her band played Milwaukee's Summerfest,            on a small stage, alongside main stage acts such as Crosby, Stills &amp;            Nash and 311.

<p align="left">The first time I met him was during the last days of an            Indian summer. The afternoon settled down into an evening of 72 degrees,            but still he hunched his shoulders like being gripped by some artic            wind. Leaning against an arcade version of Asteroids he moved a quarter            back and forth between the fingers of his left hand. </p>
<p align="left"><br/>
He had a cut above his cheek and his right eye carried the weight of            a late <br/>
night scuffle, sorely bruised.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
&quot;I got mugged last night on Spencer Street,&quot; he informed the            audience. <br/>
&quot;They got off with my acoustic.&quot; A wave of sympathy fell over            the crowd. I <br/>
tipped my drink in his direction, a gesture of understanding. Cradling            a house guitar in his nervous hands, a cheap Takamine scratched up like            an old mistress; he moved his fingers over the strings, constantly switching            back and forth between someone carrying fragile objects and a man guilty            of committing domestic violence.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
Believe it-there are no illusions. If he picked some kid from the <br/>
audience to saw in half, that boy would be returned to his family in            8 or 9 <br/>
pieces. His parents may not be quick to pick up on the change in him            right <br/>
away. Several dishes of ice cream would be placed in front of him at            the <br/>
kitchen table before Grandma hinted at the first signs of her growing            concern. <br/>
You see it's not a cut or scrape or something physical but the way the            kid <br/>
grips the chains of his swing, scoffs his shoes in the dirt or hangs            his head <br/>
in an evening sunset.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
Boxwood's music has sent me spinning off the highway on more than one            occasion, shattering my skull and the rearview with its execution. Playing            Death and the surgeon, one song rings out like a well rehearsed murder;            Another will shake you like a patient being doctored by CPR, his fists            pounding your dead heart back into revival, filling your blanketed eyes            with stars.</p>

I've been playing music since I was 12, which was two years go. Just            kidding. I'm 21 and I've been playing music since I was born, one way            or another. I come from Minnesota, as you can hear in my hit single.</p>
<p align="left"> I moved to Queens in August of 2005. I play shows around            Manhattan. I'm a regular at the Sidewalk Cafe. You can see my artist            page there at www.antifolk.net/artists/carlcreighton/.</p>
<p align="left"> I play piano a lot which you would never know unless            you saw me live. So see me live. </p></span></span>]]>

<p align="left"> JoshuaGabriel is an artist based in Brooklyn, NY. Born            and raised in Philadelphia, JG performed as a DJ/percussionist from            1999-2003, putting out 3 mixtapes and 2 EPs.</p>
<p align="left"> In 2003 he stopped DJing and began writing lyric based            songs which fused blunted distorted guitar riffs with hard beats and            politically slanted lyrics. Equally influenced by 66-era Dylan and the            Wu-Tang Clan, he began playing out in this new guise at open mikes and            small clubs in NY, performing on electric guitar and sampler. His 6            minute protest rant 'Welcome to the End of the World' (written in a            flash of anger at the start of the current war) quickly began to gain            attention in certain East village nightspots and Brooklyn hideaways.          </p>
<p align="left">After circulating a home recorded full-length, he went            into the studio with producer/drummer Chris Peck in 2005 and made '21st            Century Blues' - his new 4-song EP. Currently JG is playing shows on            the east coast as &quot;The JoshuaGabriel Band&quot; with the rhythm            section of Chris Peck and Oliver Pulleyblank.</p></span></span>]]>

<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            All the more impressive, this no-BS band makes its powerful mark<br/>
with only two men in its lineup: Andy DiSimone (formerly of superjuice)            on lead vocals, guitar, keyboard and drums and Josh Chapman (an alum            of Amazing Device) on guitar, bass and vocals.</font></font></p>

The duo, who recorded their first EP entitled &quot;Saturday&quot; as            part of a<br/>
foursome in early 2004, have since redefined and refocused their sound,<br/>
creating a new musical voice that rivals that of most contemporary major<br/>
label rock ensembles. They're currently self-producing a follow-up EP            in<br/>
their East Williamsburg studio and playing select shows around Manhattan.</font></font></p>

<p align="left">We live in Brooklyn, where we met and put this thing together.            We write pop songs - though hopefully not of a typical fashion. We have            no desire to appear as or become puppets. We believe in the concept            of one by one. Resistance is our first recorded EP. As it was completed            in the first month of becoming organized, you might notice some differences            with our live show and our newer songs. We think that is more than ok            and continue to use it as an introduction to tell people about us.</p></span></span>]]>

<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000000"><strong><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lowry</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
</font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="mailto:alex@lowrymusic.com">Email            Artist</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lowrymusic.com/">Visit            Website</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://myspace.com/lowry">Myspace</a>            | <a target="mainFrame" href="mailto:alex@lowrymusic.com?subject=add%20me%20to%20your%20music">Join            Email List</a></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Lowry            the band is synonymous with Lowry the man. From a family of musicians,            Alexander Lowry drifted from the peaceful country life of Kansas to            the mind bending, cultural hurricane that is the East Village.<br/>
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">In            his early garage days, Lowry 'let loose the demons' he would later identify            as the driving force behind his music. And as time would have it, Lowry            would then evolve well away from the rebellion of Marshall stack-driven            power punk to a uniquely infectious brand of melodic music that shares            time in both the esoteric and psychedelic realms of pop music.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br/>
While Kansas City and Lawrence had provided a cultural corner for music            making, it lacked the spark Lowry needed to become fully absorbed in            the greater musical ether. After completing over 200 live shows within            that corner, Lowry successfully extricated himself and landed where            he needed to be -- New York City.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br/>
It has been an epic trek for Lowry. One that has included time spent            in deep introspection, experimentation and personal triumph; A journey            that ushered him through tragedy and rebound all happening within a            temporal space defined by need, desire, sorrow, distrust, anger, darkness,            elation...and humor.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br/>
The moment you begin to think you understand Lowry, you're wrong. Who            you think you know--the mild-mannered psychedelic folkie of the East            Village acoustic scene -- is on a path to utterly demolish the conservative            notion of singer-songwriterism.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br/>
To attempt to define an artist like Lowry within the confines of the            written word is difficult at best. His songs range from sprawling alt-country            Neil Young-esque epics to psychedelically-irresistible pop numbers to            solo songster folk tunes. The range seems daunting to describe, but            to see Lowry on stage, or to hear Awful Joy is to witness an artist            of decidedly singular master of his trade. The songs ebb and flow with            rare consistency and verve, simultaneously stinging the nerve ends of            indie rock, anti-folk, tweak-pop and Americana.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br/>
Awful Joy is a record in two senses of the word: it is, of course, a            musical recording while also an historical record of the artist's journey.            And while Lowry prefers to subsume his physical identity into his music,            Alex Lowry's characteristic rich emotional hues are omnipresent from            first play. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Gretchen            Witt grew up aahw-sweet-n-peachy in the nice countryside of Ohio before            moving at age 18 to the barbarous streets of New York City where she            soon thereafter developed culture shock. It's been a <em>great</em>            shock.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">She            graduated from N.Y.U.'s Tisch School of the Arts with a degree in Drama,            an education during which she scribbled lots of rhymes (shere she shold've            scribbled exam notes) on the corners of her classroom noteboooks. Compelled            to perform original material, she decided to re-route her knack for            performance towars songwriting. <br/>
She has studied classical piano for eight years, has recently taken            up the guitar, and has sunger under her breath (to the annoyance of            nearby others) all her life. No one has yet, since this joyous departure            into songwriting been able to pull her away from the strings, the keys,            or the lyric-inspiring pencil set. Her first publication is now out;            a 5 track EP!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><br/>
Her vocal style is frequently compared to that of Alison Krauss, Tori            Amos, Tracy Chapman, Natalie Merchant, and Mindy Smith, however her            style remains unique. The lyrics of each song have been widely agreed            upon as the cornerstone of her work. Come to a show, and listen closely!</font></p>

<strong> <br/>
</strong><br/>
Singer/Songwriter Ian Thomas is at the forefront of a burgeoning artistic            movement that is once again breathing life and excitement onto the hallowed            streets of Greenwich Village, New York City. With his deceptively complex            music, Mr. Thomas proves that the best way to explain what is happening            now in our country is by looking back to the past, to the folk and blues            music that lies at the very heart of America.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
But where did this young man come from? It&rsquo;s actually quite difficult            to say, and when asked, even Mr. Thomas seems to be at a loss for words.            What we know for sure is that Ian took off from his small New England            hometown in his late teens with nothing but a guitar and a strong thumb            that proved adept at hitchhiking. He made his way across America, through            the Southwest, Colorado, and California. Like so many great artists            before him, he began to perfect his craft on the road. A stop in New            Orleans proved pivotal</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He            began learning blues and folk standards from local legends. He hooked            up with some fellow musicians that he had met in Colorado and began            playing constantly, embracing the throes of poverty and homelessness            as part of the life that had been chosen for him. He didn&rsquo;t just            sing it, he lived it. After his stint in the French Quarter, Mr. Thomas            left town and arrived with little pomp-and-circumstance in New York            City.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Still living out of his 1977 Toyota Corolla (with an ottoman bed in            place of the passenger seat) Ian played around the downtown parks and            subway stations for cash. He began playing area clubs in September 2002,            and he hasn&rsquo;t stopped since. As a testament to his raw power as            a performer and his music&rsquo;s ever-growing relevance, each show            is more crowded than the last, and the buzz around New York City is            certainly calling Ian Thomas&rsquo;s name. His following simply will            not stop growing. He has miraculously found a way to once again make            folk music accessible, with a pop aesthetic that doesn&rsquo;t stand            in the way of his own music&rsquo;s integrity.</font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The            two of us moved here about four years ago from the Midwest and met at            a bluegrass jam. We've been playing in a six-piece bluegrass band called            the Cobble Hillbillies for over two years now and started writing songs            that were something other than bluegrass; so we decided to start a new            band, with just the two of us and six instruments (Banjo, Dobro, Harmonica,            Mandolin, Guitar, Accordion).<br/>
<br/>
The result is a project steeped in roots of American music with a focus            on songwriting, story-telling, harmony singing, and musicianship.<br/>
Danny is from St. Louis, where he started playing mandolin in rock and            country bands before moving to NYC, and Jon is from Chicago, where he            played harmonica in blues and rock bands... <br/>
<br/>
After playing rock n' roll, blues, bluegrass, and country music for            years, the two of us have finally found a vehicle for the kind of music            we've always wanted to play.</font></p></span></span>]]>

<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            When you last joined us, Dave and John had moved from Pittsburgh,<br/>
Pennsylvania to San Francsico. Problem was, they couldn't find the right            drummer. Enter Nick, from Eureka, California. The three started playing            shows... then more and more shows. <br/>
</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More            and more folks came to see them, so they recorded a bunch of songs and            made some videos. These were songs that were meant to stick to your            ribs; not trendy flavor-of-the-month hipster fluff, but solid, like            old vinyl -- songs about hearts hitting the deck and bouncing back again...            and people started to respond. </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Eventually, they played in Los Angeles and some girl threw a drink in<br/>
Nick's face for writing on her arm -- even though &quot;she asked for            it&quot;. Earlier that day, Nick shook former Guns 'N Roses axman Slash's            hand in a chance meeting at the show, reporting later that he had fingers            like &quot;Jimmy Dean Sausages &quot;. This has not yet been confirmed.            <br/>

All of these artists            can be viewed as &quot;influences&quot; -- if that's the kind of thing            you're into. </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Low Water has just finished their first full-length release, &quot;Hard            Words in<br/>
a Speakeasy&quot;. Basic tracks were recorded at Ex'pressions Center            for New Media, in Emmeryville, CA. The rest of the recording was done            at Dave's house (in Muscle Shirts). The band has just relocated to Brooklyn,            New York. They are actively accepting offers to tour, perform and sign            dubious (but lucrative) recording contracts. </font></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            The Animators create modern popular music.<br/>
Their savvy, insightful songs are both sophisticated and accessible,            both intelligent and full of heart. Their inventive arrangements extend            the pop palette to include such unusual textures as accordion, glockenspiel            and cajon. Their confident sound evokes Coldplay and Simon &amp; Garfunkel,            the Postal Service and the Police. But for all their eclecticism and            depth, the Animators never fail to deliver big choruses, undeniable            melodies, and sticky hooks.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Born out of a cross-country collaboration between songwriters Devon            Copley and Alex Wong, the Animators have come a long way in just over            two years. Their self-released debut album, Home By Now, garnered rave            reviews and quickly sold out its first pressing. Their songs have been            featured in MTV's The Real World, Miramax's Comic Book: The Movie, and            on independent radio nationwide.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            They have won fans from coast to coast and in half a dozen countries            around the world. And most telling of all, the Animators have found            a sizable following among fellow musicians.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Now based in Brooklyn, the Animators tour regularly in the Northeast            and the West Coast, appearing in such venues as the Living Room in New            York, the Knitting Factory in Los Angeles, and the Bluebird Cafe in            Nashville. Their live shows are as compelling as their recordings, often            featuring regulars Phil Galitzine (bass) and Kevin Rice (drums) alongside            electronic loops, cello, and even beatbox. With their solid musicianship,            unforgettable songs, and tireless work ethic, the Animators are poised            for a breakout onto the national stage.</font></font></p>

</strong><em><font size="1"><br/>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all got big plans in our head and sometimes I wonder            where mine went&rdquo;</font></em></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Although man on earth has only technically been a band since 2002 the            <br/>
creative process and concept have been growing in singer Nathan&rsquo;s            head<br/>
for the last 5 years. After a series of solo demos he was joined by            Alex <br/>
who had been playing in a 10 piece funk band. The two went into the            studio,recorded a bunch of drum tracks and returned to their home studio            to finalize them. </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
<em><font size="1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been four years in this cloud,            I&rsquo;ve got a storm inside and it needs to come out&rdquo;</font></em></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Growth, re-invention and perhaps a little over analyzing lead to the            constant re-writing and re-recording over the next year. The two were            soon joined by MJ who had recently returned from Pennsylvania and an            ill fated childhood romance. Together they released their first internet            single, a demo of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, we&rsquo;ll be fine&rdquo;.            The song was downloaded by more than 3,000 peoplefrom their website            and the video for the song directed by the brilliant Megan Raney received            over 4,000 downloads in the winter of 2001- 2002. </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
<em><font size="1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of living if you aren&rsquo;t            really willing to change your mind?&rdquo;</font></em></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            <br/>
In Early 2002 the band began auditioning guitarists for the live band.            It took nearly a year to find Ron, with a few others filling in and            contributing in the process. It&rsquo;s perhaps this element that makes            man on earth most unique; as the band grewdifferent musicians with completely            different influences and styles appeared for short periods adding their            own elements, the culmination being something truly unique and diverse,            much like the members themselves.<br/>
</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Influences.<br/>
The members of man on earth are all extremely proactive music fans,            with an eclectic musical taste that touches on most musical genres.            <br/>
As a kid Alex was introduced to music by his father (a professional            Argentinean musician) his biggest influences have been Stewart Copeland,            Tony Williams, Bill Evans, the police, Stevie Wonder, <br/>
Phil Selway (radiohead), Jeff Porcaro &amp; Richard Ashcroft. &ldquo;I            like to play what&rsquo;s best for the music, being creative within            the musical style, lay the groove down and make things feel good&hellip;            it&rsquo;s not about me, it&rsquo;s about the band&rdquo;. <br/>
Mj has been interested in music his whole life, but spent many years            experimenting and learning different instruments before he finally settled            on the bass, which he attributes to the bass styling of Eric Avery <br/>
(Jane&rsquo;s Addiction), Joey Arkenstadt, Richard Ashcroft, Geddy lee            and Bootsy collins. This may explain his approach to playing &ldquo;I            try and make it as pretty as possible while maintaining a groove&rdquo;.            Mj was inspired to begin playing music by his Uncle John DiFiore &ldquo;when            I saw him play I was really impressed and knew what I wanted to do,            it takes me to another place&rdquo;<br/>
</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To            those that know Nathan, it may seem he&rsquo;s always been working on            this CD. When he was sixteen years old he worked all summer to buy a            four track and has spent the majority of his time since locked<br/>
away in his room recording his music. &ldquo;When I was in kindergarten            my teacher put on Beethoven&rsquo;s fifth symphony, that is the moment            I learned how powerful music can be&rdquo;. A predominately self taught            musician besides vocal training with Don Lawrence, Nathan considers            his biggest influences to be Prince, The Verve / Richard Ashcroft, Oasis,            Jane&rsquo;s Addiction, Tupac, Beethoven and constantly discovering            new music. <br/>
Originally from Brooklyn New York, Ron spent a few years pounding the            Jersey scene till he found his former band chlorophyll. With chlorophyll            Ron had his first taste of success; the band toured arenas with Alanis            Morrisette and Tori Amos, played radio shows and built a huge fan base.            <br/>
Ron&rsquo;s biggest influences have been Jimmy Hendrix, jimmy page,            radiohead and Jeff beck; but when asked about his own playing style            he says &ldquo;I like to keep it tastefull, whether it requires 1 note            or ten <br/>
notes it&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s best for the song.&rdquo;</font></font></p></span></span>]]>

<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000000"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I            am Andrew Scandal, born in Boston and currently living in New York.<br/>
<br/>
I am a singer and a songwriter. I write music to communitcate feelings.            Joy, f</font></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ear,            attraction, rejection, hope, spiritualilty... I communicate these emotions            through my personal mix of rock, soul, hip-jop, reggae, folk, electronic.            Mother Nasty showcases my darker, trip hop blues. Colorized Movie is            an example of how I combine the vivid colors around me into a catchy            pop song. My songs are both light-hearted and serious, contemplative            and emotional. Straight Shooters urges you to not lose yourself in this            world of exciting technology, and 7th St Blues offers a Brooklyn waterfront            story. Dylan, Bjork, Portishead, Jeff Buckley, Gang Starr, Johnny Cash,            Sinatra, just about anything from Jamaica, Lou Reed, Antony and the            Johnsons, Cat Power; they are just a few of my musical loves.</font></font></p>
<font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I            play guitar, bass and harmonica. I beat-box (vocal sounds and percussion),            I program beats, bang drums, and try to find tunes in any instrument            (and non-instrument) at my disposal. I sing as much as my neighbors            can stand. I started performing on the streets as a kid, and have played            across North America and Europe. In my performances, I often improvise            lyrics to match the mood of an audience and connect with the listeners.            I push my guitar, voice, and mind to create something true, original            and passionate.</font></font></span></span>]]>

Singer/songwriter Ari Scott has been living and performing in New York            City for nearly 8 years. She released an independent album called &quot;i            was only just a chorus girl&quot; in 2002, and, recently, a 3-song EP            called &quot;i can open my eyes.&quot; Producer Rob Arthur (Joan Osbourne,            Shelby Lynne) and Blue Note/Manhattan Records A&amp;R representative            Chris Cofoni (Norah Jones) helped Ari create the EP with the hopes of            a series of Spring 2005 industry showcases with a full band. Ari's new            band consists of bassist Rob Arthur (recent keyboardist for Five for            Fighting), guitarist Ann Klein (Ani DiFranco, Natalie Imbruglia), and            drummer Rich Mercurio (Jewel, Ben Jelen). </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Influenced            by 1980's pop, Depeche Mode, Morrissey, Joni Mitchell, Radiohead, Tori            Amos, and many others, Ari is a self-taught pianist and music theory            buff. As a child, Ari was forever playing her Casio keyboard, singing            in school choir, learning music theory, and writing stories. It wasn't            until age 19 that she considered the possibility of combining all of            these elements and pursuing a career as a singer/songwriter. She moved            to New York City two weeks after college graduation and hasn't looked            back.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            Ari's new EP has gotten some great reviews and she has been approached            by several music supervisors inquiring about possible song use in TV            and film. Her dream right now is to be able to make a decent living            solely from her music. Ari has a steady gig every Sunday evening at            Caffe Vivaldi (4:00 to 7:00 pm) playing originals and covers, and performs            several shows a month elsewhere.</font></font></p>

His music brings the party            with catchy pop/rock hooks and character drenched in eclectic NYC flavor            with Beatle-esque production. Derek's musical canvas is at once a streak            of vintage icons, at ofther times shades of contemporary style, but            primarily, a whole lotta fresh charisma.</font></font></p>

<font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The            5-piece live band is comprised of Derek James (guitar/vocals), Tom (bass),            Bruno (keys), Gilbert Gilmore (drums) of Warner Bros. recording artist            Lizzy West, and guitarist Aaron Nevezie, a mainstay on the NYC rock            scene formerly of Ambulance on TVT Records.<br/>

</strong>Jay Legaspi is a singer-songwriter from the meansest streeets            of the suburbs of New Jersey. As he writes this biography, he is of            course, laughing at his own joke - for anyone who has ever been to his            side of the tracks will be quick to attest to the fact that those tracks            are indeed the proverbial right side of them. And not that he's trying            to brag or anything, but to say differently would be to make a mockery            of all the hard work his parents and family put into coming from his            second home of the Philippines - and as any Filipino knows... that's            just not right.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jay            grew up in a musical household, picking up the guitar in grade school            in a feeble attempt to be like his father, a classically trained guitarist            who introduced his children to the likes of John Williams, Bach, and            Mozart. Jay, however, tended to lean more towards the likes of Billy            Joe Armstrong, Robert Smith, and European composers primarily invested            in techno and not string arrangements.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jay            also grew up listening to hip-hop, with his first real performance experience            bein in the ciphers and circles where people would show off their skills            in breakdancing. Later, he would take up DJing and rapping.</font></p>
<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If            there is anything Jay would like to say about his music, it's that he            wants to do his best to reflect the way he grew up musically - reflecting            his love of music from artists ranging from John Mayer to Aesop Rock.            He also strives to write music for people to grow up to, hoping that            people can listen to his music at a certain time of their life and relate            to what he writes, but also know that life is more than just that breakup            song, that song about independence, and that song about getting the            fuck out of wherever it is they are at that point. He honestly hopes            that you can see the transitions of where he is in his life in his music            so that people can ride with him and vice versa, wherever their lives            take them.</font><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><br/>

<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            Sean grew up in a small town in Northern California situated in the            middle of everything, but far from anything. Long summer days were spent            digging through his cousins treasure chest of music. The radio dial            was a line of fuzz and Friday nights welcomed the dawn of the mixed            tape. Beat up guitars, $15 amps, and thrift store kits were enough to            recreate the three chord paradise pumping through their Radio Shack            specials. </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Sean studied English in San Luis Obispo and his guitar very rarely saw            the light of the college days. Lyrics became his focus. Notebooks piled            up. They were scratched out, torn, and the good parts circled.</font></font></p></span></span>]]>

I was young and impressionable. When he found me I would have believed            anything he told me. But I also learned fast that you better find a            way to defend yourself in the street, or you end up dead in the street.            So now we're a team, we protect each other by a shield of sound. My            partner in crime is &quot;Frankenstrat.&quot; The key to our survival            is the element of surprise and unyielding fury, and all those who once            tried to silence us, now whisper our names in warning and fear in the            dark underbelly of the street.</p>
<p align="left">Dave &quot;Fang&quot; - drums <br/>
I Wasn&rsquo;t no child prodigy like the other guys. Long story short&hellip;the            dame squealed and I hadda do the time. I didn&rsquo;t even think about            playin&rsquo; drums til after my first unsuccessful parole hearing.            I just used to tap on the bars of my cell out of boredom. After a while            it started to sound like &ldquo;Bond Finger&rdquo;. And then it hit            me, like a ton of bricks&hellip;when I got out of the joint I was gonna            be the drummer for the Howlin&rsquo; Thurstons&reg; And here I am today.            I guess I shulda thanked that dame before I shot her.</p>
<p align="left">Kevin &quot;The Crippler&quot; - bass guitar<br/>
After growing up in the South Bronx as a shoe shine maven, I moved to            the Big Time and started selling used clothes on The Deuce at 8th Avenue.            I always had a ready supply of snazzy threads from the drunk swells            I rolled as they stumbled out of the after-hours joints. Finally I realized            I needed a gig that allowed me to drink and party, so I hooked up with            this Howlin'<br/>
Thurstons crowd to slap the bass and rock the house.</p>
Peter &quot;The Stump&quot; - guitar <br/>
A product of the legendary Pennsylvania prison system, his playing is            equally at home at a drag strip or a police lineup. Forced to leave            the Midwest a number years ago, he now can be found inhabiting the dark            underbelly of the brooding metropolis, or at a local Starbucks.</span></span>]]>

</font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="mailto:sitoh@nyc.rr.com">Email            Artist</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://www.setsuomusic.com/">Visit            Website</a> | <a target="mainFrame" href="mailto:sitoh@nyc.rr.com?subject=add%20me%20to%20your%20email%20list">Join            Email List</a></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            Setsuo was born and raised as the third son of the Itoh family in Kyoto,            Japan. In his childhood there, radio and TV programs gave him opportunities            of enjoying both Japanese and Western popular songs. He remembers that            he sang &ldquo;Love Me Tender&rdquo; of Elvis in English (or something            that sounded a bit like English) at a neighborhood recreational excursion            when he was five or six. Then The Beatles inspired him as a teenager            to write a song and make noises by picking a guitar. Since his high            school days, he played with several rock and folk groups, most of which            featured songs written by him and his friends. Eventually Japanese-English            translation became his profession as playing a guitar and writing songs            became just his hobby.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Working as an independent translator, Setsuo began to be interested            in intercultural communication. He also wanted to experience living            in the United States. So in 1987, Setsuo decided to study anthropology            at the City College of New York and came to live in New York City. Music            was still an important part of his life, but performing again on stage            was beyond his thought. However, in the process of his anthropological            research of the Black community in Brooklyn, he joined the City College            Gospel Choir for one semester and particpated in the activities of young            Caribbean dancers and drummers going to Beaufort, South Carolina, Atlanta,            Georgia, and Paris, France, which were based on African traditional            culture. This experience perhaps helped widen his scope of music.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Since completing the college in 1992, Setsuo has worked as a reporter            for a Japanese company. However, his passion for music has grown again            gradually. And finally he decided that he wanted to liberate this flow            of music inside of him. So he started to record his songs to make several            albums and look for a place where he can sing his songs. After trying            to perform in the subway stations and some other places, Setsuo has            frequented open mic shows since December, 2003. Then in 2004, he had            his own shows at several venues and also performed as part of singer/songwriter            sessions at CBGB&rsquo;s.</font></font></p>
<font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            <br/>
Musicians that influenced him most are The Beatles. Other facvorite            artists of his are Neil Young, The Kinks, The Isley Brothers, The Neville            Brothers, Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Otis Rush, Robert Cray, Aretha Franklin,            Laura Nyro, The Four Seasons, David Rudder, Common and many others.            <br/>

<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            Early Grace is an Alt. Country Rock band from New York formed back in            January 2002 by Christopher Bonet &amp; Anna Elias-Bonet. The band has            come a long way with their blend of Country &amp; Rock. They would say            that their music is definitely more rock influenced than anything else.            With Christopher&rsquo;s brother Sean Bonet on Bass and the amazing            Pete &ldquo;Moon&rdquo; Truncale on drums you can understand where this            powerful rock sound is derived. Lead singer Anna comes from a different            background in music, she holds a master&rsquo;s degree in classical            composition and is an extremely talented concert pianist. She is the            anchor in Early Grace&rsquo;s sound, with her beautiful vocals and well            crafted arrangements she has come into her own as a rock singer.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            The band shares a talent for writing songs. Their first effort titled            &ldquo;EP&rdquo; was a minor success but was well received by critics.            The response has traveled from as far as The Netherlands, Belgium &amp;            Europe. Nashville has also had their ears open for this band. On the            group's follow up &ldquo;Kick the Sky&rdquo; the band features a duet            by Anna &amp; Jason Ringenberg of Jason &amp; The Scorchers, one of            the finest Country/Rock bands to ever come out of Nashville, TN. Jason            was more than happy to invite Early Grace down to Nashville to record            with him. The track is called &ldquo;Tombstone Bound&rdquo; and was            recorded by the famous producer Brad Jones (Steve Earle, Sheryl Crow).            This amazing song will be one of the many singles on the band's up coming            full length &ldquo;Kick the Sky&rdquo; due out in stores this summer.            </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The            band is currently seeking Management &amp; Radio promotion so they can            focus on building their Independently owned Big Bad Train Records. The            Label was started in December 2004 by Christopher &amp; Anna to feature            an eclectic brand of music, everything from classical to country &amp;            folk. Early Grace will be touring this summer mostly through the south            and southwest. They will be performing in New York City and Long Island            until the new CD is complete, so keep a look out for this up and coming            Country Rock band. </font></font></p></span></span>]]>

<br/>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><strong><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bret            Mosley </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
</font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="mailto:bret@bretmosley.com">Email            Artist</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bretmosley.com/">Visit            Website</a> | <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alloyradio.com/artists/www.bretmosley.com">Join Email            List</a></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            Bret Mosley is a Texas-born part-Cherokee son of the desert. Things            he's been caught doing include (in this order)&mdash;ranch hand, linebacker,            mill worker, fur trapper, ballet dancer, stockbroker, shmactor, software            developer, yogi.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
But he's had a guitar in his hand the whole time. &ldquo;Oh, that's            what you do .&rdquo; someone once said as soon as they heard him play.            He picked up his father's Stella Harmony when he was six. At age 11&mdash;a            good decade and half before turntables became musical instruments&mdash;he            turned a Chet Atkins record by hand to learn &ldquo;Yakety Axe&rdquo;            note-by-note. He still has the guitar, even though some dear soul at            UPS drove a forklift through it several years ago as the culmination            to an extremely uphill stint in L.A. It was that experience, though,            that helped squeeze out his first song, &ldquo;Lord, Girl&rdquo;.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
His audience ranges from cowhands to bankers, from rastas to cops. As            a man who's lived numerous lives, and whose repertoire reflects it,            Bret has been chased plenty by the genre police. He has won out on this            one, though. A fan listening to him play on a subway platform once told            him he was dead center between Hank Williams, Sr. and The Ohio Players.            Not long ago, upon hearing some of his most recent material, a colleague            blurted out &ldquo;It's Hick-Hop!!&rdquo; So be it.</font></font></p>

Paul Woletske is an instrumental artist.<br/>
</font></font><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
&quot;Some things are best left unsaid. Most things actually.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He wrote poetry for years before picking up the guitar so, maybe he's            had his fill of words.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Although&quot; he continues, &quot;I still love reading poetry            and even write some poems here &amp; there, but my favorite poets are            the ones who go beyond words and get to the essence of things.&quot;</font></font></p>

</strong>Jeff picked up his first guitar at 17 after his little brother,            Doug, started playing bass. Jeff was not about to be out-cooled by his            little brother. They soon started playing in bands together and making            original music. This family style creative force spawned the legendary            Kalamazoo, Michigan bands Scurvy, Nacho Head, and Razzmatazz.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Later            in Chicago, Jeff studied music composition and guitar performance at            Columbia College Chicago where he was influenced by an ecclectic array            of musicians and composers. Along with the local college music scene,            Jeff soaked in the blues of the city and the folk music of the enduring            No Exit Cafe, which at the time the oldest existing cafe in the country.            It was at the No Exit where Jeff became a serious performer and started            creating a repetoir of original songs somewhere in between the genres            of folk, rock and blues.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now            in NYC, Jeff is working on his first studio release and performing throughout            the city.</font></p>

<p align="left"> In the early days, when not struggling with math or writing            3-page screenplays, Scott Meyers remembers sitting alone in his room            playing David Bowie songs on a nylon string guitar. Lessons felt more            like work than play, and the guitar&rsquo;s neck felt impossibly thick            in his 12-year old hands. So on a quiet summer morning, he put the guitar            away never to use it again. That was Tarzana, CA 1984.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
Sixteen years later while studying film and cinema in San Francisco,            Scott started listening intently to Neil Young, Paul Simon, Nick Drake,            and Bob Dylan albums. He borrowed a steel string acoustic from the guy            down the hall and he tried again. Late night practice and jam sessions            soon turned into preoccupation. His technique improved; his grades suffered.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
Before long, experimentation writing silly songs about doing the laundry            led to writing about more personal issues. After graduation, Scott started            playing more in public and writing consistently. &ldquo;For every four            songs I&rsquo;d write, there was one that I felt good enough about to            play in public,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
Eventually, Scott moved back east and dove headfirst into the folk scene            in Cambridge, MA. &ldquo;I had never played open mics for a packed room            of 75 silent and attentive people,&rdquo; recalls Scott. &ldquo;Usually,            you&rsquo;re competing with loud talkers in the front row or a coffee            grinder. They were actually listening and it scared the hell out of            me.&rdquo; When not in a club, Scott spent some afternoons busking on            the street or in T stations. &ldquo;Boston is great town for musicians,&rdquo;            he says.</p>
<p align="left"><br/>
Since returning to New York in 2001 (he was born in Far Rockaway) Scott            has begun recording his first CD tentatively titled &ldquo;15 Minute            Movie&rdquo; and plays regularly in his living room, bedroom and at            clubs in the Village.</p>

</strong><br/>
Born in Brooklyn, New York, and growing up &quot;between the Parachute            Jump&nbsp;and the Verrazano Bridge,&quot; Marc Barnhill was an avid            Beatles fan at the age of nine and a belated classic-rock teen. In the            1980s, he wrote poetry and found his musical tastes drifting toward            the introspective &quot;singer-songwriter&quot; genre. Citing such artists            as James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, David Wilcox,            Sting, Tracy Chapman, Indigo Girls, Nick Drake, and Jules Shear&nbsp;as            major influences, he began writing music in the late 1980s and collaborated            with brother Scott on a collection of guitar tracks called Cloudy Skies.            </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
In the early 1990s Marc was instrumental in the formation (and later            the dissolution) of the rock band&nbsp;Fall Out, serving as occasional            lyricist and backing vocalist. Other side projects included writing            and singing duty for poststructuralist concept band Ontology and for            experimental funk duo Urbal T. </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Marc became an English teacher in 1993 and over the next decade worked            at CUNY&nbsp;community colleges, New York University, and alternative            high schools (including The Bronx Guild, which&nbsp;he co-founded).            Meanwhile, he was writing songs that combined literary craftsmanship            with personal exploration. Many of the songs written during this period            were recorded as the Chasing After demos and promptly shelved.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            After performing live with&nbsp;Joey Figgiani&nbsp;at New York City's&nbsp;now-defunct            Psychic Cafe in 2002,&nbsp;Marc&nbsp;began work on his debut solo CD,            Blue Time, which was completed in November 2003 and independently released            in 2004.&nbsp; In addition to his participation in weekly open-mic events,            Marc has performed at such venues as CBGB, The Four-Faced Liar, The            Listening Room at Caffe Vivaldi, DT-UT, and The Bitter End.</font></font></p></span></span>]]>

&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all got big plans in our head and sometimes I wonder            where mine went&rdquo;</font></em></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Although man on earth has only technically been a band since 2002 the            <br/>
creative process and concept have been growing in singer Nathan&rsquo;s            head<br/>
for the last 5 years. After a series of solo demos he was joined by            Alex <br/>
who had been playing in a 10 piece funk band. The two went into the            studio,recorded a bunch of drum tracks and returned to their home studio            to finalize them. </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
<em><font size="1">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been four years in this cloud,            I&rsquo;ve got a storm inside and it needs to come out&rdquo;</font></em></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
Growth, re-invention and perhaps a little over analyzing lead to the            constant re-writing and re-recording over the next year. The two were            soon joined by MJ who had recently returned from Pennsylvania and an            ill fated childhood romance. Together they released their first internet            single, a demo of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, we&rsquo;ll be fine&rdquo;.            The song was downloaded by more than 3,000 peoplefrom their website            and the video for the song directed by the brilliant Megan Raney received            over 4,000 downloads in the winter of 2001- 2002. </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br/>
<em><font size="1">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of living if you aren&rsquo;t            really willing to change your mind?&rdquo;</font></em></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            <br/>
In Early 2002 the band began auditioning guitarists for the live band.            It took nearly a year to find Ron, with a few others filling in and            contributing in the process. It&rsquo;s perhaps this element that makes            man on earth most unique; as the band grewdifferent musicians with completely            different influences and styles appeared for short periods adding their            own elements, the culmination being something truly unique and diverse,            much like the members themselves.<br/>
</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Influences.<br/>
The members of man on earth are all extremely proactive music fans,            with an eclectic musical taste that touches on most musical genres.            <br/>
As a kid Alex was introduced to music by his father (a professional            Argentinean musician) his biggest influences have been Stewart Copeland,            Tony Williams, Bill Evans, the police, Stevie Wonder, <br/>
Phil Selway (radiohead), Jeff Porcaro &amp; Richard Ashcroft. &ldquo;I            like to play what&rsquo;s best for the music, being creative within            the musical style, lay the groove down and make things feel good&hellip;            it&rsquo;s not about me, it&rsquo;s about the band&rdquo;. <br/>
Mj has been interested in music his whole life, but spent many years            experimenting and learning different instruments before he finally settled            on the bass, which he attributes to the bass styling of Eric Avery <br/>
(Jane&rsquo;s Addiction), Joey Arkenstadt, Richard Ashcroft, Geddy lee            and Bootsy collins. This may explain his approach to playing &ldquo;I            try and make it as pretty as possible while maintaining a groove&rdquo;.            Mj was inspired to begin playing music by his Uncle John DiFiore &ldquo;when            I saw him play I was really impressed and knew what I wanted to do,            it takes me to another place&rdquo;<br/>
</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To            those that know Nathan, it may seem he&rsquo;s always been working on            this CD. When he was sixteen years old he worked all summer to buy a            four track and has spent the majority of his time since locked<br/>
away in his room recording his music. &ldquo;When I was in kindergarten            my teacher put on Beethoven&rsquo;s fifth symphony, that is the moment            I learned how powerful music can be&rdquo;. A predominately self taught            musician besides vocal training with Don Lawrence, Nathan considers            his biggest influences to be Prince, The Verve / Richard Ashcroft, Oasis,            Jane&rsquo;s Addiction, Tupac, Beethoven and constantly discovering            new music. <br/>
Originally from Brooklyn New York, Ron spent a few years pounding the            Jersey scene till he found his former band chlorophyll. With chlorophyll            Ron had his first taste of success; the band toured arenas with Alanis            Morrisette and Tori Amos, played radio shows and built a huge fan base.            <br/>
Ron&rsquo;s biggest influences have been Jimmy Hendrix, jimmy page,            radiohead and Jeff beck; but when asked about his own playing style            he says &ldquo;I like to keep it tastefull, whether it requires 1 note            or ten <br/>
notes it&rsquo;s really what&rsquo;s best for the song.&rdquo;</font></font></p></span></span>]]>

Rawson is one of the hottest new up and coming rock bands out of NYC,            combining the raw energy and passion of founder/front man Sean Haythe,            the steady thumping of Adam Drandoff of bass, the cutthroat licks of            Jimmy Sharp on lead guitar and the funky timekeeper on drums Rob Roman.            </font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Rawson            brings to the table a refreshing, straightforward, hard hitting, soulful,            funky rock sound that creates an undeniable feeling of pure emotion.            With influences like Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, Lenny Kravitz,            Prince and Stevie Ray Vaughn, you can tell the direction Rawson is going.</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">            When asked, &quot;Why do they call you Rawson&quot;, Sean Haythe replies,            &quot;'Cause We Raw!, Son.&quot;</font></font></p></span></span>]]>

<br/>
&quot;Although&quot; he continues, &quot;I still love reading poetry            and even write some poems here &amp; there, but my favorite poets are            the ones who go beyond words and get to the essence of things.&quot;</font></font></p>
