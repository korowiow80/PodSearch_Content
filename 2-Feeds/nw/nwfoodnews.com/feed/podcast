	<itunes:summary>[HOST INTRO] Green garlic isn’t necessarily green, it’s just young and hasn’t formed cloves. Farmers’ Markets often offer produce you won’t find in supermarkets — things that are unusual, fragile or that the average person simple doesn’t know how to cook.  Green garlic, for instance.  In this installment of the Market &amp; Garden Report, correspondent Guy Hand asks an expert about those tender, young shoots called green garlic.

(Hand) I’m at the Capital City Public Market with Charlene Stelling of Riverview Gardens in Fruitland.  I call her the garlic lady, because in another month, she’ll have dozens of different kinds of garlic bulbs for sale.  For now though, she’s selling a springtime treat called green garlic.  It’s immature garlic, young, tender garlic shoots that many people prize for it’s subtle flavor.
(Hand) How is green garlic different than regular garlic? (Stelling) Well, it’s kind of the same thing only we harvest it when it’s so young before any cloves are formed.  And it has a little bit milder taste, but it’s got a really flavorful, because it’s got a lot of oils in it right now, it’s got a really flavorful garlic taste to it.
Charlene Stelling with green garlic
(Hand) And it has less of a bite than regular garlic and it’s not quite as bitter, is that true, so for people who may not like garlic, this might be a nice introduction?  (Stelling) Yes, it is milder, because of the oils it, it’s a little smoother taste, it doesn’t have that really quick bite to it.  You can still taste the garlic, but it doesn’t stand out so much.  You can eat it around your friends (laughing) . . .
(Hand)  Charlene says they pick green garlic before it forms cloves and the papery membrane that separates those cloves.  It looks like a green onion or a scallion.  And like those, you can eat the whole thing.
Green garlic pesto made with green garlic leaves
(Stelling) You cut of the root and you use the whole rest of the garlic.  (Hand) So you can use all the green leaves as well?  (Stelling) Yes, it makes a very good pesto to put in your food processor with some pine nuts and olive oil and parmesan cheese and makes a very good pesto to put on fresh pasta.
(Hand) And what’s the season for green garlic generally, how much longer will it go?  (Stelling) Well, we’ll probably have it until mid to late June.  We start the first of April or mid April, when the market starts and we bring some every week.
Juicy, paperless bulb of green garlic before it forms cloves.
(Hand) Well let me ask you one last question.  I think of you guys as kind of the garlic people because you have so many different varieties of garlic later in the season, what is it about garlic?  (Stelling)  We like to present something at the market that isn’t necessarily found elsewhere at the stores.  (Hand) And I think that’s one of the great things about farmers’ markets is you can get things like green garlic that you couldn’t get at a normal supermarket.  (Stelling) That’s true, I don’t know of anywhere that you could possibly by green garlic in the stores here, so it’s good you have a place you can come down and satisfy your garlic whims (laughing) . . . (Hand) good.
(Hand) Satisfying garlic whims at the the Capital City Public Market, I’m Guy Hand for Boise State Public Radio’s Market and Garden Report.

(Editor’s Note: Now that farmers’ market and gardening season are back, we’re going to revisit some past Market &amp; Garden radio shows that highlight produce and gardening.  This weekend, May 12 &amp; 13, Peaceful Belly Farm wraps up their annual tomato plant sale at their farm near Hidden Springs, Idaho )
[HOST INTRO] We’ve had a hot and cold Spring and gardeners are anxious to get plants like tomatoes in the ground.  But when?  And what varieties?  In this installment of The Market &amp; Garden Report, correspondent Guy Hand digs up some useful tips on growing tomatoes.

(Plant Sale sounds) (Woman): Is there a red beef steak? (Josie): There’s tons of beef steaks over there . . .

(Hand) I’m at Peaceful Belly’s annual tomato plant sale at the new North End Organic Nursery in Boise [the sale is now at Peaceful Belly farm near Hidden Springs].  People here are asking a lot of questions.  Luckily, Peaceful Belly owners Clay and Josie Erskine have answers.  Over the last 8 years, they’ve successfully grown some 20,000 tomato plants.
(Josie) Boise is just barely a tomato climate.
(Hand) That’s Josie Erskine.  With our relatively short growing season, she says it’s essential to know how long it’ll take a variety to actually produce ripe tomatoes.  On a plant’s label, it’s called “days to maturity.”
(Josie) So when you’re choosing your tomatoes, make sure that if you want to try some of those fun heirlooms that take a long time for days to maturity, that you also put in a few early days to maturity. Something that has 57 days or 75 so you’ll start getting tomatoes in July and you won’t have to wait all the way into September to get those tomatoes.
(Hand) But once you choose tomatoes, when should you plant them?  Instead of waiting for the snow to melt on Shafer Butte, as local lore suggests, Clay &amp; Josie begin studying the 10 day forecast in early May.

(Josie) Tomatoes really do not like temperatures that go below 40 degrees.  So I do not plant out tomatoes until I can see in an extended forecast that the next ten days are going to have 45 degrees or above at night.   The days can be 85 degrees, but then at night it can still be freezing, so even if it’s nice and hot it still may not be time to plant out your tomatoes.
(Hand) Clay Erskine:
(Clay) If you do plant out your tomatoes just be aware that for the next couple of weeks you might take a look each day at the nighttime temperature and you might want to possibly throw a blanket over the top of your tomatoes if it gets down too cold.
(Hand) Clay says keep an eye on those nighttime temperatures until the first of June.  And here’s Josie’s recommended favorites:

(Josie) I say number one, put in a cherry tomato.  You’re always going to have tomatoes ready to go, you don’t have to wait for them to ripen, go with Sun Gold, that is my all time favorite.  Next one I would say if you want to do all heirlooms, stick in a Slivery Fur Tree, she’s going to knock your socks off.  Put in a Cherokee Purple, put in a Chianti Rose, put in a Brandywine, put in a Virginia Sweet or a hillbilly and make sure that you grow a Lemon Boy.
(Hand) And start dreaming about tomato salads and homemade salsa.  For Edible Idaho’s Market &amp; Garden Report and Boise State Radio, I’m Guy Hand.
Peaceful Belly’s annual tomato plant sale continues this weekend, May 8th and 9th, at the North End Organic Nursery at 2350 W. Hill Road in Boise.

[HOST INTRO] Asparagus is at it’s peak right now at area farmers’ markets. But asparagus season is short.  So, in this week’s Market &#38; Garden Report, Guy Hand finds out how to make the most of this quintessential, spring vegetable. (Sounds of market) (Hand) Asparagus is actually an immature fern, a delicacy even the Greeks and Romans loved.  And nothing shouts spring louder than fresh asparagus.  So I’ve stopped by the Capital City Public Market to soak up some asparagus wisdom from Jerry Stelling.  He runs AC&#38;D Farms in New Plymouth and has asparagus plants that are 20 years old.  He knows how to pick great asparagus.

(Editor’s Note: Now that farmers’ market season is back, we’re going to revisit some past Market &amp; Garden radio shows that highlight produce at it’s peak.)
[HOST INTRO] Asparagus is at it’s peak right now at area farmers’ markets. But asparagus season is short.  So, in this week’s Market &amp; Garden Report, Guy Hand finds out how to make the most of this quintessential, spring vegetable.


(Sounds of market) (Hand) Asparagus is actually an immature fern, a delicacy even the Greeks and Romans loved.  And nothing shouts spring louder than fresh asparagus.  So I’ve stopped by the Capital City Public Market to soak up some asparagus wisdom from Jerry Stelling.  He runs AC&amp;D Farms in New Plymouth and has asparagus plants that are 20 years old.  He knows how to pick great asparagus.
(Stelling) First off you want to make sure that it’s not too pliable, but you can kind of bend it a little bit and tell that it’s not dried out and that there’s actually some firmness and some crispness to it.
(Hand) Stelling gives a spear a little flex test.  It bends, but just a bit.  Next he looks at the base.
(Stelling)You want to make sure you’re not buying three or four inches of white down at the bottom end that’s real fibrous and real woody.  You wanna have 5, 6, 7 inches of good spear.

(Hand) But don’t snap the bottom off before you cook it.  That’s a wasteful wive’s tale.  Just cut the white part off.  The rest should be tender.  Next Stelling checks the top.
(Stelling) If the top looks a little bit mushy, you can maybe give it a little touch and tell that it has already starting to break down.  To get to that point, it’s either had to be exposed to heat for a while or it’s been harvested for probably a week and a half at that point.
(Hand) Let’s talk a little bit about the size of the spears.  I know that some people really like small spears, some people like large spears.
(Stelling) Well, we eat all of it.  Some people prefer larger stuff for grilling for obvious reasons, it’s a little bit easier to handle and the smaller spears, some people like them ‘cause they steam up really quick.

(Hand) I used to think fat spears were older and therefore tougher, but that’s not true.  Thick asparagus can be just as young and tender as thin, though you may want to take a vegetable peeler to the bottom part of a thick spear, where the skin can get a little fibrous.  But how does Jerry Stelling’s family cook asparagus?
(Stelling)  We like to put a little bit of butter in a pan and some asparagus on top there, fry it around until it’s warmed up and crack some eggs over it.  (Hand) That sounds pretty good.  (Stelling)  Yea, it is.  We really enjoy that.  Another way, you can steam it . . .
(Hand) There are tons of way’s to fix asparagus: grilled, sauteed, even pureed into pesto for pasta sauce.  That’s really good.  But you’ve only got a few weeks of the fresh, local stuff to work with.  That’s why I’ve posted a bunch of recipes at Northwest Food News dot com.
(Hand) For Edible Idaho’s Market &amp; Garden Report and Boise State Radio, I’m Guy Hand.
Here are links to recipes and stories on asparagus:

Asparagus is a Rite of Spring/L.A. Times
Asparagus-and-Camembert Sandwiches/The Oregonian
How to Can Pickled Asparagus/Year of Plenty
Asparagus Pesto/N.Y. Times


And here’s Guy’s Asparagus and Tuna Pesto recipe (it’s great)

1 5 -1/2 oz. can good quality tuna in olive oil
1/2 cup walnuts or pine nuts (reserving a little for topping)
1/2 lemon and grated zest of whole lemon (reserving a little for topping)
Dash Worcestershire sauce
Dash soy sauce (optional, but I like it)
Fistful of tarragon, basil or dill
Olive oil to taste
One bunch asparagus


Blanch trimmed asparagus in salted water until just tender.
Chop asparagus in half inch sections, reserving heads for topping.
Put the tuna with its oil, nuts (reserving a few for topping), lemon zest, [...]</itunes:summary>

If Janie Burns and Amy Hutchinson hadn’t organized the project called “2011: The Year of Idaho Food,” I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to spend the last 12 months sipping gin at 8:30 in the morning (well, once), foraging for stinging nettles in the forests of McCall, riding in a big-ass wheat combine on the Palouse, sampling more fermented foods than I thought humanly possible (or medically prudent), eating goat five ways, jet boating down the Salmon in search of pioneer apples and sifting through the sands of the Snake River for a lunch of fresh-water mussels (not recommended). And that’s just for starters.
Still, my weekly collaboration with the Boise Weekly and Boise State Public Radio to write food and farming stories under the Year of Idaho Food banner was just one feature of the project’s broader agenda.
Year of Idaho Food co-founder Janie Burns.
“The Year of Idaho Food was envisioned as a means of engaging the public to think about their food,” local food advocate Janie Burns said of the statewide project she and Hutchinson dreamt up in March of 2010 while “Amy and I were trapped in a car for six hours, traveling back from Moscow where we’d both been at a food conference.”
The two women wanted to create what Hutchinson called “a virtual table” where Idahoans who normally didn’t have an opportunity to express their interest in food and agriculture could gather and publicly share their food and farming stories via a Year of Idaho Food website. Burns and Hutchinson also wanted to organize actual on-the-ground events and encourage participants to organize their own events so people could meet face to face, all under the egalitarian banner of the Year of Idaho Food.
“A lot of people think about food and the issues surrounding it,” Burns said, “but they’ve never had the opportunity or been empowered to do anything. So we hoped that this would be some kind of organizing principle that would allow people to do something that they might not have had the courage to do otherwise.”
In January 2011, Idahoans from around the state began submitting their Year of Idaho Food stories to Northwest Food News (a web site I administer). The first, from Michele Murphree in Sandpoint, detailed Bonner County’s progress in creating school gardens. Over the year, stories included lessons shared by an accidental chicken rancher, a child’s fascination with tractors, an ode to sorrel, raised garden beds built from actual beds and a full-on, Idaho grown Thanksgiving. Some participants used the website to post multiple entries. Melissa Frazier, for instance, took the opportunity to begin cataloguing the state’s growing number of community gardens, a project she plans to continue on the Northwest Food News site into 2012. Casey O’Leary wrote several stories about the numerous epiphanies she’s experienced while working on her urban farm, Earthly Delights, and also plans to continue submitting stories.
Year of Idaho Food co-founder Amy Hutchinson.
Along with the 50 written submissions that the Year of Idaho Food posted, co-founder Amy Hutchinson, who also founded the Boise Urban Garden School (BUGS), said she was pleased to see how quickly participants put together their own grass-roots projects.
“In addition to potlucks and different neighborhood gathers,” Hutchinson said, “there are now newsletters, a compilation of titles about books about gardening and food; there have been baby and bridal showers that have focused on local food as well as discussions and book clubs.”
Hutchinson said schools and universities got involved too: “We’ve partnered with the University of Idaho; College of Idaho has done a tremendous amount around food this year and also different schools from Council, Idaho to the Boise School District, which held a harvest day.”
Over the Labor Day weekend, Burns and Hutchinson organized a “Day of Idaho Food” celebration challenging Idahoans to create a meal made [...]</itunes:summary>
