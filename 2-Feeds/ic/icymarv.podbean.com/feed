		<itunes:summary>Hello Friends
This month’s podcast is addressing these three topics:
1. The Fuel Crisis in America: With the cost of gasoline, electricity and other home heating fuels escalating beyond the average American’s budget, is it too late for an alternative fuel strategy?
2. Should MRA (Members Representational Allowance) be cut? We broached this topic due to the current climate of budget cuts and high unemployment. It seems there is a large dichotomy between cutting programs that effects the citizenry and those of our politicians. It came to our attention (Congressional Research Service) that in the calendar year 2009, members of the House received an average (MRA) allowance of $1,484,174. That’s a lot of wampum, folks! Now multiply that by 435 members of congress and 100 senators and the tally balloons to almost $1 billion per year. Just cutting $400,000 annually from each member could send thousands of high school grads to some very prestigious colleges, tuition paid!
3. Cell Phone Etiquette: Is it just me or is there a “Cone of silence” that exists? I’ve heard way too many intimate phone conversations in the dentist office; grocery store; on airplanes and in washrooms. Come on people, this is getting out of hand. 
This show is one that we enjoyed recording. We hope that you will find us both informative and entertaining. Also, we will start raffling off a messenger’s bag in the coming months. Keep listening for the clues on how to win. And if that weren’t enough, we are busy building a new website. We’ve outgrown the current site (it’s starting to look haggard). www.2conversing.com; facebook; www.facebook.com/2conversing and www.twitter.com/2conversing.

Correction:  On the show I said that congress had 500 plus seats.  That was an error and I corrected it in this posting.  Keep listening and tell a friend.

		<itunes:summary>Hello everyone and welcome to another show. We’ve been preparing this one for a while and we hope that you will find it enjoyable. Spring is almost here and we can’t wait to thaw out from the long winter’s freeze. The politics in Chicago is always a hot topic and that is our first segment. The president’s former chief of staff, Rahm Emanuelle, is now the mayor of the nation’s third largest city. The problems that he will face are huge; but, like many other cities, the main problem is the budget deficit. 
We discuss this seemingly perpetual problem that has many of us wondering, what happened? How did we get into this situation, and most importantly, how do we get the ship back on course?
In our next segment we discuss unemployment. Not so much the numbers, but the affects that it has on us both mentally and physically. We also talk about the difference between the female and male approach to handling the stress and stigmas associated with being unemployed. And later in the conversation, we talk about how it impacts our families and what we can do to keep ourselves going in tough times.
And finally, we move into the third segment and talk about “The Idiot Box”. Is television programming going to the dogs? “You are the daddy,” is considered exciting television to many viewers. I didn’t know that there are so many judges with a hankering to be on television. Do these shows come under the category of reality TV, dramas, soap operas, or just plain junk? Join us as we discuss the plight of television today.
Don’t forget you can find us at our website—www.2conversing.com or http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/icymarv/id400968420. Also we’re on facebook and twitter. We love bringing our show to you. Send us your email suggestions, questions, or encouragement. Talk to you soon.

Reflecting on when we began this podcast, a mere five months ago, I can say that our numbers are growing rapidly and it’s all because of you, our listeners; our friends. 
However, the best is yet to come. This is what we’ve been waiting for. In the spring we will begin having guests that will help improve the show and bring you even more information. Our producers have come up with a format that will be exciting and really cool. I can’t wait.
On this show we will discuss:

1. Sarah Palin in 2012?
 Are We Ready For Sarah Louise Palin, A “Mama Grizzly” President?
 Do You Think That The Former Governor Of Alaska And Reality Television Show Host Can Run The County?

2. Immigration (who are these people?)
 America Is Fighting Illegal Immigration On Many Fronts, But Who Are The Targets?

3. NCAA Pay For Play: 
We Discuss The Pros And Cons Of Paying Student Athletes. Should Those Who Put Butts In The Seats Be Paid For Doing So?
Are Those “Tuition Free” Scholarships Enough?

		<itunes:summary>The 2 Conversing Show
Hello everyone and Happy New Year! 2011 is here and we are happy to have a full year to share our thoughts with you and to hear what you are thinking. Reflecting on when we began this podcast, a mere five months ago, I can say that our numbers are growing rapidly and it’s all because of you, our listeners; our friends. 
However, the best is yet to come. This is what we’ve waiting for. In the spring we will begin having guests that will help improve the show and bring you even more information. Our producers have come up with a format that will be exciting and really cool. I can’t wait.
On this show we will discuss:

1. Sarah Palin in 2012?
 Are We Ready For Sarah Louise Palin, A “Mama Grizzly” President?
 Do You Think That The Former Governor Of Alaska And Reality Television Show Host Can Run The County?

2. Immigration (who are these people?)
 America Is Fighting Illegal Immigration On Many Fronts, But Who Are The Targets?

3. NCAA Pay For Play: 
We Discuss The Pros And Cons Of Paying Student Athletes. Should Those Who Put Butts In The Seats Be Paid For Doing So?
Are Those “Tuition Free” Scholarships Enough?
Come join us as we discuss these topics. As always we welcome your email to let us know if there are any future topics that you would like to suggest. You can find us onhttp://www.facebook.com/, twitter , iTunes and our website 2conversing.com. We thank you for listening, and as always, tell a friend.

Hello everyone and Happy New Year! 2011 is here and we are happy to have a full year to share our thoughts ..</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>2Conversing’s New Year Show
Hello everyone and Happy New Year! 2011 is here and we are happy to have a full year to share our thoughts with you and to hear what you are thinking. Reflecting on when we began this podcast, a mere five months ago, I can say that our numbers are growing rapidly and it’s all because of you, our listeners; our friends. 
However, the best is yet to come. This is what we’ve waiting for. In the spring we will begin having guests that will help improve the show and bring you even more information. Our producers have come up with a format that will be exciting and really cool. I can’t wait.
On this show we will discuss:

1. Sarah Palin in 2012?
 Are We Ready For Sarah Louise Palin, A “Mama Grizzly” President?
 Do You Think That The Former Governor Of Alaska And Reality Television Show Host Can Run The County?

2. Immigration (who are these people?)
 America Is Fighting Illegal Immigration On Many Fronts, But Who Are The Targets?

3. NCAA Pay For Play: 
We Discuss The Pros And Cons Of Paying Student Athletes. Should Those Who Put Butts In The Seats Be Paid For Doing So?
Are Those “Tuition Free” Scholarships Enough?
Come join us as we discuss these topics. As always we welcome your email to let us know if there are any future topics that you would like to suggest. You can find us onhttp://www.facebook.com/, twitter , iTunes and our website 2conversing.com. We thank you for listening, and as always, tell a friend.

		<itunes:summary>Hello everyone:
 Let me begin by saying that this special report is not the opinion of management or my co-host Lavelle Bell. Moreover, it isn’t the reason we began doing the show 2Conversing. However, I feel that this topic needed and deserved some attention.
As you know we have already posted our holiday show and we hope that you found it interesting. We enjoyed doing it.
Currently those in government are preparing to vote on the Bush era tax cuts. These are the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2002 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Reconciliation Act of 2003. These acts were meant to stimulate the economy—how’s that working for ya?
I don’t run either hot or cold for either party. My politics, I think, is what’s best for America is what’s best for us all. And that is what this broadcast is all about. You have the president, whose salary is around $227,300/yr. and the average congressional salary hovers around the $193,000/yr mark. Now, counting President Obama and representative Boehner’s investments and other activities, these guys are millionaires. Millionaires who see it fit to take the unemployed hostage.
The president wants to extend expired unemployment insurance to the out of work citizens. This extension is for 99 weeks. The republicans are having none of this without approval of the tax cuts.  These Tax cuts will add to the federal deficit and don’t truly benefit the average citizen. If you’re below that $250,000 threshold, you’re not going to see or feel any noticeable cash flow increase. However, those above will notice a marked jump in cash. The millionaires are arguing for 10’s of thousands of dollars in tax cuts.
Now 99 weeks does sound like an extended amount of time, but with an unemployment rate that hovers around 9.45 % and a dismal hiring outlook for the foreseeable future this is not an outrageous request. It’s a necessity.
Some, like William Beach of the Heritage Foundation, recently said on a PBS News Hour that the extension “changes the behavior of the people who are unemployed. They don’t look for work as much as they otherwise would.”
My questions to Mr. Beach are “Do you think that these people are some lard butt ne’er-do-wells seeking a government handout? Do you honestly think that these people desire to be home unable to pay their bills, buy food, pay their rent or mortgage and endure the humility that many feel when they are without work?”
They don’t enjoy the undeserved bonuses or golden parachutes that so many members of large corporations or foundations do. However, they can pay for government bailout plans that use their tax dollars to pay for corporate America’s greed.
I know that the politicians will agree on both the tax cuts and extension of the unemployment insurance plan. But what I disagree with was how they got to this—more money for the top—even if it meant taking the unemployed hostage.
If you feel strongly about his, call the white house at 202-456-1111 or go to their site USA.gov and they have a contact page where you can leave a message. I will place this information on our website, thanks for listening. And as always, tell a friend.
