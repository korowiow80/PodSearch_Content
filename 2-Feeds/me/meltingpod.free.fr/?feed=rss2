			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent that nice day trying to save in urgency my numerous and heavy audio and video archives and transfering them to different external hard drives and DVDs hoping it will give more energy and oxygen to my computer which shows very worrying signs of weakness these last days and didn&#8217;t work correctly. So no time and no possibility for a very creative post to celebrate that 7th anniversary but with luck maybe my cleaning will help and I will be able to do something better in a not too distant future !!</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/photos/Oriental Fusion Marseille La Meson 2012.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://meltingpod.free.fr/wp-content/photos/OrientalFusionMars2012.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
My good friends from Oriental Fusion (Hakim Hamadouche vocals and mandoluth, Ahmad Compaoré drums and Edmond Hosdikian sax) reforming the band after a 10 years break at La Meson in Marseille February 18th 2012 : a videoclip from that great night soon !</p>
<p> Anyway I couldn&#8217;t miss to point that day despite the technical difficulties because I love too much the number 7 and funnily I share for a few years now this anniversary March 1st with <a href="http://meltingpod.free.fr/?p=201">Texas Terri</a> who told me in <a href="http://meltingpod.free.fr/?p=201"> her last live interview</a> she decided to move that day from Los Angeles to Berlin (a big change in her life and carreer) and Ed Kuepper who chose also that day to launch his blog for his own label <a href="http://princemelonrecords.blogspot.com/"> Prince Melon Records</a>. Btw : If you live in Australia you can see Ed in Melbourne and Adelaïde where he is currently touring with Mark Dawson&#8230;:)</p>
<p>The International Women Day March 8th my podcast Meltingpod will be 7 years old, hoping I could publish some new songs you never heard before&#8230;:) and by a lucky coincidence <a href="https://www.facebook.com/edkuepper">Ed Kuepper</a> chose also that day to release his new studio album &#8220;Second Winter&#8221;..so stay connected !!!</p>

A video I filmed during the show in Marseille Oct 2011 where Chris played in solo &#8220;Photograph&#8221; then &#8220;In the Mirror&#8221; with the Bailey Burns Gang !</p>
<p>In that part I talked with Chris about more personal things as his new solo album&#8217;s recording in Australia (release expected very soon, maybe this year, can&#8217;t wait!!), his projects with The Saints and his last duo tour with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/edkuepper">Ed Kuepper</a> in May/June 2010.<br />
As I can&#8217;t play songs from Chris&#8217; new album yet, I illustrate the interview with some excerpts of that Australian tour with Ed, thank to a hard fan who sent me his audio recording in the audience at Troubadour in Brisbane.</p>

<p>I chose three songs from Chris where Ed is playing guitar and doing the backing vocals : &#8220;In the mirror, Photograph and Gone with the wind&#8221;.<br />
I finished with one of my favorite songs from Ed &#8220;The way I made you feel&#8221; where Chris is playing bass and doing the backing vocals ! Enjoy !!! Hoping they will record something together one day again or at the minimum wishing they will tour Europe with that duo !!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a long silence with the podcasts (exactly one year today, strange coincidence !!) I&#8217;m back with you again and to honor this return I propose to you a great live interview or more exactly a very friendly conversation with Rob Younger (ex <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theofficialradiobirdman">Radio Birman</a>) I recorded this Summer before his show at <a href="http://www.lamachineacoudre.com/">La Machine à Coudre</a> in Marseille when he was touring Europe with his famous Australian punk rock band <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theofficialnewchrists">The New Christs !!!</a></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/photos/New Christs Marseille Rob and Brent July 2011.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://meltingpod.free.fr/wp-content/photos/NewChristsBrentRobMars2011.jpg" alt="" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="wp-content/photos/New Christs Dave and Stuart Marseille July 2011.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://meltingpod.free.fr/wp-content/photos/NewChristsDaveStuartMars2011.jpg" alt=""/></a><br />
Rob Younger and Brent Williams on the left, Dave Ketley and Paul Larson (from the Celibate Rifles, specially here for the tour 2011 replacing Stuart Wilson) on the right&#8230;the New Christs at La Machine à Coudre !!</p>
<p>The New Christs delivered us a fantastic performance, sincere, warm-hearted, professional and wild like the great talentuous musicians and generous rockers they are&#8230;they can play on big festivals&#8217; stages like they can play for a small venue with the same powerful energy&#8230;I can even say they are more impressing in a small venue&#8230;Wow that superbe wall of guitars in front of the stage with Brent, Jim and Dave !! Rob adapted his show to the place he had and still was more fascinating, the air was saturated of music, the drummer was a hero (and all of us by the way) with that highly hot temperature of Summer : in fact we all shared a bath of sounds in a complete pleasure close to the trance&#8230;:)<br />
Here below a short videoclip I filmed with my small compact camera to try to give you a little idea&#8230;Enjoy!</p>

		<itunes:summary>After a long silence with the podcasts (exactly one year today, strange coincidence !!) I'm back with you again and to honor this return I propose to you a great live interview or more exactly a very friendly conversation with Rob Younger (ex Radio Birman) I recorded this Summer before his show at La Machine agrave; Coudre in Marseille when he was touring Europe with his famous Australian punk rock band The New Christs !!!

#160;
Rob Younger and Brent Williams on the left, Dave Ketley and Paul Larson (from the Celibate Rifles, specially here for the tour 2011 replacing Stuart Wilson) on the right...the New Christs at La Machine agrave; Coudre !!

The New Christs delivered us a fantastic performance, sincere, warm-hearted, professional and wild like the great talentuous musicians and generous rockers they are...they can play on big festivals' stages like they can play for a small venue with the same powerful energy...I can even say they are more impressing in a small venue...Wow that superbe wall of guitars in front of the stage with Brent, Jim and Dave !! Rob adapted his show to the place he had and still was more fascinating, the air was saturated of music, the drummer was a hero (and all of us by the way) with that highly hot temperature of Summer : in fact we all shared a bath of sounds in a complete pleasure close to the trance...:)
Here below a short videoclip I filmed with my small compact camera to try to give you a little idea...Enjoy!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last Saturday October 22th 2011 I had the great pleasure to see again one of my favorite French rock bands <a href="http://www.myspace.com/congerconger">Conger! Conger!</a> performing Live their new and first album &#8220;At the corner of the world&#8221; at Studio Decanis in Marseille !!</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/photos/Conger Conger Studio Decanis Marseille Octobre 2011.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://meltingpod.free.fr/wp-content/photos/CongerDecanisMars2011.jpg" alt="" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="wp-content/photos/Conger Conger Studio Decanis Marseille Oct 2011.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://meltingpod.free.fr/wp-content/photos/CongerCongerStudioDecanis2011.jpg" alt=""/></a><br />
Conger! Conger! Live at Studio Decanis Marseille 22th 2011 (click to enlarge the pic)</p>
<p>Each of their shows always contains the promise of some theatrical and musical surprises. Maybe it comes because the drummer Patrice De Benedetti is a dancer as well and his both mates Pierrot Gon at the guitar and Didier Bautzmann at the bass are very sensitive and inventive musicians !! They really created a new sound, highly structure their songs and mightily play them on stage sometimes at the limit of our ears&#8217; abilities&#8230;:) Hoping you will enjoy the photos and the short videoclip I filmed that night and spread the word if you like them !</p>
<p><center><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PbEymC9Ozj8?fs=1&amp;hl=fr_FR"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PbEymC9Ozj8?fs=1&amp;hl=fr_FR" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></center></p>
<p>It was the first time I went to that place &#8220;<a href="http://www.lesstudiosdecanis.com/">Studio Decanis&#8221;</a> and I really appreciated to find out a new cosy and well adapted space dedicated to the music and the arts in general in the town. So many dynamic clubs closed due to financial difficulties (cf Le Balthazar) or administrative issues (cf recently L&#8217;Enthröpy, temporarly I hope) despite the town is preparing to be the capital of Europe for the culture in 2013&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway if you like Conger! Conger! you will find more videos and pics about that band on Meltingpod <a href="http://meltingpod.free.fr/?p=227">HERE LIVE at Café Julien</a> in November 2010 and <a href="http://meltingpod.free.fr/?p=217">HERE Live at La Machine à Coudre</a> in April 2010, by the way two nice places to listen to Live Music in Marseille too !!</p>
<p>PS : I got some computer&#8217;s major issues these last months but they seem to be fixed now so I will try to publish asap the reviews of older events where I took pics or videos or recorded interviews&#8230;stay in touch !!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/cowboysfromouterspace">The Cowboys from Outerspace</a> the famous band from Marseille opened the night at La Machine à Coudre in Marseille May 26th 2011 for their friends <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theholycurse">Holy Curse</a> from Paris who gave their last show in our town during a goodbye tour all over France : a great and moving rocking night in a terribly hot atmosphere around 50°Celsius&#8230;:) Enjoy this report with some pics and two videos clips with both bands !</p>

<p>Holy Curse played some songs from their new album &#8220;Take it as it comes&#8221; produced by Rob Younger (<a href="http://www.myspace.com/theofficialnewchrists">The New Christs</a>, Radio Birman) and if they were stopping the band after that tour they didn&#8217;t break their friendship as it&#8217;s obvious on the video and pictures : it was a very moving goodbye to the friends and a great musical performance !! Thank you guys for your passion and good luck for your new projects !!</p>

Big Bang Dockers Premiere in the Street Arts City April 9th 2011</p>
<p>The project called Big Bang Dockers started in Marseille in April and was artistically managed for the first part by Marseille street theater company <a href="http://www.generikvapeur.com/html/home3.htm">Generik Vapeur</a>. It was performed by the young artists first time in front of the audience in the Street Arts City April 9th 2011 after a week working together.<br />
I filmed (below) a few moments of the show to give you an idea of their fantastic energy, creativity and good spirits !</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/lpzKz57WTkk?fs=1&amp;hl=fr_FR" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/lpzKz57WTkk?fs=1&amp;hl=fr_FR" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>After the show a big party and BBQ was organized by <a href="http://www.eurocircle.info">Eurocircle</a> who technically initiated and managed the whole project and hosted by Generik Vapeur in their new place in the Street Arts City : another great moment to exchange around the food and the music !</p>

Both last pics : a part of the Chinese group; 3 of the young artists from the 3 countries : China, France, Germany !!</p>
<p>Big Bang Dockers will be improved and developed in a second part in Shanghaï and then in a third part in Hamburg. We hope the final project will be performed in 2013 for Marseille European Capital for Culture.<br />

<p>I made a short video clip for you with some Live excerpts I filmed during the show with my small compact camera; you will maybe recognize there the signature of the great artists on stage : smiles and simplicity, the fun to play and to share the music in a warm-hearted ambience !!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes !! Each time I&#8217;m the first surprised : one year more and still alive despite the difficulties of the life and some periodic moments of doubts. I have to admit there is a long time I didn&#8217;t post anything here but a big part of my blogging acitivity happened on my facebook page these last times : by the way you can join me here at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/meltingpod">http://www.facebook.com/meltingpod</a> if you want. On another hand I lost a big part of the pleasure I had to run my other blog on myspace at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/meltingpod">http://www.myspace.com/meltingpod</a> since their commercial team decided to make more money with the advertizing and updated so badly their datas and design that they completly killed their tool which was at the beginning a fantastic idea to promote the music. Though I try to resist there hoping they will realize one day their mistake&#8230;<br />
In fact to be honest my favorite place is here, I feel home, I hope you too my faithful friends&#8230;so Happy 6th Birthday to Meltingpod, wishing to share with you still more exciting news in the next future !!!<br />
PS : My podcast Meltingpod will be 6 years old March 8th so stay connected, you could have a nice surprise very soon..:)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite rock band from Marseille <a href="http://www.myspace.com/congerconger">Conger! Conger!</a> gave a show at <a href="http://www.espace-julien.com/fr/">The Cafe of the Espace Julien</a> November 20th 2010 and tested that night a lot of their new songs before going to Toulouse to record there their new album&#8230;in fact this week !!!</p>

Click to enlarge these pics at Cafe Julien with such a nice light-show !</p>
<p>As always each show is different with Conger! Conger! : the new songs brought a new color it&#8217;s clear but the performance is always surprising with Patrice De Benedetti the drummer and lead singer (former dancer with Ex-Nihilo and right now with his own dance company beside his creative activities with the band !!) which tries all the time to feel the intuition of the moment : very focused his both mates on stage Pierrot Gon at the guitar and Didier Bautzmann at the bass quietly followed him in each of his fantasies for our greatest pleasure !!  (live video below)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.generikvapeur.com/html/home3.htm">Generik Vapeur</a> the famous French street theater company from Marseille left the ex-Abatttoirs based in the old industrial area St Louis the 10/10/10 a symbolic date for a symbolic move with all the family, friends and fans who accompagned them to their new place : The Street Arts City erected in another old industrial area in Marseille, Les Aygualades.<br />
It was hard to leave the old Abattoirs which was the theater&#8217;s stage of such fabulous events and stories, artistic or humans, full of poetry and passion during 20 years !!<br />

Caty Avram and Pierre Berthelot, both founder members of the company opened a giant Champagne bottle for the guests-workers !! On the right a last thought to the old Generik&#8217;s head quarters in the ex Abattoirs before taking my car again back home&#8230;all these memories which still float around&#8230;you could find some of them saved by Sara Vidal (aka Andree Vidal : Generik Vapeur president) in her book : &#8220;the ex Abattoirs, an original story&#8221; (Publishing Cris Ecrits).</p>
<p>Meltingpod Connections :<br />
A thought to Pierrot Bidon who founded the circus Bidon and then Archaos in the same spirit than Generik and who passed away last March&#8230;his shows were pure rock and roll !! Watch it !!<br />
