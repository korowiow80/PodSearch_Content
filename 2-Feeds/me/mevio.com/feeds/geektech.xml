			<description><![CDATA[  <p>Hi everyone and welcome to Episode 110 of Geek Tech Live. I am still 
having some issues with the live feed and the Ustream broadcast ended up
 not streaming my audio when i was showing my desktop or pictures. I 
figured out what was wrong but unfortunately that means you are stuck 
with an audio only feed this week. You can if you want start playing the
 Ustream video and start the audio podcast to see if you can sync them 
up but its probably for the better if you just listen in.</p>
 <p>I have tried to fix the video in post by using the audio from the 
podcast overlayed on the video if it all works I will attach the new 
video to this post.</p>
 <p>Without Further AdoÂ  Episode 110 of Geek Tech Live!</p>
 <p>The winner of the Magical Boxee Box is Chris Miller! Congrats Chris! I
 will be emailing you shortly to set up shipping arraignments.</p> ]]></description>

			<title>Geek Tech Live 106 Tron Legacy thoughts and review</title>

			<description><![CDATA[  <p>This is Chris your host and Welcome again to Geek Tech Live âI fight for the Users!â</p>
 <p>In this episode :</p>
<ul><li>Tron : Legacy review and musings</li></ul> <p>Yes I'm old. Old enough to remember when the MCP was just a chess program!... Its time for Geek Tech Live!</p>
 <p><a href="http://www.bscreview.com/wp-content/gallery/olivia-wilde-tron/olivia_wilde_tron_legacy.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto;text-align:center;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://www.bscreview.com/wp-content/gallery/olivia-wilde-tron/olivia_wilde_tron_legacy.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Olivia Wilde â Tron Legacy Banner" alt="" height="243" width="603" /></a> <br /></p>
 <p>Greetings Programs! I had the opportunity to see Tron : Legacy on 
premiere night at 12:01AM. I figured since I am a fan of the original 
Tron I should at least tell you my thoughts on this new addition. I gave
 it a day to think it over and organize my thoughts. I would like to 
point out that I am not a movie critic, I'm not up on the correct 
terminology for reviewing movies but I hope that my thoughts can help 
you decide if its a watch now or rent later for Tron :Legacy. So here 
are some ground rules. I am not going to give away spoilers, talk about 
each scene or go into any great detail that would spoil the overall 
effect of seeing the movie for yourself. So without further ado.... My 
review of Tron Legacy .</p>
 <p><a href="http://www.neublack.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tron-legacy.jpg" style="float:left;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://www.neublack.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tron-legacy.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Tron Legacy | Neu Black" alt="" height="273" width="219" /></a>OK,
 so I will assume that you are probably interested in Tron Legacy 
because you are a fan or recently became a fan of the original Tron. 
That can be a good thing or a bad thing really. I am a big fan of Tron 
as are most Geeks or Nerds of my generation so I went into the movie 
with some preconceived notions. I wanted to find out when this was 
supposed to take place and what the Grid was going to look like since 
technology had made some huge leaps since the original Tron. The 
Trailers and all the Hype at San Diego Comic Con made the anticipation 
even more heightened. The net result? The movie is visually exceptional.
 It looks the way I always imagined the original Tron to look in my 
mind. Everything was just so fantastic to look at I did spend the whole 
movie taking in every little piece of architecture and design. This is a
 good thing since Battlestar Galactica got the technology refresh 
treatment and it really worked for them. Other Reboots did not fare as 
well but overall it definitely ends up being positive. I would love to 
see what Babylon 5 would look like now with an fresh injection of CGI 
work. but I digress.... back to what you came here for. more Tron Legacy
 review thoughts from yours truly.</p>
 <p>A movie though cant live on just gorgeous graphics. I unfortunately 
was not that amazed by the storyline. If this was billed as what I call a
 "catch up" movie, where the story is meant to bring you up to date with
 things that happened and then set the stage for a sequel then it 
satisfied that goal. As a stand alone sequel it falls a bit short in 
some regards to me. In some ways there was that feeling of a rinse and 
repeat with the original Tron MCP being replaced by another antagonist 
and the same basic premise being laid out. I felt like there were too 
many sub plots for one movie to hold on to and do any justice to it. 
There was a feeling of a lack of depth from the story, almost like it 
was rushed or not developed fully. Both thoughts which are probably not 
correct as I don't think it was rushed or that there were any massive 
plot changes made during filming. Alas that last thought is just 
conjecture as I don't live in Hollywood or work in the film industry. 
Either way the story was just not that engaging to me. It became more of
 a passing of the torch movie similar to the Kirk Picard hand off of 
Star Trek Generations or the Indiana Jones hand off to the younger 
Indiana characters. That should not be too much of a surprise as the 
Movie was named "legacy" after all<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/44413022@N02/4216282304/" style="float:right;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/4052/4216282304_74d570663b.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Jeff Bridges revient dans Tron Legacy" alt="" height="276" width="187" /></a>.</p>
 <p>Olivia Wilde's character Quorra or as I kept thinking during the 
movie 'number 13 with lights' was jaw dropping gorgeous. Not only was 
she nice to look at she was also kick ass fighter and had some very 
awesome fight sequences. Jeff Bridges character took a while to warm 
back up to and the stuff set in the 80's used heavy amounts of CG to 
make Mr Bridges look like the younger Flynn we all knew and loved. As 
far as the technology has come the CG work for Making the younger Flynn 
still looked fake to me. I think that was the beginning of where I 
started to become disconnected to the story. The CG work in some regards
 was fantastic and in others I could tell it wasn't real and I could not
 suspend my disbelief. I was happy to see Daft Punk's cameo in one scene
 of the movie.</p>
 <p>All in all I think the movie itself was a long time coming. I think 
the anticipation of a Tron Sequel raised the bar almost too high for any
 reasonable movie to attain. I don't think any Tron sequel was going to 
live up to my own level of anticipation. In the end, if you were hoping 
for a continuation of the original storyline you definitelyÂ  got that 
and lot more. The main story though lacks the depth you may have hoped 
for and the additional subplots seem to try to converge back but don't 
always make the journey back to the main story in one piece. I am still 
very glad I went to see it and I will probably see it once more once it 
is released on Blu-Ray .</p>

			<description><![CDATA[  <p>This is Chris your host and Welcome again to Geek Tech Live âDo Not back up, Major tire Damageâ</p>

 <p>In this episode :</p>

<ul><li>Avenger Controller for your Xbox.</li><li>Sonic Screwdriver Pen</li><li>The Playboy Archives</li></ul> <p>Hey Ma! I'm on TV... Its time for Geek Tech Live!</p>

 <p>We are going to try something a bit different this time. Hold on to 
your hats! we are Simulcasting this episode as video! In theory at 
least. ;) lets see how we do shall we?</p>

<h2>Avenger Controller for your Xbox.</h2>

<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://www.avengercontroller.com/store/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/a/v/avenger-product-shot.jpg" style="float:left;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://www.avengercontroller.com/store/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/a/v/avenger-product-shot.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="371" width="384" /></a>Alright,
 I am sure you have seen controller mods on the internet before. I have 
even seen some for sale that look like they might work but usually they 
are a bit clumsy looking or need some extra fingers to really make work.
 introducing The Avenger Controller. Inventions should be solutions for 
common issues. Some are better than others and some look fantastic but 
don't really solve anything. I thought thie Avenger Controller was one 
of those. Over engineered and not applicable. I think I am wrong.Â  This 
"shell" that encases your Xbox 360 controller basically reroutes the 
buttons to be within millimeters of your touch. It also pre loads the 
buttons right to to actuation point. Think of it like giving your 
controller an espresso. It makes you that much faster on the trigger. 
With Christmas around the corner and the price set at only $60 bucks you
 really cant pass this one up. all the Major publications have given it 
rave reviews. Head on over toÂ <a href="http://www.avengercontroller.com/index.php">http://www.avengercontroller.com</a> and pick one up. your Gamertag will thank you.</p>

<h2>Sonic Screwdriver Pen</h2>

<p style="padding-left:60px;">You all have seen the Doctor Who Sonic Screw Drivers you can buy that light up. You can even buy Sonic Screw<a href="http://static.neatoshop.com/images/product/56/1756/Sonic-Screwdriver-Pen_6849-l.jpg" style="float:right;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://static.neatoshop.com/images/product/56/1756/Sonic-Screwdriver-Pen_6849-l.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="180" width="271" /></a>
 Drivers that actually drives screws. But did you know you can also use a
 Sonic Screw Driver as a Pen? Well,Â  you can now thanks to the aptly 
named <a href="http://www.neatoshop.com/product/Sonic-Screwdriver-Pen">Sonic Screw Driver Pen from Neatoshop.com</a>.
 This replica of the 11th Doctors Screw driver will not open any locked 
doors but it will help you write that note to Mom, grocery lists and 
anything else that you can think to write down on paper. Its a metal 
bodied pen that has green and blue ink cartridges and only fetches a $25
 dollar price tag. Not really that bad if you think of it. Pick 
yourselves up one of them now before they are all gone. I bet you know 
of at least a few Geeks on your Christmas list that would love to unwrap
 one of these this year.</p>

<h2>The Playboy Archives</h2>

 the E-book craze in full bloom I can now quote Egon and Say "Print is 
dead". The Ipad and nook and kindle can distribute any magazine in a 
much easier to read format. now, instead of following Egon's hobbies 
andÂ  collecting spores molds and fungus you can collect all 56 years of 
Playboy ahem.. articles on a 250GB hard drive in a collectible case. For
 you numbers geeks out there that is according to Playboy.com 650+ 
issues and over 100,000 pages all right in one place and digitally 
preserved in a typical Playboy styled case with the trademark Rabbit 
emblazoned everywhere. That's every issue from 1953 through 2010 by the 
way.</p>

<p style="padding-left:60px;">The 250GB
 hard drive comes pre-loaded with searching software so you can find 
what you are looking for faster and easier as well. All 56 years of 
articles, interviews and airbrushing is only $299.00 . If you know 
someone who likes to read Playboy then this is the gift for them.Â  Pick 
it up right off Playboy.com at <a href="http://www.playboyarchive.com/shop/HardDrive.htm">http://www.playboyarchive.com/shop/HardDrive.htm</a> .</p>

			<description><![CDATA[  <p>This is Chris your host and Welcome again to Geek Tech Live its the âBlack Friday Prep Episode!â</p>
 <p>In this episode :</p>
<ul><li>GottaDeal.com Leaks Every Major Black Friday Sale.</li><li>TJMaxx Undersells the Ipad.</li><li>F.lux saves your eyes while on your computer.</li></ul> <p>I'm in your wallets saving you Monies... Its time for Geek Tech Live!</p>
<h2>GottaDeal.com Leaks Every Major Black Friday Sale.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://cdn.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/blackfriday_gottadeal_com.png" style="float:left;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://cdn.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/blackfriday_gottadeal_com.png" style="border:0px none;" title="10 Online Resources for Black Friday Ads" alt="" height="197" width="265" /></a>Yeah
 you heard me say Every Major Sale. Its all encompassing phrases like 
that that make me very suspect. I was very surprised that <a href="http://gottadeal.com/">GottaDeal.com</a>
 is based out of Milwaukee , my home town but I never heard of them 
until now.Â  Needless to say they do have a pretty good coverage of the 
Black Friday deals whether they are leaked by a real leak or "leaked" to
 drum up interest by the manufacturers is up to you. Either way you can 
expect to find some great deals at GottaDeal.com.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">To quote the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">This year
 the site has posted advance looks at the Black Friday ads from 
retailers such as Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Toys R Us, Sears, Kmart, 
Kohl's and well over 40 other national and regional retailers and online
 commerce sites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The Site 
is not just focused on the deals but also incorporates a forum where you
 can interact with other shoppers to find and confirm the deals being 
found.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">again quoting the Press Release from GottaDeals Black Friday posting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The site 
offers consumer-oriented tools including an e-mail alert system, where 
visitors can be notified every time a new Black Friday sale ad is 
posted. The site also features a complete history of Black Friday, a set
 of frequently asked questions, as well as a popular shopping list 
feature which allows visitors to create and save a list of items from 
all the various Black Friday ads. They can add or remove items as new 
ads are posted, add personal notes such as if the item is a gift, and 
print or send their list to family &amp; friends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">So run don't walk and check them out. you might save a buck or two in this race for savings we do every year.</p>
<h2>TJMaxx Undersells the Ipad.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">So I am 
sure you all heard of this bit of info that was shared by Twitter. It 
seems like TJMaxx has decided to sell iPads and to sell them for less 
than the normal price fixed regular Apple prices. I had thought there 
was some sort of mandated pricing structure forced on to any Apple 
retailer. Apple's pricing mandates remind me of Saturn Car dealers with 
the No haggle guarantee. It doesn't matter where you go you will always 
pay X for an apple product. That was true until now when TJMaxx just 
decided to price at what they thought was a fair price. That price was 
actually $100 bucks under the regular price.</p>
<h2>F.lux saves your eyes on your computer.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://s3.herf.org/flux-shot.png" style="float:left;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://s3.herf.org/flux-shot.png" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="169" width="334" /></a>Ever
 get up early or work late and think to yourself that your screen 
brightness seemed a bit harsh? Ever had issues sleeping after working or
 gaming on your computer? Science knows that our brains use the mental 
cues of light and dark to get us ready for sleep and that's where F.lux 
comes in. F.lux get installed and finds your Lat and Lon. to get the 
sunrise and sunset for your area. then it asks you what type of lighting
 you use at night. from Tungsten to fluorescent lighting for choices and
 a few others. Once you set those two options your last decision is if 
you want the transition from day to night to be over 20 seconds or an 
hour. That's it. After that F.lux sits and waits for sunset and then 
will gradually change the color temp of the screen to match your 
lighting. The sad thing is, It actually works. I have tried it now for a
 few days and I have to say that eye strain feels less at night and I 
really don't notice that its even sitting in my task bar waiting for me.
 The best thing about F.lux? its free and available for Windows, Mac and
 Linux. Head over toÂ  <a href="http://www.stereopsis.com/flux/">http://www.stereopsis.com/flux/ </a>and grab a copy for yourself.Â  I think you will definitely find it one of those hidden gems of free apps you cant live without.</p>

 <p>In this episode :</p>
<ul><li>Call of Duty : Black Ops review.</li><li>Clean your Nerd with Luxury Lane Soap</li></ul> <p>Roger that! I'm on your six! Its time for Geek Tech Live!</p>
<h2>Call of Duty Black Ops review.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/30/1439491-cod_black_ops_pc_fob_large.jpg" style="float:left;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/30/1439491-cod_black_ops_pc_fob_large.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Call of Duty: Black Ops (video game)" alt="" height="371" width="261" /></a>Ok,
 I... like the rest of you guys bought COD Black Ops the day it came 
out. I have all the previous COD's and I have been seeing the Trailers 
and was hoping that the game would live up to the hype. the typical Game
 Day issues were there but in much smaller numbers. I had some issues 
getting into games or getting kicked out of games with friends. I 
decided to chalk it up to release day bugs. Well, now that it has been a
 few days i can confirm. The release day bugs that were plaguing me are 
gone. I have still have some game starting issues where I get kicked out
 of a multiplayer session but they are becoming very infrequent.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">As far as
 the In game mechanics go, I love the fact you need to buy the equipment
 as you go. even down to the perks and attachments to the weapons. I 
think this alone will slow the rise thru the ranks of the people who did
 Prestige 3 times and then got bored with the game. As of 3 days ago to 
this recording, there were under 60,000 out of millions who made 
prestige mode. It even costs you there as Prestige Mode will require COD
 dollars to unlock the fact you start all over again.Â  Shooting and 
responsiveness is great, just watch out for the dork with the 56k Modem 
who is the game host as they will eventually make you wait and watch the
 lag climb. It only happened to me 3 times so far but it was very 
annoying.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Seeing as
 I work in I.T. by day I must say the amount of data being captured 
during game play is huge. You can view your player card from the main 
screen in multiplayer and page thru everything from the last 5 games 
Kill / Death Ratio's to a heat map of where you are focusing your shots.
 My aim tends to be er um... in the groinal region so er uh,<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36483980@N03/5097465837/" style="float:right;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/4086/5097465837_c72e57d750.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="COD:Black ops Wallpaper 7" alt="" height="168" width="300" /></a> sorry ahead of time for that shot dude.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The 
customization options that are available to you flat out eclipse the 
previous games. Everything seems to be able to be manipulated and all 
for a price.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The maps 
are a joy to play, there is even one with a fully functional rocket 
actually lifts off in game. (I got killed at least 10 times watching 
that cinematic wonder) .Â  All the Maps though, have some element of 
surprise or special feature. I did get the feeling the maps are larger 
and they feel more thought out and well designed.Â  There are some nice 
hiding spots but they are put in places where you would expect then to 
be and that make anti-campers happy ducks.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">One last 
thing, you get 6 slots to save and replay and also share clips from the 
games you played recently as well as just replay games to see where you 
went wrong. Normally, I find these areas of games to be clunky and 
really have very little to offer. I was very impressed with the ease of 
use in COD : Black Ops. I created a clip of me and a buddy and combined 
them into a cool little movie that I then shared. It was awesome.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Geek Tech Live gives Call of Duty : Black Ops a 4.5 out of 5.</p>
<h2>Clean your Nerd with Luxury Lane Soap</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">And now 
on to something completely different but just as cool. To be fair I will
 be reviewing a few different lines of geek soap and the first one is <a href="http://www.luxurylanesoap.com/">LuxuryLaneSoap.com</a> owned and operated by Kylee Lane or <a href="http://twitter.com/kyleelane">@kyleelane on the Twitter.</a>
 So, You may ask, how does someone as rough and tumble as me end up 
talking about Soap? Other than the fact I am definitely not rough nor 
tumble? I think most people want to smell good or at least want to think
 they do. If you take that basic feeling and stir in some nerdy-geekness
 (patent pending) you geek a whole lot of Geek soap. So after I found 
Kylee online and chatted with her on the Twitter I decided to try this 
stuff out.Â  I bought the following soaps from Luxurylane.com (all names 
of soaps are from LuxuryLane.com and are owned by the awesome Kylee, i 
for one am not as talented a wordsmith as she is):</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://cache1.bigcartel.com/product_images/24999172/Solo1.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto;text-align:center;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://cache1.bigcartel.com/product_images/24999172/Solo1.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Soap in Carbonite" alt="" height="195" width="312" /></a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://cache1.bigcartel.com/product_images/26175315/Mega4.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto;text-align:center;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://cache1.bigcartel.com/product_images/26175315/Mega4.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Deceptively Soap" alt="" height="299" width="300" /></a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Also got 
the Sugarcane and hemp scented organic soap which i could not find on 
the site anymore. I got the organic soap since i had a feeling I was not
 going to want to use the carbonite soap and possibly the deceptively 
soap either. I should have bought two of them since both the soap in 
carbonite and deceptively soap are frankly amazing. They look more like 
works of art than soap so for me its harder to justify actually using 
the ones I bought. That brings me to the Sugar Cane and Hemp soap. That 
one I have been using for a while now. I am a knowledge worker by Day 
(read Nerdy/Geeky I.T. Guy) so I am very aware of my hands and keeping 
them soft. The organic soap is so wonderful the scent of it while 
washing my hands keeps me coming back again and again. It lasts for a 
long time even with me washing my hands just to get a whiff of the 
scent. And yes I am a guy and yes this is sorta girly talk but still, 
between the scents that are available and the range of Geeky and Nerdy 
designs (<a href="http://www.luxurylanesoap.com/product/nes-controller">Check out the NES controller soap! its crazy epic!</a>)
 outside of the normal Organic Soaps I am very impressed. Kylee, you 
made me a repeat customer, now the rest of you, go become repeat 
customers of Luxurylanesoap.com .</p>

 <p>In this episode :</p>
<ul><li>Capture a Ghost on your Iphone.</li><li>The creeper Wall Sculpture</li><li>Zombie crossing sign</li><li>Harcos Labs Horror Party Pack</li></ul> <p>Lets Fight the Zombie Horde the only way I know how! Its time for Geek Tech Live!</p>
<h2>Capture a Ghost on your Iphone.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:90px;"><a href="http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/039/Purple/63/a1/2e/mzl.ozqkhqrx.320x480-75.jpg" style="float:left;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/039/Purple/63/a1/2e/mzl.ozqkhqrx.320x480-75.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="128" width="85" /></a>So, need to scare your friends but dont know any Ghosts willing to pose for you? Well, look no further than <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ghost-capture/id349479650">Ghost capture for the Iphone and Ipod Touch</a>.Â 
 Just take a picture as normal and then use this app to superimpose a 
whole host of spooky creepy and hauntingly scary pictures on top of your
 photo.Â  You can set the location and scale of the goblin, gremlin or 
ghost as well as making them wispy motes of dust or definiteÂ  
ectoplasmic issues. Once you are done you can email the picture and set 
the hairs on the back of their neck standing up. There is a free version
 as well as a paid version for .99 cents.Â  Don't wait.Â  grab this and 
start creeping out your friends now.</p><p style="padding-left:90px;">Â </p>
<h2>The creeper Wall Sculpture</h2>
<p style="padding-left:90px;">If you really want to freak out your house guests then this is the thing to get. The Creeper wall statue by Liam<a href="http://ii-prod-rw.marketlive.com/DesignToscano/images/products/en_us/detail/DB383009.jpg" style="float:right;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://ii-prod-rw.marketlive.com/DesignToscano/images/products/en_us/detail/DB383009.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="118" width="104" /></a>
 Manchester will definitely make a statement in any house. If you ask me
 and well you are. It kinda reminds me of the Harry PotterÂ  Azkaban 
Dementors.Â  You don't have to live on 1313 Mockingbird lane or have the 
last name of Munster to appreciate the creepiness of this statue whether
 you are a Halloween buff or a Harry Potter fan or maybe even both, this
 is a great addition to any spooky house in any neighborhood. <a href="http://www.designtoscano.com/product/medieval+and+gothic/gothic+wall+decor/the+creeper+wall+sculpture+-+db383009.do?refType=1">You can pick one up at designtoscano.com for the low price of $79.95</a> .

			<description><![CDATA[  <p>This is Chris your host and Welcome again to Geek Tech Live âI'm back baby!â</p>
 <p>In this episode :</p>
<ul><li>HAST a la Video from Japan!</li><li>Wi-fi Direct and the unified theory of connectivity.</li><li>Chilean Miners watched movies on Samsung Galaxy Beam Phone.</li></ul> <p>Calm down... Calm down! Its time for Geek Tech Live!</p>
<h2>HAST a la Video from Japan!</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://www.ortustech.co.jp/english/technology/index.html#hast">OrtusTech has unveiled a new display</a> that blows away the retinia display specs <a href="http://www.ortustech.co.jp/english/technology/images/hast_il03.jpg" style="float:right;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://www.ortustech.co.jp/english/technology/images/hast_il03.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="135" width="200" /></a>on
 the Iphone 4. Its called HAST (Hyper Amorphous Silicon TFT) and was 
realized through the application of various original ORTUS TECHNOLOGY 
technologies: This display isn't attached to a phone but can be applied 
to any devices or applications where you want to see things that are so 
sharp and clear it might cut your eyeballs.Â  The Specs of the display 
are crazy! at 4.8 inches wide it packs a 1,920Ã1,080 resolution and a 
pixel density of 458ppi. Its ultra high performance and is 100+ ppi 
denser than the Iphone REtina display.Â  So I have a question though. It 
was said by Apple that the Retina display has so many pixels that any 
more could not be percieved by the average human eye. so, will the HAST 
display even look any better or are we just going to have to believe 
that it is better? We will just have to wait and see.</p>
<h2>Wi-fi Direct and the unified theory of connectivity.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Wi-fi.org
 is going to set the world ablaze.Well, OK maybe not ablaze but they are
 going to connect every wi-fi device to every other Wi-fi device using <a href="http://www.wi-fi.org/Wi-Fi_Direct.php">Wi-fi direct</a>.Â  Here is a Vimeo Video that explains how this will all work.</p>
<div style="margin:0pt auto;text-align:center;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/media/img/trans.gif" title="&quot;id&quot;:&quot;apture_embedPlayer1&quot;,&quot;bgcolor&quot;:&quot;#ffffff&quot;,&quot;quality&quot;:&quot;high&quot;,&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot;:&quot;never&quot;,&quot;allowFullScreen&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;flashvars&quot;:&quot;domId=apture_embedPlayer1&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=16158397&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=1&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;autoplay=0&amp;loop=0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;apture_embedPlayer1&quot;,&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;:&quot;false&quot;" class="mceItemFlash" height="225" width="400" alt="trans.gif" /></div>

<div style="margin:0pt auto;text-align:left;padding:0px 6px 0px 66px;">This
 technology will basically let anything that has a Wi-fi connection to 
be able to communicate. So you can send Images to your Ipad from a Wi-fi
 enabled camera, or long range personal gaming. Lots of possibilities 
exist and all of them could be the end of blue tooth as the connectivity
 of choice.</div>
<h2>Chilean Miners watched movies on Samsung Galaxy Beam Phone.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">To Quote Samsung <a href="http://www.samsunghub.com/2010/10/22/galaxy-beam-were-sent-to-trapped-chilean-miners/">from the Samsunghub.com:</a> <br /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://www.samsunghub.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/beam-singapore.jpg" style="float:left;padding:0px 6px;"><img src="http://www.samsunghub.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/beam-singapore.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="206" width="234" /></a>While
 Chilean Mine workers were trapped in a copper-gold mine, they were sent
 Samsungâs Galaxy Beam phones for entertainment purposes. Different 
items were sent through a hole, which also included the projector phone.</p>
 <p>The Galaxy Beam was loaded with a âmessage of encouragementâ from 
Chileâs mining minister as well as movies and recording of a friendly 
football match between Chile and Ukraine.</p>
 <p>Weâre proud that our technology could play a part in this mining miracle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">So, not 
only were the miners on an exercise regimen they also got at least a 
small comfort of visual entertainment while they were waiting to be 
saved. Good on you Samsung for what you did. That was awesome.</p>

			<title>Geek Tech Live 100 Aperture watch, Xbox Live on Windows 7 phones and One Hub to rule them all</title>

			<description><![CDATA[  <p>This is Chris your host and Welcome again to Geek Tech Live âI'm 100 today!â</p>
 <p>In this episode :</p>
<ul><li>Welcome to the 100th Episode</li><li>It's almost F11 do you know where your children are?</li><li>Xbox Live for Windows 7 Phones. Pew... Pew... Jump on mobile soon.</li><li>One hub To Rule them All! 24 Ports that is!</li></ul> <p>Don't Get your Geek Soap all in a lather! Its time for Geek Tech Live!</p>
<h2>Welcome to the 100th Episode</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Well,
its been a long a circuitous route to get me here to my 100th episode.
I would like to thank a few people that have really helped me to refine
my show up to now such as Drew Bergmark, Steven Molen and Jeff McCord.
Also, In the past few Episodes I have branched out and done some
awesome interviews! I would again like to thank Beau Ryan, Leo Camacho,
Natali of UberdorkCafe Fame and Raychul Moore for spending time with me
to talk about the things they like and chat about geeky subjects and
great ideas.</p>
<h2>It's almost F11 do you know where your children are?</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://static.neatoshop.com/images/product/26/1426/F-Stop-Watch_5637-l.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://static.neatoshop.com/images/product/26/1426/F-Stop-Watch_5637-l.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="165" width="248" /></a>The
only way this watch could be more cool is if it WAS made by Aperture
Labs. I found this on http://www.philosophersguild.com and had to
share. I love Photography and this watch is for anyone that is a
photography buff. the Watch shows time but in F Stops and the dial is
made out to look like the aperture on a lens of a camera. Its not a
Rolex but it still will look top notch on your wrist and its a lot
cheaper than a Rolex too! At $35.95 its a steal! Some info from the
page on http://www.philosophersguild.com:</p>
<p style="padding-left:90px;"><i>Remember
F-stops? Real apertures? A great photography-inspired watch. Measure
time by aperture. It's almost F11 do you know where your children are?
It'll warp your mind! </i></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Order it now at <a href="http://www.philosophersguild.com/index.lasso?page_mode=Product_Detail&amp;cat=watch&amp;skip=5&amp;item=1836&amp;sortby=rank%20DESC">The Philosophersguild.com</a> today!</p>
<h2>Xbox Live for Windows 7 Phones. Pew... Pew... Jump on mobile soon?</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/global/windowsphone/en-us/PublishingImages/sitepages/wp7/xbox-site-article-image-xbox-live-logo.png" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://www.microsoft.com/global/windowsphone/en-us/PublishingImages/sitepages/wp7/xbox-site-article-image-xbox-live-logo.png" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="95" width="95" /></a>The
Release of the New Windows 7 Phone brings a lot of new features. One
Feature that raises the bar is the Xbox live support baked right in to
the new Windows 7 phone OS Games Hub. Right now, the games hub is
definitely way cooler than Apples Game Center if you ask me and I like
my Iphone. Being able to jump on Xbox Live and Check your Gamertag info
or play need for speed or the Sims 3 all while unlocking achievements
and taunting your XBL friends is the Awesome sauce that puts the
Windows 7 Phone ahead of the Iphone for integration of Gaming
peripherals. for more information check out the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/apps/default.aspx">Windows 7 Phone launch page on Microsoft.com here</a>.</p>
<h2>One hub To Rule them All! 24 Ports that is!</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">I was cruising the Internet and happened across Thinkgeek.com and the new "One Ring" of USB Hubs.Â  I'm not<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/zoom/e5be_24_port_usb_monster_hub.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:right;"><img src="http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/zoom/e5be_24_port_usb_monster_hub.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="179" width="237" /></a>
kidding either its basically shaped like a hockey puck with two USB
ports all around the outside and a few in the middle as well. The only
way you can add more ports is to make the USB Hub out of USB ports.
ThinkGeek.com sells a 16 Port powered hub that I thought was cool and a
bit more than I needed. Now they upped the ante with a whopping 24 port
hub. You can now daisy chain up to ... get this... 127 USB devices. it
can be powered via your computer or an external power supply. What
would one pay for so many USB ports? $49.99 thats all. Head on over to
Thinkgeek.com to read more and <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/usb-gadgets/e5be/?i=front">grab one for yourself</a>! Your PC will thank you.</p>

<h2>Halo : Reach My editorial review thus far<img src="http://counters.gigya.com/wildfire/IMP/CXNID=2000002.0NXC/bT*xJmx*PTEyODQ5NDA4MTU3MTImcHQ9MTI4NDk*MDk1NTcwOSZwPTQ*MTQ*MiZkPSZnPTImbz1hNDQzMGQzZjJjYTk*YmZiOGRj/MDEzY2Y1ZTYyNDNlYyZvZj*w.gif" alt="" border="0" height="0" width="0" /></h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://revolver360.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/halo-reach.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://revolver360.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/halo-reach.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="halo reach jpg" alt="" height="215" width="327" /></a>In
episode 98 I gave you a sort of pre pre view of my thoughts on Halo
Reach initially. Well, I have been playing multiplayer and the campaign
for a few weeks so far and I have to say it brings the fun in waves of
frustration that makes you keep playing and playing and playing. I can
now say, if you liked any of the Halo Games so far you are going to
like this game.Â  Visually the game is gorgeous, the cut scenes the game
itself everything so far. Gameplay can take some getting used to. I
still cannot for the life of me pilot any flying craft. steering the
warthogs for me are also a bit of a task. For whatever reason, the
commands I tell the flying craft especially I cant get my mind to
figure out spatially.Â  I'm an inverted control stick person when it
comes to flying any kind of air craft. If i pull back on the stick i
want to go up push forward and I go down. Well,Â  the dual stick look to
fly and second stick yoke just keeps throwing me. Overall the Game is a
great keeper with a lot of replay if you ask me.Â  I will go to CoD
Black ops eventually but Halo Reach will continue to allow me to burn
countless hours of my time when I am not putting together Podcasts for
you.</p>
<h2><a href="http://twitter.com/uberdorkcafe">@UberDorkCafe</a> needs your love. Buy cookies and support <a href="http://twitter.com/uberdorkgirlie">@UberdorkGirlie</a> <br /></h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">This
world is made up of lots of people ... lots of different people and
that is cool. Some people are entertainers, some people create great
works of art, some create Podcasts and Others... the truly awesome
Others can think of things noone else has and then act on them.
UberDorkGirlie a.k.a Natali is one of those others. She came up with
the idea for a cafe. Not just any cafe, an uber Cafe. Ok, an Uber Dork
cafe.Â  You can help her raise the rest of the cash she needs to get
this idea into the stratosphere of awesomeness. This Geektacular cafe
will be a haven for all Geeks, Dorks, dweebs, Nerds and anyone else who
loves general geekery. Uberdorkcafe will give back to the community in
many different ways as well. From featuring local artists to
scholarships for needy children Uberdorkcafe has the makings of a great
idea. Great Ideas though need help to nurture and get the word out.
That is where we come in. Natali is selling <a href="http://www.rockthelan.com/content/official-uberdork-cafe-t-shirt-now-sale">UberDorkCafe Shirts atÂ  RocktheLan.com</a> . Buy one, Buy Ten!<a href="http://www.rockthelan.com/sites/rockthelan.com/files/UberDorkCafe_BrandedT-Shirt_0.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:right;"><img src="http://www.rockthelan.com/sites/rockthelan.com/files/UberDorkCafe_BrandedT-Shirt_0.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="209" width="275" /></a>
each shirt goes a long way to help Natali get the Cafe off the ground
as well as let everyone know you support the cause.Â  So, you may ask,
why am I pimping this idea so much? First off I think its a great idea
I mean c'mon UberDorkCafe its just a great name and a great concept.
Second, the first location is going to be in my backyard in Milwaukee
so I got that going for me. Third, after talking to Natali in Geek Tech
Live 89Â  <a href="http://geektechlive.com/2010/08/geek-tech-live-uberdorkcafe-explodes-into-existence/">which you can listen to here</a>
I just was inspired to tell the world about UberDorkCafe by her
tenacity and good heartedness. Everyone, Lets not forget that we as
geeks,nerds,dorks and whatnot need to stand behind this great idea! go
to <a href="http://www.uberdorkcafe.com/index.html">uberdorkcafe.com</a>
and buy cookies or find out how to donate to get Uberdorkcafe on its
way to becoming bigger than Starbucks but with more UberDorkyness</p>

<h2>Comic-Con To Stay In San Diego!</h2><p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://www.comic-con.org/common/assets/sidebarad_cci.gif" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://www.comic-con.org/common/assets/sidebarad_cci.gif" title="" style="border:0px none;" height="143" width="111" alt="sidebarad_cci.gif" /></a>I will admit it I was worried. It could have happened. Comic Con 2011 could have been the last Con in San Diego
but as you all may have heard at least a zillon times now,Â  It's not
going anywhere. Shout as loud as you can Five More Years! Five More
Years! There is a bunch of postings out there on the net about it. My
favorite is a <a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/sep/30/comic-con-staying-san-diego/">signonsandiego.com</a> article mostly since its more of a look from the city itself.Â  The Google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=comic+con+staying+in+&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a#hl=en&amp;expIds=17259,22713,23756,24692,24878,24879,25260,25907,26661,26710,26714,26781,26890,26992&amp;sugexp=ldymls&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=comic+con+staying+in+san+diego&amp;cp=21&amp;pf=p&amp;sclient=psy&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=23D&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;source=hp&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=comic+con+staying+in+&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=84f34ab5383c7ee9">"comic con staying in Sandiego"</a>
turns up a huge amount of results. I am really glad it is staying. The
alternatives were going to be Las Vegas, LA, or I even heard Anaheim. I
think San Diego is the best spot for it and I hope it renews the
contract again in 5 years with San Diego. If it takes a petition then I
think we are all able to pitch in. But at least we can all have fun
experiencing Comic Con in San Diego for Five More Years! I am going
next year. Are you? <br /></p>

<ul><li>Halo : Reach is candy for my eyeballs.</li><li>don't forget about Uberdorkcafe.com</li><li>Facebook is making a cell phone.</li><li>Apple takes a chill pill, allows C64 emulator</li></ul> <p>Put those 2d20 down and turn up the volume! Its time for Geek Tech Live!</p>
<h2>Halo : Reach is candy for my eyeballs.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">I'm not
the biggest fan of what I and a few others will call the Pew... Pew...
Jump game franchise. I freely admit that. Granted I am much more a
Crackdown or Call of Duty fan but I cant help but really love the
newest edition to the Halo world.Â  I have only played a few parts of
the campaign with friends. The MultiplayerÂ  aspect is actually pretty
tight too. There are the glitches that I have seen like AI just being a
dumbass and not following or getting caught on the wrong side of doors
or not getting into the vehicles. And my biggest gripe is the
matchmaking. It seems to only work a few times in a row and then you
end up having to leave and rejoin to search for more players or sit in
limbo for quite some time.Â  Are you playing Halo : Reach? whats your
gamertag? Mine is Xanaduguy . <a href="http://raptr.com/geektechlive">I am also on Raptr.com</a> under the Guise of Geektechlive . Send me a friend request and lets get to shooting!</p>
<h2><a href="http://twitter.com/uberdorkcafe">@UberDorkCafe</a> needs your love. Buy cookies and support <a href="http://twitter.com/uberdorkgirlie">@UberdorkGirlie</a> <br /></h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Everyone, Lets not forget that we as geeks,nerds,dorks and whatnot need to stand behind this great idea! go to <a href="http://www.uberdorkcafe.com/index.html">uberdorkcafe.com</a>
and buy cookies or find out how to donate to get Uberdorkcafe on its
way to becoming bigger than Starbucks but with more UberDorkyness</p>
<h2>Facebook is making a cell phone.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/19/facebook-is-secretly-building-a-phone/">A Techcrunch article</a> by way of <a href="http://techme.me/A4V2">techmeme</a> stated that <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>,
just like Google didÂ  is fixing to release a Mobile phone. It seems two
of its brain trust, Joe Hewitt and Matthew Papakipos are working on
this project but in a more black ops sort of fashion. Other than this
rumor that has leaked out albeit onÂ  "accident" there is not much to
say. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/19/facebook-is-secretly-building-a-phone/">Tech crunch goes into a dissertation of who Mr. Hewet and Mr. Papakipos are</a>
and were and what they worked on. I would say that they are more than
qualified to do the job. One thing I can say for certain is that if
Facebook does release a cell phone, Farmville is gonna run smooth as
silk on it.</p>
<h2>Apple takes a chill pill, allows C64 emulator.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/009/Purple/a3/c2/22/mzl.dtccpgjr.320x480-75.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/009/Purple/a3/c2/22/mzl.dtccpgjr.320x480-75.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="280" width="186" /></a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Apple
recently stated it was relaxing its app store rules. I took this with a
grain of salt as Apple's version of relaxation is usually the
equivalent of how Mr Woolsey on Stargate Atlantis stated hie relaxed.
In one scene in Season 5 Mr Woolsey after being named head of the
Atlantis Expedition states he will change into something a bit more
comfy and try to relax in his room. Later on you see him "relaxing" in
a full suit and tie. Much of how Apple does business can fall into this
category.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">A few
days later after this "relaxation" announcement I noticed that there
was suddenly a Google Voice app in the app store. Now, I think we are
moving in a different direction. a kinder maybe gentler direction for
Apple. The C64 Emulator is finally back! A quick Google of the terms
C64 emulator and IPhone turned up a few articles to confirm I wasn't
seeing things.Â  <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/09/17/c64">Daring Fireball</a>, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/18/as-apple-relaxes-app-store-rules-c64-emulator-for-ios-gets-basi/">Engadget</a>
and yes confirmation by the app store itself shows the C64 emulator and
BASIC programming interface is back! The price is only $4.99 unless you
already bought it before Apple pulled it the first time, if so true
believers... you don't have to pay again.</p>

<h2>How much room is in a TARDIS? about a Terrabyte.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">I found this while surfing though EnGadget. A guy named <a href="http://twitter.com/maxshanly">Max Shanly</a>
Took a Toy Tardis and jammed a 1 TB hard drive into it and then plugged
it into his Mac. now he really does have a Time Machine! His twitter
account looks like he only has 10 followers. I think we can all help
that out a bit?</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://www.slipperybrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/tard.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto;padding:0px 6px;text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.slipperybrick.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/tard.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="1TB hard drive inside a toy ..." alt="" height="252" width="420" /></a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Check out <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/11/1tb-hard-drive-thrown-into-a-toy-tardis-gives-us-a-proper-time/">Engadget for the whole article and all the images. </a> <br /></p>
<h2>The Prius gets louder.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">If you
have ever been near a Prius as its motoring along in a city you
probably did not even know it was there until it was right next to
you.Well, as green as they are, they aren't that safe for not running
into people. So, in Japan right now you can buy a speaker system that
get installed under the front grille and will emit aÂ  'buzz' similar to
a car engine.Â  Im not so sure about you but my car's engine doesnt
"buzz" . Anyway, here is the link and more information.Â  from <a href="http://www.physorg.com/news201853082.html">Physorg.com.</a> and EcoGeek.com</p>
<blockquote style="padding-left:60px;">
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The
12,600 yen ($148) speaker system that goes under the hood of the
third-generation Prius sets off a whirring sound designed to be about
the same noise level as a regular car engine so that it isn't annoying,
Toyota Motor Corp. said</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://www.ecogeek.org/images/stories/prius-speaker.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto;padding:0px 6px;text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.ecogeek.org/images/stories/prius-speaker.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="183" width="468" /></a> <br /></p>
<h2>GoDaddy is up for sale. Everyone pitch in a buck. Lets buy this puppy.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">That's right you heard me Godaddy.com the Monolithic grand daddy of Registrars is up for sale.Â  in a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703597204575484153733196856.html">WSJ article</a> a third party named Qatalyst Partners will shop the company around to some Venture capital firms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Qatalyst
Partners, the boutique firm run by veteran technology banker Frank
Quattrone, has been hired to shop the Go Daddy Group Inc., which runs
the world's largest domain name registrar, these people said.
Private-equity firms are expected to bid for the company, which
currently has more than 43 million domains under management.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Read all the Gory Details atÂ  the WSJ article I linked to above.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">What
does this mean for people who are hosting at Godaddy? Well, things
shouldn't change much. And if things would change, it will take a while
to get a buyer.</p>

<h2>Parrot AR.Drone is for sale! I for one welcome my robot masters.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">I have
been drooling for quite some time over the Parrot AR.Drone and eagerly
anticipating its arrival. I asked for a demo unit but I think they just
assumed I would never give it back ( and they were right) so I still
have not gotten to play with one. but if you were near the following
Brookstone locations on September 3rd you could not only play with one
but buy one as well!</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The 12 stores scheduled to receive the AR.Drone represent multiple Brookstone locations in the following cities: <br />
==&gt; New York Tri State Area (Rockefeller Center / NYC; Short Hills Mall, NJ) <br />
==&gt; Los Angeles (Third Street Promenade; Beverly Center; Glendale Galleria) <br />
==&gt;Â Â Â  Boston Area (Copley; Burlington) <br />
==&gt;Â Â Â  Houston (Houston Galleria) <br />
==&gt;Â Â Â  San Francisco (San Francisco CityCenter; Valley Fair / Santa Clara) <br />
==&gt;Â Â Â  Miami (Bayside; Dadeland Mall)</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The AR.Drone combines the worlds of video gaming and radio-controlled models, enabling consumers to recreate a<a href="http://www.brookstone.com/ar-drone-quadricopter.html" style="padding:0px 6px;float:right;"><img src="http://placeholder.apture.com/ph/400x270_WebClip/" style="border:0px none;" title="AR.Drone by Parrot Now Available at Brookstone!" alt="" height="174" width="258" /></a> large number of single and multi-player video games in the real world. <br />
The AR.Drone-Pilot Academy at www.ardrone.com provides multiple videos
and instructions that prepare aspiring AR.Drone pilots for flight. It
also connects AR.Drone fans from around the world. More information
about the AR.Drone can be found at http://www.parrot.com/facebook or
www.twitter.com/ardrone.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">It looks like not only Brookstone but Amazon is also selling the device for a meager $299 !! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZVSHB0?tag=httpgeektecco-20">Check out the Amazon page here</a> ( yes its an affiliate link for me ).</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">via <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/09/prweb4463784.htm">( PRWeb.com )</a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">
</p><h2>Steampunk Optimus prime from Encline Designs</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">I don't
think you can buy this but I had to share. I came across this by
accident and it is just frankly amazing. It is made by a company ( read
person ) called <a href="http://www.enclinedesigns.com/">Encline Designs</a>.
Encline Designs does do commission work according to their website and
they probably aren't cheap but with this level of detail its probably
worth it if you have the cash to spend. I have been a closet steampunk
fan for a while now and it just continues to grow on you. in this case
you need two ingredients and a special mixmaster take equal parts
Steampunk (the genre) and Optimus Prime (the character), throw them in
a mixmaster and set it on "Awesome" and you get the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://www.walyou.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/optimus1.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto;padding:0px 6px;text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.walyou.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/optimus1.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="371" width="294" /></a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Image courtesy of Encline Designs by way of a <a href="http://www.walyou.com/blog/2010/08/30/steampunk-optimus-prime/">Walyou.com article on Encline Designs.</a> It doesn't get anyÂ  more Epic than this people.</p>
<h2>Google gets ballsy on their main search page.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">if you
are like me you have spent at least 5 minutes on Googles front / main/
search page and made those colored balls whiz and whir around and try
to click on them and try to drag them and then devolve into yelling at
them to giv up their secrets. Ok, maybe that last part is all me but
still google isnt giving out any details except for a cryptic Tweet
stating <b>âBoisterous doodle today. Maybe itâs excited about the week aheadâ¦â </b>.
Umm ok?something is going on with Google and search or a change in how
we can search. I am not sure really but if you have any information
please leave a comment at geektechlive.com and let us all know. Either
Way it will happen this week so I guess we just have a few more days
before the unveiling from Google.</p>

<h2>RFID keys being rolled out at a hotel near you!</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Going to
Vegas soon? Staying at ARIA in the city center? You are going to love
this, Las Vegas is always known to push the limits of excess. Always
going bigger, brighter.. well you know the drill. ThisÂ  time what is
happening in Vegas isn't staying in Vegas.Â  The ARIA resort at City
Center Las Vegas is now using RFID technology to power its room keys.
From the press release:</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">That is
why CityCenter in Las Vegas took action to make ARIA at CityCenter one
of the first Las Vegas resorts to install an RFID guest room locking
system with benefits that go far beyond eliminating keycard complaints.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The new
RFID system at CityCenterâs ARIA Resort &amp; Casino, Vdara Hotel and
Spa and Mandarin Oriental, Las Vegas is part of the most advanced
guestroom technology project in the world. All of the nearly 6,000
guest rooms and suites at CityCenter incorporate hotel door locks using
RFID technology, which enables guests to unlock the door by flashing
their key over a lock reader. Unlike mag-stripe keys, an RFID key
cannot be demagnetized by cell phones or other articles in a guestâs
pocket or purse and there is no need to move the key in and out of a
slot. <br />
When a guest unlocks his or her room at a CityCenter location, the
Saflok RFID system communicates with a wireless network of technologies
within the room. CityCenter collaborated with Control4 Corporation to
develop an unsurpassed level of personalized guest automation. When a
guest first opens their door Saflok sends a message via a Zigbee mesh
wireless network to the Control4 in-room controller, which activates a
âwelcome themeâ if it is the guestâs first time in the room. Lights
come up; curtains automatically part to showcase the spectacular
mountain and city views, and the TV displays controls for guests to
personalize.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Pretty cool stuff! Read <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/KABA/SaflokIlco/prweb4422414.htm">the whole press release from PRWeb.com</a> .</p>
<h2>Batman or Robin High top kicks. Order yours now.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://brassmonki.wazala.com/data/brassmonki/images/products/l_6393batman.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://brassmonki.wazala.com/data/brassmonki/images/products/l_6393batman.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="134" width="200" /></a>I
am sure you have seen some comic book inspired sneakers in the past.
Usually, the really great designs never even make it to the store
shelves. This time its different though. The price isn't for the faint
of heart and probably is only for the most most hardy of Batman fans.
at 500 pounds they don't come cheap for us Yanks either. There are the
retro Batman sneakers and also a retro Robin pair as well.Â  These
wonderously awesome designs are brought to you by <a href="http://brassmonki.com/category/pop-culture/">Brass Monki.</a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">If you are in the buying mood or just have enough room on your credit card you can buy them at <a href="http://brassmonki.wazala.com/">http://brassmonki.wazala.com/ </a> <br /></p>
<h2>Xbox Live Price hike.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">So, I
was thinking of what my Third topic for todays podcast was going to be
and Microsoft wrote it for me. I opened my email and lo and behold I
find that XBL has decided to raise their prices? in this world of
discounts and rebates to keep customers I do find it a bit surprising
that the powers that be at XBL decided to need more of my money.
Granted the 1 year subscription price went up by only ten dollars to
$59.00 but really? I used to use that excuse to say how reasonable the
price for gaming was. Now the price is just o.k.. so what do you think
of this price hike? Read all about it on <a href="http://majornelson.com/archive/2010/08/30/price-change-for-xbox-live-gold-subscription.aspx">MajorNelson.com</a> <br /></p>

<h2>Netflix would rather stream than mail</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Netflix
claims that it only costs them 3 cents for standard movies and 5 cents
for HD content. That is ten times cheaper than mailing the same
physical disks to you via snail mail.Â  I think from what I have read
you are going to see a much more concentrated effort to stream as much
content as Netflix can. I also think edgecaching mega giant Akamai will
be helping to do the heaving lifting for Netflix as we see them start
focusing on Streaming technology and quality of services to their
customers.. like me.</p>

those old worn out games! If you are like me you probably buy some
games that are one trick ponies. I have a good handful of games I
probably will be very unlikely to ever start up again since there are
always new games coming out to keep me busy.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Below is the full press release for this outstanding choice of how to get your game on. thanks Best Buy</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">MINNEAPOLISâ(BUSINESS
WIRE)âGaming enthusiasts nationwide now have more reasons to shop Best
Buy (NYSE:BBY) as their gaming destination. Launching in close to 600
Best Buy stores this week, with additional stores to soon follow, the
new Best Buy Trade-In program offers customers an opportunity to sell
pre-owned video games. To celebrate the new offering, customers who
trade in their games beginning this Sunday, August 29, will receive an
additional $20 Best Buy Gift Card on top of the trade-in value on more
than 100 popular titles.</p>
<blockquote><blockquote> <p>âThe expansion of our trade-in program reaffirms our commitment to
consistently pursue new ways to bring a better gaming experience to
consumersâ <br />
âThe expansion of our trade-in program reaffirms our commitment to
consistently pursue new ways to bring a better gaming experience to
consumers,â said Chris Homeister, senior vice president and general
manager for the home entertainment group at Best Buy. âFall marks the
launch of several highly-anticipated gaming titles and new technology,
and weâre thrilled to provide gamers with innovative ways to connect
with the games they love.â</p> <p>Consumers can now bring their previously played video games into
Best Buy and trade them for an instant Best Buy gift card to use for
purchasing anything in the store, including any game or gaming
accessory. Soon, they will be able to purchase a pre-owned game as well.</p> <p>Those who take advantage of the new Trade-In program in store can
visit the Customer Service desk, or in select locations a dedicated
Trade-In desk within the gaming department, to turn in their games.

that enables customers to get estimates for their games, mail them in
for free and receive a Best Buy gift card 7-14 days later. Trade-In
prices in-store will match the prices shown online.</p> <p>For more information on Trade-In at Best Buy and to locate a store

<h2>Canon Announces the 60D Oooh Shiny!</h2>
<p style="padding-left:120px;"><a href="http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2010/08/25/4430824/gI_0_2_Canon60DDSLR.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2010/08/25/4430824/gI_0_2_Canon60DDSLR.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Most of
you may already know this but I went to art school before I ended up in
Information Technology. I originally majored in Photography and
Industrial Design. That doesnt make me an expert but it does make me a
lover of Photography and the devices that allow me to take photos.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The
device itself cant make you a pro, but they can definitely help get you
part of the ways. I am a firm believer in "the right tool for the right
job" and I will say right now that I do fall in the Canon Camp rather
than Nikon so i do harbor a slight bias to this new EOS 60D from Canon.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">I
currently am the proud owner of a Canon EOS 7D and I love it. Pictures
I took at Comic Con 2010 were all shot with my 7D and developed with
Lightroom 3.Â  This newest addition to the Canon lineup is a great
Prosumer addition.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The new
Canon EOS 60D features an 18-megapixel CMOS sensor that -- thanks in
part to its DIGIC 4 image processor -- can deliver up to 58 large JPEGs
(or 16 RAW files) at burst-rates of up to 5.3 frames-per-second. As for
HD Video, the EOS 60D is equally adept, and can capture 1080p HD video
@ 30f/p/s with sound leveling adjustments, manual focus control,
expanded recording, Movie Crop recording in 640x480, and an external IN
microphone port for plugging in external mics for improved sound
quality.</p>

 <p>Ok so it was more of a Skype chat but we did talk about Games she is
playing now, Games she is looking forward to, her take on Crackdown 2 ,
her love affair with Star Wars as well as Comic Con 2010 cosplay and
more fun! Raychul is just a wonderful person to talk to and a force to
be reckoned with in the Gaming world.Â  It was an absolute joy to talk
to her and I feel very special to have had the honor of her time to
chat about all things Geektastic!</p>

 <p>In this episode :</p>
<ul><li>Playboy on Ipad minus the nudity</li><li>Put some fire on your dinner table</li><li>Excalibur Online Starts Worldwide Open Beta</li><li>PodcastMadness continues in August</li></ul> <p>Grab a Coffee, Jump on that Treadmill and turn up the volume! Its time for Geek Tech Live!</p>
<h2>Playboy on Ipad minus the nudity</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Thats
right people, this is not a mis-print. Playboy Magazine, purveyor of
airbrushed Pr0n for many decades now will be coming to the Ipad. It was
tweeted by Mr. Hefner himself. Which is pretty interesting that Mr.
Hefner has any time to tweet anything while he is... ummm.. lets just
say busy?<a href="http://9to5mac.com/files/u811/Screen%20shot%202010-08-13%20at%207.25.29%20PM.png" style="margin:0pt auto;padding:0px 6px;text-align:center;"><img src="http://9to5mac.com/files/u811/Screen%20shot%202010-08-13%20at%207.25.29%20PM.png" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="242" width="465" /></a>
For some people that would be the greatest news to hit the Internet
since sliced bread. Here's the catch... no nudity. no nekkid girls, no
foldout playmates just loads of articles. Have I made myself clear? You
can now truly state you are only reading Playboy for the articles. We
all know that Steve Jobs stated that if you want Porn get an Android
phone... well Hugh Hefner, wheres the Android App for Playboy? I'm not
holding my breath on this one folks.</p>

<h2>Put some fire on your dinner table</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://store.yankodesign.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/600x/b6c53eefddb148171814c2f11aa0d200/5/9/5960-1061-feuerstelle-apoll-schwarz-03.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://store.yankodesign.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/600x/b6c53eefddb148171814c2f11aa0d200/5/9/5960-1061-feuerstelle-apoll-schwarz-03.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="370" width="370" /></a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:210px;">Ever
want to eat dinner in front of the fire but either dont have a
fireplace or worried about setting fire to the dinner table? Worry no
more my friends! for the low low price of $719.00 you can get the
Apollo Tabletop Fireplace. This little firebox runs on bio-alcohol and
leaves no smoke or odor.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">To quote the Website yankodesign.com store</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><b><i>Carl
Mertens of Germany has produced a tabletop fireplace called the Apollo
that burns bio-alcohol and would grace any home with its simple, but
superbly crafted design. This item has all the makings of becoming a
classic, it is not only as innovative as it is beautiful and useful, it
also improves the quality of life of those who experience it.</i></b></p>
 <p><b><i>Useful, but also simple to use: <br />
Simply fill the holding tank about three-quarters full, slide the lids
fully open and light with a long handled lighter or match. Allow to
burn for a minute or two in the fully opened position, then regulate
the flame to desire size by closing the lid partially.</i></b></p>
 <p><b><i>The unit will emit light and warmth, but is safe to place on
virtually any surface. Wipe the unit clean after use. The Apollo is
terrific for creating a romantic and warm ambiance in any room.</i></b></p>
 <p><b><i>Burn time is 3-4 hours. 13.8" long, 11.0" high, 4.7" wide.</i></b></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">So, for a nice romantic dinner and fire you know where to go.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[  <p>This is Chris your host and Welcome again to Geek Tech Live where âyou get a serving of Geek Twice a week!â</p>
 <p>In this episode :</p>
<ul><li>TorchWood is coming back. with USA locations?</li><li>Google Waves goodbye.</li><li>MuteWatch Says Nothing.</li><li>Name my New show!</li><li>PodcastMadness continues in August.

<h2>TorchWood is coming back. with USA locations?</h2>
 <p><a href="http://unrealityshout.com/files/images/jack-harkness.preview.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://unrealityshout.com/files/images/jack-harkness.preview.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Jack Harkness | Unreality ..." alt="" height="253" width="316" /></a>Torchwood
is coming back just not soon enough if you ask me. The continuation of
the Show named "Torchwood: the new World" will not pick up exactly as
the old season ended. I mean with that amount of doom and gloom it
would be a tough run of it.Â  The Start will be immediately as if you
might have missed out on a bit of time and with Harkness fighting and
running and being his old brilliant self.</p>
 <p>The initial premise is that a Global Event brings TorchWood Back
together. Russel T. Davies wont say what but did state in a write up on
Blastr.com that it will take 10 episodes to work it all out. I would
put my money on Aliens but its anyones guess really.</p>
 <p>Here is where it gets fun for Us Yanks! TorchWood will move to the
US of A from Wales. This means we get the cool aliens and destruction
and global domination all in L.A and surrounding areas. They are
Casting for two C.I.A. Agents to round out the cast and crew that were
left over from the "Children of Earth" Episode. of last season.</p>
 <p>Filming will begin this January. Lets hope it comes back with a bang!</p>

<h2>Google Waves goodbye.</h2>
 <p>This past Week the CEO of Google talked to the press and declared
Google WaveÂ  no longer. GoogleÂ  was asked about how the demise came
about and had this to say:</p>
<blockquote> <p>Schmidt noted that Google liked the UI and a lot of the technology behind the product, but it simply to take off. â<i>We try things</i>,â he said. â<i>Remember,
we celebrate our failures. This is a company where itâs absolutely okay
to try something thatâs very hard, have it not be successful, and take
the learning from that</i>,â he continued.</p>
 <p>If something does hit, he noted that Google gets strongly behind it. That simply wasnât the case here.</p></blockquote>
 <p>I woudl have to say that I did not see the Viability in Google Wave.
still its sad to see a possible New Tech idea wither and die. Did you
use Wave? Do you still? what are your thoughts on The Wave Cresting and
breaking on shore? Leave a comment in the show notes below.</p>
<h2>MuteWatch Says Nothing but does a lot.</h2>
 <p><a href="http://mutewatch.com/wp-content/themes/default/slideshow/images/2.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto;padding:0px 6px;text-align:center;"><img src="http://mutewatch.com/wp-content/themes/default/slideshow/images/2.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="263" width="477" /></a> <br /></p>
 <p>I like watches. I cant afford the super ultra cool ones but I like
looking at them. I saw this on Engadget and had to tell you about it.
Its Called Mutewatch and the name definitely covers what it does. the
Face is blank there are no buttons I can see. it has no ringer only a
vibrate mode.Â  if you do want to check the time you have to swipe your
finger across the face and the numbers show up for you. It will come in
White Grey or Red for the low low price of $260.Â  Read more about it
and order at their website: <a href="http://www.mutewatch.com/">http://www.mutewatch.com/</a> <br /></p>

<h2>Name My New Show</h2>
<blockquote> <p>Ok people, I am going to be starting up a new Video Show in
conjunction with Geektechlive.com it will be a division of Geek Tech
Live and will primarily be the video source for what your ears have
been listening to for the past 90 Episodes.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Twitter Tips, find relevant people to follow</h2>
<blockquote> <p>Ever look at your twitter list of people and ask yourself " who am I
missing out on"? Well just recently Twitter.com itself launched a way
to find followers called "who to follow". Once you are logged into your
account you just have to choose from a generic searchÂ  or target your
search using categories, they even have a "find your friends" feature
which looks at your email address books for people you may already know
that are on Twitter. Read all about it at <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/07/discovering-who-to-follow.html">http://blog.twitter.com/2010/07/discovering-who-to-follow.html</a> <br /></p></blockquote>
<h2>Blackberry Shines a Torch at Android and IPhone</h2>

will the phone Goliaths melt under the bright lights? I don't know but
I would think not as RIM has been only slowly gaining some market share
while Android and Apple stole the limelight. An Event Today in New York
on August 3rd will officially unveil the Blackberry 9800 a.k.a. the
Torch to the world. It will be Blackberries first Slider phone. Now,
you also may have remembered the whole IPhone Debacle and information
leak problems. RIM gets around all those issues as they pretty much
don't hide anything.Â  A Chinese video pretty much lays it all out
there. don't worry , you don't need a translator to figure out what
they are showing you of the new slider and OS6. It will be interesting
to see where this leads.</p><div style="margin:0pt auto;padding:0px 6px;text-align:center;"><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/media/img/trans.gif" title="&quot;id&quot;:&quot;apture_embedPlayer1&quot;,&quot;bgcolor&quot;:&quot;#ffffff&quot;,&quot;quality&quot;:&quot;high&quot;,&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot;:&quot;never&quot;,&quot;allowFullScreen&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;flashvars&quot;:&quot;domId=apture_embedPlayer1&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;http://player.youku.com/player.php/sid/XMTc4NzExNjE2/v.swf&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;apture_embedPlayer1&quot;,&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;:&quot;false&quot;" class="mceItemFlash" height="249" width="299" alt="trans.gif" /></div><div style="margin:0pt auto;padding:0px 6px;text-align:left;"><a href="http://berrytimes.cn/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/9800foto-08.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://berrytimes.cn/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/9800foto-08.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="203" width="307" /></a> <br /></div> <p>The Video has some interesting things in it like the Music player,
Podcasts appÂ  and launch by typing feature of OS 6. the Really
interesting thing about all this is that RIM just seems to have a very
different way of launching devices than any other company. Rather than
use mis-information, or conferences to obscure information. they just
make a device and then release videos and pictures on it and then look
at you funny when we all kind of are sort of not super excited about
something that is already pretty much a known factor in the consumer
space.Â  the only unknown is how it will actually function in the real
world.Â  for that we will have to wait and see.</p></blockquote>

			<description><![CDATA[  <p>This is Chris your host and Welcome again to Geek Tech Live where
âyou get a serving of Geek Twice a week!â except during Comic con. <br />
In this episode :</p>
<ul><li>San Diego Comic Con Bliss.</li><li>Preview Night Badges are Sold out for SDCC 2011?</li><li>Pick my new show name <br /></li></ul> <p>Grab a Coffee, Jump on that Treadmill and turn up the volume! Its time for Geek Tech Live!</p>
<h2>San Diego Comic Con Bliss.</h2>
 <p>This was my first time at the San Diego Comic Con. I have to say I
was not fully prepared as I had hoped. I had purchased the Four Day
Pass and gotten my preview night ticket and my hotel was not too far
away to be able to walk to the Con. I thought I had things mostly under
control but now I know a few things.</p>
 <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cfavero/4827599682/" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4138/4827599682_ff14b3b58b.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Good and Evil SuperGirl SDCC 2010" alt="" height="371" width="247" /></a><b>First</b>,
As a Podcaster/Blogger I should have gotten a Press Pass. I think I
could have seen more and It also would have gotten me in the right
state of mind to be able to do interviews etc. It also would have made
me realize that the recording equipment I did bring was not sufficient
enough to conduct proper interviews. Live and learn.</p>
 <p><b>Second</b>, My recording device and Iphone recorded audio for
crap so I did not do any interviews. As I said above, I only brought my
handheld recorder and my Iphone. Both of which did crap for recording
peoples voices over the throng. too much background noise.</p>
 <p><b>Third</b>, Preview night is nuts. figure out what you want then
get in line.... I meandered a bit too much and was just plain impressed
by all the pretty lights and colors and Sci-fi and aliens and well, you
get the picture.</p>
 <p><b>Fourth</b>, Any day after preview night makes preview night look
like no one showed up for preview night. I thought it was pretty busy
and crowded for preview night. that was nothing compared to the rest of
the Con.</p>
 <p>So, I thought we could get to Preview night and it would be a cake
walk to get in line, maybe see some celebs, try to get some free swag
and maybe either a Galactus or Ecto 1. Boy was I wrong. Madhouse barely
covers it. Pictures cant convey the eye candy splendor that is Comic
Con 2010. I walked in and was pulled in all directions by all the shiny
new toys, comics, giant screens playing Star Wars, and Superheros
everywhere. To say the least i was a bit overwhelmed and initially did
not know where to go or what to look at, there was just so much to do
and see and it was AWESOME!</p>
 <p>I let the throng of people guide me through the cavernous hall. I
had assumed (quite wrongly) that there would be a lot of Cosplay going
on. There were a few people who did dress up but nothing like what i
was going to experience the next few days. As I wandered the floor for
the first few minutes I just could not believe that I was actually here
at Comic con 2010. I had always said I should go to this event but it
took 37 years before I actually did it. First stop was to see about the
limited edition Batman figures with limited run Sinestro and Black
Lanterns. We found out that that the line was a drawing to be able to
be in the line to buy them. If you have not been to Comic Con before
there is a lot of just that. You need to stand in a line to pick a
ticket out of a hat to then determine if you can stand in another line
to buy the limited edition product or get the ability to meet and greet
people like Stan "the man" Lee ( someone I did not get to meet ). So
next stop was the Mattel booth to get my hands on the Ecto 1 Matchbox
car. The line for the Ecto 1 can only be explained as Epic so of course
I stood in it. By the time I got to be near the booth I found out that
the "end of the line" was already decided on and that we were behind
the end and therefore would have to stand in line more tomorrow. UGH.</p>
 <p>With that decision pretty much decided for me I wandered to the big
name Comic makers DC,Marvel and Dark Horse. They were giving out free
comics and so I nabbed as many as I could to read later and put them in
the bag we got as we entered. I got to walk right past Blair Butler and
Say hi to her. By the time I have wandered around and just got the lay
of the land it was time to call it a night and prepare for Day one of
Comic Con 2010.</p>
 <p>Day One</p>
 <p>I thought I could get to the Con a bit early, say an hour or so
before the doors opened and get into some Panels. Oh boy was I wrong. I
totally missed out on Chris Gore's "That Chris Gore Show" panel and
"X-Play Live" and relegated myself to snapping some pictures of the Con
goers. I got to see a lot of leotard wearing super heroes this day. I
slowly walked through the rest of Con and Talked to some Booth owners
at a few different areas and asked about some cool artwork I also
stopped at the Gelaskins booth where I got a sweet Umbrella Academy
Skin for my Iphone. And took a good portion of the Cosplay action going
on.Â  The day Ended with me being too late to get into Penn and Teller
and by that Virtue Too late to get into the BBC America Screening Panel
forÂ  Doctor Who and Being Human. Ok Day one was mostly just taking it
all in.</p>
 <p>Day Two</p>
 <p>Ok so, today I had a plan and I was going to stick to it. I wanted
some autographs, wanted to see the Caprica Panel and Stargate Universe
Panel and also see if I could find a few Internet Identities such as
Rachul Moore or Beau Ryan. I lined up to Hall 20 at 7:30 am for the
10am opening and I Was still sitting outside and at least a thousand
people back... wow. I did actually get in and Get to see the Caprica
Panel and Stargate Universe. I had to make a supreme decision on stay
for Big Bang Theory or get in line for some Autographs as I was unsure
of the process. So, I admittedly left to head for the Sails Pavilion.
My buddy I traveled with Stayed on in Hall 20 to bask in the glow while
I snuck into a few lines to get some autographs of stars from my youth.</p>
 <p>I was able to get autographs from Gil Gerard, Erin Grey and Dirk
Benedict this day and it was good. Batman the Red Mask was playing that
evening and The night ended on Day two with me feeling like I did
accomplish something even if I did not get to see Raychul Moore or Beau
Ryan or Chris Gore in person. oh well.</p>
 <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cfavero/4828082389/" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4119/4828082389_c3e02eb492.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Assassins Creed and Kratos SDCC 2010" alt="" height="253" width="201" /></a>Day Three</p>
 <p>Day three of the Comic Con 2010 Extravaganza and I was now ready for
my Hall 20 Marathon. I saw the Following Panels, Chuck, Family guy who
did a live reading of an episode, The cleveland Show which also did a
live reading,Â  Futurama which ALSO did a live reading of a special
episode.Â  I have to say that I was giddy with excitement. Seth
MacFarland doing Stewie and Seeing Billy West and Katey Sagal voice the
Characters of Fry and Leela and Zoidberg was Fantastic. I was planning
to stay until the Simpsons and Fringe made their appearances but I got
a text from Raychul Moore Stating she was just out of a panel and had
some time to meet up. I hurried down to the floor and eventually found
her dressed as Kraytos and her friend as the Main character from
Assassins creed. Raychul was very awesome to talk to but we were
limited on time and she stated she would be more than happy to be on
the show sometime so we exchanged information and I went on my way
happy I had met someone I only saw online and she was interested in
being on the show.</p>
 <p>I got some more Comic con picture taking done and moved toÂ  get into
line for the Mythbusters panel... I was able to score a seat only 7
rows from the front pretty much on luck alone.Â  Chris Hardwick who I
have really enjoyed seeing on Web Soup on G4tv as well as Gadget Pron
on Attack of the Show was moderating the Mythbusters panel and I knew
putting those two together was going to be fun Squared with a Double
Rainbow all the Way! I recorded a small portion of video of the Panel
and posted it up on Youtube where Adam talks about Comic Con 2010,
Boobs, working as a Mythbuster and Gets Jaimie to almost sing an answer
to Chris Hardwick.</p>
<div style="margin:0pt auto;padding:0px 6px;text-align:center;"><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/media/img/trans.gif" title="&quot;id&quot;:&quot;apture_embedPlayer1&quot;,&quot;bgcolor&quot;:&quot;#ffffff&quot;,&quot;quality&quot;:&quot;high&quot;,&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot;:&quot;always&quot;,&quot;allowFullScreen&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;flashvars&quot;:&quot;start=0&amp;domId=apture_embedPlayer1&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/HTw3Wn5sko4&amp;rel=0&amp;fs=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;apture_embedPlayer1&quot;,&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;:&quot;true&quot;" class="mceItemFlash" height="285" width="456" alt="trans.gif" /></div>
 <p>And thus that ended Day Four for me with a nice Steak dinner at Donovans</p>
 <p>Final Day</p>
 <p>Sunday was a short Day and all I did was Take some pictures, Grab
some more goodies and Autographs most especially of Chris Gore! yay!Â

In this episode :</p>
<ul><li> Apple Press conference. Will they plead guilty to hating lefties ?</li><li>Comic Con Plans are ready steady GO!</li><li>Podcast Madness continues in July. I can tell you how you can win.</li><li>Bill Nye Explains the BP Oil containment cap.</li></ul> <p>Grab a Coffee, Jump on that Treadmill and turn up the volume! Its time for Geek Tech Live!</p>
<h2>Apple Press conference. Will they plead guilty to hating lefties</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Ok
Apple, Enough! I love ya but really you just need to get this stuff
fixed. When news of a press conference where Apple may give Iphone 4.0
Sufferers a "free Bumper" or case or who knows what other rumors over
shadows the BP oil spill, the economy or worse yet Comic Con 2010 I
have an issue. Can we just get this resolved and move on? I mean Even
Jeremy Clarson of Top GearÂ  has made fun of this issue with reception.</p>
<div style="margin:0pt auto;padding:0px 6px;text-align:center;"><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/media/img/trans.gif" title="&quot;id&quot;:&quot;apture_embedPlayer1&quot;,&quot;bgcolor&quot;:&quot;#ffffff&quot;,&quot;quality&quot;:&quot;high&quot;,&quot;allowScriptAccess&quot;:&quot;always&quot;,&quot;allowFullScreen&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;flashvars&quot;:&quot;start=0&amp;domId=apture_embedPlayer1&quot;,&quot;src&quot;:&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/hXmH2QTZH0Q&amp;rel=0&amp;fs=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;iv_load_policy=3&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;apture_embedPlayer1&quot;,&quot;allowfullscreen&quot;:&quot;true&quot;" class="mceItemFlash" height="285" width="456" alt="trans.gif" /></div>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Consumer
reports has even weighed in on the fact that they "cannot recommend the
device" because of the signal strength issue. Thankfully there will be
a special press conference on July 16th to address something. We just
dont know exactly what Mr. Jobs is going to do.Â  Crazy rumors of a
Recall have even surfaced. We will all just have to wait and see what
is going to go on and hope and pray we can get back to some semblance
of reality as I need to learn more about Comic Con 2010 in San Diego!</p>
<h2>Comic Con Plans are almost ready</h2>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">So, Are
you going to the Con? San Diego Comic Con 2010 is going to have some
great panels and great Cosplay I think.Â  I can confirm that Mythbusters
will be having a panel Moderated byÂ  non other than Chris Hardwick from
nerdist.com or @nerdist on Twitter.Â  I will try to get at least one
Podcast out during the Comic Con Adventure.Â  I will be taking lots of
Photos and I will post them up on my Flickr account at <a href="http://flickr.com/cfavero">Flickr.com/cfavero</a> <br /></p>

<p style="padding-left:60px;">Well
thank gosh for this one everyone. I personally was hoping Bill Bye
would be asked about this. Bill was kind enough to create a mock up
using a soda bottle and some rubber tubing and show exactly what BP
were trying to do inÂ  very straightforward and easy to understand
terms. The catastrophe needs to be resolved.Â  Watch the Link or the

<h2>Sony Begins working on a Mobile Device? SonyPad?</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">It was
only a matter of time before Sony threw its hat into the ring for a new
Mobile device. They haven't had the greatest luck so far with their
trials and this one seems to try to make everyone happy, which by
standard definition will make non of us happy.Â  The basic feature-set
of the new Sony device will be an ebook reader, gaming console and a
netbook?Â  I am all for convergent devices and if done right they can be
great. I think that at first glance of the patent that has been
floating around the net seems a bit on the light side of functionality.
Some people have been dubbing it the PSP2 but it seems to be a PSP/iPad
hybrid ish thing. Sony's trademark it registered was named playview, so
your guess is as good as mine at this point for what exactly this new
Sony device will actually do. The reason I am skeptical on the whole
usability factor is that Sony has already stated that it will play
"games on Optical disks".Â  Helloooo the 80's called and they want their
Discman back. Who uses optical disks in a portable device anyways? for
me personally I don't want to be lugging around a portable gaming
device AND all the games AND the charger, etc... make it fit in a
pocket and run the games people want or its just going to be about a
functional as the old LAN parties were. We only lugged the PC's
together because we HAD to if we wanted to be able to play with our
friends and not have any lag. Now with Xbox live and Sony's Playstation
network we don't need to worry about that and I am not filling my trunk
with my Desktop and Monitor and a linksys switch so I can play my
starcraft. In the end we will have to just wait and see what Sony will
be delivering as an end result. The new direction Sony is going could
really take them far.</p>

<h2>Crackdown 2 is it as good as the original?</h2>
 <p><a href="http://fakehustle.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/crackdown-2.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto;padding:0px 6px;text-align:center;"><img src="http://fakehustle.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/crackdown-2.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Crackdown 2 Asks A Simple Question, âWould You Like To Blow ..." alt="" height="198" width="362" /></a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">ok, I grabbed my copy of Crackdown 2 the day it went on sale and fired it up. Here is my take on the game thus far.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Game mechanics</li></ul></blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:90px;">I was a
little disappointed that the game mechanics were not better than the
original . The original crackdown has a few issues one being aiming and
the other driving that could eventually drive you nuts.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Game play</li></ul></blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:90px;">If you
were a fan of the Original Crackdown, and you probably are if you
bought this. You will not be saddened at all. If you longed for the
next agility orb ping effect you will not be upset at all. if you, like
me froze mid run when you hear the faint sound of a nearby agility orb
for the taking you will adore this game. Its like the developers heard
the gamers whine there weren't enough orbs to collect and they upended
a huge tanker truck of Orbs across the city! The fun doesn't stop there
though as there are more than the old standard of two orbs. there are
renegade orbs which are just plain fun to chase and there are Coop only
orbs which are again there to foster team play.Â  Both highly addictive.</p>
<p style="padding-left:90px;">In this
new Crackdown there is the addition of a zombie element and let me tell
you there is nothing more fun than powering up your UV blaster and
burning some Zombie hides! the cool thing is that theÂ  "freaks" come
out at night and the normal human "Cell" are out by day so you get
twice the game play and twice the actual missions it seems.Â  You also
need to play your missions around the day night cycle it seems as well.
as if you storm a Freak lair during the day they are all waiting for
you cuz they hate the sunlight. IF you go at night there are less of
them to take you down.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>My Take</li></ul></blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:90px;">If you
liked the Original Crackdown, you are gonna like this game. the 4
person Coop is fantastic and there are so many agility orbs this has a
possibility for a good long game play. I give it 4 out of five geek
high fives.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.idaptweb.com/">IDAPT i4 Charger can charge the world!</a> <br /></h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://www.idaptweb.com/imatges/idapt/overview4.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://www.idaptweb.com/imatges/idapt/overview4.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="214" width="320" /></a>You
have heard charger makers state they will charge every device. Some get
pretty close and some fall well short of those goals. It looks Like the
IDAPT i4 gets high marks for being able to charge everything except
electric cars. Based on the plethora of gadgets, phones, hand-held
gaming platforms,kazoos,refrigerators and wombats that this thing can
charge I wouldn't put it past being able to charge almost anything
short of that. The IDAPT i4 can charge a long list of devices. I don't
have the inclination to list them all but the number currently sits at
4000 devices. No, i did not accidentally forget to proofread this
sentence...Â  the IDAPT i4 will charge a confirmed 4000 devices. Among
those devices are the following: The iPhone, iPod, Blackberry, Nintendo
DS, PSP, PS3 controller, GPS systems, digital cameras, and Bluetooth
products. <br />
The IDAPT i4 features an interchangeable tip system making it
completely customizable.Â  It has 3 charging points and an additional
USB charging point, allowing users to charge their electronics without
the mess of tangled cords or the need for more than one outlet. MSRP of
the IDAPT i4 is set at $60 for a pack of 6 interchangeable tips or $50
for a pack of four tips you can choose yourself.Â  The IDAPT i4 will be
available in August so order one now and get on the list! For more
information head on over to IDAPTS website at : <a href="http://www.idaptweb.com/US/idapt/idapt_i4/overview.html">http://www.idaptweb.com/US/idapt/idapt_i4/overview.html</a> <br /></p>
<h2>Comic-Con loads up list of Exclusive items.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Oh yes
people we are in the final countdown to Comic-Con 2010. I bought
tickets last year when they went on sale. Tickets were sold out very
fast and I have been counting the months and weeks until I could start
saying I was counting the days. On Comic-Con's website at <a href="http://www.comic-con.org/">http://www.comic-con.org</a>
they now have a list of Exclusive only at Comic-Con 2010 merchandise.Â 
Some things from the list that I think look cool are Star wars bookends
for $60<a href="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/exclusives/afx8.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/exclusives/afx8.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Star Wars Bookends" alt="" height="200" width="200" /></a> <br /></p>
 <p>Comic Book Guy #1/Futurama Comics #50, Gears of War Action figures,
Signed Autographs and much much more. Even a DomoÂ  only found at Comic
-Con</p>
 <p><a href="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/exclusives/tn_darkhorse1.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto;padding:0px 6px;text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/exclusives/tn_darkhorse1.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="143" width="120" /></a> <br /></p>
<h2>Podcast Madness continues in July. I can tell you how you can win.</h2>
<p style="text-align:left;padding-left:60px;">It's

a bit.Â  Every week in July a different set of Shows will have codes
that will be given out. Its a win-win situation for everyone. You get
to find some new and awesome shows and you know which shows to listen
to for your special code words each week.Â  So without Further Ado here

<h2>Crackdown 2 will be coming July 7 and I cant wait!</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://chud.com/articles/content_images/106/crackdown_carlift.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://chud.com/articles/content_images/106/crackdown_carlift.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="MCP: MICROSOFT LOVES CRACKDOWN" alt="" height="231" width="328" /></a>I
have been playing the Demo of Crackdown 2 for a while now and I am just
as hooked on this game as I was with the original Crackdown. Crackdown
2 seems to bring all the same fun but in a bigger and in some cases
cooler package. The fact you will be able to do a four person coop mode
is a beautiful thing for sure. The environments are bigger and the
things you can do are bigger and badder too. The cool things I have
seen from the demo was that you can do a coop mission, sighting the
target is spot on and any in demo achievements you accomplish will be
transferred to the real gameÂ  once you purchase it.Â  I was addicted to
crackdown the first time and Crackdown 2 looks to be just the same fix
I have been waiting for. Crackdown 2 will be available July 7th.</p>

<h2>What an AT-AT Afternoon looks like.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:90px;">With the
Iphone 4 issues brewing about the Iphone 4 antenna issues its been
pretty quiet as far a new news. Its been raining here ... A lotÂ  and I
was really very happy to find this as I sifted through my RSS reader
and I hope you think so too.Â  So, if you ever wondered what a baby
AT-AT would do as a pet then look no further. I am gonna say a phrase
that will all become clear while you watch the video. "Jabba the Poo"
that's all I am gonna say. Just "Jabba the Poo". This video made me
laugh out loud and that isn't an easy task. so check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CVYOCMpJRY">AT-AT Day Afternoon . </a> <br /></p>

<h2>My take on the Iphone 4</h2>
<p style="padding-left:90px;">Ok ,
well if you haven't been reading my tweets I can tell you that I was
one of the people that got the pre-order in on day one. So now that I
have been playing with the IPhone for a few days I can say a few things
about it for all you people thinking about the upgrade, my take on it
and some issues I had.</p>
<p style="padding-left:90px;">Upgrade process:</p>
<p style="padding-left:90px;">The
upgrade process was typical of Apple products. The upgrade was easy,
fast and zero blips. I had a IPhone 3G and the move to the Iphone 4.0
meant that the SIM card was would not work as the new IPhone had a
micro-Sim card.Â  I thought that might make the process a little bumpy
but it was already set up with my account and just needed to be
activated.Â  The process boiled down to these steps.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol><li>Charge the Phone but don't turn it on.</li><li>Activate the new phone with Itunes</li><li>Check your old phones Voicemail and write the info down. It wont transfer those.</li><li>Go to att.com/activations and activate the phone.</li><li>Turn on the new Phone and make a test call</li><li>Thats it. Done. The new IPhone is now ready to go .</li></ol></blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>My personal review of the Iphone 4.0</p></blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>Its fast. like really fast. The apps start and run
faster than my friends 3GS. Overall, the phone is much more responsive
and the app switching is nice too. I came from a 3G so the compass was
a cool feature. The big new great thing is the Camera. The images this
phone takes compared to my 3G. Fantastic.... simply fantastic. I think
that is also in part to this Retina display the phone packs. The new
icons are simply stunning to look at. The images are razor sharp
because of Retina. If you can see one first hand you will be pulled
right in. Movies are recorded in 720p but sadly cant be uplaoded to
Youtube at 720p via the phone. you have to get them off the phone first
and upload via your computer if you want 720p. This is understandable
as a 720p movie takes up a fair bit of room and in no time flat you
will use up all 2GB of bandwidth you paid so dearly for.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>My Issues</p></blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>Well, I don't have the Yellow bar or Yellow Dot. I also
don't seem to be able to replicate the Attenuation issue with holding
the phone like a lefty or trying to short out the antennas. What I do
have is one small but annoying issue with the Iphone 4.0 that will be
resolved soon I hope. I was working on call this weekend and I had a
Network Tech call me to discuss something I was working on. Typically,
I would take the phone into the Computer room and put the guy on
speaker phone. That is exactly what I did, only to hear him say he
could not hear me.Â  I tried to yell into the phone and still he
couldn't hear me. If I switched back to normal phone mode it all
worked.Â  I chalked it up to a glitch and figured I would reboot the
phone and it would be fixed.Â  Later I tried to test out the free
Facetime number apple set up and I got connected to a rep and we could
see each other but she could not hear me.Â  I then went back to a few
Movies I recorded as tests and found all of them without sound.Â 
Interesting eh? So off I go to the Genius bar. The genius person helper
guy had me call his cell phone and switch over to speaker and yup. you
guessed it. no sound. I hear there are a small number of us with this
issue and it basically boils down to the sound cancellation mic
overcompensating for background noise and canceling everything out. So

<h2>Icurling from <a href="http://maxnick.com/products/icurling/">MaxNick.com</a> review</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">I just
recently tweeted that I liked the sport of Curling and I do. I'm not
lying. There are two sports I will stop my channel surfing for and one
of them is Cricket and the other is Curling. So, when I got followed by
Maxnick.com and asked if i would like to demo and review their new
iCurling app for the IPhone I couldn't resist.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The Game
itself is pretty straightforward. Get the closest to "home" with your
big shiny granite rock.Â  Now I know what you are thinking... " he loves
curling, so he is going to biased" . Not so! while I love the Game I
have seen some good and bad implementations of such a simple game. Here
is the break down:</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://maxnick.com/wp-content/themes/maxnick/images/icurling/logo.png" style="margin:0pt auto;padding:0px 6px;text-align:center;"><img src="http://maxnick.com/wp-content/themes/maxnick/images/icurling/logo.png" style="border:0px none;" title="iCurling â maxnick.com" alt="" height="124" width="404" /></a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;text-align:center;"><b>PROS:</b> <br />
Controls Strightforward <br />
Clean design <br />
Bright colors <br />
Lots of Gaming for very little price</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;text-align:center;">
<b>CONS:</b> <br />
Only one setting for computer opponent <br />
Background music gets old fast <br />
Not a huge amount of settings</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://maxnick.com/wp-content/themes/maxnick/images/icurling/previews/2_en.jpg" style="margin:0pt auto;padding:0px 6px;text-align:center;"><img src="http://maxnick.com/wp-content/themes/maxnick/images/icurling/previews/2_en.jpg" class="alignleft" style="border:0px none;" align="left" height="300" width="200" alt="2_en.jpg" /></a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://maxnick.com/wp-content/themes/maxnick/images/icurling/previews/4_en.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://maxnick.com/wp-content/themes/maxnick/images/icurling/previews/4_en.jpg" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="300" width="200" /></a>Now
here is where the majority of those cons goes away. The game is only
.99 cents! even though at times the computer opponent doesn't make
great choices I found myself addicted to playing this game. It even
looks good on the Ipad. At the time of this writing I also just tested
it on the new IPhone 4.0 and iCurling looks somehow even cleaner than
on my old 3G.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The game
is played in "turns" where you choose the power of your throw and also
the rotation "curl" of the stone.Â  Sometimes the most simple games are
the most satisfying to play.Â  Hard Core curling enthusiasts, you will
find the game lacking a bit but I did not get tired of it.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">I give it 4 out of 5 Geek Thumbs up. Find out more at <a href="http://maxnick.com/products/icurling/">MaxNick.com</a> or <a href="http://itunes.com/apps/icurling">download the game from the Itunes app store</a> right now for only .99 cents.</p><p style="padding-left:60px;">Â </p><p style="padding-left:60px;">Â </p>

<h2>Ramp up for Comic Con in San Diego</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">So, ask
you may have heard me state a few times I am going to be in San Diego
for Comic Con 2010 from July 21st Thru 26th. I have the preview night
tickets as well. I will be trying to Podcast from San Diego Comic Con
and I have been prepping what I will be using.Â  The new IPhone 4.0 with
720p video will help for some documentation. I will be doing a review
of my new Camera the Canon 7D very soon. I am getting my bearings again
on a full manual DSLR again after a few years.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">So, are
you going to Comic Con? Do you have any favorite panels? Favorite
places to eat? Email me at ComicCon2010 (at) geektechlive (d_o_t) com
and let me know! This is my first trip to San Diego and my first trip
to Comic Con. I am looking for any advice. Maybe we will even bump into
each other at the Con.</p>

<h2>Launch of PlayStation Plus... but does it truly add?</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Sony
Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCE) announced that it will offer
PlayStation Plus, a new subscription service package on PlayStation
Network. In addition to the current free to use existing features and
services, PlayStation Plus brings value-added offerings including
exclusive services and content worldwide on June 29.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Well, what does the value add really mean to you and me?</p>
<blockquote style="padding-left:30px;">
<ul><li>PS+ (<a href="http://uk.playstation.com/playstationplus/">http://uk.playstation.com/playstationplus/</a>
) members will be able to play the full version of designated PS3
downloadable and PlayStation Network titles including PS one Archives
and minis (excluding Japan) with no limit of time as long as membership
is effective. These games will become available for PlayStation Plus
members at no extra cost.</li><li>Content such as avatars and dynamic themes, many of which are
exclusive, will become available, as will early access to designated
new game beta trials, game demos and video content prior to public
distribution - both available within subscription fee.</li><li>Members will have access to exclusive discounts on designated
PlayStation Store titles. Titles will vary every month on PlayStation
Store.</li><li>Members can also access full game trial where they will have access
to full versions of designated PS3 and PlayStation Network titles. The
titles on offer will be available for download on PlayStation Store for
a stated period and change every month. After the trial period expires
(expiration dates will vary by content), users will be able to continue
playing the game by purchasing the game on-line**.</li><li>PS3 will automatically download and install designated game demos
and game updates and also download the system software update data
(requires user agreement to install). PS3 will automatically start up
at a designated time to download content and will turn off after the
download has completed.</li></ul> <p>So it looks like there is some interesting additions for a price but
is the price set well? Prices I found were all in British pounds at
11.99 as a starting price. We will just have to see what it has in
store for us.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Cameras â The New Weapons In Fighting Poverty.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">ShareYourLove.com
is unlike many charity initiatives. Instead of asking for your credit
card or spare coins they ask for photos of what you love. Users view
peoplesâ loves from around the world and advertising on the site raises
much needed funds for the global water charity WaterAid.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">This is
a really cool idea if you ask me. Everyone seems to win here. You get
your photos posted online to share, that raises funds for charity and
Shareyourlove.com stays in business. Its a trifecta of awesome.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">ShareYourLove.com
founder David Smerdon, 35, from Brisbane Australia says, âMost people
want to do good but donât have the time or money to regularly
contribute. ShareYourLove.com is a daily celebration of what we love,
to help the 884 million people worldwide who donât have access to clean
water and sanitation. The site always has interesting content and
visitors are intrigued by what the world loves.â</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">ShareYourLove.com
was founded in February 2010 by David Smerdon. After 15 years working
in advertising agencies he wanted to use his powers for good. Contact

<h2>Two Games I am looking forward to from E3</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">There were two games I was looking forward to hear more about at E3.Â  Portal 2 and my new favorite Bulletstorm.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">You
probably are already at least a bit familiar with Portal 2 as it took
the gaming world by storm a few years ago. Portal 2 is set in the
future and from what I saw online its going to definitely push the
envelope of thought provoking game play.Â  A new Coop mode and all new
challenges await. And from what heard, portal 2 will have a lot of game
testing under its belt before it goes on sale so it will definitely be
a fully fleshed out game and should appeal to almost any gamer level.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The
other game that really caught my attention is Bulletstorm. This game
looks really interesting to me. Its got some new game play and a good
merging of a few great game styles. Lots of interaction in the game
world as most everything can be used to destroy the enemy. It really
looks interesting to me. Check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRVyb747wxY">G4tv's preview of BulletStorm</a> and tell me what you think.</p>

<h2>Iphone 4.0 Pre sale Implode... Again</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">You
would think that after the release of the Iphone 3G and 3GS and the
debacles that they were that AT&amp;T would learn. Well, it is nice
that some things don't change but unfortunately this isn't one of them.
Once again, the megalith that is AT&amp;T with all their resources that
they have must have forgotten to add a few servers to their Iphone
Ordering web farm or IFarm I would call it.Â  The Iphone Ordering site
was up but only for a little while. By 10am CST there were already
reports of major outages and errors and people not able to even get to
the spot in the IPhone upgrade site to even find out IF they were
eligible to upgrade. There were stories of people going to Apple stores
and being told they will take their Credit card information and be
called back once Apple can get in and order an Iphone from AT&amp;T.Â 
Heck I even heard a rumor of an Apple Store closing down for a while to
try to stem the tide of people waiting in line and getting angry(er).</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://techmeme.com/">Techmeme.com</a>
had numerous articles flying in right after the servers crashed for the
final time of an even worse issue though that the lack of a decent
network and web infrastructure to handle orders of the new device. The
first reports were of people being charged more than once for their
IPhone order, which is bad but then it hit. Security breach. Those two
words that recently have also been paired up with IPad and AT&amp;T a
bit more than I care to feel comfortable to say. It seems people were
able to log in to the AT&amp;T mobile site and actually see other
people's accounts. One very angry customer stated they logged in and
Saw the name of a woman and a different city on the main page. When
this person complained to AT&amp;T the Giant shrugged and swatted the
annoying Gnat away. Eventually AT&amp;T shut down the Mobile site
completely for a short time. I assume to fix the issue of the security
breach for their customers.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">I am one
of their customers and I have to state that My experience with AT&amp;T
and the IPhone has been not too bad over the past 2 years.Â  I work in
IT when I am not podcasting and if I were to under estimate the wave of
requests coming in to my Web farms this poorly I would have lost my job
numerous times over by now.Â  This to me is gross negligence on planning
for the insanity that everyone KNOWS an IPhone release or pre-order
will become.Â  I really truly hope that AT&amp;T will learn from this
and create a more dynamic environment for these eventualities. They
have a great product and to drop the ball on the ability to service
orders really only makes everyone look bad. Yes even you Apple, even
you. I heart you both but you need to be more prepared.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Did you have issues getting your Iphone 4.0? I would love to hear from you. Send me an email at Geek AT geektechlive.com</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">To quote Forrest Gump " That's all I have to say about that"</p>

<h2>Playstation Move Vs. Xbox Kinect ... FIGHT!</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://webassetsb.scea.com/pscomauth/groups/public/documents/webasset/motion_controller_head_image.png" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://webassetsb.scea.com/pscomauth/groups/public/documents/webasset/motion_controller_head_image.png" style="border:0px none;" alt="" height="260" width="225" /></a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">So,Â  Moving away from Sad Panda news both the titans have now released their secret weapons. Let the Gaming Begin!</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Playstation
revealed their Move a little while ago as did Xbox show of the early
Natal version now Kinect. Which is better? which will give great game
play? Right now the jury is still out. The Major Differences are that
the Move is based on controllers you hold in your hands and make me
want to eat ice cream.Â  and the Xbox Kinect is all about body tracking
etc.Â  if you are wondering, Nintendo didnt even make it to the party on
this one. the gaming architecture of the Wii is different enough that
with the lack of high def graphics etc... its really just come down to
these to bad boys.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">If you
ask me the Xbox Kinect is Rad because it does away with the Ice cream
controllers or wii-chucks and what not and engages you in the
experience. Supposedly, you can interact right on the Xbox dashboard
with just waves of your hands and your voice.Â  I am again a big fan of
getting computing to Minority report level or sophistication minus the
savants in a bath to look into the future.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">So in
the end I think that Xbox has broken some very new ground and if it
holds together we will see this technology in the Kinect be applied to
other devices and who knows what else.</p>
<h3><b>So, are you tired of waiting for me to say the Podcast Madness

<h2>"Just Psoop It!"</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Ok I
could not pass this up. As I am reading through some of new PRweb.com
releases I came across this and had to share. Who knows this could be
theÂ  "next big thing" on the Internet.Â  Psoop.comÂ  is popularizing the
Phrase "Just Psoop it!" to encourage Online Advertisers to post
classified on their site.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">This new
phrase "Just Psoop it!" is starting to be picked up by SEO webpreneurs
more and more.Â  Russel Gabiola, a webpreneur who specializes in SEO
asked, âHave you heard the phrase, âJust Psoop Itâ? No, itâs definitely
not from a popular sports brand. Itâs the new trend in the marketing
world. Itâs a way to tell people how to advertise their products and
businesses online. A year from now, Psoop.com will probably be the
biggest name in the Classified Ads Industry, well at least, that is
what the company is hoping for.â</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Psoop.com">Psoop.com</a>
is a start-up website that offers an easy way to promote products and
businesses online. They may even be the next Craigslist. so if you want
to see what Craigslist 2.0 looks like head on over to Psoop.com and
check it out.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>So,
are you tired of waiting for me to say the Podcast Madness Code? Really
just want to get your name in for the next drawing? Well the I guess i
can tell you. but shhh! dont tell anyone else. Whisper{"you are my
favorite."} The PodcastMadness.com Secret Code word is....[Listen to

<h2>Xbox 360 Slim at E3? Maybe.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">RUMOR
RUMOR RUMOR! Next Xbox will be slimmer tighter looking and much more
Boxy and it will be unveiled at E3! Maybe.Â  Ubergizmo has posted an
article detailing the unconfirmed rumors of an Xbox 360 Slim at E3.Â 
Since Playstation 3 Slim was already released it only seems natural
that Microsoft releases their take on the slimmer sleeker fresher faced
Xbox 360 now with less? in this case less really IS more as it seems
from the pictures at <a href="http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2010/06/rumor_xbox_360_slim_to_be_unveiled_at_e3.html">Ubergizmo.com</a>
that the Slim Xbox 360 mock up pictured has some Extra USB connectors
and some other docks, etc... Granted its only a mock up but still is
interesting.Â  I will definitely be keeping an eye on E3 this year for
more news about this.</p>
<h2>First 90 Seconds of Futurama Season Premiere are here!</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Oh My! <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/">Comedy Central</a>
has the first 90 Seconds of the season premiere of Futurama in over 7
years up to watch! They are back people! They are back!Â  Fry, Leela,
Zoidberg and the crew are back after a 7 year hiatus! has it really
been 7 years? In two weeks the new season of Futurama will begin.
Comedy central will be posting countdown to Futurama post every weekday
until the premiere and they are texting Futurama updates out as well if
you txtthe wordÂ  FUTURAMA to 44686. Sweet!Â  the One hour season
Premiere of Futurama will air Thursday June 24th at 10pm/9 central so
after a grueling day of picking up your shiny new Iphone 4.0 you can
relax and bask in all the Futurama Goodness!</p>

<h2>Some Iphone 4 info for you and Ios rundown</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Yes yes
yes Virginia, there is a Mr Jobs and he makes Iphones every year.Â  This
year is no different as the new Iphone 4.0 and the new Iphone Operating
system now dubbed iOS is being released as well.Â  I wonder what Cisco
is thinking or how much money they made when this was announced as Most
of you probably know, Cisco's proprietary operating system for the
switches and routers and hubs ( Oh My!) that the interwebs and most
companies run on is (or was) called Cisco IOS. I Am still looking for
that info on the cost of the ownership of those three little letters.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">But on
to more interesting things. the New Iphone has all the bells and
whistles you and I have come to expect and since we already saw it when
it was leaked its somewhat a snoozer there. the devil is in the details
that we now can confirm though and here they are:</p>
<ul style="padding-left:60px;"><li>The Iphone is 24% thinner than the 3GS</li><li>Resolution is an eye watering 960 x 640 display dubbed the "Retina display"</li><li>A4 processor similar to the Ipad</li><li>Claimed 300 hours of standby time, 40 hours of Audio and 10 hours of video</li><li>two cameras, one front facing and one normal. standard one is 5MP and capable of shooting 720p video!</li><li>A three axis Gyroscope so its got almost wii like motion control possibilities built in.</li></ul><p style="padding-left:60px;">Ios
addins make it even more interesting with the addition of Multitasking,
ibook, Unified inbox, custom folders, bluetooth keyboard support,
background audio like pandora, tap to focus for video and camera shots,
fast app switching, and a host of others.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Ok, so
how are you gonna get your grubby little paws on one of these?Â  Here is
the breakdown. For new serviceÂ  its $199 for 16GB or $299 for the 32GB
model with a 2 year contract.Â  no contract pricing will set you back
$599 for 16GB or $699 for 32GB.Â  AT&amp;T is allowing any Iphone
customers who were going to be coming due in 2010 so upgrade at theÂ 
new service pricing. which is cool, but if you want to confirm that you
are eligible you will want to dial *639# into your current AT&amp;T
phone and in a few seconds you will get a reply txt message either
confirming you are in the running or if you have to shell out the early
upgrade pricing.Â  you can also check on your AT&amp;T account page from
the AT&amp;T website.</p>
<h2>Google TV and L4 systems plan for TV application awesomeness</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">This is
pretty cool, It was announced today that L4 Systems, a Seattle area
software company, will release L4 Connected TV this fall on the new
Google TV platform and on TVs enabled by Yahoo! Connected TV and TiVo.
The companyâs app will be augmented by L4 Connected TV for Mobile for
iPhone, Blackberry, and Android to deliver an always-available visual
and speech recognition user interface to interact with features in the
living room and on the go. Both the TV application and the Smartphone
app will blend features from social networking, Internet radio, and
local search with the consumerâs TV watching experience.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">L4
Systems plans to simultaneously release L4 Connected TV and L4
Connected TV for Mobile to TV and Smartphone application stores this
fall. Using a WiFi connected TV and your 3G/4G or WiFi connected
Smartphone, the centerpiece of L4 Connected TV will be voice navigation
of features along with an open web service hosted in the cloud that
aggregates and manages connections to the consumerâs social network,
local search provider, and music.</p>

<h2>Lord of the Rings Online Goes live soon.. play for free?</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Yes you
heard me right. The LOTRO game will be free to download and free to
play online. NowÂ  in reality they are actually calling it
"Free-to-play" which really means that you seem to get a slightly
hobbled version of the game. 100 Swords? Well you get less than that.
Premium content? Yeah that will cost you. Expansion packs? Again, yes.
You will have to pay for all that with "Turbine Points"</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">from the beta sign up site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Free-to-Play
opens up more choices and options so you can play your way. When LOTRO
Free-to-Play is available, you can download the game for free and start
playing without a subscription or even a credit card. Earn free Turbine
Points as you advance your Hero and adventure throughout the massive
world of Middle-earth. You can spend these points in the LOTRO Store to
access hundreds of convenience items as well as expansion packs,
premium content, potions, character-customization options, and more. If
you choose to, you may also purchase Turbine Points in the LOTRO Store.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">From
skimming the FAQ on the LOTRO beta sign up site I t also seems that the
LOTRO store will be available at any time during the game and will
contain health potions and "convenience items" for sale. So no more
running to the nearest city to camp for the night or rest and regain
Mana? where is the fun in that?</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">If you think this game sounds interesting head on over to LOTRO.com and <a href="http://www.lotro.com/betasignup/">sign up for their beta </a> <br /></p>
<h2>Canon 5d Rocks! 24 hours in 19500 frames video</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Many of
you may not know this but I am a photography nut. I am infact even a
College Graduate of Photography School. I am not using my Photography
degree for my job but I can tell you this, Canon is my favorite choice
of camera and part of that reason is the 5D Mark II.Â  I cant justify
one for myself since the body alone will set you back a clean $2500.00
with Tax for the body with no lenses, but the photography that it can
spew out when in the right hands is fantastic!Â  The season Finale of
House was actually completely shot with a Canon 5D Mark II actually, so
if you are wondering if a DSLR can do HD quality video you have your
answer.Â  As I was researching canon cameras for myself to get one close
to the 5D Mark II 's quality ( I did just buy a canon EOS 7D ). I came
across this <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/gadgets/canon-5d-24-hours-19500-frames-2010064/">awesome video posted on Geek.com</a> by <a href="http://www.geek.com/users/SalCan/">Sal Cangeloso</a> I completely agree with the Title of the post as well <b>"Another reason why the Canon 5D rocks: 24 Hours in 19500 Frames"</b>.
According to Sal the video is a look at the 24 Hours NÃ¼rburgring race.Â 
so if you love cars, racing, movies and photography you will love this
video!</p>

<h2>Jetstar Airways is first Airliner to rent in-flight IPads</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">The
Aussies are just an awesome group of people. they got Crocodile Mick
Dundee, a cool looking opera house and a line of outback steak houses
in the USA too! now they can add one more cool thing to the Austrailian
arsenal of Awesome. (AAA for short).Â  Quantas Budget carrier Jetstar
Airways will be testing out a new IPad rental system for inflight
movies and entertainment. Any flight longer than 90 minutes will get
you the option of renting a Ipad for AUD $10 ( approx $8.40 US). so you
can view movies and probably surf the internet as well I would assume.
JetStar did not go into great detail on what would be offered but I
would assume it wont just be for Movie playing in flight.</p>
<h2>Amtrak joins the twentieth century and adds Wi-Fi to trains.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">I love
riding on Trains. Wherever possible I try to take a train. this is just
one more reason to give Amtrak a try if you ask me.Â  Based on a three
Month trial Amtrak is making Free Wi-Fi available on its High speed
Acela Express trains that runs between Washington DC and Boston. Amtrak
is also planning on expanding this offering to the rest of the line as
well. The Wi-Fi service is called AmtrakConnectSM and based on usage
stats gathered by Amtrak, about 115,000 passengers have logged-on which
translates to 39% of ridership of the Acela Express. The next lines to
get the Wi-Fi upgrade will be the California Routes in the Fall of 2010
and then the Northeast Regional service routes. The only thing
potentially slowing them down is if there is a lack of funding.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Lets all Welcome Amtrak into the Twentieth century!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[  <p>This is Chris your host and Welcome again to Geek Tech Live where "you get a serving of Geek <b>Twice</b> a week!"</p>
 <p>in this episode:</p>
<ul><li>Wikitude Drive GPS AR for android</li><li>Android 2.2 arrives on Nexus One</li><li>Ecto 1 License Plates? sign me up!</li></ul> <p>Grab a Coffee, Jump on that Treadmill and turn up the volume! Its time for Geek Tech Live!</p>
<h2>Wikitude Drive GPS AR for android</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Wikitude
Drive made by Mobilizy is the first Augmented Reality GPS application
and its only found on the Android Phone. Minimum OS version is 1.6 but
as you will find out in my next topic that should not be an issue for
very long, especially if you have a Nexus ONE.Â  The very cool thing
about this application is that it is AR driven so you see a live view
of the road ahead and it overlays the route you need to take to get to
your destination. It is currently only in beta but they are looking for
test drivers so if you rock an Android phone and you want to take part
in the Beta test head on over to <a href="http://www.wikitude.org/">Wikitude.org</a>
. You can tell them Chris sent you but they dont even know who I am so
don't bother. ;) This is a very cool Application for Android devices.
Minority report computers are just a hop skip and a jump from this
point. I hope that Jobs is listening. if the Iphone HD doesn't have
this ability then Android is definitively winning in the awesome
category.</p> <br /><h2>Android 2.2Â  Froyo arrives on Nexus One</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Confirmed
this morning! Android 2.2Â  Froyo is now officially available on the
Nexus ONE. It is being rolled out slowly it seems and as of this
writing is starting to turn up in tweets and in comments on the major
Tech Blogs.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">If you
have been living under a rock or in a cave for a while. Here are the
highlights of What exactly Froyo will mean to the Android users out
there:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Huge Speed improvements</li><li>Navigation bar is modified</li><li>Google Search Bar Modification</li><li>Tethering and Portable Hotspot ( Hey Apple and AT&amp;T ! You guys reading this?)</li><li>External Storage for applications on an SD card.</li><li>Gmail got a huge boost in usability</li><li>Pin codes instead of a pattern for locking device</li></ul></blockquote>
<h2>Ecto 1 License Plates? sign me up!</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">I have
said this before and I will say it again. I am a huge Ghostbusters Fan.
Not GB 2 but the original. I think most of my childhood was watching
and re-watching that movie on VHS. I absolutely love everything about
it. Granted the soundtrack is a bit dated now but the story is just as
good on Day 1002 as it was on day 1. But I digress, I was skipping
through my RSS reader and came across a Thinkgeek posting. Lo and
behold! ThinkGeek has a Ghostbusters Ecto-1 replica License Plate up
for grabs! Me want very bad. Its sutable for framing or putting in your
back window of your car.Â  It is not a legit plate so dont even think of
going out and putting it on your car. you will be pulled over by the
police and then I will have to say " I told you so". So dont do it even
if you think your last name looks Ghostbuster-ish.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/collectibles/c066/">Head on Over to Thinkgeek.com to buy your very own License plate</a> before they are sold out. and by sold out I mean me buying them all for myself.</p>

<h2>Gears of War 2 Update... lots of new stuff</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://www.gameguru.in/images/gears-of-war-2-coming-1.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://www.gameguru.in/images/gears-of-war-2-coming-1.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Rumor 101: Gears of War 2 Details and Map Revealed? | Game Guru" alt="" height="179" width="241" /></a>If
you are a fan of Gears of War 2 you are going to love this latest
update. This latest update is actually number 6 in the continuing
awesomeness that is Gears of War 2 ( GOW2) . Gamers rejoice! here are
some of the highlights of the release notes found on <a href="http://gearsforums.epicgames.com/showthread.php?p=27321057#post27321057">EpicGames.com GOW2 site.</a> <br /></p>
<ul style="padding-left:60px;"><li>The update adds a new public multiplayer match option called Social
Xbox LIVE (aka player matches), open to anyone who owns all
downloadable maps (that is, All Fronts Collection).</li><li> <br /></li><li>You can join Social Matches in progress and can quit any time
without penalty, although players who quit a match early donât receive
earned experience (XP) from that match.</li><li>Adds the ability to join Horde sessions that are in progress.
<ul><li>In Social Horde, you can join a session in progress through
matchmaking and you are able to continue your session from the last
wave you failed without starting over.</li><li>In Ranked Horde, you can join a session in progress only through invites.</li><li>If you join a session in progress, at the end of the session you
receive the score you achieved during the time you spent in the session.</li><li>Improves the precision of weapon selection using the D-pad.</li><li>Improves client-side hit detection for ballistic weapons.</li></ul></li></ul><p style="padding-left:60px;">And a
whole host of Exploit fixes are also packaged in the Title update 6 .
The whole update will be released in a few weeks so dont fret its on
its way soon.</p>
<h2>Iphone 4.0 Beta SDK is released again</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://news.softpedia.com/images/news2/iPhone-OS-4-0-New-SDK-Accompanying-January-Tablet-Tipsters-Say-2.png" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://news.softpedia.com/images/news2/iPhone-OS-4-0-New-SDK-Accompanying-January-Tablet-Tipsters-Say-2.png" style="border:0px none;" title="iPhone 4.0 software banner - mockup - iPhone OS 4.0, New SDK ..." alt="" height="138" width="188" /></a>Yup
you guess it had to come sooner or later. the IPhone SDK is finally
here for download for developers.Â  Apple released yet one more Beta to
developers.Â  This is the Fourth Beta so far and only for the Eyes of
Apple Developers. if you didnt fork over the cash to make Iphone apps
you are gonna have to wait a bit longer or find a friend who did spent
the tidy sum to become a developer. Based on the history of Apple Betas
a final build will be nearing soon. What does this all mean for you and
me? well not much other than a glimpse that Apple is gearing up for the
4.0 OS and eventual Iphone Roll out very soon. it will be interesting
to see how much makes it in to the final design and build with all the
Boozing and losing of Devices that has been going on. Stay tuned for
more information.</p>
<h2>Android app for the Chevy Volt? Awesome!</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://www.msiservices.com/useruploads/images/0_61_revolt320.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://www.msiservices.com/useruploads/images/0_61_revolt320.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Android remote control for Chevy Volt" alt="" height="144" width="192" /></a>Yeah,
you heard me right. if you have a Chevy Volt electric car and an
Android phone you can do a whole host of things like Setting the
Charging schedule or check its trip history to even just honking the
horn. Chevy just announced google Maps integration with the Volt in the
second iteration of the Android App later this year. Android is getting
a lot of cool new hooks I must say and this is pretty cool at that.Â 
the Google Maps integration is suppsed to be able to find your car in a
parking lot, tell a friend in a chevy Volt where you are to pick you up
and setting locations on your phone that become destinations for your
car GPS.Â  The Volt and app will be rolling out later this year with
hopefully all the above coolness.</p>

			<title>Geek Tech Live 74 TweetDeck for Android, Solid Gold Ipad and What is 180?</title>
			<itunes:author>Chris Favero</itunes:author>
			<link>http://www.mevio.com/episode/231458/geek-tech-live-74-tweetdeck-for-android</link>
			<description><![CDATA[  <p>Howdy Everyone. and welcome to a fresh new Episode 74 being recorded
form my very own brand spanking new computer slash Pod-casting Room!</p> <p> <br /></p>
 <p>In this episode of Geek Tech Live:</p>
<ul><li>TweetDeck going to spew out Twitter app for Android?</li><li>Got 190k lying around? Get yourself a solid Gold Ipad. What?</li><li>What is 180? I will tell you.</li></ul> <p>Hey, you wanna save some cash and have a website? well head on over to <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/domains/search.aspx">Godaddy.com</a>
and use one of my codes to save yourself some cash on anything you
want! GTL1 will save you 10% off any order not already discounted. or
use GTL3 to snag yourself a dot com for only $7.49</p>
<h2>TweetDeck for Android? oh yes!</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/homard/3712749293/" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/3454/3712749293_931ff95d98.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Startup Schwag #21 - tweetdeck.com Shirt" alt="" height="132" width="177" /></a>There
are a lot of Twitter applications out there. Even Twitter has a twitter
app. and I am a big proponent of getting the app from the source since
they sometimes will have something they don't release inthe API.Â  I
have used a bunch of Twitter apps and I do have to say TweetDeck has
the most features. Sadly if you were rockin the Droid you were left out
of the geek hug that was TweetDeck.... that is until now! Oh yes
TweetDeck is soon to be released. one small thing. the app will not be
able to be run in the background? Tweetdeck states that is to conserve
battery life of the droid.</p><p style="padding-left:60px;">Â   <br /></p>

<h2>Got $190k Lying around? Grab yourself a Solid Gold Ipad. Eh, What?</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">In this
still slightly depressed Economy it really pains me to see these type
of oppulent over the top modifications or Gadgets or what not. I will
be the first to<a href="http://images2.pocket-lint.com/images/tVHW/solid-gold-ipad-snip-pound130000-1.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:right;"><img src="http://images2.pocket-lint.com/images/tVHW/solid-gold-ipad-snip-pound130000-1.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="Solid gold iPad" alt="" height="109" width="200" /></a>
say the " you get what you pay for" but seriously?Â  it has 53 Flawless
diamonds embedded in the apple logo and the case was made not of
aluminum but 22 carat Solid freaking Gold! If i see Donald Trump
sporting this on any media images I will puke. I like my Ipad. I really
do. this type of "upgrade" does nothing for the functionality of the
actual device. It doesnt make it go faster, or give it longer battery
life. It does however make it weigh three times as much and fetch a
crazy mind numbing $190,000. If you ask me $599.00 was more than
expensive enought for my 32GB Ipad. $190k? no way. I guess theÂ  only
good thing I can think of about this "upgrade" is that if the economy
does collapse you will have $190,000 worth of Gold you can use to buy a
chartered jet to Canada.</p>
<h2>What is 180? A frigging Cool Game! that's What!</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">A Facebook Friend of Mine <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ralpert?v=info" title="Ron Alpert on Facebook" target="_blank">Ron Alpert</a> Co-Founder of <a href="http://www.headcasegames.com/">Headcase Games</a> has a New App out for the Iphone.

<p style="padding-left:60px;">You will
have to think quick In the action-puzzler 180.Â  You must flip, shoot,
and match combos before the wall of coins can crush you. <br />
Each piece on the gameboard has 2 sides.Â  Touch any coin to flip it 180
degrees. Tap in the empty area to shoot your next coin. Shoot to
connect 3 or more of the same front-side color to clear. <br />

			<description><![CDATA[  <p>Welcome to Episode 73 of Geek Tech Live! In this episode I talk about</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003COZM2C?tag=apture-20">Archos 7</a> Android poweredÂ  Tablet</li><li>Augmented Relality for Android by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNtpWm_6Dqk">Tagwhat</a> service</li><li>Learn Android Development at home with <a href="http://www.edumobile.org/">EduMobile.org</a> <br /></li><li>My Favorite Wordpress Plugin. <a href="http://www.apture.com/">Apture</a>!</li></ul><h2>The Archos 7 Android Powered Tablet is finally here.</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;"><a href="http://www.trendygadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/archos7_ambiance.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:left;"><img src="http://www.trendygadget.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/archos7_ambiance.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="The New Archos 7 Internet Media Tablet | TRENDY GADGET" alt="" height="154" width="267" /></a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">So, If
you were a hold out and Said " I dont want an Ipad, Android is for me"
well your wait is over. The ARchos 7 is here and it is bringin a big
game changer to the tablet market. Not only is it Android powered but
it also is priced at half the cost of a similarly decked out Ipad.Â 
Here are the Specs:</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">Up to 44
hours of Music playback, weighing in at 0.8 pounds and equipped with
8GB of Flash Memory. It comes pre-installed with a few apps like Aldiko
for book reading, eBuddy for IM and DailyPaper. It's only Wi-Fi but the
price cant be beat at $199.99! The Archos 7 also has USB ports for
syncing with other devices. You can now Pre-order the device at Amazon
right now!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003COZM2C?tag=apture-20"> Click here to get your Pre-Order on! </a> <br /></p>
<h2>Augmented Reality App by TagWhat Service</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">TagWhat is a new Service that is now Available for Android ( and IPhone) that will take your social Networking to a new level.</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">In essence TagWhat will take<a href="http://static.intomobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/tagwhatandroid.jpg" style="padding:0px 6px;float:right;"><img src="http://static.intomobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/tagwhatandroid.jpg" style="border:0px none;" title="tagwhatandroid Tagwhat joins ..." alt="" height="224" width="149" /></a>
your current Social networking apps like Foursquare, etc.. and wrap
them in a nice Augmented Reality blanket all snugly and warm. Users can
show the location they are at and then post snippets of their thoughts
about that location. When you look at a view of a street where someone
has posted that snippet TagWhat then overlays that information in an
augmented reality view. pretty awesome really. Augmented Reality is
still very new and it will definitely need some on-boarding by larger
audiences to really catch on but this is definitely a great step in the
right direction. Retailers are looking at Augmented Reality as a way to
leverage more sales as they can post sales of their products and even
prices updated immeditely online. You could walk past a clothe store
and find out if jeans were on sale and possibly even search inventory
to see if they had your size in stock. All without even walking in the
front door! Now that is pretty cool!</p><p style="padding-left:60px;">Â </p><p style="padding-left:60px;">Â </p>
<h2>Learn Android Development At home with EDUmobile.org</h2>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">If you
now have the Bug to write your own Android app but dont have the time
to go back to school or Take night classes then EDUmobile.org may be
your ticket to success! EDU Mobile released a press release recently
stating the following:</p>
<p style="padding-left:60px;">"EDUmobile.ORG

<p style="padding-left:60px;">
</p><h2>My Favorite new Plug-in, Apture for Wordpress and other Blogs too!</h2>
<blockquote> <p>I came across <a href="http://www.apture.com/">Apture</a> for my Blog GeekTechLive.com while on <a href="http://dannybrown.me/">Danny Browns</a> Website. He uses it there and actually just posted a blog entry on <a href="http://dannybrown.me/2010/05/07/17-wordpress-plugins-blog/">his favorite Wordpress Plug-ins</a>.Â  Apture is just extremely easy to use and very cool to see in action.Â  I can link things like <a href="http://twitter.com/geektechlive">my Twitter stream</a>
and if you click on that link it will take you to Twitter.com but if
you hover over the little icon next to it you will see my actual
twitter updates pop up in a little window. How cool is that! now you
can check my updates and not have to leave GeekTechLive.com.Â  Oh, and
the bar you see at the top of my Blog as you scroll? yes that is Apture
too! you can share anything you see on my site now very easily by just
using those links I am providing to you via Apture. If you have a Blog

			<description><![CDATA[ <h2>Doctor Who Sonic Screwdriver for 11th Doctor <br /></h2>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><img src="http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/front/d7d8_doctor_who_new_sonic_screwdriver.gif" class="alignleft" style="margin:5px;" title="Sonic Screwdriver Doctor Who" alt="Sonic Screwdriver Doctor Who" align="left" height="156" width="82" /></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">So, you may have already guessed that I
am a little bit of a Doctor Who fan. Well I finally bit the bullet and
ordered my very own Sonic Screwdriver from <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/collectibles/d7d8/" title="ThinkGeek.com" target="_blank">Thinkgeek.com</a>.Â 
I have always wanted my very own Sonic Screwdriver and now I have one.
Unfortunately, the screwdriver must be broken as I cant get it to open
any locked doors or start up my lawnmower or even loosen some stuck
screws.. sigh. Thinkgeek did respond via twitter to me and said they
would send someone over in a TARDIS to get me a working model or fix
the one I have so I have been waiting as I didnt specify a time to show
up and it could be weeks ago or from now before they arrive. If you
want one of your own, <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/geektoys/collectibles/d7d8/" title="Doctor Who Sonic Screwdriver" target="_blank">head on over to Thinkgeek.com and pick one up.</a> <br /></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"> <br /></p>
<h2>WOWee ONE Adds depth to portable Music <br /></h2>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">Ok, so you want a little better sound
from your portable Music player? Maybe want to add a subwoofer? Well,
the Wowee ONE may be your ticket to Subwoofer Nirvana.<img src="http://www.WOWeeOne.com/images/new/front/wowee-4.jpg" class="alignright" style="margin:5px;" title="WOWee ONE" alt="WOWee ONE" align="right" height="173" width="304" /></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The Wowee ONE is being billed as "the
most innovative, pocket-sized, rechargeable speaker for mobile devices,
iPods, laptops, iPhones, netbooks, iPads and personal game systems.". </p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">The WOWee One boasts a dynamic response
range of 40Hz - 20KHz and reaches 90 decibels yet weighs only 7 ounces.
The unit measures just 4.7" by 2.4" by 1", ideal for a pocket, handbag,
backpack, or glove compartment, so it's always handy.</p>
<h2>Healthy Android Apps for your Weight loss regime</h2>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">I found three Top Notch Android apps that will help you lose weight as well as keep track of your fitness goals.</p><p style="padding-left:30px;">The first is called <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-wsl-cardiotrainer-ray_feature-itp.aspx" target="_blank" title="CardioTrainer + Racing">CardioTrainer + Racing</a>Â 
($2.99)Â  It combines a racing application to try to beat your own best
times with a Motivational feature such as virtual racing simulator. In
addition to the racing module you can add in a weight loss app that
will set you back an additional $2.99</p><p style="padding-left:30px;"><img src="http://cdn.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/android-health-1.jpg" alt="" title="CardioTrainer + Racing" class="alignnone" height="272" width="181" /><img src="http://cdn.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/android-health-2.jpg" alt="" title="CardioTrainer" class="alignnone" height="270" width="180" /></p><p style="padding-left:30px;">The Second is called <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-concretesoftware-caloriecounter_full-jqtC.aspx" target="_blank" title="Fast Food Calorie Counter">Fast Food Calorie Counter</a>
and it shoudl cover you for ALL possible segue's off your weight loss
program.Â  This app has over 9000 items from 72 fast food restaurants.
it will give you calories, carbs, fat, protein and fiber for every
item. Very cool.</p><p style="padding-left:30px;">Teaming up with this
app is a full featured app that covers all the rest that the Fast Food
Calorie Counter doesnt hit. Its called <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-fatsecret-android-jqpD.aspx" target="_blank" title="Calorie Counter by FatSecret">Calorie Counter by FatSecret</a>Â  and it has it all. Best yet its FREE.  <br /></p><hr size="2" width="100%" /> <p>Â Well

			<description><![CDATA[  <p>Welcome to the Midweek spectacular for Geek Tech Live! This is Episode 71. In this episode I talk about:</p>
<ul><li>Boxee.tv brings a box of boxiness.</li><li>Frindie tells you who is listening to backstreet boys on Twitter.</li><li>TatMash lets you get that unicorn tat without shame or retribution.</li></ul><h2 style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://offers.mevio.com/show/geektech.html"><img src="http://static.podshow.com/CampaignAssets/GoDaddy/GoDaddy_Logo_URL_300x200.gif" alt="godaddy URL logo" style="margin:7px;" class="alignleft" title="godaddy URL logo" align="left" height="200" width="300" /></a> <br /></h2><h2 style="text-align:center;">Geek Tech Live is proud to be able to bring you some great discounts at Godaddy !</h2> <p>Godaddy coupon codes Offered are as follows:</p> <address><b>GTL1 </b>= 10% off any order not already discounted</address> <address><b>GTL2</b> = $5 off any order of $30 or more on any item not already discounted</address> <address><b>GTL3</b> = Register a .Com name for $7.49</address> <address><b>GTL20H</b> = 20% off Hosting plans</address> <address><b>GTLSSL</b> = Get a SSL certificate for $12.99 each!</address><address> <br /></address>
<h2><a href="http://www.boxee.tv/box" target="_blank" title="boxee box">Boxee Box</a> is Coming!</h2>
<blockquote> <p><img src="http://www.boxee.tv/htdocs/images/logged_out/boxee-box-front.jpg" alt="Boxee Box" title="Boxee Box" class="alignright" align="right" height="216" width="320" />Oh
yes. if you are at all familiar with streaming media over the network
from Hulu or Netflix you are gonna love this. Up until now <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/box" target="_blank" title="boxee box">Boxee.tv</a>Â 
had just a small download that turned your PC or Mac or even Apple TV
into a streamin media magnet. But in Quarter 2 of 2010 Boxee will be
unveiling the Boxee Box the single most coolest hardware device since
the Roku was made available to the masses a few years ago. I loved my
Roku and i still have it and use it today. Boxee box seems to take it
to the next level though. Here are the basic specs:</p><ul><li>HDMI</li><li>Optical Audio</li><li>RCA Stereo Audio</li><li>WiFi (802.11n)</li><li>Ethernet</li><li>2 USB Ports</li><li>SD Card Slot</li><li>RF Remote</li><li>QWERTY Keyboard</li></ul> <p>The remote with the QWERTY keyboard built in really is cool and the
design of the Boxee Box is slick as well. If I can get my hands on a
demo model for review I will definitely let you all know what I think.
Until that happens we all have to wait for a few more months before we
can buy one. No price as far as I can see has been decided on for the
Boxee Box. I sure hope its as affordable as it is awesome looking.</p></blockquote>


<h2><a href="http://theindie.biz/" target="_blank" title="TheIndie.biz">TheIndie.biz</a> Launches <a href="http://www.theindie.biz/users/friendie" target="_blank" title="Frindie">Frindie</a>, A Social Music Application for everyone</h2>
<blockquote> <p><img src="http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2010/04/25/2981054/Frindie2.jpg" style="margin:7px;" alt="theindie.biz Frindie" title="theindie.biz Frindie" class="alignleft" align="left" height="159" width="167" />TheIndie.biz
Launched a new Social media experience that will allow you to enhance
your music listening by finding out what their friends on major social
media networks are listening to or buying to listen to.
Facebook,Google,Myspace and Twitter are all covered a well as Yahoo,
Bebo and Friendfeed.Â  The <a href="http://www.theindie.biz/users/friendie" target="_blank" title="Frindie">Frindie</a>
application is a tool that hooks into these social media avenues and
will allow with just one click of a button the ability to view how many
and of which of their friends listened to, bought, shared etc.. a
particular song.Â  This spin on this one is that its not a bunch of
strangers telling you what they like this is your friends that are
letting you into the inside scoop on their listening habits, likes and
dislikes.Â  The cool thing with Frindie is that it allows bands as well
as fans to fully maximize the social networking experience. This tool
will help people find new and interesting music to listen to. What
better way to find music you will like and the likelihood of music you
will like if you are getting those listening recommendations from your
own circle of friends? I would say you are looking at a definitely cool
new tool for finding and expanding your current music likes.Â  On top of
all this sharing Frindie will also let you search for music based on
the standard Categories and GroupsÂ  as well. Maybe, you will even make
some new musical friends along the way and that is never a bad thing.
To quote the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation "Share and Enjoy!".</p></blockquote>
<h2><a href="http://tatmash.com/" target="_blank" title="http://tatmash.com">TatMash.com</a> Allows you to try out the Tat before you buy the ink.</h2>
<blockquote> <p><img src="http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2010/04/20/3217014/gI_Tatmash3step.png.jpg" alt="tatmash.com" title="tatmash.com" class="alignright" align="right" height="133" width="250" />So,
here is an interesting concept.Â  You think to yourself, man I wish I
had a cool Tattoo but what shoudl I get? and If I do choose thatÂ 
twelve in tall papa Smurf on my chest, what will it really look like?
Well, now you can get the ink with no remorse and no retribution from
friends by heading over to <a href="http://tatmash.com/" target="_blank" title="http://tatmash.com">Tatmash.com</a>.
Tatmash.com now has an online tool that will allow you to pick a spot
that you would like to have a tattoo on and then choose from a
multitude of designs to apply to the area.Â  All this can be done with
no needles no ink and a lot less alcohol, ok well you can still have
the alcohol but in the end when you wake up the next day instead of a
regret you will have a cool picture of you sporting a tattoo that you
luckily didn't get.Â  For the rest of you TatMash.com is a great way to
plan ahead for your next design. figure out if things look good before
you go to the artist and even print out your thoughts to take with you
to the shop. All in all its a very cool idea and definitely made me ask
"Why didn't I think of that?!?". So check out <a href="http://tatmash.com/" title="http://tatmash.com" target="_blank">Tatmash.com</a> and give yourself and your loved ones some ink!.</p></blockquote>

			<description><![CDATA[  <p> <br /></p> <p>Welcome to Episode 70 of Geek Tech Live! in this episode I am going to chat about:</p>
<ul><li>DVDFab 7.x gets released the same day as Avatar and the new BD+ ... coincedence? I thinks not!</li><li>Wanna be Iron Man? well UK Iron Man 2 site will let you</li><li>Twiends builds twitter communities with some incentives</li></ul> <p> <br /></p>
<h3><font size="3">DVDFab 7.x is released on the same day at Avatar on Blu-ray with stronger BD+ and defeats it!</font></h3>
<blockquote><blockquote> <p><img src="http://www.mevio.com/scripts/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/images/spacer.gif" alt="%3Cobject%20width%3D%22560%22%20height%3D%22340%22%3E%3Cparam%20name%3D%22movie%22%20value%3D%22http%3A//www.youtube.com/v/-k3Ye7VmCG0%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26%22%3E%3C/param%3E%3Cparam%20name%3D%22allowFullScreen%22%20value%3D%22true%22%3E%3C/param%3E%3Cparam%20name%3D%22allowscriptaccess%22%20value%3D%22always%22%3E%3C/param%3E%3Cembed%20src%3D%22http%3A//www.youtube.com/v/-k3Ye7VmCG0%26hl%3Den_US%26fs%3D1%26%22%20type%3D%22application/x-shockwave-flash%22%20allowscriptaccess%3D%22always%22%20allowfullscreen%3D%22true%22%20width%3D%22560%22%20height%3D%22340%22%3E%3C/embed%3E%3C/object%3E" class="mceItemFlash" align="left" height="273" width="449" /> Avatar was released on April 23rd and on the Same day <a href="http://www.dvdfab.com/" target="_blank" title="DVDFab Website">DVDFab 7.x</a>
was released to allow you to back that disk up! DVDFab 7.x will
automatically support the newer BD+ security because DVD Fab uses web
services to support BD+ on the server side of things so you get the
support without having to update the software! everyone wins! Making
backups of your movies saves you the cost of having to buy another disk
after your dog decides its a great chew toy. trust me on that. <br /></p></blockquote></blockquote>
<h3><font size="3">Even if your last name isn't Stark you can still be Iron Man</font></h3>
<blockquote><blockquote> <p><img src="http://www.ubergizmo.com/photos/2010/4/iron-man-2-ar-2.jpg" alt="Iron Man Two AR" style="margin:5px 8px;" title="Iron Man Two AR" class="alignleft" align="left" height="171" width="234" />The <a href="http://www.iamironman2.com/uk/" target="_blank" title="Iron Man 2 Augmented Reality">UK Iron Man 2 site</a>
has out done themselves this time.Â  If youc ant wait until the movie
comes out or just want to impress your friends and tell them you might
be related to Tony Stark from an unknown relative this is the site.
After you download a small add on for Mac or PC you turn on your web
cam andÂ  Iron Man or War Machine can be your face. I just love these
types of sites. its a great way to play around and pretend to be Iron
Man or whoever the Augmented Reality persona is. The fact that it is
Iron Man just seals the deal for me. The only other cool one I would
love to see is a Spider-Man AR website. That would be awesome! and come
to think of it. did James Cameron miss out on this? I don't remember
any Avatar Augmented reality websites out there when the movie hit
theaters. I cant believe Mr Cameron didn't want to do this.
UberGizmo.com has a great write of the site as well so don't take my
word for it <a href="http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2010/04/turn_yourself_into_iron_man_via_augmented_reality.html" target="_blank" title="UberGizmo Iron Man 2 Post">read UberGizmo's post </a> <br /></p></blockquote></blockquote> <p> <br /></p>
<h3><font size="3">Will you be My Twiend?</font></h3>
<blockquote><blockquote> <p><a href="http://www.twiends.com/"><img src="http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2010/04/21/3909394/gI_0_0_twiendslogo.jpg" alt="Twiends.com" title="Twiends.com" class="alignleft" align="left" height="193" width="250" /></a></p> <p>Yes I said be my "Twiend". <a href="http://www.twiends.com/" target="_blank" title="twiends.com">Twiends.com</a>
is a Social Media Community building application. its based on the
credit and incentive system at its heart. You buy credits and then when
people follow you they get a certain number of credits to their name.
the more credits they have then means more people will follow them and
get those credits passed down to them and so on, and so on. You dont
need to buy any credits so don't put this off because of the nature of
my last sentence.Â  Twiends will give you intros for free but credits
will speed up the process. The more credits you have though the more
exposure you get on the site and of course that should translate into
more followers on twitter. They have a ranking system to tell you if
you share interests or share some of the same followers. Its all very
intuitive and easy to learn and use. <a href="http://www.twiends.com/" target="_blank" title="twiends.com">Head on over to Twiends.com</a>
and see for yourself. In my opinion this is a neat little idea and
definitely will build little communities and build twitter audiences
and your reach into the twitterverse. </p></blockquote></blockquote> <p><b><font size="3">Godaddy Savings for listeners.</font></b></p><blockquote><blockquote> <p>Godaddy coupon codes Offered by Geek Tech Live are as follows:</p><address style="padding-left:60px;"><b>GTL1 </b>= 10% off any order not already discounted</address><address style="padding-left:60px;"><b>GTL2</b> = $5 off any order of $30 or more on any item not already discounted</address><address style="padding-left:60px;"><b>GTL3</b> = Register a .Com name for $7.49</address><address style="padding-left:60px;"><b>GTL20H</b> = 20% off Hosting plans</address><address style="padding-left:60px;"><b>GTLSSL</b> = Get a SSL certificate for $12.99 each!</address> <p>GoDaddyÂ  is the #1 choice for Domain hosting and SSL services.

It gets weirder. <br /></p><blockquote> <p>Right
now we don't have a ton of info on the device in question, but we can
tell you that it apparently has a front facing camera (!), 80GB of
storage (weird, right?), and isn't booting at this point (though it was
previously, and running an OS that was decidedly new). It's not clear
if this is definitely a production model, or just a prototype that
found its way into the world, but it's certainly a compelling design,
no matter how you look at it.</p></blockquote> <p>and to top it all off? this is the latest update from Engadget!</p><blockquote> <p> this looks almost exactly like a <a href="http://twitpic.com/14ge1m" title="http://twitpic.com/14ge1m">Twitpic posted by TUDream on February 20th</a>,
It's low-res, shows an indiscriminate bit of the inside, and some
mysterious button / possible SIM slot in the middle of the other side.
The mic holes on this pic seems to be larger, too.</p></blockquote> <p>I think crazy town just let out... what do you think? <br /></p> ]]></description>

buy or even think of buying an overdrive the case itself is rather well
put together. I am sure you could find a use for that extra pocket.</p> <p> <br /></p> <p> <br /></p> <p> <br /></p> <p>Â </p> <p>Â </p> <p>Â </p>

you know I am a big espresso drinker. I really love this device. its a
portable Espresso machine you can take anywhere! for only $170 bucks
you really cant argue with the quality or value you are getting.</p> <p> <br /></p> <p> <br /></p> <p> <br /></p> <p>Â </p> <p>Â </p> <p>Â </p>

<address> <br /></address>
 <p>So what do we have here this week? Well I have decided to change up
the format of the show a bit and shorten things down to smaller nuggets
of wisdom. Todays Technology news and some cool geek info all in little
bite sized nuggets for your brains. (no I am not a zombie) </p>
<h3>The Worlds Smallest, Lightest, and Toughest True HD Field Monitor the DP-SLR by SmallHD.</h3>
 <p><img src="http://www.smallhd.com/DPSLR_Hand.jpg" alt="" title="smallhd DPSLR" class="alignnone" height="556" width="596" /> <br /></p>
 <p>While I was recording the show the price was unveiled for this truly awesome device.</p>
 <p>the 5.6â diagonal, 1280x800 resolution display delivers 270 pixels per inch Starting at $899</p>
 <p>This device will be a great step forward for HDSLR filmaking and
other high end broadcasting.Â  they will be at NAB in VegasÂ  on April
12th. at NAB Booth# C11124</p>
 <p>Product Details Available April 12th at <br /><a href="http://www.smallhd.com/" target="_blank" title="SmallHD.com">http://www.smallhd.com/</a> <br /></p>
<h3>DVDVideoSoft Launches Free YouTube to DVD Converter</h3>
 <p><img src="http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2010/04/08/233899/gI_YouTubeToDVDConverterBig.png.jpg" alt="" title="DVDVideoSoft YouTube to DVD converter" class="alignnone" height="192" width="250" /></p> <p>Well
yes Virginia, we do make interesting programs. At least its free! now
you can burn those YouTube Videos you like to a DVD and send the dvd to
friends who live under a rock or in a cave. <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/04/prweb3850874.htm" target="_blank" title="DVDVideoSoft You tube to dvd Converter">read the full story here.</a> <br /></p>
<h3>Coming from Alien Technology: MakrolonÂ® will save all Stadia in the world!</h3>
 <p><img src="http://ww1.prweb.com/prfiles/2010/04/08/3852774/gI_0_BayArenaLeverkusen.JPG.jpg" alt="" title="stadium picture makrolon mockup" class="alignnone" height="167" width="250" /> <br /></p> <p>Thats
at least how it reads to me. this stuff is the stuff everything else is
made of. its like the stuff that the food replicators in star trek used
to create any type of food only this stuff can make stadiums. well, if
you are in New York from April 26th thru the 28th and you can get into
the International Stadia Design &amp; Technology Expo 2010 drop me a
line and maybe some pictures.</p>
<h3>The Owl Box! now in Ustream Goodness!</h3>
 <p><img src="http://blog.makezine.com/theowlbox.jpg" alt="" title="The Owl Box" class="alignnone" height="356" width="482" /> <br /></p> <p>If you love birds and especial Owls then you need to check this live camera out! <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/theowlbox" target="_blank" title="The Owl Box Stream">The Owl Box</a>
is a live feed of a few baby barn Owls being born and now growing up.
it is the most awesome display of Internet and Nature EVER! A Great
Article was written about it at <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2010/04/owl_nest_web_cam.html" target="_blank" title="Makezine.com Owl Box">Makezine.com</a></p> <p>Well,
Thats it! I hope you liked the shorter more fun format! I Will be back
really soon with more Geek Nuggets to pass along to you.</p> <p> <br /></p>

<h3>Introspective on the IPad!</h3>
 <p><a href="http://geektechlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Dont-Panic.png"><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Dont-Panic-200x300.png" alt="hhgttg Ipad" title="Don't Panic" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-567" height="300" width="200" /></a> <br /></p> <p>I
go into detail on the IPad and my thoughts on the release day as well
as make a startling discovery about myself. Listen in on my own
internal debate. How Close is the Ipad to Douglas Adams "Hitchhikers
Guide" and more. <br /></p>
<h3>Wordpress 3.0 Beta <br /></h3>
 <p>I <a href="http://geektechlive.com/2010/04/wordpress-3-0-beta-released/" target="_blank" title="Wordpress 3.0 Beta">blogged about the Wordpress 3.0 Beta</a>
release a day ago and now I talk about the pros and Cons of the
Wordpress Multi User addition and compare it to Dot Net Nuke (DNN).Â 
Full URL to Post here: <a href="http://geektechlive.com/2010/04/wordpress-3-0-beta-released/" target="_blank" title="Wordpress 3.0 Beta">http://geektechlive.com/2010/04/wordpress-3-0-beta-released/</a> <br /></p>
<h3>Easy Way to preiew an IPhone and soon Ipad App.</h3>
 <p>I you are like me you scrutinize every Iphone purchase since those
99 cent charges can add up. Well, now you can have someone else spend
their money and tell you what the app REALLY does before you buy it.Â  <a href="http://geektechlive.com/2010/04/the-easiest-way-to-demo-an-iphone-or-ipad-app/" target="_blank" title="iphone app demos">My Blog Article at geektechlive.com</a>Â Â  tells you all the nitty gritty as well as the link to <a href="http://iphoneappdemos.tv/" target="_blank" title="iphoneappdemos.tv">http://iphoneappdemos.tv/</a> <br /></p>
<h3>Make mine <strike>Marvel</strike> Ipad?Maybe Not. <br /></h3>
 <p>Every since Marvel was bought out by Disney I have been keeping my
eye on them before they turn into the Multiheaded Hydra that is Disney.
I assume it starts with some sort of Bite like a Vampire then Disneys
Fangs slowly drain the life force from their intended victims replacing
it with unicorns and rainbows and incessant looping music on how its a
very small world after all. </p> <p>OK, <a href="http://geektechlive.com/2010/04/marvel-on-the-ipad-awesomeness-ensues/" target="_blank" title="Marvel on Ipad">Initial speculation by me</a> in a blog post,
on the IPad having Marvel Comics on it may have been a bit too soon. I
dive back into the dark recesses of my brain to talk about the
evolution of the Comic and how the IPad could kill off Comic books...
the real tangible paper comics that I know and love and collect. </p> <p>Ok, that is all everyone. Have a happy Week and I will see you soon.

 <p>So, Most of you by now know I am a bit of a salt water fish nut.Â  I
tweeted my new 120 Gallon in wall tank build I am doing a few days
ago.Â  I want to pull the trigger on a neptune systems Aquacontroller
for the tank. This little black box not only will allow you to monitor
your temperature and pH of the water but also control up to 200+ pumps
or wave machines or what have you. Now here is where the gadgety
goodness come in. The controller has a built in Web server! Yes you can
monitor your tank remotely anywhere where there is Internet and a
browser. and it will even send you emails if there is any issue!Â  Oh
God I am such a Dork! Here are the nitty gritty details of the Neptune
Aquacontroller.</p>
 <p>System Includes:</p>
<ul><li>1 - Apex Base Unit</li><li>1 - Apex Display</li><li>1 - EnergyBar 8 Power Strip</li><li>1 - Temperature Probe</li><li>1 - Standard Grade pH Probe</li></ul> <p>CONNECTIVITY</p>
<ul><li>Ethernet Interface</li><li>Embedded Web Server</li><li>Only controller with web browser Monitoring, Control &amp; Configuration.</li><li>Email Alarms</li></ul> <p>EXPANDABILITY</p>

<h3>WD World book 2TB Home storage Solution.</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.wdc.com/en/images/products/MBWE/MBWENetworkdiagram.jpg" class="aligncenter" title="WD world book 2TB drive map" alt="" width="450" height="229" /></p>
 <p>I had the opportunity to set up and test out a My World Book 2TB
Home storage solution by Western Digital. It comes with a built in
Ethernet port as well as some cool features. The 2TB size will cover
even the most demanding Anal Retentive backup aficionado while all you
mac users out there can now use Time Machine on it so it does double
duty.</p>
 <p><img src="http://www.wdc.com/en/images/products/mbwe/MBWEconnections.jpg" class="alignleft" title="WD world edition 2TB" alt="" width="256" height="256" />This
Hard Drive that could really can. From my limited testing so far (I am
setting this up for a friend) I can tell you this much. This drive has
features. not only is it a USB attachable drive but it also has an
Ethernet port so it can go directly on your network as a Network
Attached Storage Device. It can act as a Media Streamer as well as
Automatically backing up your windows and Mac on your network.</p>
 <p>The cool thing about the 1 gigabit Ethernet port is that if you have
wireless( and who doesn't except tech Luddites? ) your 2TB drive is
fully accessible while you roam your house!</p>
 <p>In Playing around in the Admin web interface I found that you can
schedule downloads directly from the device. The location can be a URL
or a torrent file location for easy download-ability. So you can
effectively offload all downloading to this little device and leave
your PC for more fun things like games and Facebook farming. All in all
this Networking storage solution seems to have it all and the price
wont hurt your wallet either at under $300 buck at most retailers. I
saw it for as low as $275 at Amazon as of this writing. So if you are
looking for a cool little device to store all those pictures or
recipies or what have you. I think this definitely fits the bill. For
more information check out the <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.asp?driveid=587" title="WD  My Book World edition site" target="_blank">WD website</a>.</p>
<h3>IPad Sellout?</h3>
 <p>No, I didn't pre-purchase one but I would be remiss if I didn't talk
about this. As of yesterday while I was enjoying coffee and banter with
some friends Mashable.com posted an article stating that the IPad
actually sold out for opening day. Estimates are 500k have been sold
thus far sight unseen or touched or even looked at other than in Steve
jobs hands. I just have to say this: Unbelieveable. I am an early
adopter but really, if I cant see one or touch one I wait a little bit.</p>

<h3><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Blackberry OS 6.0 first looks</font></h3>
 <p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Some initial and very possible real leaked images came out recently
concerning blackberry 6.0 OS looks. From what I can see they really are
gunning for an Android like look and feel . There was also a rumor
about a possible slider phone from RIM recently as well. Could this new
Phone and OS combo be a reality? <a href="http://www.bbleaks.com/2010/03/first-live-images-of-os-60.html" target="_blank" title="bbleaks.com OS 6.0">Bbleaks.com</a> has an article as well as a bunch of related articles can be found at <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/100319/p17#a100319p17" target="_blank" title="techmeme.com BB OS 6.0">Techmeme.com</a> on this.</font></p> <p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> <br /></font></p>

has broke the news on the spring update for all your Xbox 360 owners.
This spring after the update happens you will be able to use USB mass
storage devices to save an load game data. Live arcade games DLC and
Games on demand will all be able to be held on the separate USB
device.Â  With Game data taking up more and more space every year. This
is a great update that everyone will be happy to see implemented. I can
also see Microsoft selling Xbox Branded USB devices which of course
will only expand their current line up of hardware for the Xbox 360.</font></p> <p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">via <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2010/03/18/xbox-360-gaining-usb-storage-support-in-2010-update/" title="Joystiq.com Xbox USB" target="_blank">JoyStiq.com</a> <br /></font>

you have heard me talking about my new fish tank build. well that has
taken a big step forward but took most of the weekend. I am now behind
schedule for the week but trying to catch up fast. If you hear my voice
crackle a bit the fumes from the PVC cement really did a number on me
sneezing and coughing most of today. <br /></p>

<h3><b>SXSW </b> <br /></h3>
 <p>South by Southwest, or<a href="http://sxsw.com/" target="_blank" title="sxsw"> SXSW</a>
for all the cool kids is THE event for Music, Movies and
interactive/social media. I have seen tweets from all the major players
in attendance. I think that next year I will be going to Comic-con AND
SXSW. from what I have seen online and heard in the twitstream it
really looks awesome! To quote SXSW.com telling what the gathering is :</p><blockquote> <p>Year
after year, the event is a launching pad for new creative content. New
media presentations, music showcases and film screenings provide
buzz-generating exposure for creators and compelling entertainment for
audiences. Conference panel discussions present a forum for learning,
business activity thrives at the Trade Shows and global networking
opportunities abound. Austin serves as the perfect backdrop for SXSWÂ®,
where career development flourishes amid the relaxed atmosphere.
Intellectual and creative intermingling among industry leaders
continues to spark new ideas and carve the path for the future of each
ever-evolving field, long after the events' conclusion.</p></blockquote><p style="text-align:left;">via <a href="http://sxsw.com/" target="_blank" title="sxsw">SXSW.com</a> <br /></p>
<h3><b>Tetris Chair</b></h3>
 <p>UberGizmo had a cool if not albeit uncomfortable chair in the shape
of Tetris tiles. A Mexican Industrial Designer named Gabriel Canas
designed the chair for all us geeks out there. No price is set on the
chair or if it will be sold at all. but still it IS pretty cool.</p> <p><img src="http://www.ubergizmo.com/photos/2010/3/tetris-chair.jpg" alt="" title="tetris chair" class="alignnone" height="530" width="468" /></p> <p>Now I just need a Galaga end table and Qbert TV tables and I would be set!</p><p style="text-align:left;">via <a href="http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2010/03/tetris_chair_does_not_look_too_comfy.html" target="_blank" title="Ubergizmo Tetris chair">UberGizmo.com</a> <br /></p>
<h3><b>More Portal 2 Info</b></h3>
 <p><a href="http://www.vg247.com/2010/03/07/portal-2-gi-feature-gets-scanned-is-internetalised-looks-awesome/" target="_blank" title="vg247.com portal 2">VG247.com</a> has the scoop on Portal 2 and some more defined details of what the game will be about, where and when it takes place.</p> <p><img src="http://assets.vg247.com/current//2010/03/portal-2-logo.jpg" alt="" title="Portal 2" class="alignnone" height="165" width="405" /> <br /></p> <p>To quote VG247.com:</p><blockquote>
  <ul><li>The game takes place hundreds of years after the original. Hence why the Aperture centre looks a lot like a jungle possibly.</li><li>GlaDOS returns as the main villain, with the subject from the last game, Chell, coming back to be the protagonist.</li><li>The co-op campaign is separate from the main story in the game. It lets you play as two bipedal robots.</li><li>Those personality cores thrown into the fire at the end of the
last game? Theyâve shut off areas of the Aperture lab and made it their
own.</li><li>Physics has a bigger role this time, with one demo showing a
portal could be used from an air vent to suck air from one area to an
another.</li><li>Reflection cubes will be added to the game for laser-based puzzles.</li><li>Valve had no idea Portal 1 would be so big.</li><li>The original Portal was seen as a âtest bedâ. The sequel will be a fully fledged title.</li></ul></blockquote> <p>So there you have it! more info on the Portal 2 Game
soon to become reality. Lets all keep our fingers crossed and hope a
beta test group opens up for us to try it out.</p> <p>via <a href="http://www.vg247.com/2010/03/07/portal-2-gi-feature-gets-scanned-is-internetalised-looks-awesome/" target="_blank" title="vg247.com portal 2">VG247.com</a> <br /></p>
<h3>Disney Replaces Monorail with Tron Lightcycles!</h3>
 <p>Ok not really but still these shots I found at Collider.com are
truly getting me pumped up for the movie. If Only I could get my own
Lightcycle. If I do ever get one you will be the first to know. Thanks
Steve Weintraub of Collider.com for posting this shot! Love it! <br /></p> <p><img src="http://www.collider.com/wp-content/image-base/Clubhouse/T/Tron_Legacy/Monorail_disney/Disney%20Monorail%20Trains%20to%20Feature%20TRON%20LEGACY%20Art%20%281%29.jpg" alt="" title="Disney Tron Monorail" class="alignnone" height="186" width="529" /></p> <p>via <a href="http://www.collider.com/2010/03/10/disney-monorail-trains-to-feature-tron-legacy-light-cycles/" target="_blank" title="Disney Tron Lightcycle Monorail">Collider.com</a> <br /></p>
<h3>Ipad Preorders open the floodgates of Early Adopters</h3>
 <p>I like new tech. I really do. I even will buy some tech on preorder
if I can see or feel a demo unit of it or at least glimpse it behind a
glass box on a pedestal. I have unfortunately not been able to score an
Apple Ipad to review for testing purposes and I cant seem to find a
reasonable demo unit to play with either. Compared to the big boys like
Twit or crunch gear I am just some guy with a mic and a really great
Barry White smooth voice so I dont get the uber-cool gadgets to
review.... yet. to quote Anthony Dinozzo of NCIS " Working on it Boss!"
. </p> <p>All that being said, as I continue to see the early adoption sales peak past <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/100313/p8#a100313p8" target="_blank" title="IPad past 120k units presales">120k according to techmeme</a>
I am even more inclined to wait a bit. I think based on what I am
reading I will be leaning toward the 3G model as your not tied to a
commitment for the 3G. I do believe that there may be some issues with
the first generation Ipad as all new first generation devices are akin
to have. Articles like <a href="http://www.techmeme.com/100313/p26#a100313p26" target="_blank" title="Pc World Ipad pre-orders for idiots">PC World's " Ipad Pre-orders: for Idiots Only"</a>
really got me thinking how I want to spend my Discretionary Gadget
cash. I am not ruling out the fact I want one. but I also want the next
Iphone and I LOVE my Iphone. </p> <p>So, are you going to pre-order? have you already? which Ipad did you get? c'mon! dish! I really would love to know!</p> <p>links via <a href="http://techmeme.com/" target="_blank" title="techmeme.com">techmeme.com</a> <br /></p> <p>Well
that's it everyone. Happy St. Patty's Day and I will see you all in a
few days! You can always follow me on Twitter @Geektechlive or on

They are both 12.1 megapixel and have a 3" LCD screen viewfinder. they record video in 720p and have the ability to interchange lenses. the basic package will come with a 14 - 42mm F3.5 - 5.6 lens. the G2 adds a touchscreen that folds out and twists to allow for better viewing. the G10 is the more basic of the model geared to the beginner enthusiast.  no prices yet but the press release states more technical details such as: </p><blockquote>Other features of the LUMIX G2 include: â¢ Dust Reduction System: If dust or other foreign matter gets inside the camera when youâre changing lenses, it could cling to the image sensor and show up as a spot in your photos. The Dust Reduction System in the G2 helps eliminate this possibility by placing a supersonic wave filter in front of the Live MOS sensor. Vibrating vertically around 50,000 times per second, the filter repels dust and other particles effectively. â¢ Included Software: PHOTOfunSTUDIO 5.0 HD Edition makes it possible to sort and organize photos. Videos can be uploaded directly to YouTube using the built-in YouTube uploader â even in HD quality. It also lets you create a 360-degree rotation panorama file in .MOV files. The software is compatible with the Windows 7.  The Panasonic LUMIX G2 will come equipped as part of its kit, with the newly announced LUMIX G VARIO 14-42mm/F3.5-5.6 ASPH/MEGA O.I.S. lens. The new lens offers a versatile zoom range of 14-42mm (35mm camera equivalent: 28-84mm), making it suitable for a wide variety of scenes, everything from dynamic landscape to portrait. Additionally, the LUMIX G2 is compatible with all Micro Four Thirds System lenses, allowing users even higher levels of performance in a digital interchangeable lens camera.</blockquote> <p> To read the whole press release and even more info drop on over to <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/03/07/its-official-panasonic-g2-and-g10-press-release/" target="_blank" title="crunchgear G2 and g10 article">Crunchgear.com</a>  </p> <p>via <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/03/07/its-official-panasonic-g2-and-g10-press-release/" target="_blank" title="crunchgear G2 and g10 article">Crunchgear.com</a> </p><h2>Portal 2 is coming to you soon</h2> <img src="http://loot-ninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/portal_2.jpg" class="alignnone" alt="" title="portal 2" height="288" width="384" /><h6><i>Photo courtesy of <a href="http://loot-ninja.com/" target="_blank" title="http://loot-ninja.com/">http://loot-ninja.com/</a></i></h6> <p> For those of you who really fell in love with the game Portal your wait for a sequel will be over soon. Valve is going to be releasing Portal 2 and this time its a full game. Portal 2 will be released this fall and it is gonna rock!  There was a quote that was awesome while I was reading thru the internet articles on this.  "portal was a test bed. Portal 2 is a game" AWESOME! more info coming soon! </p> <p> via <a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/03/07/portal-2-in-game-informer-scanned-for-your-pleasure/" target="_blank" title="portal 2 at crunchgear.com">Crunchgear.com</a> </p><h2>Motorola Backflip review</h2> <p> <img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/4/2010/03/top.jpg" class="alignnone" alt="" title="backflip" height="213" width="361" /></p> <p> I came across this today in fact and had to link to this article.  Gizmodo did a fantastic  review of the Backflip AT&amp;T's first Android phone. The Review isn't pretty as this phone is not for the early adopters of new and exciting tech. The hardware is a bit outdated and really isnt any better than the Cliq. in the nuts and bolts of it.. its being sold as a budget smart-phone for the masses and it knows it. So, If you normally would not buy a smart-phone but still want to have smart-phone capabilities and are not looking for a rocket of a machine then this may be your ticket to the show. the breakdown of the phone is as follows: </p> <p> <b>pros</b> </p><ul><li>It's more functional than the messaging/feature phones it's attacking</li> 	<li>The backwards folding mechanism is surprisingly functional</li> 	<li>Android 2.1 to come</li> 	<li>Spacious keyboard</li> </ul><b>neutrals</b> <ul><li>Launch price too high, though it will probably fall</li> 	<li>The rear trackpad: great when the phone's unfolded, but useless when it's closed</li> </ul><b>cons</b> <ul><li>Ships with Android 1.5</li> 	<li>Resistive screen</li> 	<li>Underwhelming hardware specs</li> </ul> read more via <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5483788/motorola-backflip-review-not-for-us-but-maybe-for-them" target="_blank" title="Gizmodo.com backflip article">Gizmodo.com article</a> <h2>Microsoft's Courier.. Digital  journal... Ipad Killer?</h2> <p> <img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2010/03/03-05-10courier.jpg" class="alignnone" alt="" title="Microsoft's courier" height="356" width="470" /></p> <p>Oh My! well you probably saw my blog post I did yesterday when this story broke at <a href="http://techmeme.com" target="_blank" title="techmeme.com">Techmeme.com</a>. Well, I have to say that if this Courier actually does what the HD videos and the PIctures I saw over at <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/05/microsofts-courier-digital-journal-exclusive-pictures-and-de/" target="_blank" title="Engadget.com">Engadget.com</a> then we have a serious contender for Ipad early adopters.  This Courier has made me stop and think if I truly want to go Ipad or wait and see if Microsoft Delivers.  Check out the Article at Engadget.com and read all about it.  I am sure we will be seeing some kind of retort from Apple and Mr. Jobs soon about this new device. only downside is there is no date set for release of the Courier. </p> <p> via <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/05/microsofts-courier-digital-journal-exclusive-pictures-and-de/" target="_blank" title="Engadget.com courier">Engadget.com</a> </p><h2>Alice in Wonderland has a record breaking Opening weekend.</h2> <p> <img src="http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/deppalice.jpg" class="alignnone" alt="" title="Wonderland" height="190" width="260" /></p> <p>  I was unable to see it on opening weekend but even without my 12 bucks Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland Drew over 40 Million dollars in box office revenue. This is Burton's first ever 3D release to boot. Were you able to see it yet? what are your thoughts on the Movie and how was the 3D? </p> <p> via <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/03/07/alice-in-wonderland-box-office/" target="_blank" title="Alice in Wonderland at mashable.com">Mashable.com</a>  </p> <p>Well that's it for Episode 60 of GeekTech Live.

			<description><![CDATA[ <h1 style="text-align:center;">Welcome to Geek Tech Live 59</h1> I would first like to state my deepest sympathies for the people in Chile who are dealing with the earthquake aftermath. Mother Earth seems to be pissed right now. Lets hope we can help Gaia regain some balance and soon.  On this episode of Geek Tech Live I will be talking about <ul><li>Corsair SSD drives are released sooner than expected.</li> 	<li>DOD social media policy?</li> 	<li>6 More free Android apps that are cool.</li> </ul> This episode of Geek Tech Live is brought to you by <a href="http://godaddy.com" title="Godaddy.com">Godaddy.com</a> .  Want to start a new website or Blog? thinking of hosting that site somewhere with stellar up-time and customer service? Look no further than the Largest Registrar ever! Let me help you get started by offering you some <a href="http://offers.mevio.com/godaddy-coupon-code.html" target="_blank" title="Godaddy Offers from Geek Tech Live">great discounts for Godaddy.com services</a>. <h2><b>Corsair SSD drives are released sooner than expected.</b></h2> <p> <a href="http://hothardware.com/newsimages/Item12303/reactor--ssd.jpg"><img src="http://hothardware.com/newsimages/Item12303/reactor--ssd.jpg" class="alignnone" alt="" title="Corsair Reactor SSD" height="409" width="450" /></a>  </p> <p>Way sooner than expected Corsair released two offerings in the SSD category.  The New SSDs utilize JMicron JMF612 and Indilinx BarefootT controller technologies.  </p> <p>The Reactor Series, coming in 60GB and 120GB drive capacities, is built using a new JMicron JMF612 controller. This controller has 128MB of DDR2 cache memory built in. The 120GB Reactor SSD delivers speeds of up to 250MB/s read and 170MB/s write, while the 60GB Reactor SeriesSSD features speeds up to 250MB/s read and 110 MB/s write.  </p> <p>The Nova Series uses a Indilinx Barefoot controller with 64MB of cache memory, and come in sizes of 64GB and 128GB. The 128GB SSD is able to read at 270MB/second and write at 190MB/second , while the 64GB Nova Series SSD delivers speeds up to 270MB/s read and 130MB/s write. </p> <p> Both SSDs will support the TRIM command in Microsoft Windows 7 operating systems, which automatically maintains performance over the lifetime of the drives. </p> <p> This is where it is very interesting I was expecting these to not be available for a little while now but... The Reactor Series and Nova Series are available immediately from Corsair's authorized distributors and resellers worldwide and are backed by a Two-Year Limited Warranty.</p> <p>  Via <a href="http://hothardware.com/News/Corsair-Ships-Nova-And-Reactor-25-SSD-Lines/" title="Corsair SSD HotHardware.com">Hot Hardware.com</a> </p><h2>DOD social media policy?</h2> <p> For a long time now the Government has been struggling with how to deal with Social Media as a whole. Twitter and Facebook along with all the other major players can be seen as a large security hole as well as time waster by the Government.  In a recently release memo from the DOD the new directive requires military and defense agency leaders to make Internet capabilities via the militaryâs unclassified but sensitive network available across all of DOD.Until now, some leaders have prevented or severely limited such access.  </p> <p>The Memo really only details the importance of Social Media to the function of Government. It does nothing to actually enforce any specific guidelines. This memo is really just a first step to show that Social Media is a valid part of Government and also tie in the fact that Security is still the utmost priority for ANY data, most especially data transmitted over Social Media venues.</p> <p>  Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, invited followers on his <a href="http://www.facebook.com/admiralmikemullen?ref=nf" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> to view the new social media policy, demonstrating the value of the technology. </p> <p> Via <a href="http://fcw.com/Articles/2010/02/26/DOD-issues-new-directive-on-Internet-and-social-media-use.aspx?Page=1" title="DOD Social Media Policy">FCW.com</a> </p><h2>6 More free Android apps that are cool.</h2> <p> In my previous Podcasts  I covered a few Android apps that were free and cool. Well, here are six more free apps that are very cool and not found on the IPhone. </p> <p> <font size="3"><a href="http://betterandroid.wordpress.com/2010/02/03/open-home-v4-x-now-on-market/" target="_blank">OpenHome</a></font> </p> <p> OpenHome lets you fully customize your home screen/desktop.

			<description><![CDATA[ <p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Geek Tech Live Episode 55 </b></font></p><p align="center"><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/GeektechlogoNew.jpg" title="GTL logo" alt="GTL logo" width="246" height="240" />Â </p><p align="center"><font size="4"><b>Health Gadgets! </b></font></p><p align="left"><font size="2">Â So, I got a cold a few days ago and I had even lost my voice there for the last few days. I was worried about not being able to even record a podcast on schedule for this week. It got me to thinking about all the health related Gadgets that are out right now and so once my voice came back I grabbed a few gadgets to share with you all. Below are the list as they appear in the podcast: </font></p><p align="left"><font size="3"><a href="http://www.bodybugg.com/" title="bodybugg" target="_blank">Bodybugg.com</a></font></p><p align="left"><img src="http://my.apexfitness.com/images/myapex/bodybugg_unit.jpg" title="bodybugg" alt="bodybugg" width="175" height="95" /> <br />Â </p><p align="left"><font size="2">I talked a bit about this as my second episode of GeekTechLive.com was all about me using it. I signed up for a 14 week fitness training course at my local gym. part of the course wasto use the bodybugg to help lose weight and track progress.Â  Please listen to my original podcast back at episode 2 for all the details but I will say this. It definitely made losing the weight easy. </font></p><p align="left"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_9?url=search-alias%3Dhpc&amp;field-keywords=body+fat+scale&amp;sprefix=body+fat+" title="Body Fat Scales at Amazon"><font size="3">BodyFat Scales</font></a></p><p align="left"><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BRuBLRGlL._AA280_.jpg" title="body fat scales" alt="body fat scales" width="196" height="196" />Â </p><p align="left"><font size="2">I think these are great for checking your progress on a diet or excercise plan. they arent as precise as the body bugg style of trackers but they definitely should show your your progress on a daily basis. I had one i used for a long time and i definitely found them to be a good replacement after I stopped the body bugg program. the link above will take you to the amazon market place showing all the body fat scales available. </font> <br /></p><p align="left"><a href="http://www.epartyunlimited.com/healthcare-head-spa-massager.html" title="head spa"><font size="3">Head spa Massager</font></a></p><p align="left"><font size="2">What can I say?

Now go out there and make your mark! You cant say I didn't try to help.</p>  <p>  <br /> All right, So how much IPad Goodness do you think could be out right about now? It was only Last week that we were talking about the unveiling of the apple Tablet. Geek Tech Live is recorded on the weekends (except Special programs like last weeks RadNerd Interview). So this is a few days after the unveil and the mass effect of pandemonium it has done to the world. Did we survive? yah we didâ¦ was a it a game changer? I think a little yes and a little no. The Ipad wasn't some magical device like we were hearing. It isn't made from unicorns and creates its own rainbows. It does however have some very cool aspects of the device that make me want it. Lets see if I can explain in a bit more detail.Â  About 6 months ago I was almost going to buy a kindle. TheÂ  rumored Ipad, Islate, Itablet, etcâ¦ was seeming to be a long way off and well I just wanted to get a good e-reader to take with me to work for lunch time reading and when i am on vacation , etc. I did the research and almost did it. The kindle did everything I wanted it to do at the time and my Iphone was able to fill in the gaps quite well for anything else i wanted to do.Â  I am really glad I had second thoughts and waited for the apple Tablet unveiling. </p>  <p>  <br /> There have been a lot of people all whining about the Ipad and as the week progressed you also found out more rumors concerning next years possible Ipad additions like front facing video cameras, video calls, etcâ¦ I really don't care so much about those rumors since it is apples job in my mind to continue to innovate. if they stop doing that then there will not be anything more than what we have today in technology. you cant fault them for holding back a few extra goodies for the revision two of the Ipad that is just goo business if you ask me, even if it still annoys the hell out of me.  <br /> So what do we know about the current Revision 1 of the IPad.Â  here are the basic specs for the Ipad courtesy of the Apple websites:</p>  <p> <img src="http://images.apple.com/ipad/specs/images/dimensions_20100127.jpg" alt="Ipad Image" title="Ipad Image" width="532" height="350" /> <br /> <br /> Size and weight <br /> Height:Â  9.56 inches (242.8 mm) <br /> <br /> Width:Â Â  7.47 inches (189.7 mm) <br /> <br /> Depth:Â Â  0.5 inch (13.4 mm) <br /> <br /> Weight:Â Â  1.5 pounds (0.68 kg) Wi-Fi model; <br /> Â Â Â  1.6 pounds (0.73 kg) Wi-Fi + 3G model <br /> <br /> Display <br /> Â Â Â  â¢Â Â Â  9.7-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit glossy widescreen Multi-Touch display with IPS technology <br /> Â Â Â  â¢Â Â Â  1024-by-768-pixel resolution at 132 pixels per inch (ppi) <br /> Â Â Â  â¢Â Â Â  Fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating <br /> Â Â Â  â¢Â Â Â  Support for display of multiple languages and characters simultaneously <br /> <br /> Capacity <br /> Â Â Â  â¢Â Â Â  16GB, 32GB, or 64GB flash drive <br /> <br /> Processor <br /> Â Â Â  â¢Â Â Â  1GHz Apple A4 custom-designed, high-performance, low-power system-on-a-chip <br /> <br /> Sensors <br /> Â Â Â  â¢Â Â Â  Accelerometer <br /> Â Â Â  â¢Â Â Â  Ambient light sensor <br /> <br /> Battery and power <br /> Â Â Â  â¢Â Â Â  Built-in 25 Whr rechargeable lithium-polymer battery <br /> Â Â Â  â¢Â Â Â  Up to 10 hours of surfing the web on Wi-Fi, watching video, or listening to music <br /> Â Â Â  â¢Â Â Â  Charging via power adapter or USB to computer system</p>  <p>  <br /> Ok, so if you ask me based on these specs it definitely fits the bill be being better than an IPhone and still not as good as a full on laptop. Yes, its a niche market. but if you look at how the Ipad is being marketed its not supposed to eliminate laptops. It does however give the Kindle and Nook a run for its money.Â  The Three top things it seems the Ipad does very well are Web browsing, Email and Ibook reading. Those three right there are exactly the right niche market if you ask me. I can see the Ipad being taken to college classes and textbooks handed out electronically. With Wifi you can keep in touch with the integrated email and OF course you get full screen browsing of websites ( sans flash) . The fourth and last big thing I like about the Ipad is the video capabilities. I can watch my movies and not worry about running out of juice.Â  the screen looks fantastic if you ask me.Â  </p>  <p>  <br /> So 3G or just Wifi? I agree with Leo Laporte's take on this. Leo stated in a Revision 3 Tekzilla episode that he isn't going to wait as all he needs is wifi. what I mean is get the wifi version and then if you need toÂ  get a Mifi from Verizon and now you have your very own personal hotspot. Easy peasy lemon squezey. Either way you are going tohave to pay for the 3G coverage so why not get the MiFi and now anything in your car or office or beach etcâ¦ can get a signal to the Internet. I like how he thinks. Especially since I was saying this to my friends about a day before his interview aired on Tekzilla. </p>  <p>  <br /> Love it or Hate it the Ipad is here and here to stay.Â  There were a lot of nay sayers when the Iphone came out and now its the standard phone all new smartphones are compared to.Â  My only issue with the keynote address by Steve Jobs was no mention of any Iphone 4G or anything.Â  my contract is coming up for renewal and I don't want to pounce on a 3GS if a bit of prudence on part can end me up with a new 4G model that IS made out of Unicorns and rainbows. </p>  <p>  <br /> Well, thats it for this episode of Geek Tech Live.

I am not sure how I was able to pull this off, but hosts Beau Ryan and Leo Camacho from <a href="http://radnerd.com" title="RadNerd.com">The RadNerd Show</a> were gracious enough toÂ  drop by and talk about their show as well as games, movies, IPhone apps you name it.Â  In a word it was awesome!Â  </p> <p>You can find Beau and Leo online at the following Twitter and Facebook addresses:</p> <p>Beau Ryan | Host/Producer <br />

They are up for a streamy Award for best new series as well.Â  </p> <p>I would like to state that, as you all well know by now I am by no means adept at interviewing (or even having guests on Geek Tech Live). Beau and Leo were my first guests via a skype call and although i did my homework and research i was definitely nervous conducting the chat.</p> <p>For the record both Beau and Leo were very easy to talk to and were very very very intelligent and professional guests with a wealth of Nerdy, Geeky knnowledge. I could not have asked for a better first interview of Internet Celebrities on Geek Tech Live. I am looking forward to maybe even more inerviewing splendor if my luck continues. <br /></p> ]]></description>

Vtech the maker of fine cordless telephones for the home has created an Internet Radio streaming device called the IS9181.Â  Vtech packs a lot of punch into a very small package.Â  With the IS9181 you can stream music across your 802.11 b/g WiFi network with "Best-in-Class" range.Â  You will need broadband Internet service and a home WiFi network router but who doesn't have one of those these days? Once you have it set up the IS9181 allows you to listen to Internet radio from the available 11,000 stations with no monthly fee! Beat that Satellite providers! the ease of use is very apparent, you can access Internet radio stations from Vtech's user-friendly online site or on the device itself.  <br /> <br />Now just being able to stream Internet Radio wasn't enough for Vtech. You can also play music from any audio device (i.e. CD player, MP3 player, etc) and connect to any stereo system or powered speakers to access streaming Internet radio or music files stored on a PC or Mac. It even has a Built-in FM radio tuner for local FM broadcast service. <br /> <br />You will also be getting big sound out of that small package since the IS9181 has Hi-Fidelity built-in 3W tuned stereo speakers and a 10W subwoofer with class D amplifier for each speaker that can fill any room. It even has a built in Alarm Clock so you can wake up to radio Brazil or BBC Radio 1 every morning! And speaking of settings... Setting the time on the IS9181 is a snap as you can use Internet Time servers to get atomic clock precision without mucking about manually setting the time. It can run on batteries or included AC adapter power too. This thing seems to do everything and it does it quite well! to top it all off, punch in your zip code and receive 5 day weather forecasts right on the large full color screen. It only weighs in at 4 lbs and is 6.3" x 12.4" x 3.5". Wow! You gotta hear it to believe it. And I did so lets get into the meat of the review! <br /> <br />I received the unit from Vtech and proceeded to unbox it. I would like to say right here that I was not compensated in any way by Vtech for this review. I received a loaner unit and as always it was I that asked them if I could try it out and kick the tires on it since I was interested in how it stacked up to other Wifi radio units on the market. I was actually amazed at how small this device really is. I was expecting something a bit larger and began to get worried that it wasn't going to live up to an level of audio quality i was looking and hoping for. To help reference the size I placed a 25 cent piece in frame in a few shots. as you can see below its small and would fit into any AV shelf system living room or bedroom for that matter. <br /> <br />Small top shot of unit <br /><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/fullshotwithremote.jpg" title="top shot of IS9181" alt="top shot of IS9181" height="255" width="453" /> <br /> <br /> <br />Controls are well spaced out and looked to be very well designed for the function they were to perform. <br />top shot of controls <br /></p> <p><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/topdials.jpg" title="Closeup of Controls" alt="Closeup of Controls" height="383" width="430" />Â </p> <p>Shot of the Power Cord and Aux Cables <br /><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/powercord-e1263712857319.jpg" title="Power cords and aux cable" alt="Power cords and aux cable" height="190" width="300" /> <br /> <br />In the box you get the receiver, a mini remote, a power cord and an aux audio cord as well as some assorted manuals, quick start guides etcâ¦ So I plugged the unit in and started the boot up sequence.  <br /> <br /><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/startup1.jpg" title="Start up sequence" alt="Start up sequence" height="294" width="430" /> <br />Â  <br />The actual sequence can take a minute or so and I did like the progress bar on the bottom of the screen so I knew how much longer i needed to wait.  <br /> <br />Once the system booted up I needed to connect it to the wireless broadband connection in my house.Â  The IS9181 found my SSID fine and I then proceeded to put in my Wireless key which if you are like me and have a very long one was a bit of a pain in the butt on the scroll wheel. I had to scroll to the letter or number and then press a button next to the scroll wheel to select it. It reminded me of trying to leave a message on my Xbox using the controller. you can do it and it worksâ¦. its just time consuming and a pain.  <br /></p> <p><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/wepkey.jpg" title="Wireless key entry" alt="Wireless key entry" height="291" width="442" />Â </p> <p>Almost any time I had to input more than a few letters I found myself slowing down a lot to make sure i did not mess an input up and have to redo it. Even the Zip code entry was a bit frustrating.  <br /> <br /><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/zipcode.jpg" title="Zipcode entry" alt="Zipcode entry" height="330" width="452" /> <br /> <br />This by the way could be chalked up to the fact this was my first time using this input system and I was trying to document my progress so your frustration may vary. :)Â  I will say that it did get a bit easier to use the more i fiddled with the controls. <br /> <br />Once I got the system on my wireless network and punched in the Zip codeÂ  and set the Clock via the Internet time servers. I was presented with a nice Menu Screen asking my what function I wanted to use. </p> <p><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sourcescreen2.jpg" title="Selection source" alt="Selection source" height="308" width="468" /> <br /> <br />The IS9181 will not only stream Internet radio but can also function as an alarm clock or FM radio ( AM is dead right?) . Oh yeah it also has outputs so you can hook it up to a bigger stereo or speaker system if the speakers themselves don't do it for you. I was actually pleasantly surprised on the sound output from small speakers like they are. There was no real good way to get a picture of the speakers but it does have front firing stereo speakers and a down firing subwoofer of bass reproduction. <br /> <br />So from here I chose Internet radio andÂ  had the choice of Genres, Locations languagesÂ  most popular stations or My stations ( If I created Favorites)Â  so I chose locations, then Europe AND then UK  <br /> <br /><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/genres.jpg" title="Genres screen" alt="Genres screen" height="288" width="462" /></p> <p><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/europelist.jpg" title="europe list on IS9181" alt="europe list on IS9181" height="303" width="467" /> <br /> <br />and then finally BBC Radio 1. did I mention there are 11 thousand stations you can tune in to?Â  I chose Radio 1 as I have Sirius in my car and i figured it would be a good comparison. I was wrong.Â  Sirius Does a 6 hour time delay on their broadcasts so I could only listen to live radio on the IS9181 and not a direct comparison to my Sirius unit.Â  Either way the station came in fine and was very clear. There is a short buffering segment when you choose a channel but over all it wasn't too bad of a wait.. just a few seconds while it told you it was "connecting to [Station Name]" <br /> <br /><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/connecting2bbc.jpg" title="Connecting to BBC Radio 1" alt="Connecting to BBC Radio 1" height="311" width="462" /> <br /> <br />I switched gears a bit now and decided to seek out some lesser known stations.Â  I was able to find radio stations in Grand Cayman and Jamaica. I ran a speed test on my system and so I can confirm my download speed was never below 5MB/Sec some stations just don't make the trip over the interwaves so well. I would gather this is because of the recording and broadcasting setup they have in their locations. Grand Cayman was a bit on the fuzzy side. Kind of less than 128k stream ish sounding overall.  <br /> <br />One other cool feature of this device is the Weather brought to you by AccuWeather.com .Â  You remember I stated I had to input my zip code? Well , the reason is that the IS9181 will go out and grab a 5 day forecast for you and let you view it while still listening to your streaming audio. neat!</p> <p><img src="http://geektechlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/weather.jpg" title="Accuweather on Is9181" alt="Accuweather on Is9181" height="287" width="427" /> <br /> <br />I was also a snap to point the IS9181 to a windows and mac share and stream my own Mp3's over the wireless network to the device. IT does this quite well and the documentation is a breeze to read and understand. <br /> <br />Over all I give this a 4 out of 5 for Functions and aÂ  a 4 out of 5 for not needlessly packing it full of touch-screens or widgets that would break.. I liked the Analog nature of the device all buttons and switchesâ¦. and I give it 2.5 out of 5 for usability with the scroll wheel and lack of an Ethernet port.  <br /> <br />Ok, so here is where the rubber hits the roadâ¦ I give it then a combined score of a 3 out of 5Â  which is pretty good . It's a buy, not a pass or a wait. The price is competitive with other devices and it comes with a full feature set..Â  Sure, you could stream ANY of these stations if you just had a laptop but for a bedroom or a den with a big set of speakers it fits in nicely and can act as not only an internet radio player but a music streamer as well.Â  for more information on the Vtech IS9181 check out their website at <a href="http://www.vtechphones.com/vtechui/store/music/index.cfm" title="Vtech IS9181 site">http://www.vtechphones.com/vtechui/store/music/index.cfm</a> There you can see some cool videosÂ  of Quantic using the IS9181 to created mixes as well as more Gallery images and Full specifications list of the machine.Â  Vtech has even set up the site to allow you to find stations and get them in your IS9181. Check them out. <br /> <br />Ok, so that was theÂ  reviewâ¦ Lets see what else I scrapped off the walls of the intertubes this week that is interesting. <br /> <br /><b>PDFMyURL</b> I saw fly by on twitter recently! <a href="http://pdfmyurl.com/%20" title="pdfmyurl.com">http://pdfmyurl.com/Â </a> . This site allows you to essentially take a snapshot of your site or any site for that matter and make it a PDF. IT definitely makes it easier to get pictures into powerpoint slides or presentations by doing this. And almost as easy as a screen grab. All for free!  <br /> <br />I also saw that <a href="http://twitter.com/GeekTyrant" title="@GeekTyrant">@GeekTyrant </a>who I follow on Twitter was mentioned at theÂ  Cliqe list : 132 People you should be FollowingÂ  <a href="http://criqe.tumblr.com/post/338059349/before-we-begin-i-have-a-few-things-i-would-like" title="132 people you should follow">http://criqe.tumblr.com/post/338059349/before-we-begin-i-have-a-few-things-i-would-like</a>Â  Lots of people you really should be following and a few that I didn't realize were on twitter.  <br /> <br />And finally,Â  Remember that I am now coming to you weekly unless there is breaking news or a really cool interview happens. I would also like to say that I do say "we" a lot when talking about Geek Tech Live. but this podcast is all me myself and I. Its only one person and I welcome any and all comments or suggestions so go to geekteclive.com and email me or comment on a post and help me make GTL better for everyone!</p> <p>Â  </p> ]]></description>

I unfortunately could not get out there this year and it seems like I missed a lot.Â  Due to some unfortunate circumstances one being CES, all my reviews were stopped as the people I was working with in PR departments across the globe are suggley warm in the warm glow of giant LED TV's or immersed in 3D HDTV... sigh. I really am sorry i could not make it out there.</p> <p>So, I have been wathing lots of news come flying in and grabbed a few tidbits to listen to.</p> <p>Nexus One from Google. so, the actual device itself is pretty darned cool over all. A local friend of mine picked one up and gave me a run down as well as a looksee and I have to say the screen is fantastic! some of the integration like multi touch or apps can use some work but the nice thing about the phone is that all the little fiddly bits i coudl fault it on can all be fixed with some software updates.</p> <p>And speaking of getting a Nexus One ( I know... horrible segue)...

			<description><![CDATA[  <p>Happy New Year 2010!!Â </p> <p>I am taking this year to bring us back to the old way of doing things. I got a bit over zealous with my Foley artistry lately and realized you arent listening for the foley ( I hope) but for my information I bring.Â </p> <p>That being said: I am trying this episode with no background music or intro music. tell me what you think at info@geektechlive.com or leave a comment on my blog at <a href="http://geektechlive.com">geektechlive.com </a> <br /></p> <p>The Magic Mouse review I agve it 5/10 ... 8/10 for style.. several million points negative for usability. </p> <p>Dont get me wrong it works fine.. I just find that the mouse "being a trackpad" occasionally will start scrolling my browser screen all over the place. .. listen to my full rant in the podcast  <br /></p> <p>Â Next I cover some cool gadget for skiers, boarders and even scuba and swimmers! coming in Summer of 2010! Liquid Image will be unveiling the summit searier snow goggles! Huzzah! <br /></p> <p><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2010/01/609979googlesjan09.jpg" title="summit series snow goggles" alt="summit series snow goggles" height="256" width="500" />Â </p> <p>quoting the press release:</p><blockquote><blockquote> <p><i>The Liquid Image Summit Series is the world's first snow goggle with an
integrated digital camera. The goggle contains a wide angle lens to
capture all the action while skiing, boarding, sledding or
snowmobiling. The hands free unit has a 5.0 MP (2560 x 1920) camera
mode and a video mode that records D1 video (720x480) at a rate up to
30 frames per second with audio. <br /> <br />
The Summit Series Snow Camera Goggle is easy to operate. There is a
button for On/Off/Mode and another button for the shutter. To record a
photo or a video, simply turn on the camera, choose the mode, then
press the shutter button. LED lights inside the goggle indicate the
mode to the user. Large side buttons along the right side of the frame
allow for greater dexterity while wearing gloves. <br /> <br />
Liquid Image Summit Series 335 Snow Camera Goggle <br />
The internal memory has 16 MB NAND Flash. The memory is easily expanded
to record thousands of photos or hours of videos by adding a Micro
SD/SDHC Card up to 16 GB. Files may be downloaded to a computer through
the High Speed USB cable <br />
provided, or through a Micro SD/SDHC card. <br /> <br />
The Camera operates on an internal rechargeable Lithium Battery <br />
. Estimated battery performance is 2200 still images or 2:20 hrs of video. <br /> <br />
The Summit Series Snow Camera Goggle model 335 is estimated to ship
late summer 2010, in time for the Winter Ski Season and for Holiday
shopping. This new model follows the concept of the original Liquid
Image Underwater Digital Camera Mask by creating an easier way to
record photos and videos. The concept of integrating the camera into
the sports equipment allows the user to travel with fewer items and to
keep their hands free while performing sports activities. The
integrated camera records a view similar to what is seen, allowing the
user to share their experience with other people, and to enjoy their
activities to a greater extent because they concentrate less on holding
and operating the camera. <br /> <br />
The Summit Series Snow Camera Goggle model number 335 has an estimated
US price of $149.00. Specifications and pricing are estimated at this
time. <br /> <br />
Liquid Image Co, LLC, is a manufacturer of cameras, electronics <br />
, toys and games that target sports and outdoor activities with an
emphasis on Sport Technology and POV Cameras. The corporate office is

			<description><![CDATA[ <div align="center"><b><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="5">Welcome to the post Christmas Geek Tech live Spectacular! Episode 48 for December 26th!</font></b> <br /></div> <p> <br /></p> <p><b><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4">Barnes and Noble Nook EPIC FAIL!!! <br /></font></b></p> <p><img src="http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Barnes-and-Noble-Nook-2.jpg" title="Barnes and Noble Nook" alt="Barnes and Noble Nook" height="235" width="433" />Â </p> <p>So Lets start out with our Epic Fail of the Week theÂ  Barnes and Noble Nook.Â  I am not a media Mogul, obviously since I am not on network TV nor am I even working for the hallowed Revision3 or G4tv or mashable.com. being that as it may I still know one or two things not to do when creating something new and giving it out to customersâ¦. makes sure it can handle the traffic if it becomes an overnight sensation. You only get one shot at this especially when you are talking about going up against the kindle. but it appears a surge of download requests over the 25th jammed the B&amp;N net tubes and left Nook users high and dry with nothing to readâ¦ All attempts at downloading an ebook on the 25thÂ  , even by those who got their Nook early,Â  were greeted with a "Queued: Will complete shortly" message. Not cool. Barnes and Noble.. Hear this well. consumers arrant going to stand for this. in this economy of 5 seconds of fame and rapid fire news and information. people are not going to be "ok" with this level of service. I was almost going to get a Nookâ¦. now I am going to wait and see if Barnes and Noble can not only rectify this sufficiently but also keep things on a steadily improving course.Â  On Christmas Day you don't want your precious new Gadget to not work. especially if its not a lack of batteries but a lack of servers at the manufacturers that are able to send you your 1's and 0's so you can read your book.Â  wowâ¦. Epic fail at an Epic Date ( at least in the states ).</p> <p><b><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4">ISlate, ITablet... I Claudius?!?!? </font></b> <br /></p> <p><img src="http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/08/personalbest_list/image/jobs.jpg" title="Steve Jobs Islate Itablet apple" alt="Steve Jobs Islate Itablet apple" height="316" width="440" /> <br /> <br />Lets move on to a more happier moment in timeâ¦ say January 26th? are you free? I hope you are because we all have a date with Destiny! the Apple tablet, or cure for cancer or something even cooler will be announced by apple January 26th!Â  Steve Jobs is soo excited and happy he only took a salary of one US dollar. ok we all know that this is just a nicety as he is making a lot more cash by just being Steve Jobs but if you listen to the song being played I would say we are coming to the bridge and its going to be a solo of Epic proportionsâ¦ and not in a Fail way.  <br /> <br />The big rumor right now is this whole new Domain name that cropped up called Islate.com that was bought by Apple in october. rumor has it the tablet is the slate and the slate is the tabletâ¦ and the worm is the spice of course! what this all means to you and me is apple is again working the smoke and mirrors machine and is going to try to use misdirection again to in the end show us exactly what they are planning. either way even if you know whats coming it will be pretty cool to see it unveiled â¦finally.Â  the Media event as I said will be held on January 26th at the San FranciscoÂ  Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.Â  rumors again here but Apple rented a stage at the Gardens and is expected to use this venue to announce a new product.Â  of course Apple and the Yerba Buena Gardens failed to comment on those rumors.Â  Wouldn't you be surprised if they said..Â  "oh that? yeah we are going to showcase a new device the Islateâ¦ we bought that URL and then the Jobman is going to walk on water..Â  its gonna be a great party.." yeahâ¦ I don't think they are going to be anything less than tight lipped about this until it happens. My only complaint is that I am stuck in the Midwest with no way of getting to the eventâ¦ of course I also have not been invited either but that is just a small hurdle to jump. <br /></p> <p><b><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4">FastMall.com</font></b></p> <p><img src="http://www.fastmall.com/images/buymap/banner/menlo_b.jpg" title="FastMall.com" alt="FastMall.com" height="136" width="514" /> <br /></p> <p>From epic Fail to Epic possible Win and now to an Iphone app for cruising the mallâ¦. FastMall. This little app came across my attention lasersÂ  while perusing Prweb.com.Â  the Tagline for this iapp is the following â¦ and I quote <br /> <br />Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â  " For millions of mall shoppers finding a desired store, restaurant or restroom from a directory kiosk can be nearly impossible and terribly frustrating. Multiple levels, ever-changing retailers and crowds of people can all add up to making mall shopping much more difficult than itâs worth. " <br /> <br />Now I don't know about you but I don't really get lost in malls that oftenâ¦ of course I don't go to the Mall of Merica either and that mall I bet I could get lost in. Fastmall has over 30,00 unique stores and more than 250,000 stores overall. the database holds approximately 1250 Malls currently as news ones are being added on a weekly basis. you an even request a mall to be added by emailing fastmall.com via email. Now I guess there are times you may need this. but here is where my interest fails on this appâ¦ the app itself is free but the maps range from 99 cents to 2.99. this just doesn't seem like a good pricing scheme as for me personally i know the malls I live near pretty well and if I just take the time to walk them once I will uncover any new shops that open with very little effort. This app isn't for me but if what I said sounds interesting take a gander at the app store or For more information, visit <a href="http://www.FastMall.com" title="www.FastMall.com">www.FastMall.com</a> Or go directly to iTunes and download FastMall now:<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fastmall/id340656157?mt=8" title="fastmall app"> http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fastmall/id340656157?mt=8</a> <br /> <br /></p> <p><b><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4">Foursquare vs Gowalla! </font></b> <br /></p> <p> <br />Foursquare or Gowalla, isn't that the eternal question? well now <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/12/25/foursquare-gowalla/" title="foursquare or gowalla">mashable.com has chimed in</a> on the location based game,social network, game app. these apps allow you to find and connect with friends and then shout out locations via the app to show where you have been and garner prizes like badges or pins for accomplishing stuff. create to-do lists for friends. Mashable.com has a great article doing a face to face drag down, no holds barred tag team cage match to show you the differences and which you should choose. <br />And for me I chose Foursquare since I had seen some recent tweets that were geotagged and were from people using foursquare in my city. Alas, if you are like me. non of my friends on my address book or on face book or following me on twitter were actually using foursquare. so for me the app is a bust as it doesn't help me in the slightest. now if you have a group of people using either of these apps the possibilities are endless.Â  I will post a link to the foursquare vs Gowalla image breakdown list in the show notes. but if you are interestedâ¦ find the one that your friends do and join in the fun!</p> <p><img src="http://cdn.mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/foursquare-v-gowalla.jpg" title="Foursquare vs Gowalla features" alt="Foursquare vs Gowalla features" height="953" width="564" /> <br /></p> <p><b><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="4">Listener Email! </font></b> <br /></p> <p>So we have an actual email from a listener slash fan of the show!!Â  MarkÂ  F.

"so you really wanna be a podcaster?"</li></ul> <br />so I was browsing thru PRweb news articles and this one really stood out. I was like huh?? whaaa? awesome! <br /> <br />Ever out at a pub and notice the premier of china stroll in for a Guinness? well now you can tell the world! immediately! Huzzah! <br /> <br />News from Silicon Valley, SachManya LLC publisher of <a href="http://360Newslive.com" title="360Newslive.com">360Newslive.com</a> and <a href="http://360ne.ws" title="360ne.ws">360ne.ws</a> citizen journalism websites announced today immediate and free access to their first Iphone app called 360 News. this new app allows citizens like you and me report up to the minute news as it happens directly from their Iphones. wow! <br />It tracks GPS coordinates, Date and time is inserted automatically, and photo and videos can be uploaded right on the spot. the 360 distribution service takes it from there and submits it to TwitterÂ®, FacebookÂ®, YoutubeÂ®, CNN iReportÂ®, Yahoo/Reuters You Witness NewsÂ®, MSNBC and more. all without joe journalist lifting a finger!  <br />If you are searching news the app also delivers location based news targeted for your location again using the internal GPS location of your phone.Â  you can bets this app is pretty robust since the parent company of 360news SachManya LLC develops and markets mobile applicationsÂ  and is based in SiliconÂ  Valley. You remember silicon valley? thats where all the computers come from before the bubble burst. <br /> <br />Well at any rate the tag for the app is the following : "360News is all about mobilizing the user-generated news creation and sharing it with the rest of the world in the fastest and easiest manner" <br /> <br />in other news, <br /> <br />taking back seat to the crazy town that was the buzz of the google nexus one phone it looks like the Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 is headed to Tmobile now. There was a report that the users manual for said Sony Ericsson XPERIA X10 was leaked "accidentally" by the FCCâ¦ oh you FCC you loony bunch you! on an <a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2009/12/20/sony-ericsson-xperia-x10-headed-t-mobile/" title="BGR EXPERIA X10">short article on Boy Genius report</a> they state to look at page three where you can see the 3G bands that will be used on the phone. those bandsâ¦. drum rollâ¦ are known far and wide as <a href="http://tmobile.com" title="TMO">T-Mobile</a> AWS 3G bands! so ther you have it. unless something changes.. Tmobile the big T , Mr T phone will be getting the EPERIA X10. yay! <br /> <br />And finally, <br /> <br />Everyone knows, or maybe they don't that I was a HUGE Blackberry fanboy for many year before the Iphone a came and stole my inner circuitry of a heart. that said I still look fondly at RIM and keep up with my first loveâ¦ you never forget your first love. Speaking of Love Research in Motion executive board must be loving the fact that they sold 10 Million blackberries in Q3 breaking their previous record the quarter before.Â  80% of threes new phones were to non corporate entities. what does this mean? for you and me it means that RIM is starting to win over the consumer and prosumer markets which are still dominated by the Iphone and its ilk. to put all these numbers in perspective. Iphone sold 7.4 Million phones this last quarter so its a close race but RIM beat Apple by 2.6 Million phones and that is really not a small number. <br />Its a good end to a good year for Cellphones at any rate. <br /> <br />Part 2 of " so you really wanna be a podcaster"Â  will dive into the next stepsâ¦ so you got a name and a URL, you picked a topic you love, and now where do you go? PArt 2 will go into hosting your siteâ¦ where and how and is it free, all of that and more in episode 47 Of Geek tech live  <p></p> <p>Â </p> ]]></description>

Twitter was all a flutter today with news of the much awaited ,star trek referenced Google Nexus ONE phone. Lots of info is floating around and so far we know a few tidbits from multiple sites like engadget and techcrunch.com . We know it will be gsm.. from photos we can see it has Wifi, the phone has a QR code on it? not sure why but it does. updated OS has 3d features in itÂ  mute and lock screens are similar to Android 2.0.1.Â  there is a grid icon at the bottom of the screen that opens a webOS style card view of all the home screen pages. the NExus one will have Google Navigation and Google Goggles which if you haven't see the video of that in action you are missing out. One main thing to note is that nowhere on any of the pictures I have seen is it branded with HTC even though it really looks like the HTC Passion.Â  engadget has more info and boot up videos as well as links to google goggles and updates as they fly in.Â  Techcrunch.com stated the original pictures they got their hands on were from a san-fran <a href="http://twitter.com/CoryOBrien" title="twitter.com Cory OBrien">blogger named Cory O'Brien</a> who got his hands on one and got all tweeting crazy taking a pic of the phone for all the world to see. Cory had this to say on the Google Nexus ONE.  <br />"Google Phone = Iphone+extra screen and a scroll wheel. great touch and Android".</p> <p>Below is a picture of the bad boy from engadget:</p> <p><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2009/12/nexus_main_2.jpg" title="NEXUS ONE photo" alt="NEXUS ONE photo" height="460" width="352" />Â </p> <p>here are some of the links to the articles I referenced:</p> <p> <br /><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/12/nexus-one-google-phone-picture/">http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/12/nexus-one-google-phone-picture/</a> <br /><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/14/exclusive-first-google-phone-nexus-one-photos-android-2-1-on/">http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/14/exclusive-first-google-phone-nexus-one-photos-android-2-1-on/</a> <br /> <br />Also, here is a pic from  <br /> <br /> <br />We here at GTL would love to get our hands on this phone and do a review before launchâ¦. you hear me Google?! call me on Twitter! @geektechlive Do it!</p> <p> <br />So what do you think of the Google Nexus Phone? have we finally seen the face of the Iphone killer and its called Nexus? will next years model be called Nexus two? when they named it Nexus were they making a reference to Star Trek? will capt Kirk pop out of a phone and whoopee Goldberg try to get into one? who knows.Â  All I can say is its a slick phone and at first glance it really looks like it will give the Iphone a run for its money. Especially with the rumor of it being sold as an unlocked phone so you can just pick either T-mobile or AT&amp;T . At least Google is givingÂ  us the opportunity for choice. <br /> <br />Alright, I Am Nexusssussed out. lets move on to Another Google Topic as well as facebook. Both of these media giants are wanting to shorten your URLs. so does this matter? is Bit.ly worried? with the plethora of URL shorteners I just done understand why we would want any more. unless by using specific urls you gain anything like tracking information It seems like both facebook and google are a bit late to this party. Heck you can set up your own URL shortener using wordpress. I have done it and it was easyâ¦ and in the end I don't use it since most of my mobile apps that I use shortening on only give me a small choice of providers. In the end they still all provide the same thing. they make URLs easier to manage. but thats about it if you ask me.  <br /> <br />Ok so on to the Iphone 3G getting video recording.YAY!â¦ NOT.Â </p> <p><img src="http://waynesutton.files.wordpress.com/2009/03/p-480-320-3cdaca34-c9bd-4c18-b547-b9ea47c98754.jpeg?w=200&amp;h=300" title="ustream for 3g" alt="ustream for 3g" height="300" width="200" />Â </p> <p> to be able to tell you why I am not impressed I need to also do a small App review for the UStream app called broadcaster that allows this to even happen on my archaic Iphone 3G. Now the actual Ustream app seems pretty darned cool I almost wanted to do a once a month Live Geek Tech Live podcast. that was until I used it on my IPhone. audio works cleanly on the 3G. and Ustream.com works flawless on Android phones as well as with standard webcams. But the Little Iphone that could Sadly cant. its very noticeable why Apple decided to not allow Video on the 3G and only allow it on the 3GS. the frame rate suffers and at times seems like one of them Olde time pre talky moving pictures. to get it even partially usable I had to drop my recording size down to 176x144 which is slightly but not really bigger than a postage stamp on my screen. And even then, video is choppy. now don't get me wrong. it works and it records and it even records on an Old 3G. but the video from a 3Gâ¦. blows. its just horrible. I would love to use it but unless I am filming a geological event like two tectonic plates moving apart or a glacier whipping down a mountain at breakneck speeds its just not worth it to me. the upside of all this. the app is free and it works great on 3GS and other devices as well as online with plain old webcams.</p> <p>There is a great article online at :<a href="http://foodao.wordpress.com/2009/12/10/ustream-live-broadcaster-iphone-app/" title="iphone broadcast">http://foodao.wordpress.com/2009/12/10/ustream-live-broadcaster-iphone-app/</a></p> <p> <br /></p> <p>And that brings up to the end of another installment of Geek Tech Live.

While you are waiting for armageddon to arrive browse these amazing images from the boston.com picture section called the big picture. truly amazing and really is a beautiful machine.... even if it will create a super black hole that will swallow the earth and neighboring stars. </p>  <p> <img src="http://inapcache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bigpicture/lhc_11_20/l11_00000001.jpg" alt="LHC" title="LHC" width="435" height="290" /> Â </p>  <p> Â <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5409596/droid-price-drops-to-120" title="Droid Price drop"> Gizmodo article on Nokia Droid Price Drop</a> . Looks like the Droid is taking a cue from the Palm Pixi and dropping its price prior to black friday and the holidays. 199.99 nets you a brand new Droid with contract. not a bad deal if you were sitting on the fence for this one.</p>  <p> <img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2009/11/delldroidprice.jpg" alt="Nokia Droid price drop" title="Nokia Droid price drop" width="340" height="363" /> Â </p>  <p> <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/11/19/wired-apple-tablet/" title="more apple tablet rumors"> Â Is Wired.com getting ready for the apple tablet? read more here at Mashable.com.</a>  more rumors abound about the apple tablet conde nast is prepping wired.com to be on the tablet? is it even coming soon? not sure if anyone knows other than apple. I reallly wish we coudl get soem sense of what exactly this will all be and a small timeline. even a estimted date from apple would be a blessing. if not I sure hope it lives up to the hype because if its not as revolutionary and cool and gee whiz awesome as they are making it out to be its going to be the bigest flop of the decade!</p>  <p> And finally, I sadly announce the passing of Edward Woodward . you might have known him of "The Equalizer" fame. I used to Love that show. i think i may need to buy the whole season and start watching it all over again as a tribute to Mr Woodward.Â  Read more here at <a href="http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/tv-world-mourns-equalizer-star-edward-woodward-14564659.html" title="edward woodward Obituary"> the belfast telegraph website.</a> </p>  <p> Â </p>  <p>   </p>   <p> And dont forget to check out Zazzle.com for all your holiday gift giving needs!</p>   <p> Geek Tech live is now on Twitter at <strong>  <a href="http://www.twitter.com/geektechlive" title="GTL Tweets">  <span style="font-size:small;">  @Geektechlive</span>  </a>  </strong>  Follow me on there for more news that doesnt make it into the show!</p>   <p> We can now offer all GTL'ers super cool discounts at Zazzle!

I was so pumped about this I went straight for the Goggles. <p> at $150.00 for the numbered MW2 prestige edition it isnt cheap but rarely is awesomeness this cheap! </p>  <p> I even got a good view of what things look like thru the goggles on cam. A buddy at work also bought the prestige edition and since he is a hunter he is really looking forward to finding his tree stands a bit easier this year. </p>  <p> So please check this unboxing out! They are a bit on the small side for Large humans ( read Adults) and they are not over the glasses friendly. but all in all a very nice pair of Night vision goggles for the price and a very cool game as well.Â </p>  <p> My Gamertag on Xbox live is Xanaduguy send me an invite and lets jump into the action!</p> <hr /> You can get even more information and read more about MW2 at infinity ward's website hereÂ  <a href="http://modernwarfare2.infinityward.com/agegate.php" title="Infinity ward site for MW2"> Infinity Ward</a>  <p> Wired.com did a review on their site of the game as well. check that out <a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/11/modern-warfare-2-review/" title="Wired.com MW2 review"> at Wired.com</a> </p> <hr /> On to some holiday Ideas inspired by Going out to Zazzle.com and buying some cool merchandise!

			<description><![CDATA[  <p>Welcome Geek's to #39 of the GTL podcast!</p> <p>Today we cover some cool topics including my thoughts on the following! click on the images to go to the underlying source articles. </p> <p>Sprint HTC hero Finally available to presale? pros and cons of the HTC and is it a Palm Pre Killer?</p> <p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/07/23/htc-hero-review/" title="HTC hero review Engadget" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.pcworld.com/news/graphics/167279-htc_hero_slide_01_slide.jpg" title="HTC Hero" alt="HTC Hero" height="196" width="375" /></a>Â </p> <p>From there we move to the Tale of Woe ( not Whoah!) with Tmobile and sidekicks losing all their data? really? ever hear of redundancy? maybe back ups? well listen on for my thoughts on this rather big mess up.</p> <p><a href="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20091012/Sidekick.jpg" title="sidekick article" target="_blank"><img src="http://i.i.com.com/cnwk.1d/i/bto/20091012/Sidekick.jpg" title="sidekick" alt="sidekick" height="138" width="184" /></a>Â </p> <p>I Talk a bit about my thoughts on Zazzle and how I use them to host my own Geek Teck Live Gear as well as other crazyness my mind can come up with.Â </p> <p>I have two Custom codes for people wanting to buy items at <a href="http://www.zazzle.com" title="Zazzle" target="_blank">Zazzle.com</a>Â  </p> <p>The first is <b>GEEKTECHSHOW</b> which will nab you 10% off any purchase from Zazzle of $50 or more!Â  </p> <p>The next is <b>GEEKTECHLIVE </b>which will get you 12% off any order of $75 or more! </p> <p>for more information check out my offers page at <a href="http://offers.mevio.com/show/geektech.html" title="Geek Tech Live Zazzle offers!" target="_blank">http://offers.mevio.com/show/geektech.html</a></p> <p>I will be reviewing Call of Duty Modern WarFare 2 (MW2) prestige edition next month! I will go thru not only gameplay but also the custom working night vision goggle review as well so stay tuned!</p> <p>The final thing i wanted to cover was the Wacom Bamboo Fun Tablet review! </p> <p><a href="http://www.wacom.com/index.html" title="Wacom.com bamboo fun tablet"><img src="http://www.drawittablet.com/files/2230731/uploaded/CTE450K_MidSideAngle_RGB.jpg" title="Wacom Bamboo Fun tablet" alt="Wacom Bamboo Fun tablet" height="347" width="373" /></a>Â </p> <p>I bought this for myself to help with some of my designs with my Zazzle store. Boy Howdy! this is a great product. its a little small on the active area at 4x6 but even with that I give it a 4 out of 5. between the precision of the stylus to the pressure sesitivity of the active area. i dont see how i could have lived without one for so long!</p> <p>Dont forget Geek Tech Live is on Twitter at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/geektechlive" title="GTL on Twitter">@Geektechlive</a> Follow me there for more information that doesnt get into the showÂ </p> <p>And pick up some geek tech live gear on Zazzle at <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/geektechlive%20" title="GTL at zazzle">http://www.zazzle.com/geektechlive </a> <br /></p> <p>Â </p> ]]></description>
