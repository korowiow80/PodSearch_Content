			<description><![CDATA[ Seb and Chris are the alone in the studio this week as Ed takes up a case of man flu, so they fill time with a huge selection of banter from the last fortnight as well as two tracks from Right Hook Ruin and Hella Better Dancer. We do the drinks review anyway, regardless, and we talk about the new 3G Sounds website, a goat born with a human head and Gordon Brown developing a like for chocolate biscuits.

			<description><![CDATA[ Literally everyone's in the studio this week, so many people that we needed an extra chair! On the 3G Sofa is Edward T and Matt O'Keeffe, and we're joined by special guest singer Gabriela Machado, who brought her guitar with her to play us a choon (as well as other psychic related subjects when Matt interviews her). Featuring your fortnightly dose of news, features and banter, this podcast is the round up of all things relevant in the last fortnight, including Derren Brown - real or fake? (It's pretty obvious who you think will say he's real)

This week's guest on the 3G Sofa is the infamous James D'Costa, who tries to set things straight in the studio by forcing Seb to actually organise the podcast. Edward T is at a funeral this week, so Seb takes over the drinks review with the - cough - best drink we've ever had, and we feature our new resident band, Right Hook Ruin, as well as a great game of Top 100. Also with the best news from the last fortnight. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ The 3G Team are back finally for the last podcast of the series with this week's piano-guest, Olly Greally. Due to weeks worth of unplanning, this turned out to be quite a regular podcast, but we figured we'd throw in a piano solo at the end. Featuring greats such as Top 100, an drinks review of Mountain Dew and such, but this time organised in a topsy-turvy way thanks to Seb's bright idea. Also available in 3D. Join us again in the second half of August for the new series, where the team will be interviewing people of stupidly high IQ, as well as more of your favorite British banter here at 3G Sounds. Have a great summer!

We've scratched Gambi's Big Boffin Quiz for Top 100, a game full of shouting random words. We discuss proper news including Wimbledon, Seb's trip to the US of A and the (scariest) fastest rapper in the world, as well as a drinks review of another of Bundaberg's greats and a LOT of twitteration!

It's safe to say not the best of our podcasts, but hey, the heat was on. Hosted this week by Edward T while Seb spends his whole time playing on the iPod Touch, this podcast involves a lot of loud noises and pointless plosives. Oh, and this one isn't recommended for hardcore Micahel Jackson fans either. Enjoy!

			<description><![CDATA[ Due to various shennanigans (I hope I spelled that right) this week, we bring you a filler podcast recorded a few months ago. As with all future fillers, a different presenter will host, and this week it's Edward T with Seb on the 3G Sofa, talking about things probably not relevant today. I mean, sheesh, what is a today-podcast without Gambi's Big Boffin Quiz? Don't hold your breath though, because next week we'll be starting our line of weekly podcasts up to the Summer Special, featuring guests such as Jazz pianist Olly Greally. Until then, endure this.

Join us all again in May for the next series of 3G Sounds podcasts, where we'll be doing numerous interviews, and possibly a Street Fighter tournament! See you then!

Featured music is CC Licsenced. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ The last in the second series of 3G Sounds Podcasts, Seb and Chris close the set with a few laughs due to their standard Britishness, as well as a heck of a lot of ‘The News!’ including the data capacity of a brain and the Wimbeldon tennis championships.

Join us again in September 2008 for the beginning of the third series with a huge range of new guests, 3G Sounds Mixes, as well as the long awaited explanation of the Falteninstitut. Join us then and thanks for the support throughout the series, including those who supported us in the podcast we recorded in Austria. ]]></description>

Random discussions lead into a Skype-cast chat with Americans on how British people rule, a preview of the upcoming Awok and Amule as well as a quick hoedown resulting in the studio going up in flames.
