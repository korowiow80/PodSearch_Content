            <description>So, it's about that time again, that is, time to wildly speculate about the upcoming announcements that will be announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo.&amp;nbsp; I was going to record this in audio form as part of my next episode, but that probably won't be out until after the expo, thus rendering my predictions moot.&amp;nbsp; An episode is on the way, though, so don't think you are off the hook just yet.&amp;nbsp; If I have to suffer, so do you. Anyways, on with the predictating.&amp;nbsp; First up, Nintendo:I know that the Wii U will be the focus of Nintendo&amp;rsquo;s E3 press conference this year but I still have a good feeling about the Wii Vitality Sensor.&amp;nbsp; This year&amp;rsquo;s my year.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m totally going to use it to test how vital I am if you catch my drift.&amp;nbsp; Wink emoticon Wink emoticon.&amp;nbsp; And by that I mean I&amp;rsquo;m going to use it to test my blood pressure.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I am getting older and high blood pressure does run in my family.That being said, since the Wii U will go on sale this year, Nintendo will finally announce a release date for the system and a price point.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m going to hazard a guess and say the system will be released in November, in time for the Christmas shopping season, and for $299.99 US.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There will be &amp;ldquo;shortage&amp;rdquo; of systems at launch that will level out in the coming months.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We may also get specs for it.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s going to be way more powerful than 2 Gamecubes duct taped together.&amp;nbsp; It will have the mighty power of two Gamecubes and a Wii.&amp;nbsp; That&amp;rsquo;s like 4 Gamecubes.&amp;nbsp; It will be a fierce competitor in the HD console market until next year when the next Sony and Microsoft consoles are released.&amp;nbsp; It will not play blu-rays or DVDs as it will have its own proprietary disc format, thus making porting to the system much more costly.&amp;nbsp; It won&amp;rsquo;t do a lick of good to stop game piracy, though.Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m assuming that Ninty will have the following games to show:New Super Mario Bros Wii U 2: New Super Mario Brothers 3 (with Bono).&amp;nbsp; This will be basically the same game as the Wii iteration, except that 1) you will be able to play as your Mii character and 2) one player will have a gross advantage over the others due to being able to use the Wii U tablet controller.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The advantage being that that tablet having player will be able to play another, better game while everyone else is stuck playing the same old, same old.&amp;nbsp; Also, there will be a raccoon tail power up. Metroid/Star Fox fan fiction crossover game.&amp;nbsp; The current grist in the rumor mill is that there will be a Samus / Fox McCloud teamup game for some reason.&amp;nbsp; They are both bounty hunters so I guess it works.&amp;nbsp; I would advise that if Nintendo does go through with this, that they must include Captain Falcon as he too, is a bounty hunter.&amp;nbsp; As is Boba Fett, but as he is currently preoccupied in the Sarlacc Pit, I&amp;rsquo;d understand his absence.** The expanded universe doesn&amp;rsquo;t count.&amp;nbsp; Neither do the prequels nor any scenes added or edited after 1983.&amp;nbsp; I will allow the following, however:&amp;nbsp; Star Wars: the Radio Play
Pikmin 3:&amp;nbsp; Now with PikWomin.&amp;nbsp; In addition to new colors of pikmin (orange, pink, and periwinkle), we will see Olimar&amp;rsquo;s family entering the fray.&amp;nbsp; There will be his wife Peech, his son Tode, and another bastardization of another Mario character&amp;rsquo;s name, possibly Yoshee or Browser. Who am I kidding, if there is another playable character, it will be a Mii. Some sort of Wii Sports variant.&amp;nbsp; I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see someone smacking someone upside the head with the tablet controller.&amp;nbsp; That&amp;rsquo;s curling for you, which better be one of the sports included in this minigame collection. Wildcard game: Mario Paint.&amp;nbsp; Everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite &amp;ldquo;Smurfs: Paint and Play Workshop&amp;rdquo; ripoff will be announced.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This time you will finally be able to paint on Mario.&amp;nbsp; This will open up all sorts of creative possibilities but inevitably everyone will draw a penis on his forehead.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Wildcard Teaser Announcements: Super Smash Bros U and Legend of Zelda U.&amp;nbsp; Neither game will be past the planning stages yet, let alone have screen shots for them, but they will still get the most press.Several HD remakes of Gamecube classics will be announced (Luigi&amp;rsquo;s mansion, etc).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They won&amp;rsquo;t come out until next year though, if ever.&amp;nbsp; And Eternal Darkness will not be one of them, no matter how awesome that would be.Finally for the Wii U, Nintendo will have a sizzle reel of all the PS3 ports and Xbox 360 ports coming later this year.&amp;nbsp; Darksiders II,&amp;nbsp; Assasin&amp;rsquo;s Creed III and probably Grand Theft Auto 5 will all be announced, with tacked on functionality for the tablet to boot.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In particular, Ubisoft will rush a number of ports to the system, Rayman Origins being the main one.Also, there is the 3DS to consider.&amp;nbsp; New Super Mario Brothers 2 will be coming out.&amp;nbsp; In 4D.&amp;nbsp; The fourth dimension is 2D.&amp;nbsp; Because I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I&amp;rsquo;ll be turning off the 3D when I play it.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s not as bland and generic as the other New Super Mario brother games, but it definitely will be.There will also be a Legend of Zelda: Majora&amp;rsquo;s Mask remake for the Thirds.&amp;nbsp; Other than that, there&amp;rsquo;s not going to much fan fare for the 3DS as Nintendo has to focus on getting the Wii U out the door.&amp;nbsp; And quite frankly, they don&amp;rsquo;t have any competition in the hand held market to worry about.&amp;nbsp; Well, except for Apple.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, they should be extremely worried.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Microsoft:Since Microsoft and Sony have officially announced that they are not announcing any new hardware at this E3 convention, both of their press conferences are going to be boring.&amp;nbsp; As usual.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, since this is a transition year, there aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be a lot of surprising announcements coming from either company.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Why waste killer IPs on dying systems when you can use them to sell the next one?&amp;nbsp; So yeah, we probably won&amp;rsquo;t be seeing too many new franchises or updates to existing franchises.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is a shame as we are at the point now where game devs should be comfortable enough with the hardware to crank out some really stellar games.&amp;nbsp; Case in point:&amp;nbsp; It was about this time in the PS2&amp;rsquo;s life cycle that Shadows of the Colossus was released. Anyway, here are the games I&amp;rsquo;m expecting to see from Microsoft:New Gears of War prequel .&amp;nbsp; This isn&amp;rsquo;t a prediction as Microsoft has already leaked that this game is on the way.&amp;nbsp; Yay, I guess?Dance Central 3: Electric Bugaloo.&amp;nbsp; Although they won&amp;rsquo;t do it, Harmonix should release a version of the game with classic pop and rock songs from the 20th century.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it would have a broader appeal as Baby Boomers might not want to dance to Lady Gaga but they may want to do the hustle. Kinect Adventures 2: Now with Bears.&amp;nbsp; Or more minigames where you pantomime plugging things up with your extremities.&amp;nbsp; By which I mean my penis.
Harry Potter Kinect will be showcased.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My favourite level is the one where your character is locked under the staircase. Sony:Uncharted Prequel.&amp;nbsp; If previous games can be taken as precedent, Nathan Drake will somehow be estranged from Elena in the game and will somehow end up back together with her at the end.&amp;nbsp; This will be slightly more bizarre as this will be a prequel and the characters will not have met yet.&amp;nbsp; Only slightly, though.&amp;nbsp; As long as Sully is there to crack wise, I&amp;rsquo;m good to go.Infamous 3.&amp;nbsp; Shocking, I know.More on the Playstation Battle Royale will be revealed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m guessing it will have a special guest star Scorpion from Mortal Kombat, because making a kid friendly fighting game with Kratos from the God of War series isn&amp;rsquo;t wrong enough already. The Last Guardian will be dated, finally.&amp;nbsp; 2015.&amp;nbsp; Mark your calendars. And finally, little to nothing will be announced for the Vita.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps a price cut, but not any good reasons as to why you should buy one.Other game company announcements:Activision, taking the path less traveled, will shock the gaming world by showing off Black Ops 2 and possibly even announcing Modern Warfare 4. Capcom will announce Darkstalkers 4.&amp;nbsp; And when it comes out next year, no one will buy it.&amp;nbsp; Partly because the fighting game market is flooded right now (thanks in part to Capcom) but mostly because a super ultra lemon scented edition of the game will be released three months afterwards. Also, Capcom will announce when you will be able to pay to unlock the remaining characters on Street Fighter x Tekken from the disc you already bought.&amp;nbsp; Because I&amp;rsquo;m stupid.&amp;nbsp; I mean, you&amp;rsquo;re the stupid one for buying it.&amp;nbsp; I totally didn&amp;rsquo;t get suckered by buying it. No siree.&amp;nbsp; If I say it enough times, it&amp;rsquo;ll come true.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Sega will announce Sonic Generations 2.&amp;nbsp; This one will ignore what made Sonic Generations so good and will revolve around his friends.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There&amp;rsquo;ll also be Yakuza 5 and a lot of focus on Mario &amp;amp; Sonic at the London Olympic games (the xbox one will have Kinect support).&amp;nbsp; And there won&amp;rsquo;t be any more Valkyria Chronices news.&amp;nbsp; What they should announce, but won&amp;rsquo;t, would be a Valkyria Chronicles 2 &amp;amp; 3 HD collection for the PS3.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;d buy it.&amp;nbsp; Twice. Konami will have Metal Gear Rising on display and will drop a teaser for Metal Gear Solid 5. Bioware will announce Dragon Age 3.&amp;nbsp; They will also tease a bit about the new Mass Effect 3 ending, which itself will be an advertisement for Mass Effect Online.&amp;nbsp; There will be three playable factions in that game: Red, Green, and Blue.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, it doesn't matter which one you pick as the game will be the same regardless.&amp;nbsp; Ubisoft will announce a ton of ports for the Wii U, none of which will be good.&amp;nbsp; They&amp;rsquo;ll even manage to screw up porting Rayman Origins and that game is amazing.&amp;nbsp; Also, Beyond Good and Evil 2 will not be at the show. Theres really only one game&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to Quantum Conundrum (by Valve) as it looks to be the spiritual sequel to the Portal Franchise.&amp;nbsp; I hope this one has cupcakes that are half truths.
Anyway, those are all the predictions I have for now.&amp;nbsp; If I can think of any more, I'll update them here.&amp;nbsp; Probably after the convention so that it will appear that I'm a regular Nostradamus.&amp;nbsp; As opposed to an unleaded one, I guess.&amp;nbsp; Anyway,&amp;nbsp; talk to you guys later.

            <description>This episode I catch up on the geek news from the past two months and I also review the movie no one was demanding a review for, The Smurfs: In 3D.&amp;nbsp; It's more of an overview, really.&amp;nbsp; NewsSteve Jobs and Dennis Ritchie RIPNintendo 3DS right thumbstick attachment announced.&amp;nbsp; Also announced, a game that will use said thumbstick.&amp;nbsp; The game is scheduled to come out in 2017.&amp;nbsp;
Back to the Future, Part II: The Shoes sold on eBay for charity (Parkinson's research).&amp;nbsp; They're all sold out, so if you want some, you'll need a Delorean, which you could then trade for the shoes.&amp;nbsp; Also, apparently the shoes only have a battery live of 4 hours, and not 6 as reported by me.&amp;nbsp; To distract you from my mistake, enjoy this commercial:Arrested Development movie no longer in arrested development.

            <description>This episode I talk about E3, Marvel vs Capcom 3, the Nintendo 3DS and other things that come in threes.&amp;nbsp; I also regale you with tales of my Florida vacation and talk about the Florida Anime Experience.&amp;nbsp;
News3DS Price slashed by $80.&amp;nbsp; Now you'll be able to afford all those 3DS games that don't exist and have probably been cancelled.&amp;nbsp; Like Megaman Legends 3.&amp;nbsp; I am looking so foward to not being able to buy that one ever.
Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 announced.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; You should probably hold out for Ulitmate Marvel vs Capcom 3 Arcade Edition Turbo Hyper Fighting + Jazz Hands edition.&amp;nbsp; I still haven't forgiven Marvel for Spider-man 3.&amp;nbsp; Putting Nightcrawler into the game would help to put them back in my good books.&amp;nbsp;
ReviewOk, I didn't actually review anything this time.&amp;nbsp; I did talk about my Orlando vacation, and memorable rides from Disney World, Sea World, and Universal Studios.&amp;nbsp; Pretty much everything I missed out on the last time I went (Episode 38 - Don't listen to it).&amp;nbsp; I also talk about going to the Florida Anime Experience, a con that made its debut this year.Here's the clip from the Disneyland 35th Anniversary Special that warped my fragile sensibilities when I was but a lad:

Promotional Consideration Given To:The Starlight Megaphones Ahoy Podcast: This is the new home of Jake the Root Beer King, where he talks about everything but RPGs.&amp;nbsp; Be forewarned.&amp;nbsp; If you listen to this podcast for an extended period of time, you will become a writer for Lusipurr.com.
The Anime Pacific Experience: This is still the home of Dane and Alex, I think.&amp;nbsp; But they haven't updated their site in over a month.&amp;nbsp; What kind of a jerk does that? Musical Accompaniment:Blisters by Creature Republic
Contact InfoEmail: upapaddle@gmail.comTwitter: http://twitter.com/upapaddleGoogle Plus: Search for upapaddle@gmail.com
If you like what you heard, or detested it with hate of a thousand suns (suns are bitter, bitter stars), leave me a review on iTunes.&amp;nbsp; I'll return the favor, as only podcasters listen to other podcasters.&amp;nbsp;
Thanks for listening!

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/upapaddle/BbPR/~3/AqDqYNJ49m4/up-a-paddle-episode-103-potatoes</link>
            <description>This episode I talk about various bits of old news (so exciting) and review (kind of) the Secret of Kells.&amp;nbsp;
News
Japan Earthquake - Donations are still being accepted by Red Cross
Osamu Dezaki has passed away.&amp;nbsp; RIP.&amp;nbsp;
Apple iPad 2 released - but it still doesn't taste like apples.
Duke Nukem Forever delayed, again - Game devs apparently still chewing their last pieces of gum.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Nintendo 3DS released - The third dimension is boring.&amp;nbsp; Now when the Nintendo 5DS is released, then we'll be playing with power.&amp;nbsp;
Sony hacked - Again and again.
Futurama renewed for two more seasons.&amp;nbsp; So was Venture Bros
Sgt Frog Season 3 licensed.&amp;nbsp; So was Revolutionary Girl Utena
Odd video
The cat with hands.&amp;nbsp; It's disturbing, to say the least.

Review
The Secret of Kells

I'd tell you what the secret is, but then it wouldn't be a secret.&amp;nbsp; Ok, I'll tell you.&amp;nbsp; Hearts, Stars, and Horseshoes, Clovers, and Blue Moons, Pots of Gold, and Rainbows, and me Red Balloons!

Eeeper's Choice -&amp;nbsp; I know Eeeper and Oni are taking a podsabattical right now, but for some reason I felt compelled to play their promo.&amp;nbsp;

Musical Accompaniment
Ordinary Day by Great Big Sea.&amp;nbsp; I suppose it would have been more appropriate to play "End of the World as We Know It" given that the Rapture happpened today, but ah well.

            <description>Yes, I finally have 100 episodes under my belt and it only took me four years.&amp;nbsp; Boy, if I had a penny for every episode I did, I'd have a loonie.&amp;nbsp; A Saskatchewan Roughriders' Loonie, in fact.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And I do.&amp;nbsp; Woo!&amp;nbsp; Of course, if I could only have a penny for every good episode, I think I'd owe money.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Just like George Lucas owes me for the Prequels.
Anyways, because of this Achievement of 100 eppys being unlocked, I take time in this episode to reminisce about the past, realize that this show's past wasn't all that great, and look forward to the future.&amp;nbsp; I also contemplate ways that I can improve things around here.&amp;nbsp; For starters, I can do less reminiscing and just start miniscing more.&amp;nbsp; Better miniscing. The kind of miniscing they did in the good old days, when men were men and women were secretaries.&amp;nbsp; I've been watching a lot of Mad Men lately.&amp;nbsp; I also talk about Gamecation 2010 and review Sin and Punishment: Star Successor for the Wii.

            <description>This week I talk about losing a legend, Mark Hamill's chin and review Star Wars: In Concert.
News Satoshi Kon, director of Paranoia Agent, Millenium Actress, Paprika and much more has passed away.  RIP.  His farewell letter is especially heartbreaking. The whole moe fad is fading - According to Ken Akamatsu anyhow.  Also, harem shows set to make a comeback - according to Ken Akamatsu.&amp;nbsp; Just kidding, he thinks yuri (girl on girl action) is the next big thing.&amp;nbsp;  Return of the Jedi Deleted Scene found - you can see why it was deleted.  There weren't any cgi robots, banthas or babies in the background Star Wars coming to Blu-ray - In other news: the Pope is Catholic, bears poodoo in the woods

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/upapaddle/BbPR/~3/rNqz2WgJrCs/gamecation-2010</link>
            <description>Yes, the much vaunted Gamecation 2010 is here.&amp;nbsp; I've taken a week off from work and plan to squander it by playing video games.&amp;nbsp; A lot.&amp;nbsp; I plan to finish at least four games within five days.&amp;nbsp; There are some who said it couldn't be done (e.g. Donny) but I am set to prove them wrong.&amp;nbsp; Them being Donny.
Here are the games I plan to play from start to completion:

Sin and Punishment 2: Star Successor
No More Heroes 2
Prince of Persia: Forgotten Sands
Uncharted 2: Among Thieves

All the while, I will be tweeting my progress at http://twitter.com/Gamecation2010.&amp;nbsp; Afterwards, I will be doing a podcast on my experiences and my thoughts on each game.&amp;nbsp; I also have a regular episode of UAP that is half edited that I hope to get out soon as well.
If I get time, I will play more games.&amp;nbsp; I may put up a poll so you can vote on the last game for me to attempt.
If this test run goes well, I plan to do this next year as well, but with video streaming.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, I was unable to get that set up in time for this run through.
And now, Gamecation commences!&amp;nbsp;

			<title>Up a Paddle - Episode 98 - E3Dictions (months later)</title>
            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/upapaddle/BbPR/~3/m8kJDA5wA-M/index.php</link>
            <description>This week I transform into a crotchety old man and rant about E3.  You know, the show that was over two months ago.  I also occasionally forget that I told a joke and then tell it again, as per my old man ways.  Enjoy, you darn whippersnappers.  Also, off of my lawn!
Part 1: Intro (0:00 - 1:59) Just some rambling.
Part 2: Predictions (2:00 - 13:30)  You can see what I had predicted at Kentcer.com. I'm a regular Nostradamus, or if you will, a Paul the octopus
Part 3: The Rant (14:17 -24:47)  Wherein I list everything that I think is wrong with the convention and offer up no solutions whatsoever to the concerns that I raised.
Part 4: The Games (24:48 - 48:36) I'm not going to bother listing out all the games that were interesting, because there were a lot.  Rather, here are a few videos of the stand outs (in a particular order, but I'm not telling what that order is):
Epic Mickey 





You'd better believe that I'll be singing the original Mickey Mouse theme song throughout this game, complete with barnyard animal noises.
Journey 





Wait, I'm confused.  Do you play as the small town girl or the city boy?  You know, the one born and raised in South Detroit, I believe.
Kirby: Epic Yarn 





It'd better suck, is all I'm saying.
Metal Gear Solid: Rising 





Raiden can cut pretty well, I guess, but he's no Slap Chop!
Portal 2 





No, I'm not going to make a "the cake is a lie" joke here, as those have become passe as of late.  As have quips about not making "the cake is a lie" jokes.  No, instead, I'd like to mention that we now have a Cold Stone Creamery here in Regina, which is resplendant with cakes of the ice creamed variety.  More importantly, they come in cup sized form.  That's right, cupped cakes with ice cream in the middle.  It is now one of my new goals in life to try one of these creamy confections.  Alas, they are often sold out.  If anyone in the area is at the Creamery and notices that they are in stock, please tweet or email me and I'll be sure to thank you properly.
Project Dust - Now "From Dust" 





This game looks a little bit like Avatar: The Last Airbender, when it comes to elements and such.  Let's just hope M. Night Shymalan is in no way affiliated with this project.
And here's the gameplay video for Wii Party that I mentioned 






Part 5: Epic Annoucment (48:36 - 50:21) Yes, I'm taking a vacation and you need to know. Well, it's more of a staycation or GAMECATION 2010 (tm) if you will, as travelling costs money. So yeah, this is more a challenge to myself to see how many video games I can get done in a five day period, starting on August 30th, 2010.  I may extend it to Labour day, if I don't get burned out before then.  A coworker thinks that I can't do it.  I need to prove him wrong.  Anyway, it should be interesting. For me, that is.
Part 6: Wrap up (51:26 - 52:10) Wherein I close the show.  It's exhilarating.
Contact Info You can email me at upapaddle@gmail.com or follow me on twitter at http://twitter.com/upapaddle.
Promotional consideration given to: The Animentors (13:30 - 14:16):  They finally released a new episode!  Prodigious, as they might say.  However, Lord Moonstone sounds awfully strange in this one.   Anime Pacific (24:48 - 25:47).  The race to 100 episodes is on.  I think I might win!  RPGLamer (50:22 - 51:25).  The race to 100 episodes is on.  I think I might win!
Musical Accompaniment (52:11 - 58:50) The song played on my old timey gramaphone was "Hyrules Angel the Sleeping Beauty - Zelda cover" by Game Over.
Thanks for listening!

            <description>This week I talk about the "Our Body: The Universe Within" exhibit currently at the Saskatchewan Science Center and not much else.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Information on the exhibit can be found at http://www.ourbodytheuniversewithin.com/ EDIT: In this episode I said the adult human body had 213 bones.  I meant to say the infant human body has 213 and the adult body has 206.   Videos of Interest: The Skeleton Dance  





 Yeah, it doesn't take much to get me to post that video.   Them Dry Bones - As Performed by the Wiggles  





 Now that's infotainment!.  That song is sure a lot more religous than I remember it in school.
Contact Info You can email me at upapaddle@gmail.com or check out my twitter at http://twitter.com/upapaddle.
Promotional consideration given to: Fightbait Podcast - I miss the old promo because riffing on "It's like the pie" never gets old for me.  For instance, it's like the pie ... ok, well I have nothing this time, but next time, boy howdy I'll ... probably have nothing then too.    Eeeper's Choice - Eeeper played my promo on his last episode. Yay!  But he also called me a neophyte.  Booh!  Technically, I've been at this podcasting racket a few months longer than you Eeeper.  My show may not be good but it is old. And how! Bearing that in mind, feel free to call me sempai or Doctor Of Podcasting Excellence.
Anime Pacific - Although I didn't play their promo this time, I'd be remiss if didn't link to this podcast given all the mentions I gave to it in this show.&amp;nbsp; Also, I'm afraid of what Dane might do to me if I don't.&amp;nbsp; If I'm not back in a couple months, tell my family that I love them and that I'm part of a lovely display.
Musical Accompaniment The song played was Good Looking Corpse by Sunspot Thanks for listening

I wasn't able to get an episode out this month but will have one in the next two days.&amp;nbsp; I've been having some sound issues that I've been working out and hopefully everything should now be good to go. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I do have about 3 to 4 episodes written, so I should be soon able to get back on a semi-regular schedule.&amp;nbsp; I apologize for the wait.&amp;nbsp;

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/upapaddle/BbPR/~3/3SX0P8a2mYU/index.php</link>
            <description>This episode I talk about copyright and copywrong, black Spider-men, and the end of the anime industry as we know it.&amp;nbsp; I also talk about the iPhone 4 since that's all I can do up here in Canada.&amp;nbsp; That is, talk about it.&amp;nbsp; We sure aren't getting them any time soon.&amp;nbsp; Bastards.&amp;nbsp; I also review the anime One Outs.  Full show notes&amp;nbsp;will be up in a day or two. EDIT: Or a month.&amp;nbsp; Sorry about that. &amp;nbsp;
News
Canadian Copyright Reform Bill tabled.&amp;nbsp; 
Here's the link I mentioned when talking about copyright reform in Canada.&amp;nbsp; This form will autogenerate an email voicing concern&amp;nbsp;the new bill&amp;nbsp;to the PM, your MP, and&amp;nbsp;other concerned parties. http://www.ccer.ca/send-a-letter-to-ottawa-to-stop-the-canadian-dmca/&amp;nbsp; iPhone 4 Announced ... and it's out now as of July 30, 2010 in Canada.&amp;nbsp; And I got one.&amp;nbsp; Woot!Funimation up for sale?&amp;nbsp; I'm pretty sure I mispronounced the company name Navarre.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, I haven't heard anything about this sale lately, so I'm assuming it hasn't gone through yet.Donald Glover as the next Spider-man: Nope, they gave it to some British tosser.&amp;nbsp; For shame, Sony Entertainment.&amp;nbsp; Review:One Outs 






In this show they found a way to make baseball less boring.&amp;nbsp; Or gambling more boring, I suppose.&amp;nbsp; Here's the wikipedia article I mentioned during the podcast:&amp;nbsp; African Painted Dog

I need a new microphone.&amp;nbsp; The Blue Snowball mic I'm using is causing me nothing but headaches.&amp;nbsp; It seems to be clipping or popping or something.&amp;nbsp; I have two pop filters on the darn thing and a spider mount and it still picks up clicks every five to ten seconds.&amp;nbsp; It's the reason this episode took so long to come out.&amp;nbsp; And there's no firmware or drivers I can use to fix the low gain in Windows 7.&amp;nbsp; So far I've had the Audio Technica AT2020 USB and Blue Yeti recommended to me.&amp;nbsp; What do you guys use?&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
News
The Smurfs movie pictures leaked.&amp;nbsp; Take a look at the pictures here and be afraid.&amp;nbsp; Be very afraid.    
Review
Final Fantasy XIII  I'm sure that if you were at all interested in this game you would have picked it up by now, but I've reviewed it anyway.&amp;nbsp; Because I'm nothing if not timely and relevant.&amp;nbsp; Speaking of which, have you heard about this new show Lost.&amp;nbsp; I hear it's about a magical island with polar bears and Tim Daly.&amp;nbsp;
Anyway, here's the trailer for the game:







And here's the Chocobo music:







Promotional Consideration given to:
RPGLamer - I look forward to Jake's thoughts on this game.&amp;nbsp; Given that he's the resident RPG expert, I'm sure he'll have a lot to say about it.&amp;nbsp; That is, if his mouth isn't full of Double Downs.&amp;nbsp; Also, let this be a warning to you.&amp;nbsp; If you have a podcast and you let it lapse, I will steal it from you.&amp;nbsp; I did it to Eeeper (see here), and I'll do it to you.&amp;nbsp; I've got my eye on you, Animentors.&amp;nbsp; I'll abridge the hell out of your podcast.&amp;nbsp;
Fightbait - It's like the PI: &amp;nbsp;3.14159265... or as we've learned from the Bible, 3.

            <description>This week I talk about old news, because it is so exciting.&amp;nbsp; I also review "Street Fighter: The complete History" by Chris Carle, whose hair is also very exciting!  News Paprika Live Action Movie in the works.&amp;nbsp; Here's the opening to the animated counterpart.&amp;nbsp; Do you guys think it will work as a live action movie? I sure hope so.







Also, watch Paprika the anime.&amp;nbsp; This is not negotiable.&amp;nbsp;   Bleach Live Action Movie - Warner Bros is in talks to acquire movie rights for manga.&amp;nbsp; This movie will have the biggest swords this side of a Final Fantasy game.&amp;nbsp; Also, if you're wondering, my bankai is huge, just so you know.&amp;nbsp; It can talk, too.  Aniplex to release Gurren Lagann movies on DVD.&amp;nbsp; Excellent.&amp;nbsp; I was just thinking about how I wanted to be charged up the wazoo for content that I've mostly already bought on DVD.&amp;nbsp; I say that now, but when the eventual blu-ray release is released, I'll be first in line.&amp;nbsp; To the Bandai website, I guess, as they aren't releasing the discs anywhere else.&amp;nbsp;   iPhone prototype leaked&amp;nbsp; I think Jon Stewart had the best take on this whole debacle, so you'd be better off listening to him.&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; Nintendo 3DS announced.&amp;nbsp; It will come in red and more red. KFC Double Down.&amp;nbsp; It's just a matter of time before this gets combined with the KFC bowl. And that will be the end of civilization.&amp;nbsp; It's what the Mayan's predicted.&amp;nbsp; For more food porn, go to thisiswhyyourefat.com.   NHL and Anime?&amp;nbsp; I for one am disappointed that they won't be adding big googly eyes to the pucks during regulation games.&amp;nbsp;   Carl Macek has passed away.&amp;nbsp; RIP.&amp;nbsp;
Review"Street Fighter: The Complete History."&amp;nbsp; Conspicuously absent from this book:&amp;nbsp; Jackie Chan.&amp;nbsp; You had to know I'd go there.&amp;nbsp; That's my go-to clip.&amp;nbsp; Speaking of which, has anyone heard anything about the live action City Hunter tv series that was going to be made?&amp;nbsp; Last I heard, Fox optioned it but since it doesn't involve teenagers that sing from the heart into autotuned microphones, it may have fallen by the wayside.
Here's the Daigo - Wong matchup I was telling you about.&amp;nbsp;

Promotional Consideration given to: Eeeper's Choice and Kung Fu Flicken - Eeeper, if you're taking recommendations, the original Drunken Master would be a nifty choice for a Kung Fu movie to review. If you want to continue with the Kamikaze theme, Dane turned me on ... to Kamikaze Taxi and that is an excellent film as well.&amp;nbsp; I recommend everyone here check it out if they get a chance.
Anime Pacific&amp;nbsp; - I've been intrigued by the Summer Wars debate that has gone on during the last few episodes of Anime Pacific, and am going to try watching the movie tomorrow to see on which side of the divide I end up sitting.&amp;nbsp; However, I'm starting to worry a little about my taste in anime as I watched Odin last week and kinda liked it.&amp;nbsp;
Spiraken Manga Review&amp;nbsp; - Congrats on 100 episodes Xan!&amp;nbsp; That's a lot of spinning your wheel!&amp;nbsp; That was lame.&amp;nbsp; I apologize.
Musical Accompaniment: The song played was Time Off by the Kellys Thanks for listening!

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/upapaddle/BbPR/~3/mx4KZa1KMLU/index.php</link>
            <description>This week I talk about some lovely angels, a nifty talking squirrel and stand alongside John Cusack in the Heavy Rain. 







News  Dirty Pair TV licensed by Right Stuf's Nozomi Entertainment.&amp;nbsp; Maybe if we are really lucky, we can get the Dirty Pair's first animated appearance licensed as well (again).&amp;nbsp; That's right, Crusher Joe.&amp;nbsp; Hey, it's worth a shot.
Conan O'Brien's comeback tour.&amp;nbsp; Conan's squirrel approves.&amp;nbsp; As does his beard, Ford Taurus, sharpie, and freckles
Super Mario Galaxy and Metroid: Other M out this summer.&amp;nbsp; This announcement was a relief as I was worried that I'd have nothing to play this summer, except Yakuza 3, Bayonetta, Final Fantasy XIII, Darksiders ...
Review Heavy Rain  






If I was clever, I'd have called this episode "Get your ass to Mars!".&amp;nbsp; It fits since you are trying to save Shawn Mars.&amp;nbsp; Eh, that's why I'm not clever. &amp;nbsp;
For more info on the plot holes of this game, go to this spoilerific blow by blow at GamesRadar.com&amp;nbsp;  I have to admit, I felt a little dirty after playing this game. I should go take a shower, like my new hero Madison in Heavy Rain  Contact Info You can email me at upapaddle@gmail.com or follow me on twitter at http://twitter.com/upapaddle.   Promotional Consideration Anime 82 - Keep your ears peeled (ew) for a very special episode of Anime 82.&amp;nbsp; And by special, I mean all OVA reviews.&amp;nbsp; I might be on it.&amp;nbsp;    RPG Lamer - Jake hasn't had an episode out for a while and that's understandable as there haven't been a lot of high profile RPG's released recently.&amp;nbsp; Oh wait a minute.
Musical Accompaniment  The song played was Rainy Day by Lucky Day Thanks for listening!

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/upapaddle/BbPR/~3/LM8cC0DL9Qk/index.php</link>
            <description>This week I talk about gold in them thar hills (British Columbia); Y2K the revengening; intrigue in the time of dragons; movie remakes and please don't makes; and a large chunk of rock floating in the vacuum of space.&amp;nbsp; I also review Moon, the 2009 sci fi movie that you didn't watch.&amp;nbsp; Shame on you.&amp;nbsp;
News
Vancouver 2010 Olympics happened. Upapaddle.com was not there, but I did see some of it on my tv.
PS3 bug wrecks up the place.&amp;nbsp; Only the original PS3 models were affected.&amp;nbsp; You know, the ones that need to buy an extra seat when they fly Southwest Airlines.&amp;nbsp;
A Game of Thrones tv series greenlit by HBO.&amp;nbsp; Now which will come first, season five or "A Dance of Dragons"?&amp;nbsp;
Spider-man cast&amp;nbsp;* I'm glad they got a teenager this time.&amp;nbsp; After all Spider-man is basically a metaphor for puberty.&amp;nbsp; He notices his body is changing, there's hair where there wasn't hair before, and he has an urge to shoot his "webbing" when he's alone in his room. Also, when I was his age, I could walk on walls.&amp;nbsp;
Gilligan's Island, Space Invaders, and Police Academy movies in development.&amp;nbsp; Hollywood has officially run out of ideas.&amp;nbsp; Aw screw it, paint everyone involved in blue, shoot them in 3d and you'll have a bevy of billion dollar blockbusters.
Review
Moon







For more Moon information, go outside and look up.&amp;nbsp; Only if it's dark out, though.    Since this podcast is lunar themed, I'd be remiss if I didn't post the following video.&amp;nbsp; Kate Micucci's Mr. Moon.







And here's the Gertie video: 






Promotional consideration given to: Luke and Elliot's Bearfighting Extravaganza&amp;nbsp;- I think we should start a petition to get bear fighting at the 2014 Olympics.&amp;nbsp;
The Moon Masters&amp;nbsp;- To quote The Gospel of Mick Aloha, "if you see a gator, run!"&amp;nbsp; As true today as when it was written.&amp;nbsp;
 The Animentors&amp;nbsp;- Kent is a jerkâ&amp;nbsp; An&amp;nbsp;AWESOME jerk.&amp;nbsp; And yes, I used an interrobang there.&amp;nbsp; Just like I interrobanged your moms.&amp;nbsp;

            <description>This week I talk about fighting in the streets, despair about punny teachers, talk about the latest kentagion, and command my podcasting brethren to entertain me.&amp;nbsp; I also talk about Coyote Ragtime Show.&amp;nbsp;
News Sayanora Zetsubo Sensei and Legend of the Overfiend licensed by Media Blasters.&amp;nbsp; Hmm.&amp;nbsp; Tentacles and school girls.&amp;nbsp; What an odd combination.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Street Fighter IV on the iPhone.&amp;nbsp; I bet Madcatz will have a $200 joystick attachment for this game in no time. The iFightPad.&amp;nbsp; New Super Street Fighter IV characters announced.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I guess we'll need to wait for Super Duper Street Fighter IV for R. Mika to make her appearance.&amp;nbsp; BUMBA!!
Review Coyote Ragtime Show
&amp;nbsp;It's no Cowboy Bebop, but neither is Origin: Spirits of the Past.&amp;nbsp; Wait a minute, that show sucked.&amp;nbsp; Ragtime on the other hand is a decent show, but it could have used a little more ragtime.&amp;nbsp; See the following video for more on this delightful musical genre:
Promotional Consideration given to:Eeeper's choice: http://eeeperschoice.com - Since apparently you read these show notes Eeeper, please release the fabled lost episode of I Heart the 80s that Dane keeps mentioning on Anime Pacific and I promise to lay off the potshots and will focus on doing zingers instead.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Anime Pacific: http://animepacific.blogspot.com - Since apparently you read these show notes Dane, I just want to point out that Canada is kicking Australia's ass at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. That's what you get for having winter during the summer time.&amp;nbsp; Also, our curlers are #1.&amp;nbsp; GO CANADA!

            <description>This week I talk about Gintama, reading for fun, and digital manipulation.&amp;nbsp; I also some other stuff, probably.&amp;nbsp; And I review No More Heros for the Wii.  This episode is dedicated to the fine folks at Anime Pacific.&amp;nbsp; I have finally surpassed them, if only for a brief window, in terms of episode count.&amp;nbsp; Mwah ha ha.&amp;nbsp; My 10 day release schedule is undoubtedly superior to their biweekly schedule.*
News 
 Gintama to be released on DVD Or you could just check it out at Crunchyroll.&amp;nbsp; Do it now. I can wait.
Imagi Entertainment to lay off staff.&amp;nbsp; I guess Nick Cage's hair wasn't wild enough to save the Astro Boy movie.&amp;nbsp; Maybe if they release it on dvd with the rumored deleted scenes where his character runs around in a bear suit and punches out old ladies.
Nintendo is working on new hardware - This one will be 2 Wii's duct taped together.
Fun thing of the episode

 Part 2







Catching up with Kent
Like I mentioned in the show, I'm currently reading The Art of Osamu Tezuka: God of Manga by Helen McCarthy.&amp;nbsp; I forgot to mention that I'm also watching The Kids in the Hall: Death Comes to Town.&amp;nbsp; I mention this now because for once I'm on the right end of "This content is not available in your country"&amp;nbsp; Suck on it, Hulu.
 Review
No More Heroes 
It's crass, vulgar, and morally questionable.  I loved it.  Here's the trailer:

            <description>This week I talk about the iPad, the second Late Night War and I review Case Closed.&amp;nbsp;
News  The iPad is unleased upon the masses.&amp;nbsp; And lo, there was much rejoicing in the lands.&amp;nbsp;      
In regards to the whole late night goings on, check out some of the videos at tv.gawker.com:
&amp;nbsp;


Letterman&amp;nbsp;- No one is blaming Conan and a visit from Norm MacDonald
The Bugatti Veyron Mouse and a cameo by an old friend


Here's Conan's Farewell speech 






Also, here's the Taiwanese video described the Late Night War 2: Electric Bugaloo 






And here's a camel punch 







Finally, here's one of my favorite Conan moments (also with Norm MacDonald)
&amp;nbsp;







&amp;nbsp;Now that Conan's looking for a new job, is it time to revive the almost classic Lookwell!&amp;nbsp; Yes, yes it is.







Review
Case Closed - The Time Bombed Skyscraper in particular &amp;nbsp;







I can't believe I forgot to mention Conan's catch phrase, "One Truth Prevails" in my review.&amp;nbsp; Ah well.&amp;nbsp; This show is based on the manga version of Kindergarten Cop, in that the mangaka saw the title Kindergarten Cop and totally misinterpreted it.&amp;nbsp; You should watch it.&amp;nbsp; Good stuff.

First off, would you like some pancakes?NewsSony, Discovery Channel and IMAX to bring you one of the&amp;nbsp;first TV channels in 3D.&amp;nbsp; And yet again Smellovision gets snubbed.&amp;nbsp; Can you imagine how much better Man v. Food would be with smellovision?&amp;nbsp; Or Dirty Jobs?
Yeah, I'll try and find some more stories to talk about next week.&amp;nbsp; I've been slacking off in this area and I apologize.
Email, Awesome! This week I talk about being mentioned on other podcasts and catch up on the comments on the site that I might have missed the first time around.
Fun Video of the WeekBarefoot Gen - as performed by Smurfs

            <description>This week I talk about the Elephant Dance (unfortunately,&amp;nbsp;not this one) and review The Princess and the Frog.&amp;nbsp; NewsCrayon Shin-Chan MMO on the way.&amp;nbsp; They should get the Funimation team to translate it to English.&amp;nbsp; It would be 18A, that's for sure. Or, they could just go ahead and dub more Shin-chan.&amp;nbsp; That would be good too.
Fun Video of the EpisodeComing to Alderaan&amp;nbsp;
AHA!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have seen Coming to America more times than I'd care to admit.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It was one of the few movies we had taped on VHS,&amp;nbsp;so I saw that, Rustler's Rhapsody, and Back to the Future Part II many, many times over.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I really need to rip off the &amp;quot;I Heart the 80s&amp;quot; podcast again and talk about those gems of the silver screen.&amp;nbsp; 
ReviewThe Princess and the Frog
I was a little worried that in this episode I gave away more of the plot of the movie than I should have, but after watching this trailer, I realize that I was beaten to the punch.&amp;nbsp; 
Well, I do have to say that, when it comes to race relations,&amp;nbsp;Disney's come a long way.&amp;nbsp; Check out Mickey's Mellerdrammer to see what I mean:I bet &amp;quot;The Princess and the Frog&amp;quot; has Walt Disney's frozen head spinning in &amp;quot;The Vault&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; At least it can watch Song of the South, because that one's never seeing the light of day again.&amp;nbsp; Contact info:You can email me at upapaddle@gmail.com and follow me on twitter at http://twitter.com/upapaddle.&amp;nbsp; You can also try skyping me with Skype ID upapaddle.&amp;nbsp; 
Promotional Consideration Given To:The Ninja Consultants - They recently released another episode, so check it out.&amp;nbsp; Equally entertaining is Erin Finnegan's column &amp;quot;Shelf Life&amp;quot; at http://animenewsnetwork.com, partly for the content and partly for the inevitable flamewar that&amp;nbsp;ensues after every one.
Destroy All Podcasts DX - They did an episode on&amp;nbsp;a Muppet Christmas special and ended up talking about the reproductive cycle of the Aliens from Aliens.&amp;nbsp; Good stuff.

Lathers Blathers&amp;nbsp;- After six months, Rich &amp;quot;Lather&amp;quot; Tatarek has come out of hiding and has graced us with another episode.&amp;nbsp; Fignuts.&amp;nbsp; I was enjoying having marginally higher feedburner statistics than him.&amp;nbsp; I guess it goes to show the relative qualities of our shows.&amp;nbsp; I'd be petty and start arching him but I'm already being petty and arching Anime Pacific, and I don't have time for two archenemies.&amp;nbsp; Ah well.&amp;nbsp; Musical AccompanimentThe song played was Rock N Roll Man by Mr. Nasty

            <description>This week I talk about the &amp;quot;dark spectre of moe&amp;quot;*, manga possessing your cell phone and I review Ghostbusters for the PS3.

NewsAccording to one poll, otaku&amp;nbsp;guys prefer moe and otaku gals prefer robot shows.&amp;nbsp; I have obtained a video of the horrible future that will result when the two ideas are inevitably combined to form a marketing juggernaut in Japan:Shueisha to sell manga on US Phones next year.&amp;nbsp; If I had bothered to re-read the article before talking about it on the podcast, I would have realized that Shueisha is partnering up with Microsoft to do this, so their manga will most likely not be appearing on the iPhone.&amp;nbsp; Nuts, and I'm all set to get one when my current contract expires.Fun Video of the EpisodeI didn't actually mention this video in the episode but I think it's fitting.&amp;nbsp; Ghostbusters - The PremakeSpeaking of spooky movies from the 40's, does anyone know where I can find a copy of Gildersleeve's Ghost?&amp;nbsp; I caught part of it late on Halloween night and I want to see the rest.&amp;nbsp; There was an invisible woman and a gorilla for some reason.&amp;nbsp; ReviewGhostbusters: The GameAnd for the curious amongst you, this is what the Filmation version of the Ghostbusters was like:It was an all right cartoon but it just wasn't the Ghostbusters.EDIT:&amp;nbsp; In my review I said that Ray Gossett Jr.&amp;nbsp; did the Ghostbusters theme.&amp;nbsp; This is wrong.&amp;nbsp; Ray Parker Jr. did the theme.&amp;nbsp; I'm not sure why I got those names mixed up.Contact InfoYou can email me at upapaddle@gmail.com and check out my Twitter feed at http://twitter.com/upapaddle.

            <description>(It has to be pronounced A-OK in order for the joke to work ... which it doesn't).This week I talk about pandas and their relevance to my gaming purchases, Leggo my Lego, the seeing of the Astro boy movie (because I told you to damn it), and I also review Hakaba Kitaro just in time for Halloween ... next year.

PreambleHappy Belated Halloween everyone!

Check out this costume.&amp;nbsp; This could have been me.&amp;nbsp; 

News

Blizzard to add new pets to World of Warcraft.&amp;nbsp; They cost real money like real pets, but less mess.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Here's one in action:Lego Mario - That's a lot of Lego.&amp;nbsp; I must have one.- Here's a previous attempt at Mario in Lego form

- Also, not stop motion but still neat

Astro Boy - the movie not doing so well.&amp;nbsp; I can't help but think that my review has something to do with the poor sales.&amp;nbsp; Yes, I'm that delusional.&amp;nbsp; Check it out if you get a chance.&amp;nbsp; 

Fun video of the Episode:The Horribly Slow Murderer with the Extremely Inefficient WeaponWarning: The previous video contains salty language, scenes of violence, and adult situations.&amp;nbsp; View discretion is advised.Site NewsI have aquired Up a Padddle's first ever site deal!&amp;nbsp; If you listen to this episode, you will hear a promo code for 5 free Switch Bucks from Playswitch.com.&amp;nbsp; If you're in the states, I implore you to try it out.&amp;nbsp; Who knows when I'll be able to secure another promo deal like this.Also, listen to the Playswitch.com podcast.&amp;nbsp; Good stuff.

Angry DomeAudio promos and you, the podcaster.&amp;nbsp; ReviewHakaba Kitaro

How can you not want to watch that show after seeing that opening.

Also, there's a special deal from http://playswitch.com waiting for you if you listen to this episode.&amp;nbsp; Nifty!

Promotional Consideration given to:Anime World Order - If you get chance (and chances are you have already), listen to their &amp;quot;Old Timers of Anime&amp;quot; segments.&amp;nbsp; Let it take you back to a time when men were men and the women were too.As it is, I fear for the otaku of today, what with guys liking moe and girls liking the robit shows.

Eeepers Choice (http://eeeperschoice.com and http://capricorntheater.com) - Yes, I know Eeeper hasn't released an episode of either of his podcasts in quite a while but I decided to play his promo anyway.&amp;nbsp; After intensive study of mythology, I've come to the conclusion that his podcasts&amp;nbsp;are dead because we don't believe enough.&amp;nbsp; Clap with me children, Clap! I believe in potatoes!&amp;nbsp; I believe in potatoes!If you haven't yet, check out Eeeper's interview with Helen McCarthy.&amp;nbsp; Good stuff.

And just think, this could be your promo played next episode if you only make it readily available on your site.

            <description>This week I talk about Astro Boy.&amp;nbsp; I also announce the winner of the &amp;quot;Zombie Survival Plan&amp;quot; contest.
NewsNew DSi - the DSi LL.&amp;nbsp; I guess my relatives were right.&amp;nbsp; Those darn video games will ruin your eyesight.&amp;nbsp; At least Nintendo has you covered.&amp;nbsp; 
PS3 to offer Netflix Streaming.&amp;nbsp; I hear they will be offering a similar service as other streaming sites do in Canada.&amp;nbsp; They will provide you with a disc and when you pop it in it will say, &amp;quot;This service is not available in your region&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; 
ReviewAstro BoyI guess this movie isn't doing too well theatrically.&amp;nbsp; I may need to go see it again.&amp;nbsp; You should go see it too, or rent it when it comes on dvd.&amp;nbsp;Promotional Consideration given to:Ani-Gamers - For quite a while I wasn't able to get their promo off of their feed but it looks like that has been rectified.&amp;nbsp; Check them out if you haven't already.&amp;nbsp; Also, pro-tip to any other anime podcast that for which I haven't yet played a promo (well amateur-tip, since it's coming from me): If you have a podcast, put a link to your promo on your front page!&amp;nbsp; People can't play your promo if they can't reach it.&amp;nbsp; Animentors - Guys, release another episode already! Get your priorities straight.&amp;nbsp; Podcast, then school.&amp;nbsp;Just like I do (except last week ...)Musical Accompaniment:Im a Robot by Boy Novice

            <description>It looks like the wrong episode was attached to this blog post. This has been corrected.&amp;nbsp; I apologize for the mix-up.


This week I talk about Tatsunoko vs Capcom, doing the Mario, and review Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland and the Zombie Survival Guide.




NewsNew characters revealed for Tatsunoko vs Capcom - And once again, the Mach&amp;nbsp;V get's rejected.&amp;nbsp; Captain Lou Albano RIP.&amp;nbsp;Here's the&amp;nbsp;Mario.&amp;nbsp; Commence&amp;nbsp;doing it.&amp;nbsp; I mean&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Doing the Mario&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hey, check this outPlayswitch.com, now with online game trading.&amp;nbsp; That's Playswitch.com.&amp;nbsp;

            <description>This week I talk about buying the cow when the milk is free, keeping Domo-kun away from kittens, PLAYSWITCH.COM, and I review Bruce Campbell vs the Army of Darkness and My Name is Bruce.&amp;nbsp; 
News:Discotek to release Fist of the North Star tv, a Lupin special and Sea Prince and the Fire Child.&amp;nbsp; I forgot to mention that Sea Prince and Fire Princess is a Sanrio production.&amp;nbsp; They make Hello Kitty and more importantly, Ringing Bell.&amp;nbsp; I can't wait to show my nephew that cartoon.&amp;nbsp; It'll screw him up real good.Domo-kun coming to 7-11.&amp;nbsp; Here's the short I mentioned:
I need a Domo-kun toque like right now!
CONTEST TIMESend in your zombie survival plan, either via voicemail or email, to upapaddle@gmail.com and you could win a copy of &amp;quot;The Zombie Survival Guide&amp;quot; by Max Brooks.&amp;nbsp; All you have to do is give me a few brief sentences describing how you'll be handling the impending zombie apocalypse.&amp;nbsp; I'll be accepting entries until October 27, 2009, so enter now.ReviewsBruce Campbell vs The Army of Darkness
Yes, I realize that any self respecting geek has seen this movie already and it doesn't need&amp;nbsp;a review (also, it's over 16 years old), but it was fun to talk about.&amp;nbsp; Also, on retrospect, that trailer spoils an awful lot.&amp;nbsp; Oh well.My Name is Bruce&amp;nbsp;
I also realize that Guan Di isn't technically a zombie, although I refer to him as such in the review.&amp;nbsp; My bad.&amp;nbsp; And since I mentioned them, here's some Silly Symphonies:The Skeleton DanceRandom Fact: That was Disney's first Silly Symphony and it&amp;nbsp;was released&amp;nbsp;in 1929.The Old MillThis one was the first Silly Symphony to make use of Disney's multiplane camera.&amp;nbsp; Back in the day, the Silly Symphonies were testing grounds for new animation techniques, much like how Pixar treats their Pixar shorts that you see before each Pixar movie.&amp;nbsp;

Promotional Consideration given to:Anime 82 - http://anime82.blogspot.com.&amp;nbsp; Although, with&amp;nbsp;his release schedule as of late, you might have a better chance of catching&amp;nbsp;Regan on Anime Pacific.&amp;nbsp; He left quite the voicemail to Dane and Alex in their latest episode.&amp;nbsp; It was kinda tough to understand him, though, with his ragin' Saskatchewan accent.&amp;nbsp; Which is odd, because I have the same ragin' Saskatchewan accent.&amp;nbsp; And a mellow one, too.The RPGLamer Podcast - http://rpglamer.com.&amp;nbsp; Although, with his release schedule as of late, you might have a better chance of catching Jake on Anime 82&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;See what I did there?Speaking of promoting stuff, I also mentioned in this show how Playswitch.com sent me an email to see if I would be interested in some cross promoting.&amp;nbsp; Eh, why the heck not?

            <description>This week I talk about hobbits, power rangers, the general geography of Florida and I review Miami Guns.&amp;nbsp; Full show notes can be found at http://upapaddle.comNewsNew Line settles with Tolkien Estate, Hobbit movies to move forward.That's some serious bling bling that they can take all the way to Mordor ... and then drop in into&amp;nbsp;a volcano.&amp;nbsp; I'm not sure where I was going with that.Tommy the Green Ranger to fight in MMA.&amp;nbsp; SPOILER ALERT: It is with great sorrow that I report that, from what I learned from AWO's latest promo, the Green Ranger died.&amp;nbsp; Jason Frank, we hardly knew you.
Star Ocean: Last Hope International announced for PS3.&amp;nbsp; That's right, come to UAP for all&amp;nbsp;the latest&amp;nbsp;RPG news.&amp;nbsp; You definitely didn't hear this from the other RPG podcasts yet.&amp;nbsp; Also another thing they forgot to mention, Valkyria Chronicles is awesome.&amp;nbsp; 
PS3 RPG Developers screwing Microsoft over.&amp;nbsp; Come on Namco Bandai, I want Tales of Vesperia for PS3 now.&amp;nbsp; Could you try screwing Microsoft a little faster?
ReviewMiami Guns
Visit scenic Florida, land of the podcasters!&amp;nbsp; Visit the majestic&amp;nbsp;mountains, the serene deserts, and&amp;nbsp;prodigious jungles brimming with wildlife!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Just be sure to bring your gun.&amp;nbsp; There are&amp;nbsp;Americans in those jungles!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;To be fair, though, some of them&amp;nbsp;are only there on a cruise.Also, beware of exploding fruit.

Promotional Consideration given to: 
Spiraken Manga Review - I don't know why, but for some reason I really like that promo.
Fightbait Anime/Video/Westie Podcast - I'm not a big fan of&amp;nbsp;Fightbait's new Westie Wednesday segment as pugs are clearly the superior breed of dog.&amp;nbsp; Yes, every day is Pugsday here at upapaddle.comLook at this little guy, he's dog tired:
If you're wondering, that was Ollie the Pug and his blog can be found&amp;nbsp;here.&amp;nbsp;Musical consideration given&amp;quot;If I was a Cop&amp;quot; by Russell WolffThanks for listening!

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/upapaddle/BbPR/~3/0JmBVmb1-Dc/index.php</link>
            <description>This week I talk about Black Jack.&amp;nbsp; The doctor, not the game.&amp;nbsp; Specifically, I talked about &amp;quot;The Four Miracles of Life&amp;quot; specials, which can be streamed legally at Crunchyroll.com.&amp;nbsp; Check them out!NewsDisney buys Marvel.&amp;nbsp; I think the following picture sums the deal up nicely:
 From Comicmix.com Please, oh please, won't someone think of the rollercoasters?Fantastic Four to get reboot.&amp;nbsp; Whoever green lit this picture should get a good booting.&amp;nbsp; To the head.&amp;nbsp; I guess at least we'll get to see new suits for the FF family, complete with molded nipples.&amp;nbsp; Yes, Thing nipples.&amp;nbsp;Okamiden for the DS&amp;nbsp;- Look at him, he's just a little puppy!&amp;nbsp;Who's a good boy?&amp;nbsp; Who's a good boy?&amp;nbsp; Fetch!Also, he's seemed to attracted a Midna type character.&amp;nbsp; Interesting.&amp;nbsp; Much more interesting than the mention I gave it in the episode, but to be fair, I hadn't seen the trailer when I did my recording.Science news: Saturn's rings will disappear on September 4th, 2009.&amp;nbsp; I blame swing dancing, and the Internet.More Fightsticks on the way.&amp;nbsp; And more after that.&amp;nbsp;And one more for good measure.ReviewBlack Jack: The Four Miracles of Life&amp;nbsp;*Yes, there are only four miracles in life and one of them involves a supercomputer.&amp;nbsp; You can find them at Crunchyroll.com* The specials didn't have this opening sequence but I put it here to give you an idea of what the character designs and animation looked like.Promotional consideration given to:RPGLamer.com - Jake and I are planning on recording another episode together soon, that is if I can be dragged away from Valkyria Chronicles long enough.&amp;nbsp; You brought this on yourself, Jake.Anime World Order - for an indepth, informed review of Black Jack, check out this episode.&amp;nbsp; For more&amp;nbsp;information&amp;nbsp;on the God of Manga himself, Osamu Tezuka, check out this AWO episode.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, check out the Astro Boy Essays, by Fred Schodt.&amp;nbsp; Good stuff.Musical Accompaniment Doctor by BloomContact InfoYou can email me at upapaddle@gmail.com, visit the blog and leave a comment on the BRAND NEW Comment system DISQUS, follow me at http://twitter.com/upapaddle, or try Skyping me with Skype ID upapaddle.&amp;nbsp; Also, I feel kinda bad for using &amp;quot;What's up, Doc?&amp;quot; without referencing Looney Tunes once, so here's a cartoon.Falling Hare Fans of the old kentcer.com site probably recognize this one as I've posted it on at least one other occasion.&amp;nbsp; I have a particular fondness for this&amp;nbsp;particular Bugs Bunny cartoon as I used to have it on an old vhs tape when I was younger and&amp;nbsp;I used to&amp;nbsp;watch it over and over again.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As Bob of WQOQ.com would&amp;nbsp;say, I would have still been in diapers then.&amp;nbsp; The repeat viewings&amp;nbsp;may have been due to the lack&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;age appropriate vhs tapes in our household.&amp;nbsp; I sure saw Coming to&amp;nbsp;America and Rhustler's Rhapsody a lot, though.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ah, memories.Thanks for listening!

            <description>This week's episode is all about treasure, and the finding of said treasure.&amp;nbsp; I talk about Cat's Eye, Uncharted: Drakes Fortune, and Zack and Wiki: Quest for Barbaros Treasure.&amp;nbsp;

            <description>This week I talk about a big moose.&amp;nbsp; I also review Fat Princess, Big Man Japan, and Shadow of the Colossus

NewsSony PS3 Slim Announced&amp;nbsp;- What they don't tell you is that it they performed liposuction on the features in order to slim it down.&amp;nbsp; Namely, no more Linux. 

PSP miniS&amp;nbsp;- I may have been mistaken about the capitalization on this one.&amp;nbsp; My bad

Funimation to begin re-streaming One Piece.&amp;nbsp; I haven't watched the show for a while but it looks like it is catching up with the manga.&amp;nbsp; So they are just in time to start airing the filler!&amp;nbsp; Hopefully it's just as good as the Naruto filler was.&amp;nbsp; Mmmm, curry of life!

Speaking of large things, Here's Mac the Moose.&amp;nbsp; He's glorious

And here's a song about Moose Jaw, I've been to Moose Jaw by John WingFat PrincessesI wonder if there would have been an uproar if it had been Disney Princesses.&amp;nbsp; Now that's a game I'd like to see.

Big Man JapanBABY JUSTICE!Shadow of the ColossusFull disclosure:&amp;nbsp; for the longest time, I thought the horse's name was Arrow.&amp;nbsp; Boy was that an awkward imaginary conversation between Argo and Wander.&amp;nbsp; Yes, even in video games, I'm awkward.

Promotional Consideration given to:Anime82 - Speaking of big things, what happened to Kaiju82? Anime Pacific - They recently updated their site layout.&amp;nbsp; Mark my words, they're up to no good.&amp;nbsp; EDIT:&amp;nbsp; I WAS RIGHT!!!1!&amp;nbsp; Just when I caught up to them in episode count, they release a new episode (with the promise of more to follow).&amp;nbsp; I'm going to have to step up my A game now, and by A I mean Arch Nemesis-ing.&amp;nbsp; 

Anime World Order - I'm a little surprised the&amp;nbsp;AWO gang&amp;nbsp;aren't doing as well as I would have thought on the Anime on Twitter competition.&amp;nbsp; They're still doing much better than I am, though, since I refuse to submit my own twitter id&amp;nbsp;(http://twitter.com/upapaddle) for consideration.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I suppose I should actually start&amp;nbsp;tweeting again, but screw it.&amp;nbsp; 

Musical Accompaniment:Big in Japan by SupergeneAnd since you demanded it, here's a video of the world's largest pie, circa the 1920's

            <description>This week I rant about Haruhi, gush about Horace, leap through &amp;quot;The Girl Who Leapt Through Time&amp;quot;, and give you a primer on &amp;quot;Primer&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; The reviews are a little spoilerific, so caveat emptor.
NewsFuturama original voice cast coming back, for sure this time.&amp;nbsp; RUMOR: 4Kids for Sale.&amp;nbsp; Whenever I think of 4Kids, I think of this flash.&amp;nbsp; The nifty thing is that this was done by TVs Kyle, a frequent contributor to Otaku Generation.&amp;nbsp; I've played a few of his songs on this podcast too.&amp;nbsp; Good stuff.Epic Mickey - It looks epic, to say the least.&amp;nbsp; I just hope that a lot of the concept art makes it into the actual game.

Commenting on ControversyI talk about the much maligned Endless Eight saga from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.&amp;nbsp; I'm not a fan of it myself, but I don't think I'm taking it as hard as Hitler is:EDIT: Apparently the Endless Eight Saga is coming to an end, after eight episodes.&amp;nbsp; Who'd have thunk it?&amp;nbsp; Anyway, it still sucked.
Reviews
The Girl Who Leapt Through TimeI haven't been able to time leap myself yet.&amp;nbsp; I think&amp;nbsp;I need to get some more height when I jump before it will work.&amp;nbsp; If I leap from my apartment balcony, that should do it.&amp;nbsp; I'll be back (in time) in a minute ...Ow.
Primer
I promise if I ever get a time machine, I'll only use it for good.&amp;nbsp; Specifically, I'll beat the makers of Endless Eight with the Smart Stickâ so they'd have&amp;nbsp;had&amp;nbsp;the good sense to not make Endless Eight in the first place.&amp;nbsp; Also, after&amp;nbsp;relistening to&amp;nbsp;this episode, I realized that I went into way more detail in my reviews of these movies than I should have.&amp;nbsp; I guess I need&amp;nbsp;to go back and beat myself with the Smart Stickâ.&amp;nbsp; EDIT: I'd also go back and remind myself to include all the videos in the shownotes that I promised in the show.&amp;nbsp; Here's the Back to the Future comparison:

            <description>&amp;nbsp; This week I'm joined by Jake the Rootbeer King from RPGLamer (http://RPGLamer.com). We discuss Canadian Heritage Minutes, candy, and go over this summer season's new anime release.
This is my idea of a Canadian JokeSasquatches ... IN THE FUTURENewsValkyria Chronicles 2 headed for the PSPFunimation licenses 4 more Detective Conan moviesBlack Lagoon 3rd Season to be OVA
Bandai reveals license for Kannagi - Crazy Shrine MaidensFuturama - Coming back with different voice cast?&amp;nbsp; Summer 2009 Anime Previews (not necessarily in the order we previewed them)Umi Monogatari - Mermaids that walk on land and have legs. So I'm assuming the fish half is on top.Aoi Hana - Yuri the only one for me. If only that song was podsafe, then we wouldn't have had to hit the old unicorn well two too many times.Bakemonogatari - Wherein several&amp;nbsp;school supplies&amp;nbsp;are thrown around.&amp;nbsp; If only I would have caught a thesaurus I could have remembered to call them school supplies and not school implementsNeedless - I'm sure this joke has been already made before, but this show is needless.&amp;nbsp; It did not need to be made.
Charger Girl Ju-den - If you love Magical Girl shows where the girls wet themselves a lot, you need psychiatric help.&amp;nbsp; 
Canaan - Wherein I break out my knowledge of the book of Genesis.&amp;nbsp; Genesis has a lot more moe in it now than I remembered.&amp;nbsp; Elementhunters - Wherein we drop our impressive scientific acuity on your asses. CHON indeed.Tokyo Magnitude 8.0 - We're all shook up.
Plus, apparently the one about the blue&amp;nbsp;koala is called PÃnÃlope tÃte en l'air.&amp;nbsp; But I'm sure you'd much rather reminisce about The Noozles

The NewsCharger Girl Juuden Chan censored.&amp;nbsp; Not censored enough for my liking.&amp;nbsp; Mario Mararthon - At first it seemed like a marathon I might be in good enough shape for, but now I'm not so sure.&amp;nbsp; Still, good on these guys for raising so much money for charity.&amp;nbsp; 

Street Fighter IV -- unbalanced?&amp;nbsp; Dan says yes!Speaking of Rolling with Sagat ... (nsfw) 

I'll count this as the fun video of the episode.Reviews

Ramen Fighter Miki Yes, my former job was just as exciting and deadly as this was.&amp;nbsp; Here's the trailer:You can see the episodes&amp;nbsp;on Anime News Network or on&amp;nbsp;Youtube.&amp;nbsp; FOR FREE!!!1!Neko RahmenI didn't see video for the cartoon on Youtube, but did find this trailer for the Live Action movieI think it's pretty clear that this will be awesome. Here's the link for Neko Rahmen on Crunchyroll.comAnd as promised, here's Hard Gay, Razor Ramon (probably nsfw):EDIT: When I was talking about Naruto, I said Uzumaki meant swirl.&amp;nbsp; I meant to say spiral.&amp;nbsp; That is all.Promotional Consideration given to:Luke and Elliot's Bearfighting Extravaganza (http://www.lukeandelliot.com/)The AniMentors (http://themented.com)Fightbait Videogame and Anime Podcast (http://fightbait.com)Musical AccompanimentThe song played was Pillsbury Cookie Dough by Paul and StormYou can email me at upapaddle@gmail.com, skype me with skype id upapaddle and follow me on twitter at http://twitter.com/upapaddle.Thanks for listening!&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/upapaddle/BbPR/~4/6Sowx1MM-r4" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>

            <description>And by that I mean splitting episodes into two and suffixing each part with a letter, as they are wont to do.&amp;nbsp; Although technically speaking,&amp;nbsp;I recorded both halves at separate times so I probably could have gotten away with calling this a new episode, that is, if&amp;nbsp;it weren't for those meddling kids ....
NewsFunimation streaming anime again.&amp;nbsp; But not One Piece yet, so the news story in my last episode is still relevant.&amp;nbsp; 
New Hajime no Ippo anime on the way.&amp;nbsp; Heck yeah!Tatsunoko vs Capcom - One Character To Be Dropped Due to Licensing.&amp;nbsp; But it's not Gold Lightan, so we're good for now, Internet
This is the guy that's being dropped:Admit it, knowing you can't play as him makes you want&amp;nbsp;to all the more.SPACE WEDDING - Well, Zero-G, which is just as weightless.&amp;nbsp;

BasquashCars that play basketball.&amp;nbsp; Crazy, I say!&amp;nbsp; Crazy!If you want to torture your ears, check out Pun-Colle.&amp;nbsp; Punk songs by Japanese voice actresses.&amp;nbsp; It's as scary as it sounds.

Also be sure to check out their take on Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit.&amp;nbsp; For a better cover of the song, check out the Ukelele Orchestra of Great Britain.&amp;nbsp;
Restaurant Paradiso&amp;nbsp;If this show is correct, then due to my graying hair and glasses, I should be irresistable to a&amp;nbsp;significant segment of the female population (in Italy, anyway).&amp;nbsp; So yeah, feel free to throw yourselves at me ladies.
Cross GameThis show gets a little sad, but remember, there's no crying in baseball!&amp;nbsp; Valkyria Chronicles Based on the Game (and probably manga) of the same name.&amp;nbsp; Like I've said before, it's next on my queue.This is what the game looks like:

            <description>For this episode I decided to record a homage (read: blatantly rip off) of the I Luv the 80s podcast by doing my own 80s related show, because it's the smurfy thing to do.&amp;nbsp; Watch the video below for more information on the Smurfs and Smurfs related video games of the 80.
Smurfs: Rescue In Gargamel's Castle.&amp;nbsp; This game is unanimously considered to be the best video game of all time&amp;nbsp;by game historians.
So I dusted off an old recording from when I was still in diapers and play it for you to listen to with your ears.&amp;nbsp; Apparently, I reviewed Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, which was totally excellent and righteous.&amp;nbsp;

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/upapaddle/BbPR/~3/HepLe6AHreY/index.php</link>
            <description>For this episode I decided to record a homage (read: blatantly rip off) of the I Luv the 80s podcast by doing my own 80s related show, because it's the smurfy thing to do.&amp;nbsp; Watch the video below for more information on the Smurfs and Smurfs related video games of the 80.
Smurfs: Rescue In Gargamel's Castle.&amp;nbsp; This game is unanimously considered to be the best video game of all time&amp;nbsp;by game historians.
So I dusted off an old recording from when I was still in diapers and play it for you to listen to with your ears.&amp;nbsp; Apparently, I reviewed Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, which was totally excellent and righteous.&amp;nbsp;
I talk about some news stories but I have misplaced the links for some of them so I'll edit this post at a later date.&amp;nbsp;
I also review an anime from the 80's that creeped the hell out of me, with a name that roughly translates to &amp;quot;The Lurking Horror&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Please don't click on the aforementioned link until you have heard the review and have properly prepared yourself, both mentally and spiritually, for the horror that awaits.&amp;nbsp; The review itself&amp;nbsp;may be a little rambly and nonsensical, but that is only due to the psychological scars that the&amp;nbsp;anime inflicted on me as a kid.&amp;nbsp; Rest assured, I will ensure that this cycle of forcing children to watch these cruel and&amp;nbsp;frightening shows will continue with my nephkids when they are born&amp;nbsp;(don't know the gender yet).&amp;nbsp; There's some other stuff in the podcast, but I kinda drifted in and out when recording so I can't recall off hand what it may be.Oh yeah, I played a promo for the Hello Kitty Island Adventure podcast and one for myself.&amp;nbsp; Please note that some of the clips I included in my promo may have been taken slightly out of context.&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, you should harass the podcasters that those said clips originated from.So I also played the song King of Kong by Tvs Kyle.If you want to contact me you can email me at upapaddle@gmail.com, go to http://upapaddle.com or even follow my twitter at http://twitter.com/upapaddle.

            <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/upapaddle/BbPR/~3/324PPmztBkI/index.php</link>
            <description>Up a Paddle - Episode 61 - The Protector of StuffThis episode I go over the official Up a Paddle 2008 Awards, talk about new years resolutions, read out email correspondence, bandy about a few shoutouts and review The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of Uruk.The Up a Paddle Best of 2008 Awards:Wherein I discuss the games and movies that won the coveted UAP Seal of Approval.
The royal seal:
You know you want one.&amp;nbsp; 
The Resolutions:Wherein I discuss my previous New Year's resolution (to learn the words to Yo Ho Yo Ho A Pirate's Life for Me - I succeeded - Woot) and I also discuss my resolutions for this year.&amp;nbsp; One of them would be quite easy if a talented anime podcaster in my area started up a con of his own, possibly centered around 80's anime, perhaps.
Stuff I'm looking forward to in 2009Street Fighter IV.&amp;nbsp; It's almost here too.&amp;nbsp; City Hunter Live&amp;nbsp;Action TV Show&amp;nbsp;- Get Wild and Tough
Stuff I'm not really looking forward to:Street Fighter the Legend of Chun Li - I just don't see how it could top the finest live action performance of Chun Li ever:

&amp;nbsp;Still better than the Van Damme version
The NewsFunimation licenses everything, ever.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Funimation laying off employees, along with Bandai and most other anime distributors in NA.Nintendo reveals online video service in Japan. Don't have an engram, man!&amp;nbsp; Bart Simpson used as a marketing tool for Scientology
The ShoutoutsI gave a shoutout to a lot of the podcasters on the right sidebar there.&amp;nbsp; If I didn't give you a shoutout or felt the quality of your shoutout was lacking, I apologize.&amp;nbsp; Please contact me and I'll fix it.&amp;nbsp; Just so we're clear, I won't play your promo or link you if I don't listen to you regularly and enjoy what I'm hearing.&amp;nbsp; So if you're on the side bar, I think you're just nifty and other people should too.&amp;nbsp;
Teh FunnyWe Name Him&amp;nbsp;Hanabi - He gon BROW UP I am a building
The review - The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of UrukHere's episode 1:

Tower of Druaga - The Aegis of Uruk - Episode 1 
Also, please note the Tentacle Grape link on the right sidebar.&amp;nbsp; If you click the link and buy the pop, you get pop and I get money, so good deal.&amp;nbsp; Tentacle Grape Soda - Violate your Thirst.&amp;nbsp; (I came up with that slogan&amp;nbsp;btw, but you can use it too).

            <description>Up a Paddle - Episode 56 - Yeah, I'm Kinda Evil

In this episode I do a rundown of E3 and talk about videogames and such.&amp;nbsp; Also, I talk about certain tendancies of mine. Evilish tendancies.

NewsMarvel vs Capcom 3 closer than we think?Animeondvd.com sold to mania.com.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Live action Cowboy Bebop film in development

Games for Windows Live goes free

FeedbackProps to Anime 82Check out his podcast at http://anime82.blogspot.com

DS Tool.&amp;nbsp; No, not me*.&amp;nbsp; Go here to see it in all it's glory* Thanks to Bob of wqoq.com fame for this link and that joke.&amp;nbsp; 

Eeeper's comment on Episode 55.&amp;nbsp; About the evil.http://eeeperschoice.com and http://capricorntheater.com

Well, you want evil, you got it, albeit in the form of random slightly disturbing videos.&amp;nbsp; So, in no particular order:

Pom Poko.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Mommy, why isn't that raccoon wearing any pants?&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Disney stuff is the best. Speaking of Disney stuff:Walt Disney's The Menstruation Story

Worms in a guy's stomach - WARNING - Video is exactly what I said.&amp;nbsp; People with weaker temperaments beware.The green stuff in his stomach is a nice touch.

And, because Wii Fit Girlfriend got you all hot and bothered, here's the sequel:Wii Fit Boyfriend

Putting this video on hulu.com after I downloaded on iTunes, now that's evil.&amp;nbsp; Well played, Whedon.

Random FactSurgeons who grew up playing video games make 37 percent fewer mistakes

E3In this segment I give a rundown of of the E3 conferences.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, Penny Arcade has already done a much better job of this.&amp;nbsp; Check out this comic for more details.http://penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/7/16/&amp;nbsp; 

Here's the wikipedia article on the spanking machine I mentioned.&amp;nbsp; I did not realize how depraved the thing was until I learned it also has a kancho mode.&amp;nbsp; For more information on kanchos, go to Gaijin Smash, a blog written by an American that taught English in Japan.&amp;nbsp; There's some pretty wild stories in there.

Back to my show, I also go on a bit of a rant (I know, I never rant, but I guess there's a first time for everything) about why E3 is a flawed concept. 

Random FactMario was named after Mario Segale, the landlord of Nintendo of Americaâs office, who barged in on a company meeting demanding an overdue rent.

            <description>Up a Paddle - Episode 54a - Merrily we roll along.








This week I talk about the news in brief and review one of my all time favorite Anime type shows.








  News

  Bandai Visual - Price Cut
  








  Roy and MewTwo in Super Smash Bros Brawl.&amp;nbsp;
    Roy can be unlocked with the Super Smash Bros Melee Gamecube disk.&amp;nbsp; You  will need to first unlock Roy in the Gamecube version and transfer the Gamecube save
  file to the Wii's flash memory.&amp;nbsp; The next time you load up brawl, Roy will challenge you to a duel.&amp;nbsp; This is similar to how you could unlock the Pikmin trophy in Melee by having a Pikmin save file on your memory card.
  
    To unlock MewTwo is a little trickier.&amp;nbsp; You will need to play 1000 vs  matches with Jigglypuff.&amp;nbsp; The last match has to be won at between 10:00  and 12:00 on&amp;nbsp; Friday night on the Animal Crossing Stage.&amp;nbsp; If done  correctly, KK slider will saronade you with the Mario theme and Mewtwo will
  challenge you.&amp;nbsp;

Random Fact
    All 2% milk sold commercially contains 5% soy milk.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This is a  measure that dairy industry has implemented in response to Mad Cow  disease.&amp;nbsp; Many herds have been destroyed in the last year and in order to
  provide the same quantity of milk, drastic actions had to be taken.
  
  
Announcements
    Up a Paddle has been picked up as the official podcast of the first annual
  WhatsACon  in Regina.&amp;nbsp; An official date has not been set yet but I'll keep

  Podcast news
    My state of the anime podcast address wherein I address the problem of
  podfading.&amp;nbsp;
  Not mentioned is the We Love Furries podcast.&amp;nbsp; I may not agree with what they say (I totally don't) but I'll defend to the death their right to say it (and to soil teddy bears) ...&amp;nbsp; ok, maybe to the minor injury ... screw it, they're on their own.&amp;nbsp; Payback's a bitch, Dane and Alex.

I might have accidentally watched that show not knowing what was awaiting me.&amp;nbsp; Do you know how many bowls of Corn Flakes I had to eat to suppress the wicked urges that that article begat, let alone how many more I would I have to eat if I had watched Dominion Tank Police**Also, here's the pdf I mentioned.&amp;nbsp; * More like the Dominion Tank Police that like to have sex with each other whilst innocent Canadian children watch on with mouths agape because a certain podcaster recommended this lurid filth as appropriate, which although it doesn't actually have any explicit sex scenes, it could.&amp;nbsp; Ridiculous. ** Bonus Pretzels to anyone that gets that Random Fact&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Japanese ISPs to crack down on P2P anime sharers.It will be interesting to see how this affects the fansub community.&amp;nbsp; This is finally an action that could see results.&amp;nbsp; Fans here might have to resort to actually buying their content.&amp;nbsp; That is, if they can get it across the border first.&amp;nbsp; Also, it will be interesting to see if anyone counts how many times I say &amp;quot;It will be interesting&amp;quot; when I talk about this news item in the podcast.Pirate site crunchyroll.com has been given 4.5 million in venture captial. &amp;nbsp;(It might have been only 4 billion.&amp;nbsp; Only.)Give me 4.5 billion and I'll steal stuff for you too.

            <description>Up a Paddle - Episode 46 - Everybody Yes!Or It's the Most Wonderful Time of the YearIt's Kentmas Time! Kentmas Time is here!&amp;nbsp; Time for ... Video Games and Anime ... and Candy!&amp;nbsp; Lots and lots of Candy! &amp;nbsp; I gave this episode a different title in the audio but screw it, this one's better.&amp;nbsp; Also, in this episode I tried out a little something different.&amp;nbsp; I used some music loops in order to mix things up.&amp;nbsp; Please comment or email if you like or dislike the loops and which ones I should keep.News Teppan Toppa Gurren Lagann Game coming out -- in Japan that is for DSHere's the TrailerYeah, if you want up to the minute news (like Nova - one of the English Teaching programs in Japan going under, leaving its teachers high and dry, listen to a real podcast.&amp;nbsp; Like Anime Pacific). &amp;nbsp;Here's the Nova StoryHere is Anime Pacific on the Nova StoryTake the next news item for exampleLucky Star has been licensed by Bandai.&amp;nbsp; This story was broken by Anime Genesis.&amp;nbsp; So check them up.&amp;nbsp; They know the anime news even before Anime News Network does.&amp;nbsp; Good job guys.Here's the Anime Genesis announcement. Here's the page showing that the show has been licensed:&amp;nbsp;(a brief search didn't turn this up on ANN)Someday I'll get a scoop.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, it will probably be Smurfs related.Japanese Animation is Destroying American Society. The above is an editorial I briefly mention.&amp;nbsp; Also, I would like to point out how relevant the whole seizure thing is.This week in Smash - The big blue guy is in Smash Brothershttp://smashbros.comThat's right: King Dedede from the Kirby Series is in Smash BrothersOh yeah, So is Sonic the Hedgehog.&amp;nbsp; Big news indeed.&amp;nbsp; Also, Smash Brothers Brawl has been delayed until February. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My Smash Brother PredictionsThis is the portion of the show where I go off on a tangent about possible characters in Random Fact - The Legend of the Jack - o - LaternShort version: A guy named Jack (vagabond if I ever met one) tricked the Devil by getting him to go up a tree and then carved a cross to prevent him from coming down.&amp;nbsp; He finally let the Devil down after the Devil promised to no longer tempt him (presumably with candy and loose women).&amp;nbsp; So Jack dies and Heaven won't let him in (too many cavities if you know what I mean).&amp;nbsp; The devils still ticked off at him so he can't get into Hell either.&amp;nbsp; He's forced to wander all eternity.&amp;nbsp; The Devil gives him a single ember to light his way and so Jack hollows out a turnip to keep it safe.&amp;nbsp; Then he realized turnips were stupid and got a pumpkin.&amp;nbsp; I'm really wishing I would have put this version in the podcast as it is way funnier than what I said.&amp;nbsp; Just imagine me saying the above in my irritating voice and your set.&amp;nbsp; Also through in a few references to pirates and Smurfs for good measure.Recent Releases (past month)Halo 3Legend of Zelda - Phantom HourglassJungle Book: Platinum EditionCorner Gas: Season 4This week's releasesBleach Box Set 1Hajime no Ippo Box Set 1Hajime no Ippo Box Set 2Phoenix Vol 1Guitar Hero III What I'm watching/playingLegend of Zelda - Phantom Hourglass - Just finished it, it was glorious.Will review in a future podcastBarefoot Gen 1 and 2.&amp;nbsp; Boy, If you are ever worried that you are too upbeat and happy, watch these films.&amp;nbsp; They're jarring, to be quite frank.&amp;nbsp; The first one is set during the bombing of Hiroshima and it follows Gen and his mother as they attempt to survive.&amp;nbsp; I'll be reviewing this in episode 48. &amp;nbsp;Finally, I'm watching Monster.&amp;nbsp; I've decided that this season of Anime doesn't really have anything that I'm particularly interested in following (except for Genshiken and Bamboo Blade) so I'm taking this opportunity to check out slightly older series.&amp;nbsp; Next up on the queue are Touch and Hajime no Ippo. (In addition to the shows on the current poll, of course).Monster makes a good horror anime to watch for Halloween.Random FactPumpkins are a fruit that originated in Central America.ReviewsThis week I review The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad.&amp;nbsp; Well part of it anyway. I'm going to focus on the story of Icabod.&amp;nbsp; That's Icabod Crane.&amp;nbsp; As in the Legend of Sleepy Hollow.&amp;nbsp; The Mr. Toad is also a good, worthwile cartoon to watch, but it isn't creepy, kooky or altogether spooky, so it will have to wait for another time. Next, Kakurenbo&amp;nbsp; - Hide and SeekThis is a 25 minute ova.&amp;nbsp; It's CG with cel shading and it looks sharp.&amp;nbsp; It looks for the most part like traditional 2d animation. This ova is about a game of Hide and Seek, with deadly consequences. &amp;nbsp;Both shows are well worth watching. &amp;nbsp;Random FactThe world's fastest time to carve a face into a pumpkin is 54.72 seconds, by Stephen Clarke (USA), on October 23, 2001 (source: Guinness World Records)Promos Played:Dave and Joel's Fast Karate for the GentlemenAnime PacificEeeper's ChoiceClosing SongHalloween is Awesome by Hyper Nonsense.Contact InfoEmail: upapaddle@gmail.comBlog: http://kentcer.comThanks for listening!

            <description>Up a Paddle - Episode 45 - Sheep that Pass in the NightThis week I talk about the death of Geneon, the Canadian Dollar reaching Parity with the US Dollar, upcoming Fall Anime, and previous Spring and Summer anime.&amp;nbsp; I also review Ringing Bell and One Stormy Night, two similar but very different children's movies.NewsGeneon to stop productionNote: I said November 1st as the stop date, it's actually Nov. 6.&amp;nbsp; Correction to follow in upcoming episodeRock band coming out Nov 3Canadian Dollar on parity with states ... what does it mean.Nintendo offers free Wiimote JacketsFall Anime PreviewGenshiken Season TwoBamboo ShootG/R Giant RoboSpring/Summer Wrap upPotemayo Zombie LoanLucky Star Random FactGiraffes have no vocal cords.RantParking Lots - The current bane of my existenceRandom FactThe sweat drops drawn in cartoon comic strips are called pleuts.ReviewsIn this episode I review two children's movie about sheep.&amp;nbsp; I would have reservations about showing either of them to children.&amp;nbsp; Show them Bad Sheep instead.&amp;nbsp; Not the Chris Farley/David Spade vehicle but this one.&amp;nbsp; . That'll really mess them up almost as much as showing them Ringing Bell.Ringing Bell (Chirin no Suzu).&amp;nbsp; This one is about a sheep that wants to become a big bad wolf so that he won't be prey any more.&amp;nbsp; Very violent and disturbing.* I said I'd post the YouTube videos for this movie but apparently it has been removed.&amp;nbsp; Here's an AMV:

Ringing Bell - Animal Chirin has Become. It's not that hard to find the movie if you really want to.One Stormy Night&amp;nbsp; (Arashi no Yoru Ni).&amp;nbsp; This is the story of a sheep and a wolf that becomes friends.&amp;nbsp; It's pretty good and I give it the Kentcer Seal of Approval.&amp;nbsp; Here's the AMV I mentioned (well, a One Stormy Night AMV, anyway):
