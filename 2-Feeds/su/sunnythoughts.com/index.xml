<title>Affirming Has Helped With Sleep</title>
<description>Thank you for all the affirmations. We in Christchurch, New Zealand are going through rough time after the 4th September&apos;s big earthquake and so many after shocks are keeping us on edge. After many sleepless nights, last night I started affirming and first time slept well.

<title>Positive Subliminal Pictures - Morin Bernard  - Morocco</title>
<description>Dear Sunny, 
A little time to acclimate, and now, 
I really appreciate your Sunny Thoughts. 
At the beginning, I received your mail on the afternoon, 
and did not practice the autosuggestion as well 
as I would like to do. 

I start now to open your Sunny Mails in the early morning 
and it&apos;s a better way to enjoy. 
By luck, I&apos;m only at the third affirmation.
 
Thank you anyways for this clever idea. 
(I have resisted to uncover the 102 others...) 

I created a sort of affirmation like yours in the 70ies. 
I call them &quot;Positive Subliminal Pictures&quot;. 
The word &quot;Happyness&quot; for example, 
written so many times in all directions, 
that it becomes illegible. 
The subconscious catches the idea contained 
and the seed of the &quot;happyness&quot; begins to grow... 

I can offer you the possibility to make 
them downloaded by your customers-readers. 
Once a week as a free gift? 
I shall make 52 of them. 
You can have a look, if you want, on my web site:

<title>Question About Getting Out Of Depression - Phyllis Boulsien, Libya</title>
<description>Dear Sunny, 
I have been reading your affirmations 
for quite a while now, 
but they do not seem to sink into my brain. 

For the last 3 years I have been down 
in the depths of depression. 

There are weeks when I am OK, not bad. 

But the rest of the time I find 
I am constantly thinking how old I am, 
how nobody wants me, how I am so lonely. 

I have always had a tendency 
to get depressed and agitated,
 but nothing like the last three years. 

I want to get out of it. 
But I do not know where to start. 

I am British, living in Libya, 
so I do not have access to counseling services etc. 

Its basically do it your self here 
- or try and find counseling on line for huge fees 
for which I do not have the funds to pay for. 

How to I change my thoughts, 
my view of myself and my situation?

Any advice would be welcome. 
Kind Regards, 
Phyllis Boulsien 
~Libya</description>
