			<title>Issue #5 - Superhero Shtick</title>
			<itunes:author>Superhero Cinema</itunes:author>
			<description>Week of April 11th, 2007 

First we apologize for the amount of time since the last issue.  Then we talk about our very cool new logo image provided by Cory Gray of thegraydomain.com.

The apology for this week’s show is that there’s a really bad echo on Jefferson’s microphone.  We got Jonathan a new headset mic after the first 3 shows, and he sounds much better ever since, we’ve ordered the same one for Jefferson.

Emails:

1.	Fake casting notice for the Superhero Guys in The Dark Knight, sent in by Blake.
2.	We also answer Blake’s question about rumored villains in the next Superman sequel, as part of that we get a little into the history of Brainiac.
3.	Jason asks us an entry on Wil Wheaton’s where he is asked about being in Watchmen, we discuss the possibility and the quote from the movie’s directory Zach Snyder about the direction the casting will take.
4.	Jason also asks about Heroes and whether the hiatus is too long and if that can hurt a show, we have several different opinions on this one.  We compare Heroes to Lost, X-Files and 24.
5.	Jeff from Thornton CO asks about what characters would we like to see made into movies and TV shows.  Not a small subject.

News:

1.	One last 300 box office report.
2.	Incredible Hulk updates, new effects company, etc.
3.	Eric Johnson (Smallville) will be Flash in SciFi Channel’s Flash Gordon TV series.
4.	Leslie Bibb cast in Iron Man.
5.	First set pictures from Iron Man are out, are Tony Stark and Pepper Potts an item in the film?
6.	Lauren Shuler-Donner producing DC’s The Metal Men.
7.	Ben Stiller producing an animated film for Dreamworks Animation called MasterMind.
8.	Ghost Rider on DVD June 12.
9.	The Secrets of Isis complete series on July 24.
10.	 New David Goyer project, Super Max, must be heard to be believed.

Rumor Treadmill:

1.	Returning cast and director for Spider-Man 4?
2.	John Goodman and Susan Sarandon in talks to play Speed Racer’s parents.
3.	Nadia Bjorlin is not Wonder Woman.
4.	Jason Schwartzman in a possible cameo in Spider-Man 3.
5.	Orlando Bloom in a future Superman film?  Based on a lunch sighting.
