        <link><![CDATA[http://elsiesyogakula.com]]></link>
        <description><![CDATA[Inspiring, spicy, fun, joyful and uplifting live and unplugged yoga classes taught by Pittsburgh yoga teacher Elsie Escobar. Classes range from strong beginners to advanced. They are 1hr or 1hr and 15 min.  Depending on the level and length of the individual class they may include all or some of the following: a theme, meditation, pranayama, warm ups, sun salutations, standing poses, arm balances, hip openers, thigh stretches, backbends, forward bends, cool down poses and relaxation.  Remember, the class is live and Elsie is teaching to what she sees. It's designed to include you into the class experience, to participate in deeper ways.

<p>Nothing fancy.</p>
<p>No crazy poses.</p>
<p>In fact, there are very little poses.</p>
<p>This is more of a practice of <em>just</em> doing THIS. One. Thing.</p>

<p><strong>The awesomely fantastic tunic colca, which I ADORE</strong>.</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite pieces of clothing from [Prancing Leopard[pl], the <a href="http://www.prancingleopard.com/online-store/index.php/tunic-colca.html">Tunic Colca</a>. It's sort of like a super sophisticated and styly racerback ribbed tank top.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/scy/96_Ep_96_Discovering_the_Eve_of_Your_Breath.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<h2>Discover The Eve Of Your Breath</h2>
<p>FINALLY!!!</p>
<p>The more I live my life, the more I recognize that the most important aspect of the practice of yoga is the breath. Every key insight either about me, a specific pose, the way my body functions or even my relationships has come through a growth in the breath.</p>
<p>I remember two distinct times while practicing backbends that they <em>unfolded</em> themselves to me when I FINALLY breathed optimally while working deeper into the postures.</p>
<p>I also remember my first feeling of wholeness as I let go into savasana for the first time, I believe because I released into my breath for the first time.</p>
<p>The breath has particularly played a <em>ginormous</em> part in staying sane after the birth of Mae and becoming a Mama of two, through three pretty powerful experiences with pain and discomfort (during labor, when my sacrum went out 2 weeks after birth and when my impacted wisdom tooth got infected.)</p>
<p>The breath just came to my aid recently, not regarding to pain this time, but <strong><em>anxiety</em></strong></p>
<p>You can hear how the breath helped me come back from an almost full blow anxiety attack!</p>
<h2>Here are a few other things covered and mentioned in this special breathing class episode:</h2>
<ul>
<li>What I'm doing about my Anusara Yoga Inspired status given the recent goings on.</li>
<li>The why behind my choice: <a href="http://elsiesyogakula.com/2008/05/16/courage-prayer-and-action-an-elsie-update/">Courage, Prayer and Action</a></li>
<li>One of the most courageous human beings I know, Beth Morey, and the reason this episode is dedicated to her daughter Eve.</li>

</ul>
<p><em>The practice is meant to be the first step you take into the power of your own breath</em>.</p>
<h2>This is a breathing practice for beginners</h2>
<p>The breathing practice focuses primarily on cultivating your own natural breath, by discovering it's movement within your body.</p>
<h3>If you feel like you are anxious, fearful, disconnected, or tired, give this practice a go.</h3>
<p>If you are someone that has never done any kind of breath practice or have never paid attention to your breath and how it affects your health, this is the practice for you!</p>
<p>Go ahead, practice! You won't regret it. (THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE THE APP, YOU WILL GET AN MP3 OF ONLY THE 20 MIN CLASS WITHOUT THE INTRODUCTIONS AS WELL!)</p>

<li>There is a 9 min introduction to the episode as well as news and sponsors</li>
<li>There is a 5 minute intro to the breathing practice itself</li>
<li>There is a 20 minute breathing practice</li>

			<title>Ep 92: Level 2 90 Minute Class, Home Equals Heart</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/scy/90_Ep_92-_Level_2_90_Minute_Class_Home_Equals_Heart.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<h2>I've been at home A LOT lately.</h2>
<p>My body has gone through a pretty massive transformation since giving birth, as it should, since it facilitaded an entire new human being to come out! My goodness does that still keep me in awe. It floors me when I think of what this body is capable of. If something is magical, it's our bodies :)</p>
<p>I'm also keenly aware that as magical and intuitive as it is it MUST be nurtured.</p>
<p>I had my sacrum/si completely go out on me about 4 weeks postpartum. Thank God my parents were here visiting at that time. I could barely get out of bed, let alone pick up my infant daughter! It was rough. No amount of yoga therapy instantanously 'healed' me. In fact, the simple act of sitting and standing was excruciating.</p>
<p><strong>It was then that I learned, um...RE-learned that yoga is not about the poses</strong>.</p>
<p>The gifts that yoga has given me have nothing to do with the poses, but with the simple and all powerful discovery of being, breathing and feeling. This discovery comes from the un-abiding choice recognize and honor Home.</p>
<h3>What is Home?</h3>
<p>Have you heard <strong>"Home is where the heart is?"</strong></p>
<p><em>I think Home is the Heart</em>.</p>
<p>Yoga didn't give me extra super powers. Yoga hasn't made my life any easier. I still have to address important issues, deal with stress, navigate financial woes, and experience physical pain! Ugh. That is sucky :(</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p>the practice of yoga facilitated my recognition of Home aka my Heart, and when that happens living becomes simpler, still challenging, still unpredictable, still difficult, but simple. It seems contradictory huh?</p>
<p>And therein lies the magic ;)</p>
<p><strong>The practice of Home, developing a yoga practice at home, sustaining a yoga practice at home begins in the Heart.</strong></p>
<p>Are you up for that?</p>
<p>Practice along :) or even simply listen along.</p>
<p>Let me know if Home became clearer to you and in what ways? I'd love to hear from you! WANNA GET ALL THE EXTRA TREATS? <a href="http://bit.ly/eyknewsletter">Sign up for my Newsletter</a> :)</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I know there are some of you still in the midst of Winter. Maybe your winter has been going on for so long you're not sure how to deal with it or if you can deal with it.</p>
<p>Winter, or at least the <em>qualities of winter</em>, the darkness in particular, that darkness that forces you to remain inward, to cover yourself, and to slow down is great in little bits but when it's prolonged it can get challenging.</p>
<p>Some of you may be physically going through Winter, the season, while some of you may be going through an emotional or spiritual winter, even though the sun is brightly shining all around. In this level 2 yoga class we go use our bodies and our hearts to fully step into the darkness, see it as an opportunity to root and ground into all that we are capable of so that we may welcome springtime and blossom through light.</p>
<p>I am 8 months pregnant. When I recorded this class I was 4 months along, barely out of my first trimester having gone through a rough and long winter time. My beautiful new little life needed me to remain inward, steady, calm and receptive to allow the growth of light within. The rising of vibrant Springtime was a direct reflection of the power of the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>How about practicing along and dancing with the dark and the light and blossom into the world around you?</strong></p>

			<title>Ep 90: Level 2 90 Minute Yoga Class Filling Your Gas Tank</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/scy/90_Ep_90_Filling_Your_Gas_Tank_A_Level_2_90_Minute_Yoga_Class.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The theme for this class was inspired by one of my friends <a href="http://hillaryrubin.com/">Hillary Rubin</a>. She has <a href="http://hillaryrubin.com/uncategorized/how-to-stop-running-on-empty-get-rid-of-exhaustion-2/">this amazing post</a> plus video, asking questions that needed to be asked at that moment....hmmmmm. Or at least <strong>I needed</strong> to ask these questions ;)</p>
<p>It was all about RUNNING OUT OF GAS! Well, at least for me it was about running out of gas. It made me think about the various ways that we deal with running out of gas:</p>
<ol>
<li>We make sure to make time to consistently fill up the gas tank at a specific time of the week/month to make sure we always have a full gas tank.</li>
<li>We play it by ear. We know relatively <em>when</em> we are 'really' gonna run out of gas and choose to milk it for all it's worth and PRAY we don't run out of gas before we barely make it to the gas station.</li>
<li>We recognize we are running out of gas but circumstances around us at the time (we got lost and are now in a looooong stretch or road without a gas station in site) don't let us fill up the gas tank. <strong>We are going to run out of gas.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I fit into number 3.</p>
<p>Before becoming a Mama, I fluctuated between 1 &amp; 2. I was conscious of my choices and continued to do my best to not run out of gas. I was close a bunch of times, but managed to get my fuel on time ;) After being a Mama I have found myself without a gas station in sight quite a few times. That is a whole other ball game.</p>
<p><em>side note- y'all know I'm not referring to actual gas or driving right? this is all a gigantuan metaphor ;)</em></p>
<h2>No Gas In Sight? It's Gonna Be OK.</h2>
<p>When I first found myself without a gas station in sight I panicked. I honestly thought it was the end of the world. I had a total and complete meltdown. I felt so alone. As I sat in my despair I did recognize that I needed to let someone know, I wasn't alone you know, I had my toddler with me. I reached out: God, my beloved, my friends, my teachers and most importantly myself.</p>
<p>I let myself soften. It opened my eyes to see that it really wasn't the end of the world. People run out of gas all the time. It's what we do about it that matters :)</p>
<p>I still run out of gas...and I'm ok. I always have an extra tank of gas with me. I always let my family and friends know where I am, in case I need an unexpected pick-up ;) And most importantly, I absolutely make sure that I enjoy the time while I wait for the gas to once again be filled up.</p>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[The theme for this class was inspired by one of my friends Hillary Rubin. She has this amazing post plus video, asking questions that needed to be asked at that moment....hmmmmm. Or at least I needed to ask these questions ;)
It was all about RUNNING OUT OF GAS! Well, at least for me it was about running out of gas. It made me think about the various ways that we deal with running out of gas:

We make sure to make time to consistently fill up the gas tank at a specific time of the week/month to make sure we always have a full gas tank.
We play it by ear. We know relatively when we are 'really' gonna run out of gas and choose to milk it for all it's worth and PRAY we don't run out of gas before we barely make it to the gas station.
We recognize we are running out of gas but circumstances around us at the time (we got lost and are now in a looooong stretch or road without a gas station in site) don't let us fill up the gas tank. We are going to run out of gas.

I fit into number 3.

<p>This class was inspired by one of you lovely people. The mighty Jennessa posted on my Facebook wall asking if I would consider doing a prenatal class in the next couple of weeks and voila! Here it is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Here is the disclaimer: This class is aimed at pregnant women that already have a working knowledge of yoga and have done yoga prior to attempting doing this audio yoga class OR that recently have decided to practice yoga because they heard that yoga was good when you are pregnant. Always be mindful of your own body and consult your doctor or midwife before attempting any physical activity such as this class. This yoga class is not medical advice.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry to be so serious but it comes from my deep desire for you to choose what's best for you and to be mindful of the choices that you make especially when you have a beautiful little life growing inside of you.</p>
<p>Given that, this prenatal yoga class is a little over an hour, not too intricate but deeply focused. It is what I consider a level 1-2 class and not the best for absolute beginners of yoga. You may do the actual class or you may use it as a meditation and simply listen to me speak, and do an extended savasana :) Props to have near you if you happen to have them, blocks, blankets and bolsters. Use them as you please.</p>
<h2>The Meaning Within</h2>
<p>The theme of the class is all about creating meaningful boundaries. I find that when it comes to parenting physical reminders really help me. I have a gold pendant of the virgin mary that my Mom sent me, that is actually for Hunter when she gets big enough, I also have bought myself a couple of rings and a bracelet that hold deep meaning to me, due to the precious stones, the metal and even the shape. They serve as physical manifestations of sacred choices. It sort of magically worked out that this episode's sponsor was a jewelry site. I found a lovely amethyst silver ring that resembles one I wear when I want to choose to remember promises I've made to myself as well as a silver cuff that is almost exactly like one I own when I want to remember power, strength and grounding. <strong>If you wanna get yourself some power jewelry for yourself for Mother's day go to <a href="http://ice.com/yogaclass">http://ice.com/yogaclass</a> and get 25% off the entire store PLUS free shipping!

			<title>Ep 87: 25 min Level 2-3 Yoga Class- Immunity as Receptive Strength</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hunter got sick and it totally made me think about <em>immunity</em>. I'm sure that those of you that read this blog and perhaps other content that is similar are aware that immunity is not just about bacteria and viruses being present in your body and all of a sudden you get sick. It's not just about the physical. It's all about the beautiful trifecta of mind, body and spirit. All of this affects the how your body reacts and doesn't react to pathogens that decide they want to wreck havok inside of your body.</p>
<p><strong>The optimized circulation (inter-relationship) of our thoughts, our deep desires and the clarity of our body is the magic formula to sustain supreme health in all parts of our lives. I want to work more on that <em>circulation</em>.</strong></p>
<p>While Hunter was sick I found myself getting harder, more fearful and less willing to soften, <em>trust</em> and be grateful. She has a cold for goodness sake! I felt a deep tightness in my belly. I let my mind go to places that it should not have been going to, and in the process I was feeling pretty crappy myself, wound up, stressed out and nauseous.</p>
<p><strong><em>My circulation was off.</em></strong></p>
<p>It took all of me to focus and remember the goodness, the steadiness and the beauty.</p>
<p>This practice is what I did to get myself back together. I put myself upside down. I forced myself to physically get into a place that I was NOT in. Getting into the shape transformed my ability to see more than the little things and re-attune myself to the Bigger picture :)</p>
<h2>Physical benefits of this inversion/immunity practice:</h2>
<p>Strengthening the circulatory system (big focus for me this year).</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves blood-flow to the endocrine glands</li>
<li>Helps to energize and stabilize the whole of many systems. </li>
<li>Revs up the lymphatic system.</li>

			<title>Ep 86: Meaning and Truth To Sustain, Level 2 90 min yoga class</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://elsiesyogakula.com/2011/01/02/ep-86-meaning-and-truth-to-sustain-level-2-90-min-yoga-class/]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode was absolutely inspired by one of you.</p>
<p>I was asked basically how to practice yoga daily. This is something that I think about every day, that I meditate on, and continue to refine.</p>
<p>I'm not going to describe my own process but tell you what it boils down to, at least for me: <strong>Meaning and Truth</strong>.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t first and foremost ask yourself who you want to be in the world, what has meaning, what has value to you, and continue to refine the answer and deepen the questions again and again, whatever you decide to do (be it a daily asana practice) will be unsustainable.</p>
<p>If you <em>do</em> refine your questions and lack integrity in the way that you live your life, by telling yourself little lies and convincing yourself  that they <em>&lsquo;don&rsquo;t really matter&rsquo;</em>, no matter what you do, you will not be able to sustain your practice. Particularly your practice of being the best human being that you can be, with a full and clear heart.</p>
<p><strong>I'm only sharing &lsquo;cause I've been there. I tried really hard. Doesn&rsquo;t work. </strong></p>
<p>The more that you refine the sacredness of your life and live in truth the more freedom and lightness you will have and reflect. It is through choosing to remain steady with great sensitivity no matter what, that the ease and goodness of life becomes a daily gift to unwrap and enjoy. You will then not only have the deep strength needed to sustain this but also offer this great support to all those that you touch :D</p>
<p>Now on that positive note ;)</p>
<p><strong>Happy New Year! </strong></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[This episode was absolutely inspired by one of you.
I was asked basically how to practice yoga daily. This is something that I think about every day, that I meditate on, and continue to refine.
I'm not going to describe my own process but tell you what it boils down to, at least for me: Meaning and Truth.
If you don&rsquo;t first and foremost ask yourself who you want to be in the world, what has meaning, what has value to you, and continue to refine the answer and deepen the questions again and again, whatever you decide to do (be it a daily asana practice) will be unsustainable.
If you do refine your questions and lack integrity in the way that you live your life, by telling yourself little lies and convincing yourself  that they &lsquo;don&rsquo;t really matter&rsquo;, no matter what you do, you will not be able to sustain your practice. Particularly your practice of being the best human being that you can be, with a full and clear heart.
I'm only sharing &lsquo;cause I've been there. I tried really hard. Doesn&rsquo;t work. 
The more that you refine the sacredness of your life and live in truth the more freedom and lightness you will have and reflect. It is through choosing to remain steady with great sensitivity no matter what, that the ease and goodness of life becomes a daily gift to unwrap and enjoy. You will then not only have the deep strength needed to sustain this but also offer this great support to all those that you touch :D
Now on that positive note ;)
Happy New Year!

<p>The second mudra is called Kubera Mudra</p>
<p>One of the hardest things to do once you have resolved to stick to a really meaningful promise to yourself, or you've committed to something really valuable to you is&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">sticking to it</span>.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">We always waver</span>. No matter how strong your commitment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Kubera mudra is a physical expression of your deepest wish to stick to it.</span>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s very simple and this can be done so easily almost imperceptibly anywhere. It&rsquo;s very cool :)</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">Practicing Kubera Mudra</h2>
<p>The first thing you do is embody your sankalpa, your deepest heart&rsquo;s desire. If you can be clear and simple in formulating the words of your intention in a positive way, that would be really great.</p>
<ul>
<li>Settle into a quiet place regardless of where you are physically.</li>
<li>Place the tip of your thumb, index finger and middle finger together, bend the other two fingers so that they rest in the middle of your hand.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Putting your fingers together in this fashion is a huge forceful commitment.</span>&nbsp;You are harnessing desire, power, faith, courage and intensity behind those fingers.</li>
<li>If you happen to be alone and are up for speaking out your intention do it three times while holding the mudra.</li>
<li>Sit until you begin to sense your sankalpa seep into your breath and heart- again.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are out in the wild, just hold your fingers together in this fashion and let that power fuel the support that you need to follow through with your highest intentions.</p>
<p>A bonus feature of the Kubera mudra is that it opens up and decongests the frontal sinuses, especially if you draw air up upward as if you were smelling the sweetest yummiest perfume.</p>
<p>So you've gotten the background of the&nbsp;<a href="http://elsiesyogakula.com/2010/12/18/mudras-for-grounding-through-the-holidays/">Grounding Mudras</a>, you've learned about&nbsp;<a href="http://elsiesyogakula.com/2010/12/20/ganesha-mudra/">Ganesha Mudra</a>, and now you've got this one.</p>

There are times that I&rsquo;m so overwhelmed or so in my head that for the life of me,&nbsp;no matter how hard I try to settle and essentially calm down I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp;What I have found for myself is that if I engage physically: a yoga posture, a mudra, I drink a cup of my favorite tea, or even listen to my favorite podcast or music and take a brisk walk, I don&rsquo;t have to work so hard to get my inner self to shift.

			<title>Ep: 85 Level 2 90 Minute Yoga Class Are You The Bully? </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://scy.libsyn.com/ep-85-level-2-90-minute-yoga-class-are-you-the-bully-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Who Is The Bully?</h1>
<p>I've been doing a lot of meditation on worthlessness or the feeling of being unworthy.</p>
<p>Often times this feeling arises from the way the world speaks to us, perhaps in the form of bullies around us, family members, peers, bosses, etc. but what has really become clear is that it's not the world that is the root of this feeling, but ourselves.</p>
<p>The biggest bullies that we have in our world are not outside of ourselves but within ourselves.</p>
<p>In this class I went back to one of my favorite books, Christina Sell's Yoga from the inside out, as she speaks of this bullying within the book so very clearly. She inspired me to teach this class to get you to look at yourself honestly and recognize the bully within. See it and transform it.</p>
<p>Recognize how worthy and beautiful you are. Stop the bullying.</p>
<p>I know that I have been a bully to myself. I also know how that personal bully can break the heart much faster the outside ones.</p>
<p>Are you a bully to yourself? Practice along with us. Give yourself the time to rediscover your worth.</p>
<p>You won't regret it!</p>]]></description>

Often times this feeling arises from the way the world speaks to us, perhaps in the form of bullies around us, family members, peers, bosses, etc. but what has really become clear is that it's not the world that is the root of this feeling, but ourselves.
The biggest bullies that we have in our world are not outside of ourselves but within ourselves.
In this class I went back to one of my favorite books, Christina Sell's Yoga from the inside out, as she speaks of this bullying within the book so very clearly. She inspired me to teach this class to get you to look at yourself honestly and recognize the bully within. See it and transform it.
Recognize how worthy and beautiful you are. Stop the bullying.
I know that I have been a bully to myself. I also know how that personal bully can break the heart much faster the outside ones.
Are you a bully to yourself? Practice along with us. Give yourself the time to rediscover your worth.
You won't regret it!]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>Ep 83: 25 Minute Meditation- Finding Your Center In Difficult Situations</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/scy/83_Ep_83-_25_Minute_Meditation__Finding_Your_Center_In_Difficult_Situations.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>25 minute meditation.</p>
<p>These past few months I nearly got overwhelmed by anxiety.</p>
<p>This hasn't happened to me in a LONG time.</p>
<p>I lost control of my rational thought process and simply dove into a feeling that was suffocating and terrifying. I can't say that I was in any way comfortable. The only thing that pulled me out of it was my toddler Hunter. She forced me to get out of myself and engage her. The moment that I disconnected from her off I went into a very uncomfortable sense of overwhelm.</p>
<p>I refused this.</p>
<h1>Take Control of Your Anxiety and Fear</h1>
<p>Instead of allowing myself to be pulled by this avalanche of anxiety and fear I chose to meet it, with softness and full consciousness. I looked at it straight in the eye. I used a technique that I heard in a podcast, and I sooooo wish that I remembered what episode and what this guy's name was because I would share it, believe me, but at this moment, finding the episode would take me YEARS, so that will wait. I may update this post to add the info</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the technique was to feel where the emotion was in my body, fully. You are to notice which was its winding, clock wise or counter clock wise, and slowly unwind the feeling the other way until it dissolves. At first just moving into that hard ball of tension in the middle of my diaphragm was enough...but as I practiced this technique I began to see that I could literally unravel the anxiety!</p>
<p>Unraveling- It's all about creating space, space to feel, to choose, to remember, and to find your ground. Most importantly, finding space helps you remember that you are part of something so much bigger. Anxiety is about disconnection and isolation. It's an emotion that rises when you absolutely become limited and small. As you unravel the feeling, you begin to get more spacious, there is literally more room in your body, your breath, your mind, your heart, and you can step back a bit and see things as if you are watching from a bird's eye view.</p>
<h2>You are ok. You truly are. You are more than ok in fact :D</h2>
<p>A couple of days ago I received and email from one of you requesting a more breathing centered practice. Although this simple audio meditation is not specifically about the breath, there is no way to escape the breath. Space is breath.</p>
<p>Every time choose to center myself and incorporate this very accessible and easy meditation practice, you get the opportunity to re-attune yourself to align with something more than anxiety and fear.</p>
<p>I want that!</p>
<p>Listen, practice and do this and tell me what happens! I'd love to hear if this works for you</p>

			<title>Ep 82: 90 Min Level 2 Yoga Class- Stay Open, Learn, Choose the Highest and Share </title>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>An iPhone 4 Yoga Class For Your Enjoyment!</h1>
<p>And here I thought that I was going to get some time to be able to publish more episodes to you guys...in JULY.</p>
<p>Not so much, but alas! Here&rsquo;s a yoga class to start the month off right! This one is close to my heart. It&rsquo;s focus is all about the way we are swayed and often times misguided by what we see and hear all around us, especially the media. It is a call to take responsibility for our choice making and the way we go about making choices. The inspiration for this class came straight from all the hoopla around the iPhone 4 and its antenna issues.</p>
<p>If you happen to <a href="http://twitter.com/yogeek">follow me on Twitter </a>or are part of the <a href="http://facebook.com/elsiesyogakula">Facebook Elsie&rsquo;s Yoga Kula Community</a>, you would know that I have an iPhone 4! Yipeeee! So I speak from my own experience with the device, and I&rsquo;m totally loving it!</p>
<p>Given that I&rsquo;m sure you have heard at least something about the whole antenna thing, so I sorta offer my 2 cents about it and wrap it around a yoga class.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about this theme is that it mirrored the hoopla around an article on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25Yoga-t.html">my beloved teacher John Friend</a> in the NY Times. If you haven&rsquo;t already, please read the article,<a href="http://www.anusara.com/index.php?option=com_wpmu&amp;p=107&amp;blog_id=2&amp;Itemid=250"> John&rsquo;s response to the article</a> PLUS <a href="http://www.elephantjournal.com/2010/07/waylon-lewis-interviews-john-friend-founder-of-anusara-yoga-re-controversial-popular-ny-times-feature-article/">Elephant Journal&rsquo;s exclusive interview with John</a>. Interesting how perspectives and opinions shift and change if you simply choose to step deeper into them :) And move from your heart.</p>
<h1>This week&rsquo;s online yoga class</h1>
<p>This yoga podcast class is a level 2 class, and if you have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LGMLSW?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=elsyoku-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000LGMLSW">yoga block</a> in the house, please feel free to take it out and play with it during our backbends towards the end of class. I cut a bit of the class in the middle because I did a demo that doesn&rsquo;t really work if you weren't there so why put you guys through it :) If you do hear references to it, or to another demo that I had a student do, just dismiss them. Pretend that you went to the bathroom during that part of the class!</p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep 81: 85 min Level 2 Yoga Class- Immerse Your Value into The Heart and HOLD! </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/scy/81__Immerse_Your_Value_into_The_Heart_and_HOLD_85_min_Level_2_Yoga_Class.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> </span></p>
<p>A powerful Level 2 yoga class that builds lots of internal strength and stamina</p>
<p>I know that if I asked you who or what you hold valuable and dear you could tell me without much thought. I'm sure that you've thought about how much your family, your homes, your friends, your culture, etc. means to you. I'm sure that now that I've brought your attention to this, you have a clear idea in your head and feel pretty strong about where you place your value.</p>
<p>The thing is, that we think about this too much. I mean that we keep that which we value in our thinking mind. We intellectuallize much more than we internalize it, within our hearts. There is a level of detachment that comes with it. Yes, we love our family. Yes, we love our friends. Yes, we value our home. Here's the question: Do your actions, from day to day, from moment to moment honor and abide by that higher intention? If we could graph our daily activity, and our daily thoughts, what truly takes up the majority of our days? What would it show?</p>
<p>I know that for me, my graph would show huge interaction with my cellphone and my ipod. It would also show me constantly checking my email, FB, Twitter, and stats.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[ 
A powerful Level 2 yoga class that builds lots of internal strength and stamina
I know that if I asked you who or what you hold valuable and dear you could tell me without much thought. I'm sure that you've thought about how much your family, your homes, your friends, your culture, etc. means to you. I'm sure that now that I've brought your attention to this, you have a clear idea in your head and feel pretty strong about where you place your value.
The thing is, that we think about this too much. I mean that we keep that which we value in our thinking mind. We intellectuallize much more than we internalize it, within our hearts. There is a level of detachment that comes with it. Yes, we love our family. Yes, we love our friends. Yes, we value our home. Here's the question: Do your actions, from day to day, from moment to moment honor and abide by that higher intention? If we could graph our daily activity, and our daily thoughts, what truly takes up the majority of our days? What would it show?
I know that for me, my graph would show huge interaction with my cellphone and my ipod. It would also show me constantly checking my email, FB, Twitter, and stats. (Note the word checking, there is no actual engagement involved.) And these are my physical behaviours! I am also guilty of being with my daughter and having my mind full of everything BUT my daughter. I think more about podcasts, blog posts and creating content on a daily basis than I think about my breath, my body and growing my relationship with those that I have said I hold valuable. There are countless opportunities to deepen relationships. There is enough time. I know that I tend to leak my energy in places, thoughts and actions that in no way deserve it. Unconsciously, through my thoughts and actions I am serving and cultivating less than optimal relationships.
The level of commitment and discipline required to sustain an optimal level of engagement and relationship in our lives is great. It requires that we choose, and choose again, always refining and clarifying moment to moment. We must sustain the focus throughout our days, slowly building a strong internal practice, that lets us be at once soft and steady.
As I became aware of this for myself, I had to share this. I know that I am not alone. My desire is to place what I value in my heart, not in my head. My desire is to engage and hold the sacred where it's meant to be.
How about you? Do you observe your behaviors and thoughts serving and cultivating less than optimal relationships? In what ways to do abide by the Highest?
Start By Breathing
FYI! There's a video towards the end of the post to supplement this episode :)

<p>I had never viewed memory as something alive and tangible. In fact, I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve ever thought about memories as &lsquo;gifts.&rsquo; As I thought about this concept I realized that when I remember something from my childhood or come across a scent I hadn&rsquo;t smelled in a long time, or find an article of clothing I haven't worn in a long time, it is like receiving a gift. Those memories are gifts I get to open every time I encounter them. They always serve to remind me of what I give value to in my life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/programs/2010/alzheimers/essay_dienstag-lessonsfromthelifelines.shtml">One answer that emerged from the Lifelines group is that we should surround people who are forgetting with acts of remembering. People in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease are in danger of forgetting that they can still remember, as are those of us who work with people with Alzheimer's. - Dr. Dienstag</a></p>

<p>Something affected me about this sentence. Yes, it is about folks that have been diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s, but did you catch the last little bit of that quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as are those of us that work with people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>To me that means everyone.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s when we are about to loose something that we hold dear that we choose to step in fully to do something about it. Why is that? Why must we wait until the situation is dire before choosing to fully engage in our lives, our relationships, our environment, our bodies, our hearts, etc?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Move back into the culture of your body, cultivate it and grow it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was the theme of this week&rsquo;s episode. Inspired by a conversation from one of my favorite podcasts Speaking of Faith . It was regarding manuscripts and the &ldquo;monastic library that rescues manuscripts from across the centuries and across the world. And there are worlds in this place &mdash; on palm leaf and papyrus, in microfilm and pixels &mdash; stories of ordinary life as well as the rise and fall of civilizations....In their lives as in this work, the relevance of ancient manuscripts to people of the present and the cultural cargo of the past itself are revealed in a new light.&rdquo; - Krista Tippet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a particular affinity for manuscripts themselves, in fact I haven't ever really thought about them, but after listening to this episode they were revealed to me as yet another expression of the sacred in the every day, and how there are so many many treasures that often times we overlook within our every day lives</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The treasure that I speak about in class specifically is the treasure of our bodies, and the way that we loose sight of the beauty of it&rsquo;s culture until it begins to unravel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step into the challenge of Truth and get Healthy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping on this same topic, I am launching an in depth 3 part eCourse. I&rsquo;ve had requests from the online yoga community, from my Pittsburgh yoga community AND from my own desire to create this. It employs empowering simple practices that you can incorporate toward your optimal health and wellness.</p>

<p>Yoga Lesson: How do we tune into nature and allow it to deepen our life?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every day I am brought to back to the application of yoga lessons in my life. Yoga or life as I choose to see it now, becomes a pulsating beneficent opportunity, a gift really, for me to become a better human being. This past week I was given the task of preparing one of my current students to step into an Anusara Immersion with my beloved teachers that has already started. She missed the first weekend, or half of Part 1. My job is to catch her up *gulp*.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Out have come all of my notes and of course the Immersion Lesson plans and the like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Succinctly explaining the Anusara Philosophy, the 3 As and the UPAs (Universal Principles of Alignment &trade;) is not the easiest thing when you have crazy time constraints. Arghhh!!!...goodness gracious!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So given that, studentship has been on my mind. I am stepping into the seat of the student as I pour over how to convey all this knowledge in a way that will be optimally soaked in by her. I adore the way that I heard John explain studentship using the Elements. I remember how he shared that using the elements as teaching tools is wonderful because they are understood and experienced by all, so we have a common ground from which to step into the teachings and also deepen the understanding of the UPAs within the yoga postures. Since I&rsquo;d been meditating on this theme, lo and behold, I taught all about it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This episode&rsquo;s online yoga class is a Level 1.5 class (in other words strong).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s slow, meditative and we take time to get into things. I hope you enjoy stepping into it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, let me know which elements you resonate with the most :D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my intro I told you that I recorded 2 other classes that I was unable to use for the podcast, but I&rsquo;m making them available to you, if you would like to download them. Both of them are level 2 yoga classes. One of them is a full 80 minute class with less than optimal audio, and the other one was a TOTALLY awesome class, but I ran out of batteries half way through the class! Ugh!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EXTRA Level 2 80 min Class with the theme of Dreaming and Community EXTRA Level 2 Unfinished Class with the them of &ldquo;Let Your Smallness Dissolve&rdquo; and the Pareto Principle</p>
<p>★★★I want reviews from you!★★★</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any yoga gear, or yoga clothing, or any yoga related accesory that you would like to review either because you LOVE it, or HATE it, or perhaps are simply indifferent. Let me know! email me at eyogaclass (at) gmail (dot) com. I would love to have you be part of the online yoga community :D</p>

&nbsp;
EXTRA Level 2 80 min Class with the theme of Dreaming and Community EXTRA Level 2 Unfinished Class with the them of &ldquo;Let Your Smallness Dissolve&rdquo; and the Pareto Principle
★★★I want reviews from you!★★★
&nbsp;
If you have any yoga gear, or yoga clothing, or any yoga related accesory that you would like to review either because you LOVE it, or HATE it, or perhaps are simply indifferent. Let me know! email me at eyogaclass (at) gmail (dot) com. I would love to have you be part of the online yoga community :D

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is NOT a yoga class!&nbsp;Hello and welcome to episode number 4 of Elsie&rsquo;s Yoga Kula the special series of Elsie&rsquo;s Yoga Class: Live and Unplugged Podcast, that&rsquo;s all about you and all sorts of extra exclusive information about yoga and culture. As always this podcast is brought to you by the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=329177574&amp;mt=8">Elsie&rsquo;s Yoga Class Podcast App for the iPhone and iPod Touch</a> available in the iTunes app store for $3.99. Why not have your yoga in your pocket!</p>
<p>Listen to the Podcast</p>
<p>I am sooooo excited about this episode! Two subjects people, two subjects that I get a ton of email and questions about. The first topic is aimed a bit more toward yoga/fitness/alternative health professionals. I am honored that a lot of you listen to the podcast and am glad that you reach out to me regarding how to grow and supplement your own practices and businesses via new media. I can help you regarding audio stuff, but my video making skills I&rsquo;m afraid are not as pristine HA! I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen at least one of my videos where I cut off my head!</p>
<p>Cut off head videos:</p>
<ul>
<li>sun salutation</li>
<li>headless pigeon</li>
</ul>
<p>So given that, I had the privilege of interviewing someone that DOES have lots of expertise with a still camera and a video camera, plus even more know how as to how to create, yes, CREATE your own DVD (something I know NOTHING about). You guys will just LOVE this interview, seriously, tons of great conversation and sharing of insights! Which brings me to the next topic of the episode: Yoga and Men!!! I know that most of y&rsquo;all listening right now are women. To those of you that practice consistently in a studio setting, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve come to see that the majority of people that come to yoga class are women. That demographic is also true of the listeners to this podcast, BUT I do have some pretty strong and committed male listeners. I also have some wanna be committed male yogis that have stayed away because they are a bit afraid. I don&rsquo;t blame them, the first time I walked into a yoga studio I also was a bit intimidated. I just happened to have had a bit more experience with dance/movement/bare feet/hard wood floors due to my life as a theater actor, but it was still a bit weird. I get it, especially for the guys, the images that you see out there of peeps in al those yoga shapes, can be a bit intimidating, so I asked my guest, who is also a yoga intructor! In fact, there was a time in his life that he taught yoga INSIDE PRISONS!</p>
<p>So who is this super man you ask? His name is James Wvinner, producer/director/photographer/yoga teacher/yogi extraordinaire. You ready to step into the conversation? Here we go! This was recorded at grandma&rsquo;s house on a Saturday afternoon...</p>
<p>Listen to the Podcast!</p>
<p>Here are the links of all that James touched on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Desiree Rumbaugh DVDs</li>
<li>Brian Kest</li>
<li>Richard Freeman DVD</li>
<li>Fit Soul Fit Body</li>
<li>Desi Bartlett </li>
</ul>
<p>Tell me that product doesn&rsquo;t sound awesome? I know that I want it! So, I have a little surprise, for all of you lovely Kula members, you guys will get 10% off the product for the next month! So basically you guys have until March 23 to get 10% of the how to create your own exercise dvd! You just have to listen to the podcast to get the coupon code! I know how hard it is to gather up information and study and learn from so many different resources. I believe this is one of the most valuable products that I&rsquo;ve seen come to market, plus it comes from such a genuine guy with so much talent I can&rsquo;t even take it! Have you seen his photographs and his videos?</p>
<p>This has to be my all time favorite 30 second promos that I&rsquo;ve EVER seen. When I saw this promo, I totally wanted to work with James. Seriously.</p>
<p><a href="&rdquo;https:/www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=90457&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=106706&rdquo;" target="&rdquo;ejejcsingle&rdquo;">Click here to visit Make Your Own Exercise DVD.</a></p>
<p>Well, enough about that!</p>
<h2>Yeay for Men and Yoga!!! A request for you guys</h2>
<p>I wanna bring it back to the men. So what did you &lsquo;guys&rsquo; think about what James had to say? I&rsquo;m putting out a request for you men, those of you that listen to this podcast. Would you help out your fellow wanna be yogis that are a bit intimidated by this whole yoga thing and send an email or better yet call 310 651 6238 and leave a voice message to give some advice? perhaps share some of your favorite resources? That would be really really cool!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to make this episode too long so I&rsquo;m just gonna share a few emails with you, I&rsquo;ll share more on the next one.</p>

<p>This is a comment regarding EYK Episode 3 Yoga App, Muscular Energy and The Best Yoga Mats</p>
<blockquote>Hi Elsie, thanks for the podcast!&nbsp;&nbsp;So good to hear from you.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to add my two cents worth of advice about the mats.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have always had a lot of problems slipping and sliding on my regular sticky mat especially in downward facing dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;I got a lovely grippy Jade yoga mat which helped but did not solve the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;About 9 months ago I got a Yogitoes skidless towel.&nbsp;&nbsp;This towel goes on top of the regular sticky mat and there is no more slipping and sliding!! It has really made a huge difference in my practice, I cannot recommend it enough for anyone who is having problems with slipping due to sweaty palms.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only drawback is that it does not work on the Jade mat, you have to put in on the regular cheap kind of mat.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand it is easy to wash, I just pop it in the washing machine and let it air dry, and it has held up really well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope this can help someone!</blockquote>
<p>And here's a lovely little email :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Elsie,</p>
<p>I've been doing your level 2-3 yoga podcasts almost every morning for the past two months and I'm addicted! I've been going to yoga classes on and off for years, but for the first time I feel like someone is actually teachingme. And I can't even see you! I'm an acrobat and aerial artist so I&nbsp;&nbsp;do a lots of stretching and conditioning to stay in shape, but I have to say that after two months of doing your classes I'm more flexible than I've ever been in my life. You should see my backbends now...my shoulders are so much more open now because in one of your podcast you talked about hand placement. It was the tiny adjustment I needed to make to really round out my upper back and push my my chest forward. And also, splits are easier than ever now thanks finally doing to all of those high lunges correctly. I hope one day I can make it out to Pittsburgh and take a class in person. You rock!</p>
<p>Thank you for everything,</p>
<p>JD</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> </span></p>
<p>Upon learning about and delving into the earthquake in Haiti, and specifically the lack of infrastructure within the area where the earthquake hit, and the lack of foundation to receive help, it forced me to look at what was going on in my &lsquo;home&rsquo;, my heart, my surroundings so that I could help create clarity HERE and NOW.</p>
<h1 style="font-size: 2em;">Why HERE and NOW?</h1>
<p>I donated money. In fact, how could you not? It was made so easy to give, so very easy to give. You saw how fast the human heart can open up and offer. You all experienced a sense of unity did you not? It&rsquo;s amazing how open our hearts are. I have so much faith in the human race and our ability to open our hearts. I have no doubt.</p>
<p>Now, our ability to keep the hearts open and sensitive, to work daily to make choices that will optimize our well being and that of those around us is a different story. I can speak from personal experience as I say that I&rsquo;m lazy when it comes to that stuff. I often times choose to &lsquo;fix&rsquo; what&rsquo;s broken in the house later. It&rsquo;s too much of a pain now. I&rsquo;ll eat healthier later. This pound of ice-cream isn&rsquo;t gonna hurt me now. I&rsquo;ll discipline and engage with my daughter later, she&rsquo;s only 16 months old, there&rsquo;s plenty of time....and on and on and on. That later, turns into years (or at minimum months). Those every day things are the infrastructure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/infrastructure">An underlying base or foundation especially for an organization or system.<br />The basic facilities, services, and installations needed for the functioning of a community or society, such as transportation and communications systems, water and power lines, and public institutions including schools, post offices, and prisons</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we don&rsquo;t tend to that, regardless of how open our hearts are, how willing we are to give, how much we want to work, the delivery of that love, support, resources will not get there easily. At least that&rsquo;s how I see it. The foundation will not be set when push comes to shove. Infrastructure is not exotic, it&rsquo;s not exciting, it&rsquo;s very grounded, methodical, and I guess you could say boring? Our job as yogis is to make these every day choices, these mundane often boring and at times, may I say annoying tasks sacred, valuable and full of meaning. It is in those every day ways that we build our foundation, our underlying system within our household, within our relationships, within our BODIES that we create the optimal way for us to share that wealth of heart and spirit with which we are all blessed</p>
<p>.</p>
<h1 style="font-size: 2em;">Build the infrastructure and Clear the path to Love</h1>
<p>The more that we cultivate our infrastructure, the more that we will be able to share and love each other, support each other in a myriad of ways. We will be ever more effective and clear and raise ourselves and each other to a higher level of consciousness.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have to be very honest, winter is very challenging for me. I do my best to see all the goodness, I really do, but when winter begins, man does it kick my spiritual booty!   I don't often have time to sit and meditate on my themes for my classes. I'm working on being more efficient in my themeing and conveying more of the Anusara Principles of Alignment &trade; and Philosophy more clearly, but as I'm sure some of you teachers know this requires work, time and study. The clearer and simpler a teacher's theme is the more skilled and experienced they are (at least that's my observation). It's kinda like watching a great dancer, you only see the beauty of the art, you get pulled into the dance itself, not the specifics of the dance, the steps, how many hours the artist had to rehearse in order to make it seamless...  I'm getting more and more adept at allowing nature to guide me into what I teach. This generally happens during my walk to teach my yoga class. I've learned to let go of 'what I have to do' and simply allow myself to listen and to drink inspiration freely.   Thank God for Christmas lights!  They were so beautiful! They showed me things I hadn't seen in a while, streets that I walk often shifted and shone in a different way. I was more intrigued by what was going inside the homes that the outside. I saw beautifully decorated houses whose windows shone so bright. I saw shapes and figures all inviting me to step deeper into the homes, into the warmth of the inner dwelling. I realized that the holiday lights where put there in a very strategic way, they weren't just randomly placed, they weren't merely thrown out, but carefully thought out and generally speaking, placed in ways that would enhance each individual dwelling. The specificity of the way the light was cast out was a clear reflection of the owners time, thought and commitment. I saw that in order to place these lights optimally the dweller must first be willing to search the closets, the basements, the attics, to get the boxes out and choose what to cast out. What makes this so glorious is that all this beauty wouldn't be seen if it wasn't for the shorter and darker days of winter.   The winter serves to take us deeper into the closet of the self so that we may bring out the decorations of light and enhance the world around us by the way in which we choose to cast our own individual light out into the world. Vasudeva vasu = dwelling place deva = the light The nature of the universe is how you choose to pour the light of consciousness into the dwelling place of the self. As you do this oh how it shines brightly all around, showing off those mighty beautiful lights. How do you choose to create a dwelling place of light?   Just putting that out there....  So, given all that, this week's class is a Level 2 class, I know it's been a while! Let me know your thoughts, I always ADORE hearing from you all!!!! you can call me at 310 651 6238 email me at eyogaclass@gmail.com or comment at elsiesyogakula.com :)  Remember this podcast is brought to you by the Elsie's Yoga Class Podcast App for the iPhone, a lovely way to support the podcast if you happen to own an iPhone or iPod Touch. $3.99 in iTunes! $3.99!!!! That's pretty cheap if you ask me! Consider purchasing it!</p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://scy.libsyn.com/eyk_episode_3_yoga_app_muscular_energy_and_the_best_yoga_mats]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The voice mail that is played at the beginning of this episode is why I decided to do these episodes that I call Elsie's Yoga Kula. There is so much power to sharing your journey. This practice of yoga can take you to so many absolutely fabulous places, not only on the mat but off the mat. I know that my yoga practice opened up so much for me, in fact it was the catalyst for gigantic growth in my life, and I'm in no way talking about the poses. They are the icing on the cake :) They provided me with the first courageous steps towards something more! Thank you sooo much for sharing Jeanne (sp?) ! I am thrilled when I hear stories like yours, those that are all about stepping deeper into your self, to see the vast goodness that dwells within! NICE! Oh, and I would be honored to have you come to my class! Even though I only teach 1 public class a week...but more to come, promise!  As you can hear, this message was actually sent 'quite' a while ago. I'm trying to go back and honor you guys that sent me messages long ago :) And if you haven't sent a message to share with me and the kula DO SO. I'd love to help all of us stay inspired and feel that we are truly part of a world wide community! So call me to share at 310 651 6238  Hello everybody and welcome to Elsie's Yoga Kula episode #3! Happy Autumn :) Oh man is Pittsburgh gorgeous when the leaves start to change! My most favorite changes, that of the ivy, it's like fire snakes climbing up trees and buildings. So beautiful! So much has happened this year it's unbelievable. truly. Last year right around this time I became a mother. Yep, my lovely Hunter is 1 year old as of October 2. Happy Happy birthday my baby girl! You have shifted me to become someone I honestly never knew was inside. I've gotten...sturdier, that's for sure :) I started to finally teach public classes, I was laid off of my job last November, man! and now I'm in the process of developing my own consulting business. As soon as I get all my stuff in gear I'll let you all know all about it. You can venture to YoGeek.Me, to see a gradual development of posts delving into the world of yoga and technology :)  It has been an incredible fortifying year, full of everything you can imagine, calm, love, fear, angst, courage, meltdowns, you name it. I have LIVED! You guys have made this year for me a sort of life line. Your emails and messages and support have provided me with hope and strength. If you are listening to the podcast I now read an email from Maria Rose from Vermont :D and my response to her email!  Listen to the Podcast!  EYK News:  Remember how I mentioned the cool personalized bottle from the company SIGG on EKY Episode 1? Well, I take that back. I used to love those bottles but the practices of their CEO has left me less than pleased. Here's the quick scoop: SIGG CEO Steve Wasik recently announced that SIGG water bottles did in fact contain the toxic chemical bisphenol A (BPA) in its liners until August 2008. That means that any bottle that you purchased before 10/08 contains BPA. They are allowing customers that purchased a bottle prior to this date (you would know by the bronze liner instead of the pale yellow liner that are the new ones) to exchange their bottles.  But the Environmental Working Group is not satisfied with this. Here is letter sent by the President of EWG to SIGG: On behalf of the Environmental Working Group (EWG), I write to ask that you issue an unambiguous apology for misleading consumers and retailers about whether SIGG bottles contain the toxic chemical bisphenol-A (BPA). I further urge you to modify SIGG Switzerland CEO Steve Wasik's recent announcement of a SIGG voluntary bottle exchange program. Consumers should be able to take SIGG bottles that contain BPA to an authorized SIGG retailer and receive a refund for the full retail value of the product. The cost of the refund should be covered by SIGG. The announced exchange policy, which forces customers to accept a replacement SIGG bottle, puts them in the untenable position of having to trust Mr. Wasik and his team about the composition and safety of the replacement product. It is our view that SIGG's reputation will be difficult to restore while Mr. Wasik remains at the helm of the company. Sincerely,    Kenneth A. Cook President Environmental Working Group  In case you want to exchange your product you can go to http://mysigg.com/bulletin/ to read all about it. I'll post a link in the shownotes.  Just last week I was interviewed by David Spark about my new iPhone App! It was such a cool experience. He's a really great guy. What was crazy about the whole thing is that I scheduled it specifically so that Hunter was in an optimal mood and she could keep herself occupied. The interview was supposed to take 10 min. Of course none of it went as planned. As we signed on in Skype, my camera decided not to work...ggrrrrrr. I had to trouble shoot for about 10 minutes! I did have an opportunity to see my lovely friend Inge's face as I had my mini freak out. I asked her to help me but at that time she had no solutions for me. I figured it out FINALLY! then of course, the moment that David started recording the podcast Hunter fell down and conked her head. yep, of course she did. anyway, the whole thing ended up going really well. I'll put a link in the shownotes for ya'll.  Here's the article on David's Blog: Elsie's Yoga Class: Making Money From Podcasting  Here's the larger piece on Mashable! 9 Successful Techniques For Making Money From Podcasting  And speaking of my iPhone/iPod Touch app...Have you gotten a chance to buy it yet? It's $3.99 and what you get is the ability to stream all of my content, all 70+ classes without downloading anything at all, at the push of a button! Plus, I'll be adding a PDF of the sequences of my classes a little bit a time, so you can have it with you as you practice! Occasionally I may add little videos here and there and some other bits and pieces of content. Now, I have to clarify that if you happen to have an iPod Touch, the only time that you can stream the content is when you are connected via Wifi. Thank you Lisa for helping me be clear about this :) Full disclosure, there have been some issues with the 1st version of the app (the classes not streaming and the app itself not opening). The new version HAS been released which fixes the majority of the bugs. If you have downloaded the app and still experience problems, please feel free to contact me via email so we can get the issues resolved!  If you have wanted to support this podcast, this is a wonderful way to do it. I do get a teeny bit of money from the sale of each app. I'd like to take the opportunity to thank all of you that have already downloaded the app, from the bottom of my heart, and I'd also like to thank all those of you that have donated to Elsie's Yoga Kula. I'll share that last months donations allowed me to make our car payment. It was a blessing. I've been doing this podcast for 3 years and I have never put up a donate button, until now. At this moment, I feel that I can and I have had requests from you guys, so it's helped me make the decision. If you'd like to donate to the podcast please feel free to do so, if you'd like to donate to the podcast in another way other than in a monetary way, I have put up a page telling you of all sorts of ways in which you can 'donate' that don't include money. Check it out. Any little thing totally helps and like the page says, Support the Podcast, support the family!  We have another voice mail from a listener! So listen up if you wanna hear :)  Here's Vanessa Best's Web site: The Spinal Space  Thank you Juli from Atlanta! I know it was a while ago, but she very kindly sent me an email and told me that I had inadvertedly tagged episode 69 with an 'explicit' tag, YIKES! Totally did not want to do that. I went in there and fixed it as soon as I could, although I know that a few of you got that episode with an explicit tag, and of course there was nothing explicit about it...  It's all about listener emails!  Carli from Kansas  My 16 year old son talked me into trying Yoga with him. He plays football and his coach got them started on Yoga. I am a runner and lift weights, I took a yoga class once but it never stuck. So I started looking for yoga podcasts and came across yours. I loved it. It was very hard for me to follow at first because I am not familiar with the poses. So I went online and found your website! I flipped out when I realized I can look at the poses to the episodes online and follow that way. I'm so stuck on yoga now! I love your classes and how you describe things. You Rock!  Thank you so much Carli :) You know, I totally keep forgetting to tell you guys to come check out this site! The pictures are there, there are a couple of times where there are corresponding videos and extra links at times, especially when I mention an article or something like that in my theme :) oh, and the EYK episodes will be transcribed as a blog post (hence this post ;) ), so if you wanna read, what I said, then all you have to do is go to the corresponding blog post!  Marie from Ol Miss  Hi Elsie!I hope you are well. I've just started listening to your podcasts, and they are so great! I have a random question for you. What kind or brand of mat would you recommend to someone who is just beginning yoga? I have a mat that I have had for a long time, (I've started and stopped yoga a few times), but it is starting to kind of thin and I've found a few holes. Also, do you have any other advice for a newbie like me? Thank you so much and have a great weekend! Marie  Here's my answer to Marie  Hello Marie :) Great questions! Regarding the yoga mat...I'm a very big fan of the Jade Yoga Mats. At times they can bunch up a little bit off the floor, as they are not as 'sticky' as the yoga mats that you would purchase almost anywhere. My fave from Jade is The Encore because I like my mats to have a bit more substance when I practice. The Encore is the one that I have (at least I have the prototype as they sent it to me before it was released. Also love Beinjoy yoga mats. They are soooooooooooooooooo pretty :) That gets some bonus points from me. They feel very good. Also I own 2 Manduka &trade; mats, the purple PROlite and the Black Mat PRO. They have some eco friendly versions that are also available, which I've been meaning to try. My purple mat has lasted me for about 5 yrs! and it looks almost the same as when I bought it. The only thing thats wrong with it now is that my kitties got to it and scratched the tar out of it ;) They also have a mat that supports an organization called 'off the mat into the world' which I think is pretty darn fabulous organization. Another company that I love is Prana. They have a FANTASTIC mat that I want to purchase the is wider than most mats out there. When I practice in order to have my shoulders properly aligned I honestly have to widen them so much that my pinky fingers end up being off the mat. I don't mind, but their new Revolution mat takes care of that! Plus it's eco friendly :) A lot of the mats that I have mentioned are pretty pricey, $60+ and UP! It is a lot of $ I know. You can get some mats from Prana, or Jade or even Lululemon that are eco friendly for between $35 and 40. I know that I have not needed another mat after buying my purple mat so long ago. I just like to try out other mats, and share about them :) Let me know if I can help you with anything else! As a beginner practitioner, I would merely say to take your time, to listen to yourself, and to choose to always be honest and open with yourself every time you get on the mat. Choose to step in deeper and enjoy your own body, with all it's 'limitations'. They make you the unique beauty that you are. If you get through a class and you haven't smiled....I would make that my priority :) Smiling and laughing truly allows for a deeper moving into your heart to see what really matters!  Marie's answer:  I ended up getting a Manduka Black Mat Pro and I love it!!! I've been practicing for three weeks and it has been really awesome to see how my body is responding. I also wanted to let yo u know that I started a blog about my yoga journey, girlmeetsmat.blogspot.com. I am wide open to any comments or suggestion :) Thank you so much for everything!!  NICE! I do love the Manduka Black mat. That thing is hardy, the thing for me is that I now tend to leave that one at home as trekking around with that puppy on a bike, or a bus, or any amount of walking that isn't just a block or so, is soooooooo hard on my back. That mat is HEAVY :) Just to let you all know, there is a fantastic article by one of my Twitter/Facebook buddies, the mighty Nancy Alder and it's all about this same exact subject. It really gets in to more detail about the mats and especially pricing and it's a great read!  Nancy Alder's article: Ecologically Minded Yoga Mats Meaghan Message :D  Hello! How are you on this beautiful day?! I am a fellow yoga teacher, brand new, and IN LOVE with your site. It is so inspirational and moving and every detail means so much. Thank you for keeping us involved with your journey.  I wanted to take a moment to personally invite you to take a peek at my website. I am training to run a half marathon to raise money for research towards Crohns, a disease incredibly close to my heart, which my boyfriend has struggled with for more than 20 years.  My website is : meaghansrun.net  The first ten people to raise 500 dollars in the next week will be matched 500 from a local company! So, if you are thinking you may be able to donate (any amount, big or small) -- now would be a perfect time! And, it is tax deductible  . Lots of love and thanks,  Meaghanxo  I saw the other day mighty Meaghan or Megan ) sorry if I mispronounced your name that you reached your goal! Congratulations, and if any of you would like to donate to the cause follow the link above! and thank you so much for sending this along!  Kate in Italy!  Hi Elsie, I am a Canadian living in Italy and have just started using your podcasts for my daily practice. Thank you! You say the phrase "scissor your legs asymmetrically together" quite a few times and I am very confused what this means...is it possible to get some clue about that? Thank you again for beaming your classes out for the world to access. In Italy classes are in Italian which makes English speaking me a little lost. Your classes are a big help. All the best.  You know what I wanted to do to answer this question? I wanted to ask my students to tell me what that means to them, as often times I (I think all teachers) tend to relly on saying things one way, and you guys may just have 'better' ways of explaining this. OK, so here goes a bit of an explanation. Isometric movements according to wikipedia:  Definition  Isometric exercise is a form of exercise involving the static contraction of a muscle without any visible movement in the angle of the joint. This is reflected in the name; the term "isometric" combines the prefix "iso" (same) with "metric" (distance), meaning that in these exercises the length of the muscle does not change[edit] Isometric resistance Resistance in isometric exercises typically involve contractions of the muscle using: ▪	the body's own muscle (e.g., pressing the palms together in front of the body) ▪ structural items (e.g., pushing against a door frame). ▪	free weights, weights machines or elastic equipment (e.g. holding a weight in a fixed position) ▪	pressure plate type equipment that has a digital readout of maximal force. Depending on the goal of the exercise, the exertion can be maximal, or sub-maximal. Basically, you are engaging your muscles even though the poses are 'static'. There is an action that is involved always everytime that you are in a pose. In Anusara the principle that best describes isometric movement (or scissoring the legs together) is called Muscular Energy. Here's the definition according to the Anusara Teacher Training Manual....( you're just gonna have to listen as I'm NOT typing this whole thing out ;).  One way that I teach these actions, I learned from one of my teachers Noah Maze, is by getting 2 folded blankets, placing them on a non carpeted floor, placing one foot on one blanket and the other foot on the other blanket. Once you're all set there, widen your feet apart and do a standing pose, like Warrior 2 for example. If you don't pull energy to the midline, I guarantee you that you will be doing the splits! It's a pretty cool exercise that teaches those actions, just for fun!  Well, that was a bit of a long explanation! I hope that makes sense Kate! And reaching out to yoga teachers out there, how about you sending me some ways in which you teach pulling to the midline, or muscular energy? It would be awesome to share you wisdom with the Kula :) email me or send call me 310 651 6238 (put that number in your cellphone!!!)  Ok, just 3 more things to address, as it looks like we're running a bit long! Ahhhhhh  . I got an FB message from Isabella, she just wanted to say thank you to me, but she also mentioned that she was looking for a fan page for me. Well, I do have a Facebook Group! Search for Elsie's Yoga Kula, I haven't started a FB fan page....yet....I'm still figuring out what is best for me and for you guys. I know how crowded FB has gotten with soooooo many fan pages and groups and all sorts of other stuff, and I honestly don't want to add to all that. When I feel that creating a Page will add value, and I can honestly keep it up and have it be a place were you guys and myself can participate more fully I'll do it. I gotta really see how Fan Pages work. When and if I do that, I'll send y'all a little not in the FB Group, OR post something on my blog!  This episode's art work is a class that a long time listener Tracee Sioux hosted at her Bookclub weekend getaway. How cool is that???? LOVED it! It was podcast #10 from El Salvador and it was all about authenticity. She said "We were touched and those of us out of practice or beginning were also a little sore. LOL" Thank you sooooo much Tracee for sharing that picture, and it really warms my heart to know that these classes are being used it such fantastic ways!!!! If you wanna know a bit more about Tracee, check out my blog post on my other blog YoGeek.Me. She's a pretty phenomenal woman with an incredible Web site calle The Girl Revolution, all about empowering girls, and I'm ALL FOR THAT!!!  And lastly, I'm going to close by letting you know about an Affiliate that I'm working with. I will only work with people and organizations that I whole hearted believe in and whose products I absolutely USE AND LOVE. Floracopeia is one of the most incredible companies that I have had the gift of coming into contact with. I'll tell you more about the organization in a future episode, but right now I'd like to share with you 2 products that I use almost daily:  Hormonal Essential Oil Blend  Directly from the Floracopeia Website: For women who are interested in optimizing their endocrine health for long lasting vitality and radiance, the Hormonal Blend is a valuable addition to your every day pleasures.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[The voice mail that is played at the beginning of this episode is why I decided to do these episodes that I call Elsie's Yoga Kula. There is so much power to sharing your journey. This practice of yoga can take you to so many absolutely fabulous places, not only on the mat but off the mat. I know that my yoga practice opened up so much for me, in fact it was the catalyst for gigantic growth in my life, and I'm in no way talking about the poses. They are the icing on the cake :) They provided me with the first courageous steps towards something more! Thank you sooo much for sharing Jeanne (sp?) ! I am thrilled when I hear stories like yours, those that are all about stepping deeper into your self, to see the vast goodness that dwells within! NICE! Oh, and I would be honored to have you come to my class! Even though I only teach 1 public class a week...but more to come, promise!  As you can hear, this message was actually sent 'quite' a while ago. I'm trying to go back and honor you guys that sent me messages long ago :) And if you haven't sent a message to share with me and the kula DO SO. I'd love to help all of us stay inspired and feel that we are truly part of a world wide community! So call me to share at 310 651 6238  Hello everybody and welcome to Elsie's Yoga Kula episode #3! Happy Autumn :) Oh man is Pittsburgh gorgeous when the leaves start to change! My most favorite changes, that of the ivy, it's like fire snakes climbing up trees and buildings. So beautiful! So much has happened this year it's unbelievable. truly. Last year right around this time I became a mother. Yep, my lovely Hunter is 1 year old as of October 2. Happy Happy birthday my baby girl! You have shifted me to become someone I honestly never knew was inside. I've gotten...sturdier, that's for sure :) I started to finally teach public classes, I was laid off of my job last November, man! and now I'm in the process of developing my own consulting business. As soon as I get all my stuff in gear I'll let you all know all about it. You can venture to YoGeek.Me, to see a gradual development of posts delving into the world of yoga and technology :)  It has been an incredible fortifying year, full of everything you can imagine, calm, love, fear, angst, courage, meltdowns, you name it. I have LIVED! You guys have made this year for me a sort of life line. Your emails and messages and support have provided me with hope and strength. If you are listening to the podcast I now read an email from Maria Rose from Vermont :D and my response to her email!  Listen to the Podcast!  EYK News:  Remember how I mentioned the cool personalized bottle from the company SIGG on EKY Episode 1? Well, I take that back. I used to love those bottles but the practices of their CEO has left me less than pleased. Here's the quick scoop: SIGG CEO Steve Wasik recently announced that SIGG water bottles did in fact contain the toxic chemical bisphenol A (BPA) in its liners until August 2008. That means that any bottle that you purchased before 10/08 contains BPA. They are allowing customers that purchased a bottle prior to this date (you would know by the bronze liner instead of the pale yellow liner that are the new ones) to exchange their bottles.  But the Environmental Working Group is not satisfied with this. Here is letter sent by the President of EWG to SIGG: On behalf of the Environmental Working Group (EWG), I write to ask that you issue an unambiguous apology for misleading consumers and retailers about whether SIGG bottles contain the toxic chemical bisphenol-A (BPA). I further urge you to modify SIGG Switzerland CEO Steve Wasik's recent announcement of a SIGG voluntary bottle exchange program. Consumers should be able to take SIGG bottles that contain BPA to an authorized SIGG retailer and receive a refund for the full retail value of the product. The cost of the refund should be covered by SIGG. The announced exchange policy, which forces customers to accept a replacement SIGG bottle, puts them in the untenable position of having to trust Mr. Wasik and his team about the composition and safety of the replacement product. It is our view that SIGG's reputation will be difficult to restore while Mr. Wasik remains at the helm of the company. Sincerely,    Kenneth A. Cook President Environmental Working Group  In case you want to exchange your product you can go to http://mysigg.com/bulletin/ to read all about it. I'll post a link in the shownotes.  Just last week I was interviewed by David Spark about my new iPhone App! It was such a cool experience. He's a really great guy. What was crazy about the whole thing is that I scheduled it specifically so that Hunter was in an optimal mood and she could keep herself occupied. The interview was supposed to take 10 min. Of course none of it went as planned. As we signed on in Skype, my camera decided not to work...ggrrrrrr. I had to trouble shoot for about 10 minutes! I did have an opportunity to see my lovely friend Inge's face as I had my mini freak out. I asked her to help me but at that time she had no solutions for me. I figured it out FINALLY! then of course, the moment that David started recording the podcast Hunter fell down and conked her head. yep, of course she did. anyway, the whole thing ended up going really well. I'll put a link in the shownotes for ya'll.  Here's the article on David's Blog: Elsie's Yoga Class: Making Money From Podcasting  Here's the larger piece on Mashable! 9 Successful Techniques For Making Money From Podcasting  And speaking of my iPhone/iPod Touch app...Have you gotten a chance to buy it yet? It's $3.99 and what you get is the ability to stream all of my content, all 70+ classes without downloading anything at all, at the push of a button! Plus, I'll be adding a PDF of the sequences of my classes a little bit a time, so you can have it with you as you practice! Occasionally I may add little videos here and there and some other bits and pieces of content. Now, I have to clarify that if you happen to have an iPod Touch, the only time that you can stream the content is when you are connected via Wifi. Thank you Lisa for helping me be clear about this :) Full disclosure, there have been some issues with the 1st version of the app (the classes not streaming and the app itself not opening). The new version HAS been released which fixes the majority of the bugs. If you have downloaded the app and still experience problems, please feel free to contact me via email so we can get the issues resolved!  If you have wanted to support this podcast, this is a wonderful way to do it. I do get a teeny bit of money from the sale of each app. I'd like to take the opportunity to thank all of you that have already downloaded the app, from the bottom of my heart, and I'd also like to thank all those of you that have donated to Elsie's Yoga Kula. I'll share that last months donations allowed me to make our car payment. It was a blessing. I've been doing this podcast for 3 years and I have never put up a donate button, until now. At this moment, I feel that I can and I have had requests from you guys, so it's helped me make the decision. If you'd like to donate to the podcast please feel free to do so, if you'd like to donate to the podcast in another way other than in a monetary way, I have put up a page telling you of all sorts of ways in which you can 'donate' that don't include money. Check it out. Any little thing totally helps and like the page says, Support the Podcast, support the family!  We have another voice mail from a listener! So listen up if you wanna hear :)  Here's Vanessa Best's Web site: The Spinal Space  Thank you Juli from Atlanta! I know it was a while ago, but she very kindly sent me an email and told me that I had inadvertedly tagged episode 69 with an 'explicit' tag, YIKES! Totally did not want to do that. I went in there and fixed it as soon as I could, although I know that a few of you got that episode with an explicit tag, and of course there was nothing explicit about it...  It's all about listener emails!  Carli from Kansas  My 16 year old son talked me into trying Yoga with him. He plays football and his coach got them started on Yoga. I am a runner and lift weights, I took a yoga class once but it never stuck. So I started looking for yoga podcasts and came across yours. I loved it. It was very hard for me to follow at first because I am not familiar with the poses. So I went online and found your website! I flipped out when I realized I can look at the poses to the episodes online and follow that way. I'm so stuck on yoga now! I love your classes and how you describe things. You Rock!  Thank you so much Carli :) You know, I totally keep forgetting to tell you guys to come check out this site! The pictures are there, there are a couple of times where there are corresponding videos and extra links at times, especially when I mention an article or something like that in my theme :) oh, and the EYK episodes will be transcribed as a blog post (hence this post ;) ), so if you wanna read, what I said, then all you have to do is go to the corresponding blog post!  Marie from Ol Miss  Hi Elsie!I hope you are well. I've just started listening to your podcasts, and they are so great! I have a random question for you. What kind or brand of mat would you recommend to someone who is just beginning yoga? I have a mat that I have had for a long time, (I've started and stopped yoga a few times), but it is starting to kind of thin and I've found a few holes. Also, do you have any other advice for a newbie like me? Thank you so much and have a great weekend! Marie  Here's my answer to Marie  Hello Marie :) Great questions! Regarding the yoga mat...I'm a very big fan of the Jade Yoga Mats. At times they can bunch up a little bit off the floor, as they are not as 'sticky' as the yoga mats that you would purchase almost anywhere. My fave from Jade is The Encore because I like my mats to have a bit more substance when I practice. The Encore is the one that I have (at least I have the prototype as they sent it to me before it was released. Also love Beinjoy yoga mats. They are soooooooooooooooooo pretty :) That gets some bonus points from me. They feel very good. Also I own 2 Manduka &trade; mats, the purple PROlite and the Black Mat PRO. They have some eco friendly versions that are also available, which I've been meaning to try. My purple mat has lasted me for about 5 yrs! and it looks almost the same as when I bought it. The only thing thats wrong with it now is that my kitties got to it and scratched the tar out of it ;) They also have a mat that supports an organization called 'off the mat into the world' which I think is pretty darn fabulous organization. Another company that I love is Prana. They have a FANTASTIC mat that I want to purchase the is wider than most mats out there. When I practice in order to have my shoulders properly aligned I honestly have to widen them so much that my pinky fingers end up being off the mat. I don't mind, but their new Revolution mat takes care of that! Plus it's eco friendly :) A lot of the mats that I have mentioned are pretty pricey, $60+ and UP! It is a lot of $ I know. You can get some mats from Prana, or Jade or even Lululemon that are eco friendly for between $35 and 40. I know that I have not needed another mat after buying my purple mat so long ago. I just like to try out other mats, and share about them :) Let me know if I can help you with anything else! As a beginner practitioner, I would merely say to take your time, to listen to yourself, and to choose to always be honest and open with yourself every time you get on the mat. Choose to step in deeper and enjoy your own body, with all it's 'limitations'. They make you the unique beauty that you are. If you get through a class and you haven't smiled....I would make that my priority :) Smiling and laughing truly allows for a deeper moving into your heart to see what really matters!  Marie's answer:  I ended up getting a Manduka Black Mat Pro and I love it!!! I've been practicing for three weeks and it has been really awesome to see how my body is responding. I also wanted to let yo u know that I started a blog about my yoga journey, girlmeetsmat.blogspot.com. I am wide open to any comments or suggestion :) Thank you so much for everything!!  NICE! I do love the Manduka Black mat. That thing is hardy, the thing for me is that I now tend to leave that one at home as trekking around with that puppy on a bike, or a bus, or any amount of walking that isn't just a block or so, is soooooooo hard on my back. That mat is HEAVY :) Just to let you all know, there is a fantastic article by one of my Twitter/Facebook buddies, the mighty Nancy Alder and it's all about this same exact subject. It really gets in to more detail about the mats and especially pricing and it's a great read!  Nancy Alder's article: Ecologically Minded Yoga Mats Meaghan Message :D  Hello! How are you on this beautiful day?! I am a fellow yoga teacher, brand new, and IN LOVE with your site. It is so inspirational and moving and every detail means so much. Thank you for keeping us involved with your journey.  I wanted to take a moment to personally invite you to take a peek at my website. I am training to run a half marathon to raise money for research towards Crohns, a disease incredibly close to my heart, which my boyfriend has struggled with for more than 20 years.  My website is : meaghansrun.net  The first ten people to raise 500 dollars in the next week will be matched 500 from a local company! So, if you are thinking you may be able to donate (any amount, big or small) -- now would be a perfect time! And, it is tax deductible  . Lots of love and thanks,  Meaghanxo  I saw the other day mighty Meaghan or Megan ) sorry if I mispronounced your name that you reached your goal! Congratulations, and if any of you would like to donate to the cause follow the link above! and thank you so much for sending this along!  Kate in Italy!  Hi Elsie, I am a Canadian living in Italy and have just started using your podcasts for my daily practice. Thank you! You say the phrase "scissor your legs asymmetrically together" quite a few times and I am very confused what this means...is it possible to get some clue about that? Thank you again for beaming your classes out for the world to access. In Italy classes are in Italian which makes English speaking me a little lost. Your classes are a big help. All the best.  You know what I wanted to do to answer this question? I wanted to ask my students to tell me what that means to them, as often times I (I think all teachers) tend to relly on saying things one way, and you guys may just have 'better' ways of explaining this. OK, so here goes a bit of an explanation. Isometric movements according to wikipedia:  Definition  Isometric exercise is a form of exercise involving the static contraction of a muscle without any visible movement in the angle of the joint. This is reflected in the name; the term "isometric" combines the prefix "iso" (same) with "metric" (distance), meaning that in these exercises the length of the muscle does not change[edit] Isometric resistance Resistance in isometric exercises typically involve contractions of the muscle using: ▪	the body's own muscle (e.g., pressing the palms together in front of the body) ▪ structural items (e.g., pushing against a door frame). ▪	free weights, weights machines or elastic equipment (e.g. holding a weight in a fixed position) ▪	pressure plate type equipment that has a digital readout of maximal force. Depending on the goal of the exercise, the exertion can be maximal, or sub-maximal. Basically, you are engaging your muscles even though the poses are 'static'. There is an action that is involved always everytime that you are in a pose. In Anusara the principle that best describes isometric movement (or scissoring the legs together) is called Muscular Energy. Here's the definition according to the Anusara Teacher Training Manual....( you're just gonna have to listen as I'm NOT typing this whole thing out ;).  One way that I teach these actions, I learned from one of my teachers Noah Maze, is by getting 2 folded blankets, placing them on a non carpeted floor, placing one foot on one blanket and the other foot on the other blanket. Once you're all set there, widen your feet apart and do a standing pose, like Warrior 2 for example. If you don't pull energy to the midline, I guarantee you that you will be doing the splits! It's a pretty cool exercise that teaches those actions, just for fun!  Well, that was a bit of a long explanation! I hope that makes sense Kate! And reaching out to yoga teachers out there, how about you sending me some ways in which you teach pulling to the midline, or muscular energy? It would be awesome to share you wisdom with the Kula :) email me or send call me 310 651 6238 (put that number in your cellphone!!!)  Ok, just 3 more things to address, as it looks like we're running a bit long! Ahhhhhh  . I got an FB message from Isabella, she just wanted to say thank you to me, but she also mentioned that she was looking for a fan page for me. Well, I do have a Facebook Group! Search for Elsie's Yoga Kula, I haven't started a FB fan page....yet....I'm still figuring out what is best for me and for you guys. I know how crowded FB has gotten with soooooo many fan pages and groups and all sorts of other stuff, and I honestly don't want to add to all that. When I feel that creating a Page will add value, and I can honestly keep it up and have it be a place were you guys and myself can participate more fully I'll do it. I gotta really see how Fan Pages work. When and if I do that, I'll send y'all a little not in the FB Group, OR post something on my blog!  This episode's art work is a class that a long time listener Tracee Sioux hosted at her Bookclub weekend getaway. How cool is that???? LOVED it! It was podcast #10 from El Salvador and it was all about authenticity. She said "We were touched and those of us out of practice or beginning were also a little sore. LOL" Thank you sooooo much Tracee for sharing that picture, and it really warms my heart to know that these classes are being used it such fantastic ways!!!! If you wanna know a bit more about Tracee, check out my blog post on my other blog YoGeek.Me. She's a pretty phenomenal woman with an incredible Web site calle The Girl Revolution, all about empowering girls, and I'm ALL FOR THAT!!!  And lastly, I'm going to close by letting you know about an Affiliate that I'm working with. I will only work with people and organizations that I whole hearted believe in and whose products I absolutely USE AND LOVE. Floracopeia is one of the most incredible companies that I have had the gift of coming into contact with. I'll tell you more about the organization in a future episode, but right now I'd like to share with you 2 products that I use almost daily:  Hormonal Essential Oil Blend  Directly from the Floracopeia Website: For women who are interested in optimizing their endocrine health for long lasting vitality and radiance, the Hormonal Blend is a valuable addition to your every day pleasures. Two drops in the palms with a deep inhalation will deliver the healing benefit of this blend directly. In addition, the subtle floral perfume of this blend is a beautiful fragrance for any occasion. Its benefits include relaxant, aphrodisiac, anti-anxiety and mood enhancing effects. BUY THE HORMONAL ESSENTIAL OIL BLEND!  Relax Essential Oil Blend  Directly from the Floracopeia Website: Use the Relax Blend in times of stress or potentially stressful situations and environments. It is a lovely diffuser blend when you want to create a relaxing and pleasant environment in your home or elsewhere. It is a wonderful blend to diffuse around children, to apply on the car seat on long rides or the pillow before bedtime. Working people will gain great benefit from the Relax Blend and should consider it for use during the morning commute or before important meetings; there are rarely times when it is not useful. It has beautiful anti-axiety and mood enhancing effects that are subtle and intoxicating. BUY THE RELAX ESSENTIAL OIL BLEND!  Do consider purchasing either or both of these products.

            <link><![CDATA[http://scy.libsyn.com/episode_74_sankalpa_90_min_level_1_yoga_class]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Ready to delve into the depth of your Heart? Yikes!  One of my all times favorite themes to teach is Sankalpa, or Intention. This isn't a general intention, or a teeny tiny intention but your heart's truest wish, your deepest heart's desire embedded in the richness of your Self. I know that when I was first offered the opportunity to meditate, truly ponder my sankalpa, it began to shift me very deeply. In fact it was the mere asking of 'what is my intention' that facilitated living a more fulfilled and truthful life. It informs my life every day, and now it becomes even more important as it helps guide me to be a better mother. I also must be honest. The power of one's own Sankalpa is very powerful, and at times requires a great shift from us if we are going to align with it fully. I felt my Sankalpa, I knew it in my cells and for many years I chose to 'ignore' it's fullness, for lack of better words. I was not ready to truly embrace what living in my truth would require of me. It took me years, plus the help of those around me who knew me and loved me enough to require me to be absolutely honest with myself :D  I recorded this week's yoga class at Matrika Yoga, where I've had the opportunity to teach series classes, all with a connecting theme. This specific series was called "Yoga With Grace", just a very welcoming way in which to offer yoga classes that were beyond just the yoga poses, beyond the asana. I had the opportunity to teach more from the Heart, from a deeper place of basic Anusara philosophy, tapping deeper into the Source.  Although this class is a very basic Level 1 yoga class, with a lot of basic alignment and instruction, the theme is always one that we can always step deeper into. If you are feeling a bit down, disconnected, lost, possibly need a tune up, do this yoga class :) Oh, and how about a piece of paper? and pen? Just to write down some thoughts, especially during the opening meditation. Let me know how it goes....  PS  If you would like to support this podcast, how about buying the iPhone App? $3.99, not bad :D Also, like I mention in the show, Click here to find out a few other options to support the podcast</p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 73: 75 Min Level 2 Yoga Class- Skillfully Attune to Know Deeper </title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A Level 2 Yoga class!!!!!   How Do We Truly Know Anything?  Man am I always a mess! Believe me, I do try to be neat...and tidy...and organized...but somehow I always end up with fantastic chaos all around me ;) The worst part about this is that I was like this BEFORE I welcomed my beloved baby, so now with her in the picture my chaos(mess) has escalated to new heights. The good thing is that as the mess escalates my need to find clarity also grows and thus came the theme for this week's yoga class :)  My teacher John guided me to recognize how one truly begins to know something. How do we acquire knowledge? Deep knowledge? How do we align with anything? You soften, feel and attune. We attune to the Highest. We attune by getting close to that which we wish to know. This learning is not a head thing, but a heart thing as we truly begin to 'vibe' with and resonate with each other at a much deeper level :D Listen and practice to the class and see if you can begin to attune to something bigger!  Finally something other than a Level 1 basic yoga class! This week's class is a Level 2 Yoga Class, not quite an 'advanced' yoga class, but a bit faster in pace and a warmer practice. You will find within this class preparations for more advanced postures such as Urdhva Prasarita Ekapadasana into Handstand (Standing Splits into Handstand) and Archback (maybe even a drop back *yikes*). If you are a seasoned asana practitioner and are acquainted with these poses, please feel free to rock it in the comfort of your own sacred practice space ;)  Love the Feedback!  email me- eyogaclass (at) gmail (dot) com leave me a message- 310 651 6238 (I'd love to play you guys on the episodes! Plus you can promote your stuff that way!) or comment on this blog! Other ways to connect with me:  Connect with the Yoga Podcast Community Elsie's Yoga Kula on Facebook Join us!

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[A Level 2 Yoga class!!!!!   How Do We Truly Know Anything?  Man am I always a mess! Believe me, I do try to be neat...and tidy...and organized...but somehow I always end up with fantastic chaos all around me ;) The worst part about this is that I was like this BEFORE I welcomed my beloved baby, so now with her in the picture my chaos(mess) has escalated to new heights. The good thing is that as the mess escalates my need to find clarity also grows and thus came the theme for this week's yoga class :)  My teacher John guided me to recognize how one truly begins to know something. How do we acquire knowledge? Deep knowledge? How do we align with anything? You soften, feel and attune. We attune to the Highest. We attune by getting close to that which we wish to know. This learning is not a head thing, but a heart thing as we truly begin to 'vibe' with and resonate with each other at a much deeper level :D Listen and practice to the class and see if you can begin to attune to something bigger!  Finally something other than a Level 1 basic yoga class! This week's class is a Level 2 Yoga Class, not quite an 'advanced' yoga class, but a bit faster in pace and a warmer practice. You will find within this class preparations for more advanced postures such as Urdhva Prasarita Ekapadasana into Handstand (Standing Splits into Handstand) and Archback (maybe even a drop back *yikes*). If you are a seasoned asana practitioner and are acquainted with these poses, please feel free to rock it in the comfort of your own sacred practice space ;)  Love the Feedback!  email me- eyogaclass (at) gmail (dot) com leave me a message- 310 651 6238 (I'd love to play you guys on the episodes! Plus you can promote your stuff that way!) or comment on this blog! Other ways to connect with me:  Connect with the Yoga Podcast Community Elsie's Yoga Kula on Facebook Join us!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Yoga of Everyday Life and Podcasting!  I honestly have tried to post and episode for almost a month. Every day I think about it. Every day I decide THIS is the day to get it all done. Every day the day ends, I'm exhausted and focusing on editing, writing, encoding and uploading is the last thing that my brain is capable of doing :(  3 years ago I began to publish this podcast. 3 years ago Elsie's Yoga Class: Live and Unplugged Podcasts came to life! So much has changed, and so much has stayed the same :)  A few things that have stayed the same:  My love for podcasting My love for yoga My love for service My love for you guys! My love for legwarmers  Although I am no longer the care free legwarmer wearing bicycling full time yoga teacher from Los Angeles and have morphed into the occasional legwarmer wearing full time Mommy/Wife part-part time yoga teacher from Pittsburgh the deepest part of my heart still wants to continue this podcast, PLUS add better content to all those of you who would like it. I may not be consistent. I may say things that I want to happen only to have my life block me in some way, but I never forget what I've said. I'm still with you and plan to be with you for as long as you will have me! :D  This is Episode 2 of Elsie's Yoga Kula.  I share a bit of an update and invite you to participate in a small mediation that helps us all that are dealing with financial challenge/stress. I know that finances are tight for a lot of people. I also know how economic matters may prove to be huge causes of stress, anxiety, fear, and even health problems. The short meditation in this podcast episode is just a simple way to reconnect with the abundance that we DO have, something we often forget. I tell you this from personal experience. I share this meditation with you because I know that I do this little meditation almost daily because it helps me to stay grounded, and I definitely need to keep my connection to the bigger Source. I share with you because it's a great way to connect with one another so that we may through our thoughts create support for each other in these financially challenging times.  I love you all! :D  YOU CAN LISTEN TO THE MEDITATION EPISODE BY CLICKING THE BUTTON BELOW!  (it's really a short one! Less than 20 min!)

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week's Yoga Class Online is a beginner yoga class  Declare Your Freedom  I had the opportunity to teach a yoga class at this year's Annual Mensa Gathering in Pittsburgh! It was quite an exciting experience. It's always such a treat to teach outside of the yoga studio, and it's also very exciting not knowing who is going to be showing up :) I was thrilled to see a pretty good outcome of between 20-25 people. The majority of them did not have yoga mats and quite a few of them weren't wearing what we would call 'yoga clothing'.  You see, none of this matters. The practice can be done anywhere, no props nor specific attire needed!  How Do Your Choices Reflect Optimal Freedom?  This yoga class is what I would call a beginners class. Although one does not need to be a beginner to practice it. We as practitioners can bring complexity to any class as we choose to step deeper into it's nuances and continue to make more meaning with every breath and every movement. Something simple can be ever so fulfilling and can become a gift to all of us who choose to pull the meaning of our hearts into it :D Let me know your thoughts! Enjoy the practice!

			<title>Ep. 1: Elsie's Yoga Kula (The Beginning of Deepening Community) </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://scy.libsyn.com/episode_1_elsie_s_yoga_kula_the_beginning_of_deepening_community_]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is NOT a yoga class. This is episode 1 of a new facet of the podcast. More yoga classes comig up next week!  Hello and welcome to the First episode of Elsie's Yoga Kula, where we share, cultivate relationship and deepen our yoga by entering the community of the heart, which is both your own heart, AND it's the heart manifesting as the company we keep.  I've been talking a lot about getting new facet of the podcast up. And it's finally here! Some of you guys may have been listening for a while so you may be a bit more aware of my story, but some of you may just have started to listen so I'll just do a quick recap. I lived in Los Angeles and taught in yoga in Los Angeles until October 2007. While I was there I was blessed to have lots of fabulous classes and an incredible community of both students and teachers that I could delve into and cultivate. The LA yoga community is thriving and abundant. Now I live in Pittsburgh. I transported to the Burgh for LOVE. I'm very happy being here. I have the best family ever ever ever! with my soon to be husband and my 9 month old little daughter Hunter. The only thing that I'm lacking (other than Jamba Juice...but I digress) is the yoga community. Having started teaching again after my baby was born and being able to once again post my classes has given me a connection to you all, and I cannot tell you how much it means to me. The power of this medium and our ability to share together this incredible practice is one of the greatest blessings in my life, so I decided to share a little bit more! I want you guys, all of you that are part of this podcast and practice together, to get to know each other a little bit, plus it also gives me the opportunity to share a little bit more about other yoga related things :) You guys up for it? So to begin, here we go with our first voice mail, It's Nikki from DeMoines!  Please listen to the Podcast to hear the Voice Mail :)  You are so welcome! You know, I have to do another one of those deep savasana (Episode 61: Chill the Body Out, A 13 Minute Full Body Relaxation) and yoga nidra episodes (Episode 62: Yoga Nidra Yourself Out, a 65 Minute Deep Meditative Relaxation). Personally .... I LOVE those!!! I used to practice yoga nidra a lot more than I have an opportunity to now. One of these days I'm sure I'll be able to again...oh the Mommy life :) Thanks for the call!  I'm a very big RSS lover. RSS is sorta like using a DVR to record the shows that you wanna watch. RSS stands for Real Simple Syndication, which means that you can syndicate or publish material 'simply'. Most websites now days, have a feed associated with them. If you subscribe to the feed, then whenever new content is published to that feed you receive it automatically. This brings me back to the DVR metaphor, so you can read, listen or watch that content whenever you want. The way that you are subscribing to this podcast is via it's RSS feed. When you are in iTunes (for the majority of you subscribe via iTunes) and you subscribe to any podcast, you are subscribing via RSS feed. Sorry for the long winded explanation, just doing it for those of you that may wanna clarify a bit :) In order to receive the content you need to have some sort of RSS reader, such as iTunes. iTunes deals primarily with audio and video feeds. My personal favorite RSS reader that deals with audio, video, but mainly text feeds is Google Reader. I subscribe to A LOT of feeds and love reading them on my cell phone. Google Reader has a really easy and simple mobile site that I check countless times a day. The reason for this huge discussion is that I'm going to share with you guys, blogs, posts, videos, etc. that I find inspiring from Google Reader! So, here we go! I'm not sure how I found this blog, but I'm loving every post. It's called Rose Garden Yoga by a yoga teacher named Elizabeth Goodman AND she's a certified Anusara Yoga teacher! I'm thrilled every time I see a new post. I'm inspired by her eloquence and her love of the garden. It is soooooo worth your time. Great insight into the yoga of every day :) Another blog that I'm diggin' is the Everything Yoga Blog at itsallaboutyoga.com. I enjoy this persons posts very much. I always end up with some new information, whether it be about a specific point of view, some sort of new product or website, whatever. I believe that I enjoy reading the posts so much because the author's voice is so natural and absolutely down to earth. Check those 2 blogs out, AND use Google Reader! You can read so many more blogs in one place! Kinda like having your own special magazine :)  Here's a nifty little product that I LOVED! Found out about it via the Everything Yoga Blog I just mentioned. Ok, I'm sure y'all have come across SIGG water bottles, those really cool bottles from sweden? Well you can totally MAKE YOUR OWN PERSONALIZED ONES!!!!! O M G. I have 2 already, and I LOVE THEM! So if you go to http://www.cafepress.com/designer/sigg/ You can see how to do it! It really is the coolest thing ever, plus if you don't know about Cafe Press you'll get a chance to check out that site! It's a GREAT resource for creating your own stuff.  And now for our next voice mail: Mary from Houston  Dude, Mary, totally humbled. Thank you! You are way too sweet. I'm soooo glad that the podcasts are able to serve you, honestly. I'm very glad. I absolutely know how you feel. Totally get it, AND I'm working hard at this whole Mommy thing, doing my best at that and all the other stuff. I think at times the will to do it all comes from a desire to connect and to serve fully. Thanks again  And now for our first email of the episode from Nora in North Carolina This is all about Prenatal Yoga!!!  You can hear the email conversation and what I have to say if you listen to the episode  Empowering your Prenatal Yoga Practice: Advise from Yogi Mama to New Yogi Mama  Speaking of prenatal yoga, Sue Elkind is doing a prenatal yoga teacher training in Athens Greece!!!!!  Sept 7-11 Athens, Greece Prenatal Teacher Training www.NYSYstudios.com  Check it out at www.sueelkind.com  If you decide to do this...please email sue and tell her that you heard it from me! snyoga (at) mac (dot) com  Another email: Lina from Malasyia!!! how exciting is that????  Thank you so much Lina! Now I'm not going to answer this question here, I've (actually we, my dear friend Hillary Rubin and I) Have just answered this question and lots of other neat little teacher type discussion topics over at Mudra Moments. You can subscribe via RSS in iTunes or listen straight from the website at Mudramoments.com! I've already let Lina know that we addressed her question in Mudra Moments Episode 13, but I thought some of you guys may be interested in still hearing the question!  One of the reasons that I'm doing this also is so that I can share with you the listeners stuff that you care about and would like to share yourself. I got an email from someone that I got to know in LA, although they lived in Las Vegas:  Yoga Rants and Raves (http://www.yogarantsandraves.com) and they are on twitter! http://twitter.com/yogasanctuary) plus, this is their WEBSITE: http://www.lasvegasyoga.com  And our last voice email of the day, Anne NC  thank you sweetie, I think Hunter is FAMOUS!!!  I still have a lot more of your emails, comments and phone calls to share! I contacted some of you to see if I could use your email, please know that I will, it's just that I didn't want to make this a REALLY long show...just enough to make it fun. If you want to be on the show, or share something about yourself or something you are doing that you would like me to check out and share with the Kula, send me an email eyogaclass@gmail.com, comment at elsiesyogakula.com or CALL ME!!!!!!!!! it's soooooo easy to do it, and how fun is it to hear yourself on the show!!!!! woo hoooo 310 651 6238 :) or you can record your own MP3 and send it to me!  Please let me know if you enjoyed this. It's really another way that I can deepen our relationship and allow us all to get to know each other better! Hope to hear from you!  Oh yea...one last thing :) The 3rd year anniversary of this podcast is coming up at the end of July. I hope to put up a special episode, plus some fun giveaways, so if you wanna be part of that episode, send me a voice mail sharing with me a special time that you practiced with it, or something along those lines so I can put it on the show!  Much love and blessings</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Path of the Yogi Within Social Networks</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been on Twitter since the Spring of 2007, way before it became so CRAZY mainstream. When I first got on Twitter, there were only a handful of people that I had actually met face to face. In fact, the people on twitter that I interacted with were basically all from the podcasting/new media community and 90% of them where out of state or out of the country. There was not one person from my yoga community.</p>
<p>That has now all changed.</p>
<p>I would say in 2009 the yoga community on <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> has skyrocketed. I&rsquo;m in awe of the amazing amount of tweets about yoga, from yoga practitioners, teachers and studios. It&rsquo;s <em>yoga yoga yoga</em> all the time now! I love it because now I can literally feel my yoga kula around me here in Pittsburgh because many of my Anusara yoga friends in LA and from other parts of the country are now on Twitter, including John Friend (the founder of <a href="http://anusara.com/">Anusara Yoga</a>)! Needless to say, that&rsquo;s some serious growth!</p>
<p>In the past 2.5 yrs that I&rsquo;ve been on Twitter, I have not ONCE had a negative experience with anyone I followed or followed me. In fact I&rsquo;ve developed some pretty special friendships with some folks on Twitter that I would have never come in contact with otherwise. I&rsquo;m a bit saddened to say that I&rsquo;ve had my first &lsquo;negative&rsquo; experience on Twitter, and it was with a fellow yogi.</p>
<p>This episode&rsquo;s artwork is a snapshot of the initial dialogue.</p>
<p>I think all of us have every right to have our own preferences and opinions about yoga and about what yoga system or philosophy we align with. In fact that goes for your spiritual and religious life. One of my <a href="http://rossrayburn.com/">fellow Anusara teachers</a> referred to yoga philosophy as &lsquo;resonant energy&rsquo;.</p>

<h1>Which Yoga Philosophy Is Right? Which Yoga Philosophy is the Best?</h1>
<p>If a philosophy resonates with you, you will be more harmonious, more sensitive, more open both with yourself and with others around you. You will in fact be able to add more beauty, goodness, auspiciousness to the world through your thoughts, actions and unique presence. You will embed the philosophy so deeply inside of yourself that you will be able to serve those around you and yourself in ever deepening and refined ways. If whatever you choose opens you to recognize the blessing of your life, your wisdom, your auspiciousness, and in turn shows you that you are part of something much Greater, and of the Intrinsic Goodness of life, than you are in optimal alignment. It&rsquo;s not about which yoga is the best: Ashtanga, Iyengar, Power, Viniyoga, etc, nor what philosophy, Tantra, Advaita Vedanta, Classical, etc. but how do your actions, your thoughts, your words offer the most auspicious part of yourself AT EVERY MOMENT. How do you feel in your own authentic heart, and how well are you able to serve and uplift those around you?</p>
<h2>If you lock your fulfillment into how other people receive it you will never be fulfilled.</h2>
<p>We always have a choice. If we do disagree with a particular style of yoga&rsquo;s philosophy, or teacher, or practice, in what way are you going to communicate that with those around you so that you show through your actions, interactions and WORDS the highest integrity, always aligning to the Highest most Auspicious part of ourselves? Bottom line, do the actions you take make you a better person. Are you being authentic? It&rsquo;s not easy, especially when confronted by someone that happens to get under your skin <img class="wp-smiley" src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" /></p>
<p>Be very mindful of what you put out into the world, especially when it is written down and sent out into the world. It holds power, and it speaks loudly.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Aligning and Re-Aligning</h1>
<p>My baby girl has recently started having solid food. She got constipated. One would imagine that the only thing that it would affect, would be her demeanor, as she was pretty uncomfortable. In fact, this constipation made other things come out of alignment. She was unable to process her food properly because nothing was really moving :( She threw up. A lot. This made me very worried, as she had never done that before! This is this week's yoga class theme. Listen to find out what my very wise Randy had to say and how it all turned out :) Oh yeah, the class was recorded on April 22 at the <a href="http://www.paaclub.com/Club/Scripts/Home/home.asp">Pittsburgh Athletic Association</a></p>
<p>Thank you all for your comments!</p>
<p>Just to let you all know. I'm plan on supplementing the live yoga classes with little extra episodes sprinkled here and there. Since the yoga classes themselves are so long, I never want to make my intro more than 6 minutes, as you really need to be getting to practicing! Given this predicament, I've decided to address emails, questions and feedback that I get from you guys in another supplement of the podcast, this is going to be all about Elsie's Yoga Kula, meaning both YOU GUYS (your feedback, your questions, etc) and a little bit of extra sharing on my part, thoughts, focused classes, or practices, or even news about yoga products or any other online yoga tools that I have found helpful.</p>
<p>What do you think about that? Let me know!</p>
<p>To add just a bit more to my plate I have started a new website/business :) <a href="http://yogeek.me/">YoGeek.Me</a>. I have posted my very first blog post there: <a href="http://www.yogeek.me/blog/2009/5/8/top-10-reasons-why-yoga-professionals-are-empowered-by-techn.html">Top 10 Ways That Technology Empowers Yoga Professionals</a>. Check it out! I would love for you to leave your comments, especially if you are a yoga teacher or maybe someone that simply feels a bit awkward with technology!</p>
<p>HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY TO ALL THE LOVELY MAMAS OUT THERE!!!!!</p>

Given this predicament, I've decided to address emails, questions and feedback that I get from you guys in another supplement of the podcast, this is going to be all about Elsie's Yoga Kula, meaning both YOU GUYS (your feedback, your questions, etc) and a little bit of extra sharing on my part, thoughts, focused classes, or practices, or even news about yoga products or any other online yoga tools that I have found helpful.
What do you think about that? Let me know!
To add just a bit more to my plate I have started a new website/business :) YoGeek.Me. I have posted my very first blog post there: Top 10 Ways That Technology Empowers Yoga Professionals. Check it out! I would love for you to leave your comments, especially if you are a yoga teacher or maybe someone that simply feels a bit awkward with technology!
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY TO ALL THE LOVELY MAMAS OUT THERE!!!!!
You all know how to reach me:

leave me a message- 310 651 6238 (I'd love to play you guys on the episodes! Plus you can promote your stuff that way!)

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I'm going to stop saying that I'm going to post more episodes more often. I absolutely don't know! Agh! Mind you, I'm now all set up technically, finally! I've been recording more consistently, so now it's just a about editing and posting :) I have recorded more than one class, and I'm refining my workflow so that I can TRULY post more episodes. I'm sure you all know by now, I'm a new Mom. My little baby is 7 months as I write this post. She has now settled into herself more, which is allowing me time to step into my own self. The only time that I have to upload, edit, post, etc. is when Hunter is sleeping. Those naps are the sacred time when I can do fun stuff like this podcast, PLUS all of the gazillion things that I have to catch up on: dishes, showers, general clean up, answering emails, paying bills, you get the picture. All I can say is that there aren't enough hours in the day to do ALL that I want to do. My life continues to ebb and flow and my biggest focus is on always remembering to constantly re-align....OH, that's the next episode!</p>
<p>In this week's episode I talk about LISTENING. It was all brought about by my latest venture: teaching other yoga teachers/professionals to podcast. I actually did my first 'virtual' workshop! It was very cool. Anyway, within the workshop I explained why I'm partial to an AUDIO yoga class as opposed to VIDEO. Y'all can listen to my intro to find out why ;)</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://scy.libsyn.com/salute_the_sun_easily_a_short_beginner_video]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[ Yeay! Salute the Sun Easily!<br/><br/><p>Hmmmmm</p>

<p>Where has Elsie gone to you ask? Well, getting swallowed up by the Pittsburgh winter, if you must know :(</p>

<p>I have been unable to even have an opportunity to practice regularly
let alone find somewhere to teach. It's been a very challenging for me
now that I have a full time 9-5 job. I now spend all of that time
infront of a computer! And it's been so cold and dreary that I have not
wanted to step into anything other than my yummy home and sleep.</p>

<p>I have become a bear that happens to work on the internet for a living ;)</p>

<p>I will be back, fully at some point. I just cannot, in all honesty
and integrity tell you when this will happen, and when I do I guarantee
that it will be a much different Elsie! That's all I gotta say...</p>

<p>I created this video to a fellow internet buddy, Nick Schmidt. We
met randomly through online community and he asked me to teach him a
little bit of yoga, and I did...with this little video.</p>

<p>Simple, short and precise. A great way to get your yoga practice in
even if you only have 5 minutes :) I usually add music and all that
jazz, and I may in the future, but I just quickly edited this puppy and
decided to publish. To get something out for y'all!!!</p>

<p>Would love to hear your feedback! I would love to hear from you guys
all the way around. You guys have now become my only connection to the
Kula. How very ironic that Elsie's Yoga Kula is now fueled by you guys.
I love it! This is what it's all about!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A fun and inventive short vinayasa sequence, which is actually done in Episode 33<br/></p>
<p><br/>Happy Valentine's Day!!!</p>

<p>I keep telling you guys this, but I'm still not teaching publicly,
so I cannot post any new yoga classes for you guys :( But I do have one
that I just found!!! I just have to take more pics for it, as there are
some things that are new, and may be a bit confusing ;) but fun, fun,
fun!</p>

<p>I hope to get an actual class up next week! Yipee!!!</p>

<p>So, my way of kinda dealing with this issue is providing you all
with some of my prior content on the feed so that those of you who are
subscribed can get these videos delivered right to your computer!</p>

<p>I do hope that you enjoy these!</p>

<p>You can listen to it's birth ;) in <a mce_href="http://elsieyogakula.wordpress.com/2007/04/02/episode-33-the-venti-problem-level-2-3-80-min-yoga-class-at-bala-yoga/" href="http://elsieyogakula.wordpress.com/2007/04/02/episode-33-the-venti-problem-level-2-3-80-min-yoga-class-at-bala-yoga/">Episode 33</a>.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[A fun and inventive short vinayasa sequence, which is actually done in Episode 33
Happy Valentine's Day!!!

I keep telling you guys this, but I'm still not teaching publicly,
so I cannot post any new yoga classes for you guys :( But I do have one
that I just found!!! I just have to take more pics for it, as there are
some things that are new, and may be a bit confusing ;) but fun, fun,
fun!

I hope to get an actual class up next week! Yipee!!!

So, my way of kinda dealing with this issue is providing you all
with some of my prior content on the feed so that those of you who are
subscribed can get these videos delivered right to your computer!

I do hope that you enjoy these!

You can listen to it's birth ;) in Episode 33. Enjoy!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Wow! a 65 minute Yogic Sleep, of course relaxation. Yoga Nidra coming your way!</p>
<p><br />I had such a great time recording this Yoga Nidra! Experience deep yogic sleep. It's a great practice for unwinding and truly diving into the depth of unconsciousness. So fun :D</p>
<p>ALL MUSIC IN THE PODCAST BY <a href="http://vichenneganmusic.com/">VIC HENNEGAN</a></p>
<p>intro song: Movin' from the <a href="http://vichenneganmusic.com/active.html">Pure Creative Spirit CD</a></p>
<p>yoga nidra music: Gaya from the <a href="http://vichenneganmusic.com/ambient.html">Desert God CD</a></p>
<p>I'm not a yoga nidra expert by any means. I had a experience during a Yoga Therapist teacher training to study with Richard Miller and experienced such bliss!</p>
<p>I bought his yoga nidra tapes and practiced it at home that way.</p>
<p>In case you are interested here are some more sources of Yoga Nidra studies and basic information:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Nidra">Yoga Nidra on Wikipidea</a></p>
<p>Totally dug Anandmurti Gurumaa's beautiful voice in this CD. If I were to buy another Yoga Nidra CD I would get this one:  <a href="http://www.yogawonders.com/">http://www.yogawonders.com/</a><br /> this site has a great introduction to yoga nidra narrated by Anandmurti Gurumaa, so worth it.</p>
<p>Plus she's got a great website herself:  <a href="http://www.gurumaa.com/">Anandmurti Gurumaa</a><br /> With a fantastic Charity for girls...<a href="http://www.gurumaa.com/shakti-education-for-girls.php">Shakti</a> :)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I have ventured in unchartered waters and I'm thrilled!!!!</p>

<p>So
this is my 1st attempt at playing with video.&nbsp; Bad video quality (HD
Camara on it's way), iffy editing, but hey, I did it all myself!&nbsp; Yeay
for iMovie.&nbsp; I kid you not, it's a fantastic little program for newbies
like me ;)</p>

<p>Anyway, so the stuff that's in the podcast is some
feedback that I sent to a fellow podcaster that I admire very much,
Father Roderick of the<a mce_href="http://www.sqpn.com/?cat=2" href="http://www.sqpn.com/?cat=2"> Daily Breakfast</a>, for he just started his own first video podcast called <a mce_href="http://www.sqpn.com/scripts/healthycatholic.php" href="http://www.sqpn.com/scripts/healthycatholic.php">Healthy Catholic</a>,
and it inspired me to get my behind going on this stuff.&nbsp; I sent this
info to him 'cause he's been getting back into running, so this little
video is just a couple of ways that you can stretch out tired feet :)</p>

<p>&nbsp;Please let me know what you think!!!!!! <br/>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Authentic love is not a vague sentiment or a blind passion. It is an inner attitude that involves the whole human being. It is looking at others not to use them but to serve them. It is the ability to rejoice with those who are rejoicing and to suffer with those that are suffering. It is sharing what one possesses so that no one may continue to be deprived of what he needs. Love, in a word, is the gift of self.</p>
<p>-Pope John Paul II</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Authentic love is not a vague sentiment or a blind passion. It is an inner attitude that involves the whole human being. It is looking at others not to use them but to serve them. It is the ability to rejoice with those who are rejoicing and to suffer with those that are suffering. It is sharing what one possesses so that no one may continue to be deprived of what he needs. Love, in a word, is the gift of self.
-Pope John Paul II

<p>This is all about my teacher Douglas Brooks, although I don't really speak about him in the class. I only try as best as I can to explain what this incredible philosophy is about. As I say during the class, and as Douglas has said many, many times before, "this is a practice that is learned from ear to ear, not from mouth to ear," so my explanation of it, is what I've 'heard.' I do my best to honor him through my words. As always I only hope to become clearer and more precise in the teachings. If you want to hear him, in his own voice, explain the philosophy check out this link where you can buy his Philosphy CD's:</p>

Yeah, I go a little crazy about one of my most favorite Christmas stories (actually the tv show story, rudolph the red nosed reindeer and the island of the misfit toys). I was kinda surprised at how many people had no idea what I was talking about. You guys have to watch the show!!!! Rent it, buy it. You gotta have it for the holiday season! Plus, according to my wacky self, it has a pretty fun soundtrack ;)

Plank  into Down Dog

            <description><![CDATA[<p>My first attempt at an Enhanced Podcast! For those of you who don't
know what that is, it's an podcast that as you listen to it on itunes
(sorry those of you who have a different podcatcher! itunes is free
though, if you don't have it!) you can see pictures and even access the
links that I talk about on the podcast straight from itunes! Check it
out! What all this means is that as you listen to this specific
podcast, there will be chapter markers within the podcast, kinda like
the markers that you have on a CD when you move from song to song. If
you don't have time to listen to the whole thing or maybe want to skip
a specific charity you can just press the forward button and you will
move straight to the next chapter. Kinda nifty! I tried it last night
and it totally worked! Another cool thing is that if any of the
charities reach out to you and you just have to go find out about the
charity the moment that you are listening to me talk about it, there is
a link already there for you to link to! You can go to the website as
you listen! Oh, technology. I hope it works :) Enjoy</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I turned it up a notch. This specific class on the schedule at the studio says a level 1-2 class, but I went a little bit more ;) The pace of this class is a bit faster than I usually teach. I also didn't do too many alignment principles through the vinyasa sequences, it was much more about moving with the breath and just opening up the body. I was inspired by a class that I had taken earlier in the week taught by one of my yogi friends, William Duprey. Y'all have to check out his <a href="http://williamduprey.com/">website</a>, he's just great!</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://scy.libsyn.com/elsie_s_yoga_class_update_computer_woes_and_angels_do_exist]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Just a short little notice telling y'all that I don't have a
computer!&nbsp; She is in the hospital with a 50/50 chance to live.&nbsp; I do
hope to be able to get a class out by next weekend, with my sweet old
computer or maybe a fancy new one, who knows!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much gratitude to all of you who are listening out there!</p>
<p>Just to share:&nbsp; My friend Victor Cajiao, from the <a href="http://typicalpcuser.com/" mce_href="http://typicalpcuser.com">typical pc user</a>, <a href="http://typicalmacuser.com/" mce_href="http://typicalmacuser.com">typical mac user</a> and <a href="http://immigrationtales.com/" mce_href="http://immigrationtales.com">immigration tales</a>
podcast is truly and angel.&nbsp; He has been helping me diagnose the
problem with my computer.&nbsp; He talked me through all the steps that I
needed to take to make sure that all my info was backed up.&nbsp; He gave me
hints as to what software to buy and also what kind of external
hardrive.&nbsp; After giving him an update of what was going on with me he
offered to record me on skype telling you all what's up (which is what
you hear on this weeks update).&nbsp; He added the music and edited it for
me!&nbsp; Tell me that's not the sweetest thing ever!&nbsp; I have thanked him so
much already and I guess I just ask for some of you to check out some
of his podcasts.&nbsp; He does some incredible work.&nbsp; I'm an avid listener
to his <a href="http://typicalpcuser.com/" mce_href="http://typicalpcuser.com">Typical PC User Podcast</a>.&nbsp;
I've learned so much from him. &nbsp; I often write in to comment and to ask
questions.&nbsp; I never feel like a 'dummy'.&nbsp; He always takes the time to
explain things so that they do make sense to me, and to all out there
that may be a bit 'typical' in our computer world.&nbsp; He also has a truly
phenomenal podcast called <a href="http://immigrationtales.com/" mce_href="http://immigrationtales.com">Immigration Tales</a>,
which I refer to in my update.&nbsp; I find it so informative and truly
inspirational as I get to hear stories from people migrating.&nbsp; It's a
subject that deserves to be addressed.&nbsp; The way Victor has addressed
the subject makes it so very human and personal.&nbsp; It really is worth a
listen.&nbsp; Check out some of Victor's stuff, as a thank you to him.&nbsp; He
really is an angel! <br/></p>

<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">same goes for</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">crazy and sane</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">truth and lie</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">answer and why</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">because I know this:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">this universe operates with a divine</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">tug of war teeter-totter,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">bringing order and balance like the tide does to water,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">like I know that each wave rolls back to the sea</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">retreating from me into deep green eternity,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and I know that I am free!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">(...well, at least in my mind if I wanna be...)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">I know that some things sound good to me in theory</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">but in point of fact, suck ass in actual practice,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">like communism and pornography.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">I know that its impossible</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">to really know</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">where anyone</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">is coming from</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">so who are we to judge &lsquo;em?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">I know that some</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">things are so dope they transcend their category</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and its important to see the glory</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">in the ordinary.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">Like, I know there&rsquo;s Nag Champa,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and then there&rsquo;s all other incense.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">I can&rsquo;t see putting Earl Grey up against any other tea,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">Lash Out isn&rsquo;t even on the same plane as other mascaras comparatively,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and I know there&rsquo;s R&amp;B,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and then there&rsquo;s Otis Redding.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">I know that most things</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">are much greater than the sum of their parts,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and that that&rsquo;s the real definition of art.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">Like, brownies are good, and so is whipped cream,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">but you put &lsquo;em together</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and its this whole other chemical fucking thing,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">like John Lennon and Paul McCartney singing harmony,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">like masturbating as compared to an orgy...</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">I know that everything</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">within this</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">surface glimpse</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">of reality</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">is infinitely</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">simple and perfectly</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">complicated,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and I know that being jaded and over it</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">is way overrated</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and I know that the colors of this world only seem faded</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">in direct relation</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">to the darkness with which your mind&rsquo;s eye is shaded,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and you made it</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">that way.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">And you can choose to change your vision&rsquo;s prismic range. Today.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">And I know you got to help a friend who&rsquo;s down.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">And I know that no matter where you end up,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">you&rsquo;re still from your hometown.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">And I know you got to know how</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">to listen to the sound</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">of your own heartbeat in the dead quiet of night sometimes,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and I know that can be so frightening...</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">...but I also know that</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">the deepest darkness is always the most enlightening,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and I know that fresh cold cantaloupe</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">tastes like the perfect first kiss,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and I know that</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">Lao-Tzu, and Moses, and Mohammed, and Buddha, and Allah, and Jesus, and all those dudes</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">knew some deep ass shit,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">But I also know that we all hold</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">the same eternal truths in our hearts deepest pit.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">It&rsquo;s because</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">I know that we are made of the same stuff</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">as the sun</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and moon</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and farthest star</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and that all that we are</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">is manifest energy</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and that we already have everything we could ever need</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">if we could just begin to see clearly,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and I know that the world will continue to spin,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and I know that one day... you will let me in</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and we will begin</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">to love in</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">a fashion</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">I couldn&rsquo;t fathom</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">existed</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and we will laugh at the fact that we ever resisted</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">this blissful togetherness,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and the sex will be off the charts!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">&lsquo;Cause we&rsquo;ll both be super freaky,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">but we&rsquo;ll be fucking from the heart</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">&lsquo;cause our loving</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">will be a something</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">(we are artists, after all, so what would fate have as make besides art?)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">And I know that outside of this space time frame,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">we are one and the same</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">we&rsquo;re a part,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">not apart,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">so I know I can wait patiently for it to start,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and far out,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">I may seem to be,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and maybe you so me as wacky,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">but baby, the fact be,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">that I am a poet,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">and as all true poets do,</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">I&rsquo;m mainlining the spiraling spherical</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">truth of the universe</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">turning it out and into lyrical</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">wholeness.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">And</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">I know this.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica; font-size: xx-small;">This, I know.</span></span></p>

I Know This [ poets be slammin ] - 12.03.01 -  		 		by: 		Rachel Kann
  
I know this,
This, I know:
all that I have, all that is me,
resides inside my poetry,
and every time
I write a rhyme
it might be the line
that sets minds free.
And also I know that I don&rsquo;t know shit!
And the more I know, the more I realize it.
I know that for all the pain I&rsquo;ve cried
there is the exact same balance of joy on the other side
of that coin
joined
with
the thinnest slip
of membrane
same goes for
crazy and sane
truth and lie
answer and why
because I know this:
this universe operates with a divine
tug of war teeter-totter,
bringing order and balance like the tide does to water,
like I know that each wave rolls back to the sea
retreating from me into deep green eternity,
and I know that I am free!
(...well, at least in my mind if I wanna be...)
I know that some things sound good to me in theory
but in point of fact, suck ass in actual practice,
like communism and pornography.
I know that its impossible
to really know
where anyone
is coming from
so who are we to judge &lsquo;em?
I know that some
things are so dope they transcend their category
and its important to see the glory
in the ordinary.
Like, I know there&rsquo;s Nag Champa,
and then there&rsquo;s all other incense.
I can&rsquo;t see putting Earl Grey up against any other tea,
Lash Out isn&rsquo;t even on the same plane as other mascaras comparatively,
and I know there&rsquo;s R&amp;B,
and then there&rsquo;s Otis Redding.
I know that most things
are much greater than the sum of their parts,
and that that&rsquo;s the real definition of art.
Like, brownies are good, and so is whipped cream,
but you put &lsquo;em together
and its this whole other chemical fucking thing,
like John Lennon and Paul McCartney singing harmony,
like masturbating as compared to an orgy...
I know that everything
within this
surface glimpse
of reality
is infinitely
simple and perfectly
complicated,
and I know that being jaded and over it
is way overrated
and I know that the colors of this world only seem faded
in direct relation
to the darkness with which your mind&rsquo;s eye is shaded,
and you made it
that way.
And you can choose to change your vision&rsquo;s prismic range. Today.
And I know you got to help a friend who&rsquo;s down.
And I know that no matter where you end up,
you&rsquo;re still from your hometown.
And I know you got to know how
to listen to the sound
of your own heartbeat in the dead quiet of night sometimes,
and I know that can be so frightening...
...but I also know that
the deepest darkness is always the most enlightening,
and I know that fresh cold cantaloupe
tastes like the perfect first kiss,
and I know that
Lao-Tzu, and Moses, and Mohammed, and Buddha, and Allah, and Jesus, and all those dudes
knew some deep ass shit,
But I also know that we all hold
the same eternal truths in our hearts deepest pit.
It&rsquo;s because
I know that we are made of the same stuff
as the sun
and moon
and farthest star
and that all that we are
is manifest energy
and that we already have everything we could ever need
if we could just begin to see clearly,
and I know that the world will continue to spin,
and I know that one day... you will let me in
and we will begin
to love in
a fashion
I couldn&rsquo;t fathom
existed
and we will laugh at the fact that we ever resisted
this blissful togetherness,
and the sex will be off the charts!
&lsquo;Cause we&rsquo;ll both be super freaky,
but we&rsquo;ll be fucking from the heart
&lsquo;cause our loving
will be a something
where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts,
(we are artists, after all, so what would fate have as make besides art?)
And I know that outside of this space time frame,
we are one and the same
we&rsquo;re a part,
not apart,
so I know I can wait patiently for it to start,
and far out,
I may seem to be,
and maybe you so me as wacky,
but baby, the fact be,
that I am a poet,
and as all true poets do,
I&rsquo;m mainlining the spiraling spherical
truth of the universe
turning it out and into lyrical
wholeness.
And
I know this.
This, I know.

			<title>Ep. 8: A Yoga Class To Celebrate Life- Honoring Michael Morgan Taylor Part 2 </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://scy.libsyn.com/honoring_michael_morgan_taylor_part_2_episode_8_a_yoga_class_to_celebrate_life]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>To remember and honor, that's why I chose to participate.  I read another blog, <a href="http://happycatholic.blogspot.com/">the happy catholic</a> and was intrigued about this project to honor 911 victims. I went onto the website and clicked on the button to take me to the victims that still needed bloggers. What I received was a cry of the heart, names, scrolling down, as if looking up at me, longing for expression. I looked at all the names and travelled down the list, my eyes still, my heart taking in the people behind the names. As I looked upon the names I began to recognize the importance and the deep commitment that it took to give these names a face, a story, a remembrance. I debated whether or not I could be a part of this process. To be honest, I didn't think that I wanted to make the commitment, too much responsibility, too much stepping out of my comfort zone. One name struck at me. It was a woman's name, long, latino in origin, (if I remember the name, I will write it), it struck me because it was such a long name. I clicked on it. She was a mother, and her country of origin was El Salvador. I broke down and cried. I'm from El Salvador. I had no idea that there was someone from my country who had died in this tragedy. I felt at that moment that I needed to do this, I took it as a sign from this name to participate. Everyone needs a voice, and even when we are gone, our hearts still beat in the world. They give us power, desire and a dense need to express love and community. I wanted to get her. This woman who seemed to have reached out to me, she was like me, we already had something in common. I wanted a commonality. I found difference and what a gift that was.</p>
<p>I was blessed with the opportunity to honor Michael Morgan Taylor (Mike or otherwise known as Mouse). He was different than I. I worried, as I felt no commonality. He was a man, number one, a bond trader at Cantor Fitzgerald (please forgive me all bond traders, but I have no idea what that is). He's from Western Pennsylvania. I've never been there. For a moment I thought, what am I going to do? I have no point of reference from which to begin. Then I softened. I allowed myself to see Michael M Taylor. I looked at the picture on the site, letting go of preconceived notions of who, how or why. I let myself open to know him. As I gazed on his face and his huge smile (this was the picture I saw first)<img src="http://www.september11victims.com/september11Victims/images/Victims/2616.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="240" /> I found comfort. I committed myself to knowing. I followed all the links that I could for Mike. I read, quickly, as an overview. I knew that there was much more to Mike than what I read. Would I be able to say enough? And then, the angels began to appear. John Davies, Mike's friend from 2nd grade reached out to me. He was kind enough to share some stories of Mike (Mouse, his nickname), and he began to come alive to me. Then Mike's sister Mary Kaye contacted me. Just the fact that she did helped me settle. I am a sister. I have two brothers. I know. So, from my heart, here goes...</p>
<p><strong>Honoring Mouse</strong></p>
<p><img src="http://www.dukemagazine.duke.edu/dukemag/issues/111201/images/memoriam_6.jpg" alt="" width="125" height="191" /></p>
<p><em>From the get go it seemed to me from what I have read about Mike, he knew his preferences, his values, his loves, his interests and most definitely who he wanted to be, not what he wanted to be, but who he wanted to be.</em></p>
<p><em>Little things made him happy, the simplicity of one liners ("One of his golfing buddies asked him 'Mike, where you been all summer?' and he replied 'I&acirc;��ve been in love.' *), the desire to refine a golf game ("He scored the best round of his life over the Labor Day weekend, shooting a 73." *That was the last weekend his parents got to see their first-born child.), the thrill of computers ("for Mouse, not being technical was a hanging offense" ***), the loyalty to a basketball team ("Boy, did he love Duke basketball. He rarely missed a televised game" *), and ahhh, the exquisite taste of fine wine ("One way to know Michael M. Taylor is to consider the eight-inch stack of index cards he dutifully prepared after deciding to get serious about wine. On the cards he recorded his impression of every bottle he tasted. As his pursuit of fine wines advanced, Mr. Taylor started his own collection. It now numbers more than 600 bottles." **).</em></p>
<p><em>Even when he was little there was an inner depth, a desire that sprung out of him like a burst of light, longing to express and to share, in mischievous ways ("The first real memory I have of Mike was in sixth grade. We were sitting in Mrs. Fleck's science class. Mrs. Fleck was a tall skinny older woman a few years from retirement. On the page of the science book that we were looking at, there was a picture of algae through a microscope. Mike pointed at it and said in his high squeaky voice, 'looks like Fleck.' We were both almost thrown out of the class because we were laughing uncontrollably." ***)</em><img src="http://elsieyogakula.wordpress.com/files/2006/09/michael-taylor.jpg" alt="michael-taylor.jpg" /> <em>His mind always moved quickly, from one thing to the next, sharp, often it seemed that as those around him were still on step one, Mouse, was already nearing the end of the journey. He had found his own way of getting there. It wasn't a serious inquiry into things for the sake of things, it was a desire to know more. He recognized that there was always more, from a very young age. When Mouse took on a new 'obsession' whether it be golf, wine, computers, or love, he did it fully, one hundred percent, no more, no less.</em></p>
<p><em>As much as he loved mastering these 'obsessions' the part most savored was when things were just a little bit off, the slight bitterness behind a sweet wine, an almost perfect game of golf, lost only in the last putt, due to the unseen angle on the green, getting a Porsche and not knowing how to drive a stick. ("I can still see him at lunch salting his Fritos. I don't know why I remember that, but it always struck me as funny that Fritos weren't salty enough for him. He'd pour in some salt and then shake the bag until they were coated." ***) Yep, these things make life so much more juicy.</em></p>
<p><em>Mike strived for perfection, his mind clear and sharp, yet his heart soft and yielding. It seems to me that he took in people, really took them in. He saw what was possible within them and helped them to also be more ("In a highly competitive business, he helped others get established. 'People in the business tend to chase after people who are already good,' said Jerry Bias, a friend. 'I was just getting started and he encouraged me.' " **) From what I have gleaned of what I have read about Mike, he didn't hold back. I may be wrong, but I don't think that on September 11th he had many regrets, if</em> any.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.dukemagazine.duke.edu/dukemag/issues/111201/images/memoriam_6_a.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="156" /><em>His heart was full. He had found love, his work was fulfilling and he was embarking on tasting more of the world around him. Michael's heart beats each time a young boy cracks his friends up with a smart remark at a teacher, when good friends delve into the subtleties of a glass of wine, when the crowd cheers as the Duke basketball team scores the winning basket. These everyday moments, the simple, hold the most sacred memories of those who love him. Through the love, alive in those still here, Mike shines bright. His life was unexpectedly cut short. I wish Mike would have had the opportunity to continue to delve into the sensations and experiences of this world, to continue to live as brightly as he did, and yet, even though it seems so unfair that he is no longer here, I have to say that his presence is tangible. He lived, and he lived fully, that is perfection.</em></p>

<p class="headerSubtitle"><a href="http://www.jamulian.com/db911/"> Bloggers honor the innocent victims of that awful day...</a></p>
<p class="headerSubtitle">Each participant (blogger) clicks on a little button and recieves the name of the person which we are to honor. It's incredibly challenging as we really have no prior knowledge of this person.</p>
<p class="headerSubtitle">My tributee is Michael M. Taylor.</p>

<p class="headerSubtitle">I decided, since I have a podcast to use it as another way to honor and remember Mike. Today I post my usual weekly class, with my theme dedicated to Michael. It's a level 2-3 class, a bit on the challenging side for those who are beginners, but remember, you can always listen to the 1st 10 min of the podcast to hear that which pertains to Mike. I will post another class tomorrow, a special class, on September 11th, also dedicated to Michael. Tomorrow's class will be a level 1 class, perfect for most everyone, so we can all honor Mike together, in a new way :)</p>
<p class="headerSubtitle">Tomorrow's post will include more about Michael, so please, stay tuned!</p>
<p class="headerSubtitle">Also, if y'all want to read about the rest of the amazing people that we lost on September 11th, here's a link to the other bloggers: <span><span> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dcroe.com/2996/?page_id=2" target="_blank">http://www.dcroe.com/2996/?page_id=2 </a></span></span></p>

I'm part of an amazing project called:
 2,996: A Tribute to the Victims of 9/11 
 Bloggers honor the innocent victims of that awful day...
Each participant (blogger) clicks on a little button and recieves the name of the person which we are to honor. It's incredibly challenging as we really have no prior knowledge of this person.
My tributee is Michael M. Taylor.

I decided, since I have a podcast to use it as another way to honor and remember Mike. Today I post my usual weekly class, with my theme dedicated to Michael. It's a level 2-3 class, a bit on the challenging side for those who are beginners, but remember, you can always listen to the 1st 10 min of the podcast to hear that which pertains to Mike. I will post another class tomorrow, a special class, on September 11th, also dedicated to Michael. Tomorrow's class will be a level 1 class, perfect for most everyone, so we can all honor Mike together, in a new way :)
Tomorrow's post will include more about Michael, so please, stay tuned!
Also, if y'all want to read about the rest of the amazing people that we lost on September 11th, here's a link to the other bloggers:  http://www.dcroe.com/2996/?page_id=2
