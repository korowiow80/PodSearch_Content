			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wanted to be able to find a planet in the night sky but don&#8217;t want to have to learn all the constellations or get all tied up with star maps? Luckily, this month you don&#8217;t need to, The Moon more than helps you out. This Sunday (31st May 2009) the Moon finds itself a close neighbour of the planet Saturn. </p>
<p>This screen grab from <a href="http://www.stellarium.org/">Stellarium</a> shows you just where to find it. </p>
<p><img src="http://i58.photobucket.com/albums/g270/Colin_Stuart/Moon.jpg" alt="Image of Saturn up and to right of Moon (courtesy of Stellarium)" /></p>
<p>Take the slightly more than half moon and move up and to the right. The first really bright object you come to will be Saturn, easy as that. One handy tip to make sure you&#8217;ve found yourself a planet; it won&#8217;t twinkle. Click <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Why_don%27t_planets_twinkle">here</a> to find out why.</p>
<p>With this weekend&#8217;s predicted lovely weather hopefully we can all get a glimpse of the sixth planet from the Sun. Spread the word and let&#8217;s see how many people we can get to see Saturn&#8217;s for themselves for the first time. Link to this page in your blogs, Facebook pages and Twitter accounts. Join the Facebook event <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo_search.php?oid=94569335635&#038;view=user#/event.php?eid=94569335635">here</a>, or follow the Twitter hashtag <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23seesaturn">#seesaturn</a></p>

		<itunes:summary>Hello There!

Join us as we talk a Hubble's eye look at starlife! Using some of the incredible pictures Hubble has given us, we look at how stars are born, live their lives and eventually die.

Thanks to everyone who entered the November competition. As you will see from this video, the hunter with the famous belt is Orion. The winner of the glow in the dark stars will be announced shortly.

Until next time, remember... science is fun!
