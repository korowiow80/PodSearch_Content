      <title>Episode 9 OutCast PodCast Walkabout</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1075483/600x600_2385927.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scratch and Bite Outcast.9.The Walkabout

Yoweeee PodCastOffs.

Welcome to OutCast the Podcast on walkabout in outback Australia.

The Stiffies opened our journey tonight as a warning to all those who trek the wilds of the planet &#8230; you to could end up in &#8220;Swampland&#8221;
After that &#8220;Crash and Burn&#8221; we discover the North Coasts &#8220;Hammerfish&#8221; was home to both &#8220;The Stiffies&#8221; Ryan and Greg from &#8220;The Outcome&#8221;.and foreshadows Greg&#8217;s path through various noise machines until &#8220;The Crimson Project&#8220;, remodelled as &#8220;
The Violation of Silence&#8221; and now in its final form &#8220;The Outcome&#8221; definitely will &#8220;Keep Running&#8221;. 
The Outcome, a powerful machine indeed. 

If you cruised round this great land of ocean and desert, 
You would have no doubt met &#8220;Gypsy Dave&#8221; sitting at his campfire near some lonely Billabong reminiscing about the &#8220;Bye and Bye&#8221;.  
Unfortunately &#8220;Gypsy Dave&#8221; passed away late this year, living the Rock and Roll lifestyle to the end and teaching a new generation of noisemakers his art. 
 
Gypsy Dave (Ian Thomas) was an interesting character, a survivor of the Seminal sixties garage bands &#8220;The Missing Links&#8221; precursors to the Punk outbreak 10 years later, &#8220;The Showmen&#8221;, &#8220;Thomas Hood&#8221; and several other reincarnations through a chequered career in the Australian music scene. 
The Missing Link expos&#233; of &#8220;Nervous Breakdown&#8221; featured a scathing Ian Thomas shattering every Elvis fans heart. 
In true links fashion the &#8220;Missing Links&#8221; always let you know &#8220;You&#8217;re Driving Me Insane&#8221;.  

A listen to some of Australia&#8217;s bands of sixties would loosen anyone&#8217;s brain cells.  
 
Found on several tracks of the &#8220;Gypsy Dave&#8221; CD is Ray Arnott another stalwart of the Australian music scene. 
 Ray has credits on so many tracks you would think he was the only drummer in Australia; I will delve into Ray in the future. 
Ray also was a leg in the trio &#8220;Digital Soul&#8221; with the incandescent &#8220;I&#8217;m on Fire&#8221; featuring &#8220;Laura Gillespie&#8221; who we will catch up with on another episode. 

Down in the South of the country Melbourne&#8217;s young bloods &#8220;NeonPres&#8221; are starting their own climb into the Australian musical hierarchy, with a slight departure from their frantic funk the pulsing &#8220;Down&#8221;. 


Peeled off caves walls around my slice of heaven and hung for your pleasure are images by the incredulous Danielle Burford. 

http://www.danielleburford.com.au 


Remember 

I want you to contribute to my noise ravaged world, so send your noise, images, and words to me and the planet can see you for who you are. 


Send stuff here 

scratchandbite@podomatic.com 

muzz@scratchandbite.com 

Or visit 

www.myspace.com/outcastpodcast 

If that is too scary, email me and I will sedate you so it will all seem like a dream. 


If you are brave enough for another episode so am I, of course it will consist of Noise, more noise and images related to NOISE! 

Disappearing into the dust this episode closes with the raw energy of &#8220;Sunday Faynes with Loco Parentus&#8221; the fresh blood that will keep Australian music driving the planet. 
Sunday says &#8220;Get Stuffed&#8221;. 

Don&#8217;t forget! 

I want to get Stuffed&#8230;.I want to get Stuff!

Yaarrgghh, thank bloody dog that&#8217;s over&#8230;

The Space Circus dedication to this podcast&#8230;Madmen!

And now it&#8217;s&#8230;

It&#8217;s male testosterone time.

It&#8217;s time to get a Stiffie thing happening.

This is my tribute to one of the great unheard garage bands that never was.

The Stiffies.

Australias contribution to &#8220;World Peace&#8221;.

Nah

it&#8217;s just noise and we love it.

I had to bounce back from my Mental Mayhem with something to spark my plug, and this is it.

The Stiffies last memorial.

That is unless you catch their last shows at The Junkyard in Newcastle 18/12/09 or the Landsdowne in Sydney 19/12/09 with Muzzy Pep.
 
So here we go.

The Stiffies www.myspace.com/thestiffies

Want you to &#8220;Come out and Play&#8221;.

And of course playing with The Stiffies can lead to blindness or in Jimmy&#8217;s case something different happened:

&#8220;Jimmy&#8217;s out to Lunch&#8221;

Digging deep into Stiffydom you discover a background of vinyl nerds and garage transvestibules.

One thing you know is &#8220;He&#8217;s Waiting&#8221;.

Let me introduce The Stiffies to you

First there is 

Ryan . six strings and a scream of horror&#8230;&#8230;.injecting with gramophone needles, chewing on vinyl, stuffing tapes and CD&#8217;s in all orifices..

Bryn sticks and exposed skins &#8230; Bad Boy Basher of every known atom on the planet.

Pete . fat arse bottom end bastard &#8230; nominal music geek, with a devil gnawing his entrails.

And 
Billy&#8230; Honking, screaming, biting, harpmanic sound encylopedia.

And they all came together at &#8220;The Pink Palace&#8221;

Of course you wouldn&#8217;t take them home to meet your parents because their social graces are limited to who they could &#8220;Nail&#8221;.

But of course it&#8217;s all bluff and bluster&#8230;tall tales&#8230; like those spread by your favourite politicians.
They are not &#8220;Evil to the Core&#8221;.

These are the sort of people I spend my time with, the sort of people with values to set this planet straight.

Remember

If you want to contribute to my potato crazed world the most important thing to remember is.

Send your noise images and words to me so I can scare people with your brainwaves
Send stuff here

scratchandbite@podomatic.com

muzz@scratchandbite.com

Or visit

www.myspace.com/outcastpodcast


Next episode will contain a bucket of fish and more noise than you can fit in your wok.

Pete has gone to &#8220;Heaven&#8221; with the &#8220;The Wait Ups&#8221;,
Who are surely having a gentle dig at Ryan&#8217;s previous band &#8220;The Wake Ups&#8221;
The Stiffies with replacement Steve on the Bottom End drive will convince you that &#8220;You have been Stiffed&#8221;




Next podcastery will have some nifty Art.

Hi Ho Planetears, Planeteyes, Planetminds.

OutCast Seven has gone to Heaven.

It&#8217;s psychotic reaction time.

With computer mayhem, vanishing pod casts, missing brain cells, and disappearing habitat, the MuZZle has been overwhelmed lately.
To save what&#8217;s left of my battered brain and feed yours, I have dug into a zany quagmire of noise.
Because of all the turmoil in my world, I am shuffling around on the planet at the moment.
So I could do with lots of your mp3&#8217;s, images and words, or refer me to your favourite artists or writers at

scratchandbite@podomatic.com

muzz@scratchandbite.com

Or visit

Word:


Last episode I was so pushed I forgot to mention the crazy background noise was by Alphacore:

Alphacore lives at www.myspace.com/alphacore

I will expose you to more of his unique output in a future episode.


If you want to contribute to my new abode the most important thing to remember is.

Send your noise images and words to me so they can help me create a new episode till I unpack.

Next episode will contain horror moving stories, grand illusions and images, foreign words and pixie dust.

Plus some not quite right Noise!

SeezYa then.

G&#8217;day The Ear, The Eye and The Imaginatron,
I got lost in the dark corners of Smog City and couldn&#8217;t seem to find all the bits to put this episode together.
Still, I made it out of there, and managed to get this together so kick in until I get outcast 7 to you.

Don&#8217;t forget to send me your mp3&#8217;s, images and words, or refer me to your favourite artists or writers at

scratchandbite@podomatic.com

muzz@scratchandbite.com

Or visit

www.myspace.com/outcastpodcast

Staring off this episode with:

The Australian Beefweek Show

&#8220;A Russian Lunch Affair&#8221;

The Beefweekers were host to Pete Bufo, to quote his myspace page, Inventor of Country/Punk in the 90&#8217;s.

www.myspace.com/australianbeefweekshow

www.myspace.com/petebufo


Pete now plays with the tractor shed boys of Brut66 so I have thrown in another of their tracks for you.

&#8220;Takin&#8217; It On&#8221;

Dropping the pace a bit to:

Ryan Ellesmore

&#8220;Can&#8217;t Believe My Luck&#8221;

Ryan plays with the Stiffies so you can get info about his solo projects from him at www.myspace.com/thestiffies

On to a bit of Nineties Punk noise from:

Stalins Organ

&#8220;We Are The Organs&#8221;

Fran from Stalins Organ now plays with Vae Victis

www.myspace.com/sufferingtotheconquered

Finishing up this time with a bit of:

Your Fanatics

&#8220;Batman&#8221;

If that doesn&#8217;t stir up your TV genes then nothing will.

Images by:

Nola Harris:

Gary Wait:

Rebekah Tonys:

www.myspace.com/rebekah_tonys


&#8220;Quote from Kitty Danger&#8217;s MySpace page&#8221;

Kitty loves anything chopped, channelled, slammed, bagged and most importantly flat black.



If you want to contribute to keep the bats flying the most important thing to remember is.

Send your noise images and words to me so they can cruise keep those dark wings fluttering in the sky.

Next episode will contain Madness, Stuff, Illusions and Images, Words and some slightly grey magic.


SeezYa Then.

G&#8217;day Them that Hear, Them that See, and Them that Think.

Circular Motion and lost visions have convinced me number five is alive.

I don&#8217;t know if it was the onslaught of summer, the technology breakdowns that a great day always brings in a beach town, or just the planet overwhelming me.

I&#8217;m back!

Better late than never.

Don&#8217;t forget to send me your mp3&#8217;s, images and words, or refer me to your favourite artists or writers at

scratchandbite@podomatic.com

Or visit

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1075483/600x600_704285.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scratch and Bite Outcast.4.

G&#8217;day Ear, Eye, and mind probers.

It&#8217;s going to be a bit noisy this time round!

I am indulging myself a bit with my favourite area of the sonic spectrum.
The raw, louder, harder, faster end of the scale.
Also to celebrate the wonders of APEC being held in Sydney at the moment, it is just a bit politically biased.

16 million for security at APEC and you get OutCast at APEC for zero 

Next episode will step into more diverse arenas, however politics have dictated a tougher response this time.

Don&#8217;t forget to send me your mp3&#8217;s, images and words, or refer me to your favourite artists or writers at

scratchandbite@podomatic.com

muzz@scratchandbite.com

Or visit

www.myspace.com/outcastpodcast

Here we go into fray

Fresh out of Zen Studios comes a track by a bunch of Sydney hardcore rock veterans.
Bands like Unclean, Downtime, Stanley knife, Sulkus, Blind Ambition, Tuti Parze, Major Addiction, form the past for these hard hitters.

Black Elvis &#8220;Lifetime of Humiliation&#8221;.

Black Elvis has left the building and are either at Graceland&#8217;s or www.myspace.com/blackelvistheband 

Now we take up the APEC theme in earnest with 
Feral Dreams &#8220;Planet Dies&#8221; 

Download free Feral Dreams at www.demogategdrive.blogspot.com
Or find out more at www.myspace.com/feraldreams

Brut 66 &#8220;Johnny&#8221;
Brut 66 are in the Tractor shed at www.myspace.com/brut66
There is some great Aussie rock history scattered amongst the members of this outfit, check them out.

Space Circus &#8220;Lies&#8221;

Space Circus teleported to www.myspace.com/spacecircus

Scary Clown &#8220;Hitler&#8217;s Alive&#8221;

Scary Clown sideshow playing at www.myspace.com/youscaryclown

Rear Axess  &#8220;Pulling Governmental Strings&#8221; 

Rear Axess were another incandescent spark that temporarily illuminated the planet, let me know if you want to here more.

Injured Head  &#8220;Put Your Trust in America&#8221;

Injured Head www.myspace.com/injuredhead

As you can see the political bites strongly in the world of noise.
I will try to let art express its political outrage in a future episode.

Images this time include band posters by:

SchoonerEater
Billy White
ReplicantZero

If you want to contribute to the feeding starving APEC leaders the most important thing to remember is.

Send your noise images and words to me so they can fill the tables of economic giant&#8217;s planet wide.

Words:

ReplicantZero &#8220;Heart Compressed&#8221;


Given are all souls&#8217; truths
Exposed fragile heart and mind 
Offered up was love deserved
Within darkest depths of pain
Undying flame of love remains
Heart compressed by life itself
Born again to seek the sun
Leave all love and pain behind
Soothe battered soul to self be kind

www.myspace.com/replicantzero 

Coming soon will be contributions from Matt of Demo Gate Drive fame, featuring some of Australia&#8217;s groundbreaking acts, more illusions, images, and fresh words and political skulduggery.


SeezYa then.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1075483/600x600_704286.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scratch and Bite Outcast.3.

G&#8217;day Noiseaddicts and imageaholics.

The news you have been waiting for!

The three cast is a free cast.

Not bloody likely!

The price you pay for listening is that you have to cough up some noise, the odd image or a word or two for me to share with the universe.

All the important nuts and bolts for this show are available at

http://www.scratchandbite.podOmatic.com


Don&#8217;t forget to send me your mp3&#8217;s, images and words to:

muzz@scratchandbite.com

Or refer me to your favourite artists or writers at:

www.myspace.com/outcastpodcast

Plus if you want to suggest an alternate flight plan, shout out to me at:

scratchandbite@podomatic.com 


This time out we spin into an old track by

Dead inside the Chrysalis &#8220;Future Shock&#8221;.

Dead inside the Chrysalis are entombed alongside a casket load of pulsating new tracks at www.myspace.com/deadinsidethechrysalis 

Out in the bush near here, a bunch of diehards are restoring Steam Trains, and seeing I was offered the chance to ride their pride and joy the 19 class engine Betty a couple of days ago I thought I&#8217;d share the ride with you.
All aboard courtesy of an original track (no pun intended)
I don&#8217;t think so anyway.
The Rail Gang with &#8220;1919&#8221;, epic violin on this song by Marie-Claire, who I will feature at a later date.

The images with this episode are from Blind Rat, Leonard Aitken and Melissa Norman.

Blind Rat at www.myspace.com/blindrat

Leonard at www.myspace.com/leonardaitkin

Melissa at www.myspace.com/vision_impaired_guardian

If you want to contribute to the defence of Mars the most important thing to remember is.

Send your noise images and words to me so they can join the fight alongside the likes of

Smut say &#8220;Ron&#8217;s the Con&#8221;

Smut were a New Zealand punk political time machine.
You will have to dig deep to find some of their powerful releases.
After travelling to Australia in the early nineties they cut some ripper tracks including this one and then dispersed throughout the planet.
It&#8217;s worth digging to find those tracks. 


The vaguely hallucinatory and very 80&#8217;s Australian classic sounding
Doc Greg and the Latex Band bring you &#8220;I thought I was Jesus&#8221;

The Violation of Silence reckon they &#8220;Need You&#8221;

This is one tight ensemble of bloody noisy boys and you can find out more at www.myspace.com/theviolationofsilence because you will need more of this life force noise.

We have words from the pencil of 123 this episode.
Owing to 123 being in his own words: 

********************************************************
I know ... I'm slack ... but my mind moves seemingly like one of those little AI robots who just wanders around in a aimless fashion until it bumps into something and changes direction ... I know that it is in actuality guided by the higher harmonics and is poignantly performing some task that I'm only aware of in retrospective flashes of inspiration and epiphany as some appendage of a higher consciousness whether I be near the seat or even at the helm of such an awareness or not ... and at the moment this ship seems mired down in silly love songs ... and what&#8217;s wrong with that ... and the trite but addictive ponderings of the opposite sex are painting the sky all sunsets and nuclear fallout in my psychic firmament ... though, of course my friend anything you like ... if something I've said says something you think the world might enjoy or at least cause a cascade of tiny little brain seizures as some deep subconscious part of them comes into consciousness it's yours to toss into any of the rings under your billowing tent ...

********************************************************

You will need to find him via my friends list at www.myspace.com/muzzinspace
Or wait till the next episode when the 123 pencil conjures up images to bemuse

Next episode will contain a fresh out of the studio track by Black Elvis.

This is the first podcast of what I intend an attempt to cover a diverse range of Noise, Images and words.
I will try to pull together some of the most twisted individuals hidden in the interweb share them with those silly enough to listen.
My aim is to expand the concept to encompass as much multimedia as possible, so feed me your favourite pieces so I can share them with everyone.

Zygomatic Major &#8220;Devil in my head&#8221;

You can find some downloadable Zygomatic Major at www.demogatedrive.blogspot.com
