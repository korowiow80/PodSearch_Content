    <description>AMiGO CHARGE is a great source of nutrient-rich whole foods to provide the body with what it needs to build a strong immune system and be truly healthy! AMiGO CHARGE has 3 essential ingredients that are “wild harvested” in the most nutrient rich soil on earth delivering the most potent daily value in the purest form. &#13;
&#13;
Açai Berry - one of the most nutritious and powerful foods in the world! Açaí (ah-sigh-EE) is the high-energy berry of a special Amazon palm tree. Açaí is packed full of antioxidants, amino acids and essential fatty acids in exactly the right combination. &#13;
&#13;
Mangosteen - has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries in Cambodia and Southeast Asia. Through laboratory testing in clinical studies, mangosteen research has found that this amazing fruit contains antioxidants called Xanthones, some of the most powerful antioxidants ever discovered. &#13;
&#13;
Goji Berry - also known as Lycium Barbarum has occupied an important place in traditional Asian medicine for generations. The goji is nicknamed the “happy berry” because of the sense of well being it is said to induce. The round, red berries are very tender and must be shaken from the vine rather than picked in order to avoid spoiling. The fruit is preserved by slowly drying in the shade.</description>

“Throughout my medical career I have always looked at all the possibilities that might benefit my patients. There is extensive research to show that as far back as the 1930’s the food we eat has been significantly deficient in more than one essential nutrient. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that most if not all disease processes are related to or caused by defective cell signaling and dysfunction of Mitochondria. Our cell biology is such that if we give our cells the correct nutrients then they will function normally and we can heal ourselves. Recent advances in Metabolomics has revolutionized how we think about health and disease. Mother Nature has given us some true super foods in great abundance on this planet. Three of those foods are found in the Amigo Product! We have been described as the sickest generation ever. I am quite certain that this product will have a major effect on disease amelioration as more people get to experience its wonderful beneficial effects.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Anti aging or that fountain of youth is one of the most sought after health and wellness issues today. Amigo Health Labs in conjunction with Natural Health Labs have created a cutting edge formula that slows the aging process, gives you energy and provides you with the top antioxidant whole natural foods out there in the marketplace today - Goji, Acai & Mangosteen. 

AMiGO CHARGE is a great source of nutrient-rich whole foods to provide the body with what it needs to build a strong immune system and be truly healthy! AMiGO CHARGE has 3 essential ingredients that are “wild harvested” in the most nutrient rich soil on earth delivering the most potent daily value in the purest form.

Mangosteen - has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries in Cambodia and Southeast Asia. Through laboratory testing in clinical studies, mangosteen research has found that this amazing fruit contains antioxidants called Xanthones, some of the most powerful antioxidants ever discovered. 

Goji Berry - also known as Lycium Barbarum has occupied an important place in traditional Asian medicine for generations. The goji is nicknamed the “happy berry” because of the sense of well being it is said to induce. The round, red berries are very tender and must be shaken from the vine rather than picked in order to avoid spoiling. The fruit is preserved by slowly drying in the shade. 

CHARGE also contains Phenylethylamine Phenylethylamine “PEA” - a compound naturally produced by the brain and may just be natural’s answer to keep depression under control while increasing your mental awareness, concentration, attention and state of well being. In the brain, PEA is captured into the pre-synaptic vessicles of the brain neurons and occupies the space normally taken by dopamine. This leads to an increase in free-circulating dopamine, enhancing dopaminergic transmission, which alleviates depression and Attention Deficit Disorder while increasing concentration and elevating mood. 
PEA and Depression - It was discovered that the amount of PEA in the brains of depressed patients was less than that of normal individuals, and that PEA given orally to individuals suffering from depression was able to reverse the depressive condition. In fact, it has been observed that most antidepressant drug treatments act by increasing the level of PEA in the brain. 
PEA and Attention Deficit Disorder - PEA can play an important role in the pathogenesis of learning disabilities and Attention Deficit Disorder. 

Other Ingredients in AMiGO CHARGE: L-Phenylalanine, L-Tyrosine, Guarana, red tea, guava powder, cocoa extract, kola, citrus pectin, maca, Siberian ginseng (eleuthero), Korean ginseng (panax). 

The ingredients in AMiGO CHARGE may provide relief to the following conditions:
allergies
alzheimer’s
arthritis
attention deficit disorder
benign prostate hyperplasia
cancer
chronic fatigue syndrome
depression
diabetes
diarrhea & dysentery
