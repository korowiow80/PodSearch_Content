			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reading Because Of Winn-Dixie, by Kate DiCamillo, our class discussed the meaning of the title.  Since everything that happens to India Opal over that summer, is due to Winn-Dixie.  The friends India Opal made and the things she did were all due to her new dog.  To keep with that theme, the class worked in small groups to create a new character, how Winn-Dixie allowed the meeting to occur, and finally the significance or importance of the meeting.  In other words how it changed the characters lives.  After writing the script, the groups recorded radio programs in the style of old time radio shows.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the radio shows and please comment on the shows.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After reading Kate DiCamillo’s Because of Winn-Dixie, students realized that while short, the title spoke volumes about the book.  Everything that happened to India Opal after moving to Naomi, Florida was all due to Winn-Dixie.  Whether it was making new friends or getting a new job, India Opal owed it all to her new dog.  
Keeping with that theme, students worked in groups to think about how else Winn Dixie could change India Opal’s life.  They created a new character, how Winn-Dixie allowed the meeting to happen, and what is the significance, or so what, of their new relationship.</p>
<p>Enjoy the following radio programs created by the students to see what else happened… because of Winn-Dixie.</p>
<p>Here are the times that each group starts:
29 sec Lauren, Juliette, and Kristen
1:42 Justin, Chris, and Jason
3:50 Devika, Rachael, Nishtha, and Nicole
6:27 Ritish, Sayan, and Nihar
7:26 Bryce, Zenzali, and Jake
9:06 Brian, Nick, and Kiernan
