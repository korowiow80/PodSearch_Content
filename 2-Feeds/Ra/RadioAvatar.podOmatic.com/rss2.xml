      <title>Episode 4 The RDA Strikes Back!</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1294508/600x600_3712551.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The RDA Propaganda episode!

But first, the usual problems: many of the cast didn't prepare for our scheduled discussions (RDA: Villains or not, Avatar versus Star Trek, Economics of Unobtanium, and Human Return to Pandora--which has been slated since January) and so they just weren't ready to talk about it. Therefore the discussions sounded like CRAP, and got scrapped. We did include Avatar versus Star Trek, only because Judy saved the day by derailing us to yap about something called &quot;Topless Robot.&quot; And of course **my** expensive podcast microphone refused to work because some idiot (me) didn't do a mic/equipment/software compatibility check. So Avatar versus Star Trek has sound quality issues as well as generally being less than stellar.

Okay, so now the good news: LOTS and LOTS of fun on Pandora--and finally an episode under an hour. This one clocks in at 27 minutes, with the usual bloopers (from &quot;episode zero&quot;) at the end, and the most evilest song ever to be sung. Also, to any Star Trek fans out there: we are just making fun of Star Trek (um... duh, it's an AVATAR podcast, not a Star Trek one), but know that I loved the original series, and the new movie (the reboot). It is all kinds of fun. So, on with the show, and future episodes will be forthcoming, smaller, leaner, and hopefully have better sound quality :-p

      <title>Episode 4a Special costuming segment</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1294508/600x600_3677907.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Episode 4 the RDA hijacks the podcast! 

The colonel raids the studio and kicks over chairs, chases out our female cast, and we still have no idea what he did with Ian, our podcast Na'vi instructor, original sound engineer, and pirate. We managed to sneak out a clip of the show, and it turns out to be a 23 minute interview Andrew got with the original costume designer Robert (who showed up for the Avatar movie premier in full costume!).

The rest of the podcast will be out next week as episode 4b. We are still downloading the final bits of it and assembling the pieces, but we have some good stuff here. Straight from the RDA. Pure propaganda.

Sorry for the delay. Corporate hell--seriously. Future episodes will be twice-monthly, and a bit shorter. Episode 4b will be out in a few days.</description>
